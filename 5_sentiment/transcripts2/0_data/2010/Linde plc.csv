Matt White, Vice President and Controller; and Liz Hirsch, our Director of Investor Relations, are with me this morning. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at www.praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 and note that it applies to all statements made during the teleconference.I'm going to start this morning with a brief overview of our full-year results in 2009. Liz will then review in more detail our fourth quarter results. Afterwards, I'll discuss our current business outlook and earnings guidance for 2010, and we will then be available to answer questions.Please refer to Slide 3 of the presentation that summarizes our full-year results. Please note that our discussion of earnings for the full year and fourth quarter including the year-over-year comparisons excludes the $0.02 net earnings per share benefit last quarter related to the Brazil tax amnesty program, which therefore reduces our operating full-year EPS of $4.01 to an adjusted $3.99. And in addition, the 2008 results exclude the cost-reduction program charge in last year's fourth quarter and the pension settlement charge in the first quarter. A reconciliation of these numbers to our GAAP reported numbers appears in the appendices to this presentation and the press release.Our earnings results in 2009 were very strong given the very difficult economic and operating environment. Overall, sales were just about $9 billion, 17% below 2008. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 5% for the year due to the stronger appreciation of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2008. As you know, this resulted in a currency headwind for us of about 9% in the first half of 2009 but then in the third quarter, the dollar weakened again, resulting in a year-over-year tailwind for us in the fourth quarter. Additionally, sales were reduced by 4% from lower cost pass-through, primarily in lower natural gas prices, which were passed through to our hydrogen customers and hydrogen prices. The largest impact on sales was 10% lower volumes year-over-year due to the economic downturn. Higher pricing boosted revenue by 2%. Operating profit was $1.9 billion, 9% below 2008. We mitigated the operating profit decline relative to the drop in sales because we reduced fixed costs significantly starting in the fourth quarter of 2008. Combined with our annual productivity savings, we reduced overall costs by about $450 million for the year. The cost reduction plus higher pricing offset the reduction on our operating profit from lower volumes. What we couldn't control was currency effects, which accounted for the operating profit decline.Our operating margin for the year was 21%, a record high and a 180 basis points above 2008. About half of this increase was the cosmetic result of lower cost pass-through, the rest was real improvement from cost reduction and pricing. Full-year net income was $1.2 billion, a decline of only 7% because lower interest expense offset some of the decline in operating profit. Our total debt levels didn't change during the year, but interest expense was much lower as we were able to take advantage of our strong credit rating and the low rate environment. We're accessing the commercial paper market with these right through to the credit crisis in paying rates below a 0.5%. We saw opportunities in the bond market to lock in lower rates for long terms, we did that. Since last March, we have issued $2.7 billion of debt with a one- to 10-year maturities at interest rates between 1% and 4 1/2%. All of these debt refinanced commercial paper and short-term bank debt. As a result, in 2010 our interest expense will be higher than 2009 by about $30 million. But this puts us in a very good position going forward by locking in very low-cost, long-term debt. Earnings per share were $3.99, only 5% below 2008 due to fewer diluted shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program. Excluding currency, our EPS would have been higher than in 2008. Our team produced outstanding results in getting positive leverage down the income statement by controlling what they can control. They mitigated the impact of a 10% decline in volume by lowering costs faster, then volume was falling, reducing our cost of debt and repurchasing stock. These cost reductions are sustainable and give us even greater earnings leverage when volumes recover. If we were able to overlay our 2008 volumes on our 2009 cost structure, our EPS would have been well over $5. This gives me great confidence in our long-term earnings outlook, the only question being, when will we see meaningful volume recovery.Our after-tax return in capital for the year was 13.8%, below 15.3% in 2008. This reflects lower earnings on higher average capital due to ongoing investment in new on-site projects, which will provide future significant revenue and earnings growth.Please look at Slide 4. We generated a record operating cash flow of $2.2 billion. Capital spending for the year was $1.4 billion, about $200 million below 2008. About 3/4 of our annual capital spending goes into the new projects, which we're constructing around the world. Since these investments are under long-term contracts with customers, our spending remained very stable compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily a result of several customer requests to defer project start-up dates due to the economic downturn.After capital spending, we generated free cash flow of $816 million, also a record. We spent $131 million on acquisitions, primarily the purchase of the Sermatech Turbine Coatings business we are integrating into our Surface Technologies segment. But the majority of our free cash was returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The results of our business strategy to drive a high return on capital is that we will continue to generate higher levels of cash flow. The graph on Page 4 illustrates that over the last 10 years, the spread between our operating cash flow and capital spend has continued to widen.We will continue to invest in as many high-return projects as we can, but we expect to have increasing amounts of cash to return to shareholders as well. This morning, we announced that we're increasing our quarterly dividend from $0.40 to $0.45 in the first quarter of 2010. It's the 17th annual consecutive dividend increase by Praxair. And we also plan to continue our stock buyback program. Now Liz will review our results in the fourth quarter."

Fourth qua",1798,"Thank you, and good morning. Please refer to Page 5. Overall, our results in the quarter reflects sequential improvements in some regions and markets and stabilization in others, in line with the fits and starts of the global economic recovery. Fourth quarter sales were $2.4 billion, in line with the prior year. We lapsed the currency headwind we have faced all year, and currency translation was a 6% benefit to sales this quarter. This was offset by lower cost pass-through and 4% lower volumes. Volumes are still below prior year because October of 2008 was a very strong month, in fact, a record month for us. The sharp downturn in volumes last year occurred in November and December. So while year-over-year comparisons have gotten easier, the overall volume comparison is still negative.Volumes increased 2% sequentially. By end market, electronics has shown the quickest recovery, and volumes are back to pre-downturn levels. Volumes to steel and chemicals are beginning to improve. Manufacturing has been slower to turn around. Overall volumes remain well below where they were prior to the recession, giving us a lot of upside as the economic recovery progresses.Although volumes were down 4% year-over-year, operating profit of $512 million was higher due to cost reduction, productivity savings and currency benefit. Operating margin rose to 21.3%. Net income and earnings per share were $340 million and $1.09, both 8% above the prior-year quarter's adjusted earnings. Net income increased to more than operating profit due to lower interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 28%. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was a record $709 million from net income, depreciation and a net working capital benefit. Cash flow funded $355 million of capital spending, a $187 million of dividends and share repurchases net of issuances and debt reduction of $197 million. Our debt-to capital ratio for the quarter was therefore a bit lower at 47.2%, and after-tax return on capital increased to 14.1%.Now I'll review our results in North America summarized in Pages 6 and 7. Sales in North America were $1.2 billion, 7% below prior year, excluding cost pass-through effects, which includes lower natural gas prices and lower power costs. Volumes were 6% below the 2008 quarter. Sales to steel and chemical customers are improving in line with higher levels with North American steel production and chemical shipments but they remain well below peak levels in 2008 before the downturn. Energy was lower this quarter due primarily to lower liquid sales to oil well services customers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. We expect this business to pick up in 2010 from the current very low volume levels.Recovery in general manufacturing continues to lag other markets. Manufacturing includes metal fabrication, machinery, nonresidential construction, which is a large market for liquid and packaged gases. Our sales to this market in North America showed modest sequential improvement this quarter by 16% below prior year. We expect to realize strong operating leverage as these volumes improve.On-site sales were 15% below the prior year. However, this was attributable to lower natural gas and lower cost pass-through. Volumes were 4% above prior year due to higher oxygen sales on our Chicago area and Gulf Coast pipelines to steel and chemical customers. Volumes were also higher sequentially due to higher demand from chemicals with steel volumes relatively flat.Merchant liquid volumes were 10% below prior year and were relatively flat sequentially. Sequential pricing trends remain stable. We have yet to see a meaningful volume uplift, although this quarter was better seasonally as we have fewer-than-expected holiday shutdowns. We are also seeing higher levels of proposal activity than we were seeing six months ago, particularly in food and energy.Packaged gas sales were 16% below prior year x currency due to lower volumes, reflecting the weak manufacturing environment. In PDI, our U.S. and Canadian business, same-store sales were 17% below prior year, driven by 30% lower hardgoods. Gases same-store sales were 10% below 2008. Sequentially, sales per day were slightly up with the third quarter in gas and hardgoods. We continue to see slight sequential growth in gases into January. Overall, sales remain stable but we have seen no meaningful upturn in growth. This tracks pretty closely with published industrial production data for the U.S. manufacturing sector.Due to the significant cost reduction achieved in the business this year, we expect to see very positive operating leverage when volumes start to pick up. In 2009, PDI acquired five small distributors. We continue to look for high-quality acquisitions in geographies where we have opportunities for synergies.Operating profit in North America was $261 million, and the operating margin was 22.1%, up from 19.7% in the prior year. This margin improvement is primarily due to cost reductions and partially due to lower cost pass-through. Please look at Page 8 for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were $351 million compared to $322 million in the prior year. The increase was due to currency appreciation. Volumes were down 4%, and pricing was flat. Sequentially, compared to last quarter, volumes increased 3%, contributing to the higher sales. Economic recovery is being led by Germany, with Spain and Italy weaker but beginning to show some signs of improvement. On-site and merchant liquid volumes both grew sequentially. Merchant liquid volumes are growing from environmental and productivity applications. Sales were higher to chemicals, healthcare, electronics and food and beverage markets. Similar to the U.S., recovery of packaged gases volumes is lagging on-site and merchant.Operating profit was $76 million compared to $83 million a year ago. Last year's operating profit included some currency hedge gains. Sequentially, operating profit and margin improved due to higher volumes, cost reductions and productivity gains. Page 9 shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $461 million compared to $382 million in the prior-year quarter. Excluding currency appreciation, sales were 4% below prior year due to 10% lower volumes, partially offset by higher pricing and cost pass-through. Brazil's economy is recovering rapidly. Industrial production in November was up 5%. Interest rates remain at historic lows of about 8%, which has provided effective stimulus to the domestic economy. On-site and merchant volumes are higher than prior year and last quarter. However, this improvement is being offset in the aggregate by lower packaged gases due to the pace of recovery of local manufacturing and the typical seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter due to holidays. We expect strong sales growth in South America in 2010 as our volumes continued to pick up. While on-site volumes and merchant have both picked up from the bottom, which was in the first quarter of 2009, they are still about 10% to 15% below the volumes we had in the peak of 2008. And packaged volumes are about 20% below their peak. By end market, the strongest sequential sales growth is to metals and food and beverage with chemicals, manufacturing and healthcare relatively flat.Operating profit in South America grew to $111 million versus $87 million a year ago. The operating margin improvement came from cost reduction and higher pricing, which offset the impact of lower volumes. Slide 10 shows our Asia results. Asia had a very strong quarter. Sales of $274 million were 24% above 2008 excluding currency and cost pass-through, driven by strong broad-based volume growth. Our base business volumes grew 16%, boosted by large plant start-ups this quarter and higher sales to all major end markets. Electronics in particular was very strong. Our sales in Asia was up 46% x currency. Last year, fourth quarter was a severe low for the semiconductor industry when many fabs and sundries were shut down. Electronic sales have increased continuously throughout the year, and our sales were 18% higher than last quarter x currency. The equipment sale we show here includes a plant that we sold to our Chinese joint venture in the Shanghai Chemical Industrial Park. This company is growing rapidly as our large chemical customers expand. As an example, in December, this joint venture announced a new 15-year contract with buyer to supply hydrogen and carbon monoxide starting in 2012. But the company is not consolidated and so, the earnings appear in our equity income line.On-site volumes grew in China, India and Korea. We started off our 3,000-ton per day oxygen plant in China for SOPO's coal gasifier, and it is ramping nicely. We also started up a new air separation plant for Samsung Electronics' LCD factory in Korea. Merchant volumes were up over 10% in Asia compared to prior year. We are growing the business by bringing our applications technology into this market. For example, we announced the project to install our patented Dilute Oxygen Combustion technology at a copper smelting plant. This technology will produce significant fuel savings and will reduce fuel gas emissions and will increase our oxygen sales.Our business development pipeline is very strong. We have 12 large projects in Asia in our existing backlog and are working on numerous other opportunities. We were recently awarded a large contract to supply hydrogen and nitrogen to the Indian Oil Corporation's new refinery on the east coast of India. Our strong position in India and on-the-ground experience in building plants was important in winning this business. These plants will not start up until 2012. So we fully expect that we will continue to see strong growth in Asia continue over the next three to five years.Asia's operating profit increased to $42 million from $34 million. The margin of 15.3% is lower than the prior year due to higher cost pass-through and lower electronics specialty gas pricing. Our results for Surface Technologies are on Page 11. PST sales this quarter were $141 million compared to $135 million in 2008. The increase was a result of currency appreciation and a sales contribution from the aerospace coatings acquisition we made in this year's second quarter. These business volumes were lower year-on-year. Jet engine coatings improved from last quarter but in the aggregate, this was offset by lower coatings for industrial gas turbines and for general industrial markets such as automotive, steel and printing. We are beginning to see some sequential improvement in these markets, and we do expect the IGT coatings to pick up in the second half of 2010. Operating profit of $22 million, grew 10%, and the margin of 15.6% improved versus last year and last quarter. This resulted from several factors: Higher volumes of high-margin EBPVD coatings; cost reduction we did in PST's base business this year; and some benefits we are beginning to realize from the integration of Sermatech. It is still our objective to bring PST's operating margins up to the 20% range. Now I will turn this call back to Jim who will discuss our global end market trends and our earnings guidance for 2010."

This quarter, we're giving you a different picture of our sales to four of our major end markets, chemicals, electronics, metals and manufacturing. The chart shows you a trend line of sales these markets globally, x currency effects. We indexed the sales through the third quarter of 2008, which shows that quarter was right before the economic downturn and was our strongest quarter.Over the course of the downturn, the electronics market fell the fastest and the furthest, hitting bottom in last year's first quarter. During the remaining three quarters, it picked up dramatically and the volumes reached a record high for us in the fourth quarter. Recovery has been broad-based, stimulated in particular by demand for smartphones, notebook computers, flat screen sales in Asia, the solar market and Microsoft's release of its new Windows operating system. We now expect growth to taper off in 2010. Volumes in steel and chemical sectors troughed in June and July. They made a nice rebound in the third quarter, particularly associated with government's stimulus programs like the Cash for Clunkers program, and then they flattened out in the fourth quarter. Unlike electronics, our volumes in the chemicals and metals sectors remain 10% to 13% below their peak in early 2008. However, we are seeing sequential improvement in the rate of about 2% per quarter, so perhaps in 2011, we'll get closer to pre-crisis capacity utilization. Our manufacturing sector has a large component of packaged gases and merchant liquid, oxygen, nitrogen and argon sales to such industries such as metal fabrication, machinery, equipment and nonresidential construction. This sector was the slowest of all as customers were continuing to complete orders and projects, which were initiated before the crisis began. Globally, it hit bottom in the third quarter but in the U.S. and Europe, it was continuing to decline in the fourth quarter. With volumes at 17% below peak in 2008, this sector is the biggest drag to earnings right now. We believe it will pick up slowly as business spending for new equipment, machinery and structures will remain low until the economy gets closer to full capacity utilization. Now please to go to Page 13 for some detail on our 2010 capital spending plans. We expect 2010 capital spending to be in the area of $1.4 billion, just about the same level as in 2009. 20% of this spend or about $300 million is a maintenance capital for base business, to spend another $70 to $75 million for cost-reduction projects such as improving the energy efficiency of our plants by upgrading compression equipment for turbomachinery. We will typically look for a three-year payback on these projects.The remaining $1 billion of our capital spend is for new production plants under 15-year contracts with customers, which will deliver sales and earnings growth for this foreseeable future. We currently have a strong project backlog of over 40 large projects with a record capital value of over $2 billion. These projects are all under construction with scheduled start-up dates from the next quarter through mid-2012. The pie chart shows you where our capital dollars are going by geographic region. The largest percentage is the U.S. and Canada, which may seem surprising but this is driven by two very large hydrogen refinery projects in the U.S. After that, Asia represents the largest segment with over 20% of our growth capital. Our investments are primarily going to China and India, and then South America with 16%. These two regions plus Mexico are what we call our emerging markets and altogether, 45% of our growth capital is going there. These economies are growing much faster than the developed world and are investing infrastructures for demands from huge populations with a rising standard of living. By 2011, we expect that about 65% of our new project spending will be in China, India, Brazil and Mexico.At this time last year, there was a lot of uncertainty about the pace of new project signings around the world due to the collapse of commodity prices, the banking crisis and the subsequent global recession. But after a pause early in the year, things have picked up again. We signed a number of very significant projects this year and are looking at numerous others. The capital value of our backlog is very high, and this is why we can tell you that on top of whatever lift, industrial production gives our existing base business. Our backlog will deliver 3% to 5% annual revenue growth in 2010, 2011 and 2012. And as we continue to sign new projects, this will extend out until 2015. And now please look at Page 14 for our earnings guidance.  As many of you know, Venezuela devalued exchange rate in the first week of January. And as a result, we expect to record a one-time charge in the first quarter, which will reduce EPS by $0.08. This impact is caused by the fact that we use the U.S. dollars as our functional currency in Venezuela. This is often referred to as hyperinflationary accounting. Therefore, we need to revalue our fully borrowed denominated working capital from the old 2.15 official exchange rate to the new 4.3 official exchange rate. For the remainder of the year, we expect the ongoing impact of the devaluation to a minimal.Our earnings guidance for the first quarter is for EPS of $1.05 to $1.10 excluding the one-time impact of the Venezuelan devaluation and $0.97 to $1.02, inclusive of it. Additionally, we're expecting to participate in a one-time voluntary cash amnesty program recently announced by the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, structured similar to the federal program we participated in last year. We do not expect the potential effect of this to be material but we're excluding it from the guidance as well. Excluding Venezuela, our expectation is for earnings in the first quarter to be just a little lower than the fourth quarter, which is often the case due to holidays in South America, the Chinese New Year and customer turnarounds.Our guidance for the full-year 2010 is for sales to be in the area of $10 billion, a 10% increase from 2009. Our initial forecast for full-year earnings per share is a range of $4.33 to $4.63, excluding the $0.08 impact in the first quarter for Venezuela and $4.35 to $4.55 including it. This guidance also includes any potential impact from the Rio de Janeiro voluntary amnesty program. Consequently, we expect to deliver record earnings in 2010. Our earnings guidance represents an increase of 11% to 16% from our 2009 earnings, which declined only 5% from the prior year.Guidance assumes that pension expense in 2010 will be approximately $60 million, about $15 million higher than 2009. We expect to make cash contributions to the plants in a range of $50 million to $75 million, and the effective tax rate is expected to remain at about 28%.Our full-year guidance assumes modest economic growth and a slow recovery in major end markets. On top of that, new project start-ups will contribute revenue growth of 3% to 4% in 2010. Application technologies will contribute a couple points of growth. And at foreign exchange rates, we may have a couple of points of currency tailwind. We're optimistic that we'll continue to see global economic recovery as we progress through the year, but we think it will be slow in delivery work [ph] in the U.S. and Europe. Therefore, we're cautious in our outlook until we see stronger signs if the manufacturing sectors are bouncing back.However, as volumes do recover, we have significant upside earnings potential. Over the longer term, we continue to expect earnings to grow in the low double-digit range with a modest assumption regarding economic growth. We'll grow earnings faster than sales because our cash flow generation is greater than our capital spending, and we can use the excess free cash flow for acquisitions and share repurchases. And now, we'll be happy to take your questions. Crystal?"

We started up seven projects in the fourth quarter, and we got five new ones. Among the ones that we started up are the Sermatech oxygen-nitrogen system, stainless steel project in China, the SOPO coal gasification project, two projects in the U.S., one related to steel and one related to LNG, and then new plants that we started up, one in Mexico and another one in Costa Rica. So those are ones we started up that we took out of the backlog. We added the Indian oil, a very, very large hydrogen and nitrogen project. We had a Bayer charging [ph] project and a polysilicon project, a stove oxygen dilute project and a solar project. The Chevron project is still in the backlog and I'll just give you a little bit of background on it since everybody's been asking about it. But we won this very large hydrogen project to supply Chevron's Richmond refinery about three years ago. And initially, based on schedule, it should have started up by now. But first Chevron ran into a lot of environmental issues before getting their environmental impact statement signed and approved. And then more recently, they were hit by a judgment from a local judge to halt construction at the request of a very small environmental group. So consequently, the construction has ceased there and we don't expect it to start up until later in the year and then come on stream in 2012. Now there's rumors circulating that Chevron may actually shut down that refinery. Chevron has not made any statements about shutting down the refinery to us or to the media. So I consider that to be very unlikely that they will shut it down. If they did, we will probably get reimbursed from what was spent. And we have to renegotiate a return from them for canceling the project. That project is about $250 million in capital spend and depending on the price of natural gas, we'll be using it starting 2012, about $250 million in sales and $25 million in operating profit."

Now I think what's changing in the picture is new project activity. And because there's really a glut of refining capacity in the United States, we're not expecting a lot of new hydrogen project activity in the United States. However, we're in discussions on about three major hydrogen projects outside the United States, in China, India and South America. And as I said before, we won the IOCL, Indian Oil company, project there. And what's happening is that refiners are building grassroots, new refining capacity in Mexico, in South America, in Brazil, in Colombia, in Argentina, in India and China. So when they build that new capacity, they're going to be building state-of-the-art capacity, which is going to require hydrogen."

It is basically the inverse of South America where -- it's more difficult to take cost out of Europe, so proportionately, we didn't take as much cost out of Europe as we did out of U.S. or South America. And Europe is really one of the most sluggish markets right now. Pretty much across the board in terms of all the products, end markets and particularly packaged gases, which is generally a good margin business for us in Europe. So that's why Europe is still stuck in a rut in terms of margins there, in terms of the backlog of projects and the internal rate of return on the projects. We analyze our projects using a discounted cash flow, internal rate of return for 15 years with no residual value and it's on an after-tax basis. The projects that we get the highest returns on are the ones where I would describe as we have synergy between our old business and our new business. An example of that would be connecting a new customer to an existing pipeline system or having a new on-site system that we also can use significant amounts of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen off of that project. And consequently, the projects in our core geographic areas, the 10 geographic areas that we have the major market share in, are the ones that have higher returns, that's Canada, U.S., Mexico, Brazil, China and India and Korea. But also, as the size of the projects get bigger, the contribution from the co-products proportionately gets smaller. And in the case of hydrogen projects, you really don't have the synergy of being able to sell the liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen, at the same time as having the on-site contracts. So by definition, larger projects have lower returns and hydrogen projects have lower returns. And in the past couple of years, the average IRR price of our backlog has been about 18%. That's been composed of a lot of smaller projects with way above 18% returns, as well as some larger projects that are in the mid- or low teens. As we move forward and the backlog moves to some of these more larger projects and more hydrogen projects, I expect the average IRR to come down to maybe the 15% range."

But $1.50 of those sales is what you paid for the natural gas. So if you're just looking mathematically at it, the hydrogen business has much higher asset turnover but lower operating margin."

But we bought back, in terms of basic shares outstanding, just about 2 million shares and then reissued them with option exercises. So we're basically offsetting dilution from option exercises during the year of 2009. If you actually look at the quarter end, the diluted shares are up from 311 to 312 or 313, that's primarily because the price of the stock is up. And the way you calculate diluted earnings per share is a function of the spread between the market prices of the stock and the strike price of the options. And the higher that spread goes up, the more dilution you have in the diluted earnings per share. So that's why, if you're actually looking at the table, you'll see 370 basic shares outstanding and 312 diluted shares outstanding. Whereas in 2008, there was only about a $3 million difference. It's primarily just because the stock price is higher now than it was at the end of 2008."

Please turn to Slide 3 in our presentation for a summary of our first quarter results. Please note that these results and the year-over-year earnings comparisons have been adjusted to exclude the impact of the Venezuelan currency devaluation which was announced in January. This resulted in a one-time, pretax charge to our earnings this quarter of $27 million, $26 million after-tax and $0.08 of earnings per share. 
As you will recall, the earnings guidance we gave you in January for the first quarter and for the full year of 2010 excluded this charge. A reconciliation of these results to our GAAP reported numbers appears in the appendices to this presentation and the press release. 
Praxair's results in the first quarter reflect improving global business fundamentals. Though the strength of the improvement we have seen varies considerably by geography. 
Volumes have picked up sequentially in all our regions, led by Asia and South America. The modest overall sequential volume growth we reported was muted because March was kind of an inflection point following demand levels in January and February that were pretty much on a par with December. So this should position us well for incremental growth in the second quarter, given that the March trends are holding or slightly improving in April.
Sales in the quarter were $2.4 billion, 14% above the prior year. Higher volumes contributed 6% growth and foreign currency appreciation contributed 7%. Volume growth came primarily from higher sales to chemicals, metals and electronics customers, whose production levels were very low a year ago, as these three industries were working through significant inventory destocking. New plant startups in Asia also contributed to volume growth.
Operating profit was $506 million in the quarter, up 14% from the prior year, in line with our sales growth and the operating margin was 20.8%, also in line with the prior-year quarter. Higher volumes of base business atmospheric gases contributed a high incremental margin in the 30% to 40% range. However, this is masked primarily because last year we were collecting take-or-pay revenue from a number of large on-site customers. The first quarter of 2009 was our volume trough, and therefore, the quarter when take-or-pay revenue was the highest. 
Secondly, to date, electronics has shown the fastest and strongest volume recovery and electronics process gases have more margins than atmospherics. Higher cost pass-through also had a modest negative effect on the margin percentage. So we do expect that the incremental margin contribution from the recovery of our base business volumes will be more evident as we go forward.
Net income was $340 million and 14% of sales. Net income grew 17% from 2009, a higher increase than the increase in operating profit due to lower interest expense. Interest expense this quarter was lower than we had forecasted due to strong cash flow generation in several of our countries with higher interest rate GAAP. We expected it to trend upwards over the next few quarters and be in a range of $140 million to $150 million for the year. 
Earnings per share were $1.09, 17% above prior year. We generated $483 million of operating cash flow this quarter primarily from net income and depreciation. This cash flow is 20% of sales, due to the fixed cost reductions we implemented last year and our ongoing tight control of working capital. This cash flow funded $288 million of capital expenditures in the quarter, related primarily to construction spending on the large on-site projects in our backlog. Our free cash flow, after CapEx, of $195 million funded $138 million of dividends and $68 million of stock repurchases net of issuances. 
The reason our total debt increased from year end was because in January, we took advantage of very attractive rates in the bond market and issued $500 million of three-year notes at a coupon of 2 1/8%. These proceeds will be used to pay off a note issue that matures in May. At the end of the quarter, this cash was sitting on our balance sheet because we have paid down essentially all our commercial paper and U.S. short-term bank borrowings with the proceeds of the over $2 billion of note issues we executed over the past 12 months, locking in very attractive low-cost financing.
Our after-tax return on capital this quarter was 13.6%. This number was impacted by the cash, which is temporarily on our balance sheet held-for-debt repayment, and also the significant amount of capital tied up on our balance sheet in construction in progress. This capital doesn't generate revenue until projects are completed and start supplying product. The impact of construction in progress on our reported return on capital is over two percentage points. However, these projects are high-return projects which will generate meaningful future sales and earnings growth. 
Please turn to Page 4 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.24 billion, 6% above prior year. Higher volumes contributed 4% growth in currency appreciation in Canada, and Mexico 3%, offset slightly by 1% lower price mix. The strongest volume growth came from chemicals, steel and electronics customers. Sales to the energy market, ex-natural gas were lower due to the continued weak oil well service activity. 
Last year's first quarter was the peak for our fracing volumes in Canada, so the year-over-year comparison is difficult. Oil Well Services revenues in Mexico are below 2009 levels due to lower spending by Pemex, but we expect these volumes to increase over the balance of the year. 
On-site volumes were 13% above the 2009 first quarter and grew 2% from the fourth quarter sequentially, driven primarily by higher pipeline oxygen and nitrogen volumes. Our oxygen pipeline volumes have rebounded significantly from the low point, but are still about 15% below 2008 levels. Demand for hydrogen from refiners has been steady and volumes are above last year. 
Merchant liquid volumes were 2% above prior year. Excluding our Fracing business, volume growth was 6%. Liquid oxygen and argon volumes increased year-over-year and sequentially due to higher demand from steel producers. We began to see a modest pickup in demand in March in the U.S. and Canada. Liquid hydrogen and helium volumes were higher to electronics and solar customers. Liquid volumes in Mexico showed strong sequential growth of 5% from the fourth quarter. Total liquid volumes in North America were 5% higher sequentially.
Packaged gases in the U.S. and Canada continued to be slow to recover. This is attributable to the fact that within the Manufacturing sector, non-residential construction, infrastructure spending, equipment and welding activity are still weak. Higher auto production and appliance manufacturing should provide lift, going forward.
Total North American packaged gases sales were 1% below prior year. In Mexico, packaged volumes were higher due to improving domestic manufacturing demand. In PDI, our business in the U.S. and Canada, sales ex-currency were down 4% versus the prior-year quarter. Sequentially, we have started to see some volume pickup, but it is stronger in hard goods than gases, which is typical in the very early stages of an economic recovery.
Operating profit in North America increased 8% to $277 million and the operating margin increased to 22.4%. The margin improvement is due to higher volumes and the substantial cost reduction actions in 2009, but is mitigated by the large customer take-or-pays we were receiving a year ago. New business activity is picking up and is increasingly broad-based in Food, Chemicals, Metals, Manufacturing, Refining and Environmental Applications. So we expect a stronger second quarter in North America.
Please turn to Slide 5 for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were $338 million, up 12% from prior year. Higher volumes contributed 7% growth and currency 5%. Volume growth came primarily from higher on-site oxygen and nitrogen sales in Spain and Germany to steel and chemical customers. Liquid volumes are also up about 10% year-over-year. Liquid volumes are recovering across the region and volumes are higher than last year in Germany, Spain and Italy, versus a very weak quarter last year. 
Auto production is increasing and exports are stronger in Germany. New business activity and contract signings are positive and above 2009 levels, both on-site and merchant volumes grew sequentially from the fourth quarter. Packaged gases sales recovery is lagging on-site in merchant. Construction activity remains weak, especially in Spain. 
Operating profit was $67 million, up 6% from the prior year. We expect to see continued recovery in Europe, but expect it to be slow. The strong volume increases this quarter reflect increased production by large customers who are making global commodities and exporting to the world market. After some restocking, sequential demand growth could slow in the second half. Merchant liquid and packaged gas volumes are more reliant on local consumption and an increase in manufacturing and construction activity and our expectation is that these will be slower to pull out of the downturn.
Please look at Slide 6 for our South America results. Sales in South America were $458 million compared to $353 million in the prior-year quarter, an increase of 30%. Currency appreciation, primarily the Brazilian real, increased sales by 21%. Underlying sales grew 12% and 3% sequentially from higher volumes and higher price. Industrial production in Brazil has rebounded strongly, from negative 15% in last year's first quarter to positive 12% in this year's first quarter. 
Steel production in February was almost 50% above February 2009, but still 25% below peak production in 2008. Our on-site volumes are up strongly on a year-over-year basis and have continued to improve sequentially, driven by oxygen demand. 
Low-interest rates in Brazil, by historical standards, and credit availability have provided economic stimulus and supported domestic consumer demand. Merchant volumes are higher versus prior year and last quarter. As in our other regions, packaged gases are recovering more slowly along with general manufacturing but volumes are up 5% sequentially. Overall sales to manufacturing are up 10% from the fourth quarter. 
We expect strong growth in South America to continue in the base business from new applications and new project startups. We have seven projects scheduled to start up over the balance of this year and we are looking at numerous new project opportunities. Our Healthcare business in Brazil also continues to grow steadily. Operating profit increased to $109 million from $75 million in the prior year and operating margin was 23.8%. The operating leverage came from strong incremental margins on higher volumes, higher pricing, productivity gains and cost reduction in 2009.
Page 7 shows our results in Asia. Asia had a very strong quarter, with sales of $258 million, up 43% from 2009, due primarily to 31% volume growth. This growth came from significant growth in on-site and liquid volumes in China, India and Korea due to broad-based demand across most end markets. Oxygen volumes are growing in China due to strong steel demand fueled by auto production and infrastructure spending on roads, tunnels and rails. 
In March, China produced 1.7 million automobiles more than U.S. production. Higher cost pass-through and currency appreciation added 14% to sales growth and price mix was down 2%. Electronic sales have completely recovered from last year's low point, up 88% excluding FX. The mix effect of such strong electronic sales is the primary reason that overall price is negative 2% and that our operating margin percentage declined. Merchant pricing in atmospheric gases is stable and beginning to firm due to strong demand and tighter capacity.
Merchant sales in China were at record levels in March, from strong demand from glass, chemicals, electronics and MetFab customers. In India, strong growth in merchant sales was driven by steel, pharma and auto. Carbon dioxide sales in Thailand for food freezing were also strong. In Korea, on-site and merchant volumes are sharply higher due to demand from electronics as well as general industry. This quarter we started up two plants in China, new business activity is robust in both China and India There are many new, large project opportunities. We are sticking to our strategy of selectively pursuing sale of gas, not sale of plant, opportunities where we can get good returns and can grow the merchant liquid business locally. 
We have a strong project pipeline in Asia. Several projects in China will start up this year, but the larger projects we are working on, such as our second 3,000-ton oxygen plant to supply coal gasification and our large hydrogen plant for Indian Oil Company startup in 2011 and 2012. So we are confident that our strong growth in Asia will continue.
Page 8 shows surface technologies' results. PST sales this quarter were $136 million compared to $123 million in 2009's first quarter. Sales increased 7% ex-currency effects due to the $20 million in sales from Sermatech, which we acquired last July. Overall coating volumes, ex-Sermatech, were lower than the prior year. Industrial gas turbine coatings are down due to weak IGT builds by the major manufacturers resulting from the economic downturn and the credit crisis. But we are forecasting a pickup in these volumes in the second half of 2010, in line with the manufacturers increasing forecasts for new builds. 
EBPVD jet engine coatings which are used in the new GE GEnx engines and will power the 787 and 747-8 planes were strong and above prior year, but more conventional aerospace coatings declined. We are expecting EBPVD volumes to pick up in the second half as more planes are delivered and as spares for rebuild engines pick up along with growth in passenger miles flown. 
Operating profit of $19 million compares to $22 million in the prior year. The margin decline is due to lower volumes and Sermatech acquisition integration expenses, which has offset the profit contribution from Sermatech in the last two quarters. Our integration plan will be completed on schedule next quarter. We will have closed five of 11 manufacturing sites, reduced headcount by 150 people, and consolidated admin and back-office processes. So PSTs operating margin should improve to the high teens range by the end of the year. 
Now I'm going to turn this over to Jim, who will give you more detail on our end-market trends and discuss earnings guidance."

We showed you this slide last quarter to show the sales trends we've seen from peak to trough in four of our key end markets. We've indexed our sales to the third quarter of 2008, which was pretty close to the peak in these markets. We updated this quarter to illustrate the sequential improvement we've seen from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the end of March. This also gives you a visual of where we are now, relative to the third quarter of 2008. 
What you can see is that electronics was the most cyclical end market in the downturn, it fell the furthest, recovered the fastest and sales volumes are now above previous peak levels. Chemicals and metals continued to recover and showed positive sequential growth this quarter. Our global sales to both markets are still modestly below the 2008 third quarter, but we expect continued growth in these markets. We are forecasting a slower sequential growth rate in the second half of the year, as we believe that inventory restocking has been a part of the increased demand we've seen to date. 
Manufacturing has been slower to recover. As Liz mentioned at regional discussions, we began to see some sequential pickup in March and you can see that on this graph. However, we're still about 13% below the peak and so this end market represents a great source of upside to earnings as volumes continue to recover.
Page 10 gives you some more detail on our end market sales trends, both year-over-year and sequentially. Let me make a few comments here on the energy market. This quarter, our sales to the energy market are a little lower, but this is not a long-term trend. We see this market as a solid source of revenue growth for us in the future. The largest piece of our energy sales is hydrogen sold to refiners. Hydrogen demand remained very steady through the downturn and our volumes in the quarter were above prior year. 
We expect continued growth from new project opportunities to supply refineries outside of North America. We're expanding refining capacity and outsourcing some hydrogen supply. As an example, in November, we announced a large contract for hydrogen and nitrogen supply to Indian Oil's new refinery being built on the East Coast of India. New projects will be the principal driver of future hydrogen revenues. These two large projects in our backlog in North America, the first of which is expected to start up in the back half of 2010, and the Indian Oil project is scheduled for 2012. We'll be selective about the projects we bid on and disciplined about returns, and we're interested only in build, own and operate, not large plant sales. But there's significant opportunities around the world and geographies where we have a very strong presence. 
Our liquid nitrogen and carbon dioxide volumes for oil and gas and well fracing in North America are well below prior year, as Liz mentioned, and any significant recovery will depend on the outlook for higher natural gas prices and drilling activity. Volumes declined over the course of 2009 and so after this quarter it will not be as much of a negative comparison in our merchant volumes. In addition, these lower volumes have had a negative mix effect on our North American merchant pricing. 
In February, we announced the contract with ExxonMobil to build a new plant to supply nitrogen for in-store recovery in Hawkins, Texas. We're optimistic that over the long-term, we will see more ROR project opportunities around the world as energy demand increases and producers look to increase production from existing reserves. 
This month, we announced that we will be supplying CO2 under contract for an Enhanced Oil Recovery pilot project in Abu Dhabi with Abu Dhabi's future energy company or MASDAR. The Middle East has an abundance of energy related projects going on, but to date has not been a region where Praxair has participated, as many of the opportunities have just been equipment sales. 
We've had business development people on the ground in Abu Dhabi for a while, looking to see if there's an opportunity to develop an integrated industrial gas business in the region. Another energy opportunity is nitrogen dilution for LNG when we recently announced the project with Chevron and TOTAL to supply nitrogen at the Sabine Pass receiving terminal in Louisiana. This is not a large investment, but these projects are all examples of opportunities for industrial gases in the energy sector and while we feel bullish about this market over the long term.
Now please turn to Page 11 for earnings guidance. For the second quarter of 2010, our earnings guidance is for earnings per share in the range of $1.10 to $1.15. This represents sequential improvement from the first quarter based on the trends we're seeing. We're raising our EPS guidance for the full year of 2010 to a range of $4.50 to $4.65, excluding the $0.08 negative impact in the first quarter, resulting from the Venezuela currencies devaluation. This represents year-over-year earnings growth of 13% to 17% and is well above Praxair's peak earnings in 2008 of $4.20. 
Our earnings guidance including the Venezuela charge is $4.42 to $4.57. We expect full year sales to be in the area of $10 billion. The effective tax rate is expected to remain at 28%, and we still expect CapEx for the year to be about $1.4 billion. 
Large project activity around the world is picking up from what we were seeing in 2009. The bulk of these projects are in South America and Mexico, India and China where a very strong presence, a history of successful project execution and integrated businesses which will allow us to get good returns on the capital index. Our large project backlog at the end of the first quarter included 38 projects. This quarter, we started up six plants with a capital value of about $140 million, but we added four new projects with a capital value of about $170 million. So the size of our back log is holding up and its startup dates are now extending out into 2013. 
If you look at the chart on Page 12, you can see how fast we're growing in Asia. Of 13% growth over six quarters, 8% was from project startups and 5% was organic growth from peak to trough. Emerging markets represent about 34% of our global sales, which is a higher percentage than our competitors. I also believe we're winning more new business in China, India, South America and Mexico. This is a result of our reputation and demonstrated ability to execute in emerging economies. Additionally, our standard plant designs are a key factor in our ability to win business at high returns due to a lower capital investment, better energy efficiency and greater reliability. 
In addition, our base business in North and South America and Europe has a significant way to go to get back to pre-crisis operating levels. As you see them down 7% to 10%, realize that we also had 3% to 5% contribution from new project startups. So the dip in the base business is actually lower than it appears, implying more upside as the economy recovers. 
In closing, I believe the outlook is clearly improving. Emerging markets are experiencing significant expansion which is being led by internal demand and consumption while the material markets are recovering from the debts of 2009. 
And now, I'll be happy to take questions."

But there are a couple of mitigating factors, particularly in this quarter, which should basically not be important more and more. But part of those is that a year ago, we had a number of on-site contracts where we were operating take-or-pay. And so we were receiving the payment, but we weren't producing the volume. And so as that volume went up, we're not making any more money for that. So that's a damper on margin expansion. But this point in time, we've moved through the threshold level of almost every take-or-pay contract. So we should get more leverage going forward. On top of that, we've got some higher expense from pension expense, and incentive comp, and so forth, which are just -- some inflation is up year-over-year. And than lastly, the areas where we had the greatest sales growth, like in electronics, are the areas we have the lowest margin. We had some kind of negative mix effect on the whole thing.

I mean, the common denominator is the internal rate of return. The cash flow internal rate of return on capital investment. Atmospheric plants, you don't have to pay for anything except the electricity. You don't have to pay for your raw materials. So atmospheric plants tend to have low asset turnover, not a lot of sales for the capital investment, but very high margins. In hydrogen, you have to buy natural gas and pass that on to the customer. So depending on the way the contract is structured, if we're buying a gas and selling it to the customer, then we're going to have a lot more sales growth for the capital investment, but it's going to be a cosmetically lower margin. Now going back to the common denominator, the internal rate of return, they should be about the same, except for the fact that atmospheric gases has more opportunity for pro-product economics and more opportunity for vertical integration between the on-side to book and the packaged business. And so as a whole, I think what we would see is that atmospheric gases is a higher return on capital business than hydrogen. Not to say that hydrogen is bad, it just doesn't have as much pro-product economics."

We are making most of our plants according to cookie-cutter standard plant designs and when we do that, each time we make another one, we bring the capital costs down, we bring the reliability up and we reduced amount of spare parts and maintenance that's required. So just to give you an example, we've built over 15 of our PL4 size plants. The project that we just announced in India is a T13 [ph] and we're building five of those.

And you have an on-site, 15-year contracts and in the merchant, usually five-year contracts. And when the contracts come up for renewal is where you just talk about pricing again. And so when we announced our price increase, generally what we mean by that is we're just giving our sales people some backbone when they go back to a customer whose contract is being renewed after five years. And so there are number of customers that are at below market that we are increasing price on. The place that we lost the slippage was that our highest priced products in the merchant business were the CO2 and nitrogen for frac-ing. And the reason the price was higher is because of the long transportation costs to get there. So as that business has gone down and other business is going up, it's kind of been a neutral overall pricing environment."

One of them is that we're really in a growth move in Asia and we got a lot of engineers on the ground and a lot of business development people on the ground. And therefore, an overhead structure, which is supporting a business that will be well over $1 billion in a couple of years. And so that's a little bit of a down pressure on the margin there. But more specifically, the electronic sales represent roughly 1/3 of our total sales in Asia. And the atmospheric gases sales and hydrogen sales have about a 20% offering margin. In other words, if I carved out the Electronics business from our business in Asia, it’d be running at a 20% operating margin. But the Electronics business is running closer to 10% operating margin and it's up 88% year-on-year. So that's why that mix caused the margin to go down relative to the prior quarter. Also in there we've got sputtering targets, which have a lot of precious metals in them and we had cost pass-through in the targets of about 9%, representing 9% of our total sales there, probably about 27% cost pass-through targets themselves. So it always looks like a disappointing thing with the low margins in Asia, but the fact is that electronics is just a bigger part of Asia. We’re not investing very much in electronics in Asia. So as we start up more oxygen plants and hydrogen plants, you'll see that operating margin go up."

Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.
Please turn to slide three in our presentation for a summary of our first quarter results. Please note that these results and the year-over-year earnings comparisons have been adjusted to exclude the impact of the Venezuelan currency devaluation, which was announced in January. This resulted in a one-time pre-tax charge to our earnings this quarter of $27 million, $26 million after-tax, and $0.08 of earnings per share.
As you will recall, the earnings guidance we gave you in January for the first quarter and for the full year of 2010 excluded this charge. A reconciliation of these results to our GAAP reported numbers appears in the appendices to this presentation and the press release.
Praxair's results in the first quarter reflect improving global business fundamentals, though the strength of the improvement we have seen varied considerably by geography. Volumes have picked up sequentially in all our regions led by Asia and South America. The modest overall sequential volume growth we reported was muted because March was kind of an inflection point following demand levels in January and February that were pretty much on a par with December. So this should position us well for incremental growth in the second quarter, given that the March trends are holding or slightly improving in April.
Sales in the quarter were $2.4 billion, 14% above the prior year. Higher volumes contributed 6% growth and foreign currency appreciation contributed 7%. Volume growth came primarily from higher sales to chemicals, metals and electronics customers whose production levels were very low a year ago as these three industries were working through significant inventory destocking. New plant startups in Asia also contributed to volume growth.
Operating profit was $506 million in the quarter, up 14% from the prior year in line with our sales growth and the operating margin was 20.8%, also in line with the prior-year quarter. Higher volumes of base business atmospheric gases contributed a high incremental margin in the 30% to 40% range. However, this is masked primarily because last year we were collecting take-or-pay revenue from a number of large onsite customers. The first quarter of 2009 was our volume trough and therefore, the quarter, when take-or-pay revenue was the highest.
Secondly, to-date, electronics has shown the fastest and strongest volume recovery and electronics process gases have lower margins than atmospherics. Higher cost pass-through also had a modest negative effect on the margin percentage.
So we do expect that the incremental margin contribution from the recovery of our base business volumes will be more evident as we go forward.
Net income was $340 million and 14% of sales. Net income grew 17% from 2009, a higher increase than the increase in operating profit due to lower interest expense. Interest expense this quarter was lower than we had forecasted due to strong cash flow generation in several of our countries with higher interest rate debt. We expected to trend upwards over the next few quarters and be in a range of $140 million to $150 million for the year.
Earnings per share were $1.09, 17% above prior year. We generated $483 million of operating cash flow this quarter, primarily from net income and depreciation. This cash flow is 20% of sales due to the fixed cost reductions we implemented last year and our ongoing tight control of working capital.
This cash flow funded $288 million of capital expenditures in the quarter, related primarily to construction spending on the large on-site projects in our backlog. Our free cash flow after CapEx of $195 million funded a $138 million of dividends and $68 million of stock repurchases, net of issuances.
The reason our total debt increased from year-end was because in January we took advantage of very attractive rates in the bond market and issued $500 million of three-year notes at a coupon of 2.125%. These proceeds will be used to pay off a note issue that matures in May. At the end of the quarter, this cash was sitting on our balance sheet because we have paid down essentially all our commercial paper and US short-term bank borrowings with the proceeds of the over $2 billion of note issues we executed over the past 12 months, locking in very attractive low cost financing.
Our after-tax return on capital this quarter was 13.6%. This number was impacted by the cash, which is temporarily on our balance sheet held for debt repayment, and also the significant amount of capital tied up on our balance sheet in construction in-progress. This capital doesn't generate revenue until projects are completed and start supplying products. The impact of construction in-progress on our reported return on capital is over two percentage points. However, these projects are high return projects, which will generate meaningful future sales and earnings growth.
Please turn to page four for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.24 billion, 6% above prior year. Higher volumes contributed 4% growth and currency appreciation in Canada and Mexico 3%, offset slightly by 1% lower price mix. The strongest volume growth came from chemicals, steel and electronics customers.
Sales to the energy market ex-natural gas were lower due to continued weak oil well service activity. Last year's first quarter was the peak for our fracing volumes in Canada, so the year-over-year comparison is difficult. Oil well services revenues in Mexico are below 2009 levels due to lower spending by PEMEX, but we expect these volumes to increase over the balance of the year.
On-site volumes were 13% above the 2009 first quarter and grew 2% from the fourth quarter sequentially, driven primarily by higher pipeline oxygen and nitrogen volumes. Our oxygen pipeline volumes have rebounded significantly from the low point, but are still about 15% below 2008 levels. Demand for hydrogen from refiners has been steady and volumes are above last year.
Merchant liquid volumes were 2% above prior year. Excluding our fracing business, volume growth was 6%. Liquid oxygen and argon volumes increased year-over-year and sequentially due to higher demand from steel producers. We began to see a modest pickup in demand in March in the US and Canada. Liquid hydrogen and helium volumes were higher to electronics and solar customers. Liquid volumes in Mexico showed strong sequential growth of 5% from the fourth quarter. Total liquid volumes in North America were 5% higher sequentially.
Packaged gases in the US and Canada continued to be slow to recover. This is attributable to the fact that within the manufacturing sector, non-residential construction, infrastructure spending, equipment and welding activity are still weak. Higher auto production and appliance manufacturing should provide lift going forward.
Total North American packaged gases sales were 1% below prior year. In Mexico, packaged volumes were higher due to improving domestic manufacturing demand. In PDI, our business in the US and Canada, sales ex-currency were down 4% versus the prior year quarter. Sequentially, we have started to see some volume pickup, but it is stronger in hard goods and gases, which is typical in the very early stages of an economic recovery.
Operating profit in North America increased 8% to $277 million and the operating margin increased to 22.4%. The margin improvement is due to higher volumes and the substantial cost reduction actions in 2009, but is mitigated by the large customer take-or-pays we were receiving a year ago. New business activity is picking up and is increasingly broad-based in food, chemicals, metals, manufacturing, refining and environmental applications, so we expect a stronger second quarter in North America.
Please turn to slide five for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were $338 million, up 12% from prior year. Higher volumes contributed 7% growth and currency 5%. Volume growth came primarily from higher on-site oxygen and nitrogen sales in Spain and Germany to steel and chemical customers. Liquid volumes are also up about 10% year-over-year. Liquid volumes are recovering across the region and volumes are higher than last year in Germany, Spain, and Italy versus a very weak quarter last year.
Auto production is increasing and exports are stronger in Germany. New business activity and contract signings are positive and above 2009 levels. Both on-site and merchant volumes grew sequentially from the fourth quarter. Packaged gases sales recovery is lagging on-site and merchant. Construction activity remains weak, especially in Spain.
Operating profit was $67 million, up 6% from the prior year. We expect to see continued recovery in Europe, but expect it to be slow. The strong volume increases this quarter reflect increased production by large customers who are making global commodities and exporting to the world market. After some restocking, sequential demand growth could slow in the second half. Merchant liquid and packaged gas volumes are more reliant on local consumption and an increase in manufacturing and construction activity and our expectation is that these will be slower to pull out of the downturn.
Please look at slide six for our South America results. Sales in South America were $458 million compared to $353 million in the prior-year quarter, an increase of 30%. Currency appreciation, primarily the Brazilian real, increased sales by 21%. Underlying sales grew 12% and 3% sequentially from higher volumes and higher price. Industrial production in Brazil has rebounded strongly from negative 15% in last year's first quarter to positive 12% in this year's first quarter.
Steel production in February was almost 50% above February 2009, but still 25% below peak production in 2008. Our on-site volumes are up strongly on a year-over-year basis and have continued to improve sequentially driven by oxygen demand.</TAG>
Low interest rates in Brazil by historical standards and credit availability has provided economic stimulus and supported domestic consumer demand. Merchant volumes are higher versus prior year and last quarter. As in our other regions, packaged gases are recovering more slowly along with general manufacturing, but volumes are up 5% sequentially. Overall sales to manufacturing are up 10% from the fourth quarter.
We expect strong growth in South America to continue in the base business from new applications and new project startups. We have seven projects scheduled to start up over the balance of this year and we are looking at numerous new project opportunities. Our healthcare business in Brazil also continues to grow steadily.
Operating profit increased to $109 million from $75 million in the prior year and operating margin was 23.8%. The operating leverage came from strong incremental margins on higher volumes, higher pricing, productivity gains and cost reduction in 2009.
Page seven shows our results in Asia. Asia had a very strong quarter with sales of $258 million, up 43% from 2009, due primarily to 31% volume growth. This growth came from significant growth in on-site and liquid volumes in China, India and Korea due to broad-based demand across most end-markets.
Oxygen volumes are growing in China due to strong steel demand fuelled by auto production and infrastructure spending on roads, tunnels and rails. In March, China produced 1.7 million automobiles, more than US production.
Higher cost pass-through and currency appreciation added 14% to sales growth and price mix was down 2%. Electronic sales have completely recovered from last year's low point, up 88% excluding FX. The mix effect of such strong electronic sales is the primary reason that overall price is negative 2% and that our operating margin percentage declined.
Merchant pricing in atmospheric gases is stable and beginning to firm due to strong demand and tighter capacity. Merchant sales in China were at record levels in March from strong demand from glass, chemicals, electronics, and met fab customers.
In India, strong growth in merchant sales was driven by steel, pharma and auto. Carbon dioxide sales in Thailand for food freezing were also strong. In Korea, on-site and merchant volumes are sharply higher due to demand from electronics, as well as general industry.
This quarter we started up two plants in China. New business activity is robust in both China and India. There are many new large project opportunities. We are sticking to our strategy of selectively pursuing sale of gas, not sale of plant opportunities, where we can get good returns and can grow the merchant liquid business locally.
We have a strong project pipeline in Asia. Several projects in China will start up this year, but the larger projects we are working on, such as our second 3,000 ton oxygen plant to supply coal gasification and our large hydrogen plant for Indian Oil company start-up in 2011 and 2012. So, we are confident that our strong growth in Asia will continue.
Page eight shows Surface Technologies results. PST sales this quarter were $136 million compared to $123 million in 2009's first quarter. Sales increased 7% ex-currency effects due to the $20 million in sales from Sermatech, which we acquired last July. Overall, coating volumes, ex-Sermatech, were lower than the prior year.
Industrial gas turbine coatings are down due to weak IGT build by the major manufacturers resulting from the economic downturn and the credit crisis, but we are forecasting a pick up in these volumes in the second half of 2010 inline with the manufacturers increased forecast for new builds.
EBPVD jet engine coatings, which are used in the new GE GEnx engines and will power the 787 and 747-8 planes were strong and above prior year, but more conventional aerospace coatings declined. We are expecting EBPVD volumes to pick up in the second half as more planes are delivered and as spares for rebuild engines pick up, along with growth in passenger miles flown.
Operating profit of $19 million compares to $22 million in the prior year. The margin decline is due to lower volumes and Sermatech acquisition integration expenses, which has offset the profit contribution from Sermatech in the last two quarters. Our integration plan will be completed on schedule next quarter.
We will have closed five of 11 manufacturing sites, reduced headcount by a 150 people, and consolidated admin and back-office processes. The PST's operating margin should improve to the high teens range by the end of the year.
Now, I'm going to turn this over to Jim, who will give you more detail on our end market trends and discuss our earnings guidance.

We showed you this slide last quarter shows that sales trends we've seen from peak to trough in four of our key end markets. (Inaudible) sales for the third quarter of 2008, which was pretty close to the peak in these markets. We updated it this quarter to illustrate the sequential improvement we've seen from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the end of March. This also gives you a visual of where we are now relative to third quarter of 2008.
What you can see is that electronics was the most cyclical end market in the downturn. It felt the furthest, recovered the fastest and sales volumes are now above previous peak levels. Chemicals and metals continued to recover and showed positive sequential growth this quarter. Our global sales to both markets are still modestly below the 2008 third quarter. We expect continued growth in these markets and we are forecasting a slower sequential growth rate in the second half of the year as we believe that inventory restocking has been a part of the increased demand we are seeing today.
Manufacturing has been slow to recover. As Liz mentioned in the regional discussions, we began to see sub-sequential pick up in March and you can see that on this graph. However, we are still about 13% below the peak and so this end market represents a great source of upside to earnings as volumes continue to recover.
Page 10 gives you some more detail on our end market sales trends, both year-over-year and sequentially.
Let me make a few comments here on the energy market. This quarter our sales to energy market are a little lower, but this is not a long-term trend. We see this market as a solid source of revenue growth for us in the future. Largest piece of our energy sales is hydrogen sold to refiners. Hydrogen demand remained very steady through the downturn and our volumes in the quarter were above prior year.
We expect continued growth from new project opportunities to supply refiners outside of North America for expanding refining capacity and outsourcing some hydrogen supply. As an example, in November we announced a large contract for hydrogen and nitrogen supply to Indian Oil's new refinery being built on the East Coast of India.
New projects will be the principal driver of future hydrogen revenues, there is two large projects in our backlog in North America, the first of which is expected to start up in the back half of 2010 and the Indian Oil project is scheduled for 2012.
We'll be selective about the projects we've been on and disciplined about returns and we're interested only in built, own and operate, not large plant sales, but there are significant opportunities around the world and geographies where we have a very strong presence.
Our liquid nitrogen and carbon dioxide volumes for oil and gas for fracing in North America are well below prior year, as Liz mentioned and any significant will depend on the outlook for higher natural gas prices and drilling activity. Volumes declined over the course of 2009, and so after this quarter will not be as much of a negative comparison in our merchant volume. In addition, these lower volumes have had a negative mix effect on our North American merchant pricing.
In February, we announced a contract with Exxon Mobil to build the new plant to supply nitrogen for enhanced oil recovery in Hawkins, Texas. We're optimistic that over the long term, we will see more EOR project opportunities around the world as energy demand increases and producers look to increase production from existing reserves.
This month, we announced that we will be supplying CO2 under contract for enhanced oil recovery pilot project in Abu Dhabi with Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company or MASDAR. The Middle East has an abundance of energy-related projects going on but to-date has not been a region where Praxair has participated as many of the opportunities have just been equipment sales.
We've had business development people on the ground in Abu Dhabi for a while looking to see if there's an opportunity to develop an integrated industrial gas business in the region. Another energy opportunity is nitrogen dilution for LNG. We've recently announced a project with Chevron and Total to supply nitrogen at the Sabine Pass receiving terminal in Louisiana. This is not a large investment, but these projects are all examples of opportunities for industrial gasses in energy sector and why we feel bullish about this market over the long term.
Now, please turn to page 11 for earnings guidance. In the second quarter of 2010, our earnings guidance is for earnings per share in the range $1.10 to $1.15. This represents sequential improvement from the first quarter based on the trends we're seeing. We're raising our EPS guidance for the full year of 2010 to a range of $4.50 to $4.65, excluding the $0.08 negative impact in the first quarter resulting for the Venezuela currency's devaluation.
This represents year-over-year earnings growth of 13% to 17% and is well above Praxair's peak earnings in 2008 of $4.20. Our earnings guidance including the Venezuela charge is $4.42 to $4.57.
We expect full year sales to be in the area of $10 billion. The effective tax rate is expected to remain at 28%, and we still expect CapEx for the year to be about $1.4 billion.
Large project activity around the world is picking up from what we were seeing in 2009. The bulk of these projects are in South America and Mexico, India and China, where we have a very strong presence, a history of successful project execution, and integrated businesses, which allow us to get good returns on the capital we invest.
Our large project backlog at the end of the first quarter included 38 projects. This quarter, we started up six plants with a capital value of about $140 million. We added four new projects with a capital value of about $170 million. So the size of our backlog is holding up and start-up dates are now extending out into early (2013).
If you look at the chart on page 12, you could see how fast we're growing in Asia. Of 13% growth over six quarters, 8% was from project startups and 5% was organic growth from peak to trough.
Emerging markets represent about 34% of our global sales, which is at higher percentage than our competitors. I also believe we're winning more new business in China, India, South America and Mexico. This is a result of our reputation and demonstrated ability to execute in emerging economies. Additionally, our standard plant designs a key factor and our ability to win business at high returns due to a lower capital investment, better energy efficiency and greater reliability.
In addition, our base business in North and South America and Europe has a significant way to go to get back to pre-crisis operating levels. As you see them down 7% to 10% realize that we also had 3% to 5% contribution from new project startups, so the dip in the base business is actually lower than it appears and you will find more upside as the economy recovers.
In closing, I believe the outlook is clearly improving. Emerging markets are experiencing significant expansion which is being led by an internal demand and consumption while the mature markets are recovering from depths of 2009. And now I'll be happy to take questions.

One of them is that we're really in a growth mode in Asia and we got lot of engineers on the ground and a lot of business development people on the ground, and therefore, overhead structure, which is supporting a business that will be well over a $1 billion in the couple of years. And so, that's a little bit of downward pressure on the margin here. But more specifically, the electronic sales represent roughly a third of our total sales in Asia, okay.</TAG>
And the atmospheric gases sales and hydrogen sales have about a 20% operating margin. In other words, if I carved out the electronics business from our business in Asia, it'd be running at a 20% operating margin, but electronics business is running closer to 10% operating margin and it's up 88% year-on-year. So that's why the mix caused the margin to go down relative to the prior quarter. 
Also, in there we've got the sputtering targets, which have a lot of precious metals in them and we had cost pass-through in the targets, representing 9% of our total sales there, probably about 27% cost pass through targets themselves. So I know it always looks like a disappointing thing in the low margins in Asia, but the fact is that electronics is just a bigger part of Asia. We're not investing very much in electronics in Asia. So as we start up more oxygen plants and hydrogen plants, you will see that operating margin go up.

But the only real impact that we could have on the negative side from this credit crisis in Europe will be seen as the dollar-euro exchange rate.

Now, the other two geographies that we're looking at and been looking out for a while but been slow to move is the Middle East and Russia, and both of those geographies come with a bit more risk than some other places and you really need to know how to operate locally. But our strategy for building shareholder value is to build integrated industrial gas networks, if you will, for we've got on-site merchant and packaged gases. 
So that's where we're looking to see if there's a way we can enter those markets with the fairly low level of risk and build an integrated business there, because both in the Middle East and Russia what they are trying to do is take the oil dollars they've got and diversify the economies into other industries, and that's kind of where we're going to be looking to build an integrated business.

Please turn to Slide 3 in our presentation for a summary of our first quarter results. Please note that these results and the year-over-year earnings comparisons have been adjusted to exclude the impact of the Venezuelan currency devaluation which was announced in January. This resulted in a one-time, pretax charge to our earnings this quarter of $27 million, $26 million after-tax and $0.08 of earnings per share. 
As you will recall, the earnings guidance we gave you in January for the first quarter and for the full year of 2010 excluded this charge. A reconciliation of these results to our GAAP reported numbers appears in the appendices to this presentation and the press release. 
Praxair's results in the first quarter reflect improving global business fundamentals. Though the strength of the improvement we have seen varies considerably by geography. 
Volumes have picked up sequentially in all our regions, led by Asia and South America. The modest overall sequential volume growth we reported was muted because March was kind of an inflection point following demand levels in January and February that were pretty much on a par with December. So this should position us well for incremental growth in the second quarter, given that the March trends are holding or slightly improving in April.
Sales in the quarter were $2.4 billion, 14% above the prior year. Higher volumes contributed 6% growth and foreign currency appreciation contributed 7%. Volume growth came primarily from higher sales to chemicals, metals and electronics customers, whose production levels were very low a year ago, as these three industries were working through significant inventory destocking. New plant startups in Asia also contributed to volume growth.
Operating profit was $506 million in the quarter, up 14% from the prior year, in line with our sales growth, and the operating margin was 20.8%, also in line with the prior-year quarter. Higher volumes of base business atmospheric gases contributed a high incremental margin in the 30% to 40% range. However, this is masked primarily because last year we were collecting take-or-pay revenue from a number of large on-site customers. The first quarter of 2009 was our volume trough and therefore, the quarter when take-or-pay revenue was the highest. 
Secondly, to date, electronics has shown the fastest and strongest volume recovery and electronics process gases have lower margins than atmospherics. Higher cost pass-through also had a modest negative effect on the margin percentage. So we do expect that the incremental margin contribution from the recovery of our base business volumes will be more evident as we go forward.
Net income was $340 million and 14% of sales. Net income grew 17% from 2009, a higher increase than the increase in operating profit due to lower interest expense. Interest expense this quarter was lower than we had forecasted due to strong cash flow generation in several of our countries with higher interest rate GAAP. We expect it to trend upwards over the next few quarters and be in a range of $140 million to $150 million for the year. 
Earnings per share were $1.09, 17% above prior year. We generated $483 million of operating cash flow this quarter primarily from net income and depreciation. This cash flow is 20% of sales, due to the fixed cost reductions we implemented last year and our ongoing tight control of working capital. This cash flow funded $288 million of capital expenditures in the quarter, related primarily to construction spending on the large on-site projects in our backlog. Our free cash flow, after CapEx, of $195 million funded $138 million of dividends and $68 million of stock repurchases net of issuances. 
The reason our total debt increased from year end was because in January, we took advantage of very attractive rates in the bond market and issued $500 million of three-year notes at a coupon of 2 1/8%. These proceeds will be used to pay off a note issue that matures in May. At the end of the quarter, this cash was sitting on our balance sheet because we have paid down essentially all our commercial paper and U.S. short-term bank borrowings with the proceeds of the over $2 billion of note issues we executed over the past 12 months, locking in very attractive low-cost financing.
Our after-tax return on capital this quarter was 13.6%. This number was impacted by the cash which is temporarily on our balance sheet held-for-debt repayment and also the significant amount of capital tied up on our balance sheet in construction in progress. This capital doesn't generate revenue until projects are completed and start supplying product. The impact of construction in progress on our reported return on capital is over two percentage points. However, these projects are high-return projects which will generate meaningful future sales and earnings growth. 
Please turn to Page 4 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.24 billion, 6% above prior year. Higher volumes contributed 4% growth in currency appreciation in Canada and Mexico 3%, offset slightly by 1% lower price mix. The strongest volume growth came from chemicals, steel and electronics customers. Sales to the energy market, x natural gas, were lower due to the continued weak oil well service activity. 
Last year's first quarter was the peak for our frac-ing volumes in Canada, so the year-over-year comparison is difficult. Oil well services revenues in Mexico are below 2009 levels due to lower spending by Pemex, but we expect these volumes to increase over the balance of the year. 
On-site volumes were 13% above the 2009 first quarter and grew 2% from the fourth quarter sequentially, driven primarily by higher pipeline oxygen and nitrogen volumes. Our oxygen pipeline volumes have rebounded significantly from the low point but are still about 15% below 2008 levels. Demand for hydrogen from refiners has been steady and volumes are above last year. 
Merchant liquid volumes were 2% above prior year. Excluding our Frac-ing business, volume growth was 6%. Liquid oxygen and argon volumes increased year-over-year and sequentially due to higher demand from steel producers. We began to see a modest pickup in demand in March in the U.S. and Canada. Liquid hydrogen and helium volumes were higher to electronics and solar customers. Liquid volumes in Mexico showed strong sequential growth of 5% from the fourth quarter. Total liquid volumes in North America were 5% higher sequentially.
Packaged gases in the U.S. and Canada continued to be slow to recover. This is attributable to the fact that within the Manufacturing sector, non-residential construction, infrastructure spending, equipment and welding activity are still weak. Higher auto production and appliance manufacturing should provide lift, going forward.
Total North American packaged gases sales were 1% below prior year. In Mexico, packaged volumes were higher due to improving domestic manufacturing demand. In PDI, our business in the U.S. and Canada, sales ex-currency were down 4% versus the prior-year quarter. Sequentially, we have started to see some volume pickup, but it is stronger in hard goods than gases, which is typical in the very early stages of an economic recovery.
Operating profit in North America increased 8% to $277 million and the operating margin increased to 22.4%. The margin improvement is due to higher volumes and the substantial cost reduction actions in 2009, but is mitigated by the large customer take-or-pays we were receiving a year ago. New business activity is picking up and is increasingly broad-based in Food, Chemicals, Metals, Manufacturing, Refining and Environmental Applications. So we expect a stronger second quarter in North America.
Please turn to Slide 5 for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were $338 million, up 12% from prior year. Higher volumes contributed 7% growth and currency 5%. Volume growth came primarily from higher on-site oxygen and nitrogen sales in Spain and Germany to steel and chemical customers. Liquid volumes are also up about 10% year-over-year. Liquid volumes are recovering across the region and volumes are higher than last year in Germany, Spain and Italy, versus a very weak quarter last year. 
Auto production is increasing and exports are stronger in Germany. New business activity and contract signings are positive and above 2009 levels, both on-site and merchant volumes grew sequentially from the fourth quarter. Packaged gases sales recovery is lagging on-site in merchant. Construction activity remains weak, especially in Spain. 
Operating profit was $67 million, up 6% from the prior year. We expect to see continued recovery in Europe, but expect it to be slow. The strong volume increases this quarter reflect increased production by large customers who are making global commodities and exporting to the world market. After some restocking, sequential demand growth could slow in the second half. Merchant liquid and packaged gas volumes are more reliant on local consumption and an increase in manufacturing and construction activity and our expectation is that these will be slower to pull out of the downturn.
Please look at Slide 6 for our South America results. Sales in South America were $458 million compared to $353 million in the prior-year quarter, an increase of 30%. Currency appreciation, primarily the Brazilian real, increased sales by 21%. Underlying sales grew 12% and 3% sequentially from higher volumes and higher price. Industrial production in Brazil has rebounded strongly, from negative 15% in last year's first quarter to positive 12% in this year's first quarter. 
Steel production in February was almost 50% above February 2009, but still 25% below peak production in 2008. Our on-site volumes are up strongly on a year-over-year basis and have continued to improve sequentially, driven by oxygen demand. 
Low-interest rates in Brazil, by historical standards, and credit availability have provided economic stimulus and supported domestic consumer demand. Merchant volumes are higher versus prior year and last quarter. As in our other regions, packaged gases are recovering more slowly along with general manufacturing but volumes are up 5% sequentially. Overall sales to manufacturing are up 10% from the fourth quarter. 
We expect strong growth in South America to continue in the base business from new applications and new project startups. We have seven projects scheduled to start up over the balance of this year and we are looking at numerous new project opportunities. Our Healthcare business in Brazil also continues to grow steadily. Operating profit increased to $109 million from $75 million in the prior year and operating margin was 23.8%. The operating leverage came from strong incremental margins on higher volumes, higher pricing, productivity gains and cost reduction in 2009.
Page 7 shows our results in Asia. Asia had a very strong quarter, with sales of $258 million, up 43% from 2009, due primarily to 31% volume growth. This growth came from significant growth in on-site and liquid volumes in China, India and Korea due to broad-based demand across most end markets. Oxygen volumes are growing in China due to strong steel demand fueled by auto production and infrastructure spending on roads, tunnels and rails. 
In March, China produced 1.7 million automobiles more than U.S. production. Higher cost pass-through and currency appreciation added 14% to sales growth and price mix was down 2%. Electronic sales have completely recovered from last year's low point, up 88% excluding FX. The mix effect of such strong electronic sales is the primary reason that overall price is negative 2% and that our operating margin percentage declined. Merchant pricing in atmospheric gases is stable and beginning to firm due to strong demand and tighter capacity.
Merchant sales in China were at record levels in March, from strong demand from glass, chemicals, electronics and MetFab customers. In India, strong growth in merchant sales was driven by steel, pharma and auto. Carbon dioxide sales in Thailand for food freezing were also strong. In Korea, on-site and merchant volumes are sharply higher due to demand from electronics as well as general industry. This quarter, we started up two plants in China. New business activity is robust in both China and India. There are many new, large project opportunities. We are sticking to our strategy of selectively pursuing sale of gas, not sale of plant, opportunities where we can get good returns and can grow the merchant liquid business locally. 
We have a strong project pipeline in Asia. Several projects in China will start up this year, but the larger projects we are working on, such as our second 3,000-ton oxygen plant to supply coal gasification and our large hydrogen plant for Indian Oil Company start-up in 2011 and 2012. So we are confident that our strong growth in Asia will continue.
Page 8 shows Surface Technologies' results. PST's sales this quarter were $136 million compared to $123 million in 2009's first quarter. Sales increased 7% x currency effects due to the $20 million in sales from Sermatech, which we acquired last July. Overall coating volumes, x Sermatech, were lower than the prior year. Industrial gas turbine coatings are down due to weak IGT builds by the major manufacturers resulting from the economic downturn and the credit crisis. But we are forecasting a pickup in these volumes in the second half of 2010, in line with the manufacturers increasing forecasts for new builds. 
EBPVD jet engine coatings which are used in the new GE GEnx engines and will power the 787 and 747-8 planes were strong and above prior year, but more conventional aerospace coatings declined. We are expecting EBPVD volumes to pick up in the second half as more planes are delivered and as spares for rebuild engines pick up along with growth in passenger miles flown. 
Operating profit of $19 million compares to $22 million in the prior year. The margin decline is due to lower volumes and Sermatech acquisition integration expenses, which has offset the profit contribution from Sermatech in the last two quarters. Our integration plan will be completed on schedule next quarter. We will have closed five of 11 manufacturing sites, reduced headcount by 150 people and consolidated admin and back-office processes. So PST's operating margin should improve to the high-teens range by the end of the year. 
Now I'm going to turn this over to Jim, who will give you more detail on our end-market trends and discuss our earnings guidance."

We showed you this slide last quarter to show the sales trends we've seen from peak to trough in four of our key end markets. We've indexed our sales to the third quarter of 2008, which was pretty close to the peak in these markets. We updated this quarter to illustrate the sequential improvement we've seen from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the end of March. This also gives you a visual of where we are now, relative to the third quarter of 2008. 
What you can see is that electronics was the most cyclical end market in the downturn. It fell the furthest, recovered the fastest and sales volumes are now above previous peak levels. Chemicals and metals continued to recover and showed positive sequential growth this quarter. Our global sales to both markets are still modestly below the 2008 third quarter, but we expect continued growth in these markets. We are forecasting a slower sequential growth rate in the second half of the year, as we believe that inventory restocking has been a part of the increased demand we've seen to date. 
Manufacturing has been slower to recover. As Liz mentioned at regional discussions, we began to see some sequential pickup in March and you can see that on this graph. However, we're still about 13% below the peak and so this end market represents a great source of upside to earnings as volumes continue to recover.
Page 10 gives you some more detail on our end market sales trends, both year-over-year and sequentially. Let me make a few comments here on the energy market. This quarter, our sales to the energy market are a little lower, but this is not a long-term trend. We see this market as a solid source of revenue growth for us in the future. The largest piece of our energy sales is hydrogen sold to refiners. Hydrogen demand remained very steady through the downturn and our volumes in the quarter were above prior year. 
We expect continued growth from new project opportunities to supply refineries outside of North America. We're expanding refining capacity and outsourcing some hydrogen supply. As an example, in November, we announced a large contract for hydrogen and nitrogen supply to Indian Oil's new refinery being built on the East Coast of India. New projects will be the principal driver of future hydrogen revenues. These two large projects in our backlog in North America, the first of which is expected to start up in the back half of 2010, and the Indian Oil project is scheduled for 2012. We'll be selective about the projects we bid on and disciplined about returns, and we're interested only in build, own and operate, not large plant sales. But there's significant opportunities around the world and geographies where we have a very strong presence. 
Our liquid nitrogen and carbon dioxide volumes for oil and gas and well frac-ing in North America are well below prior year, as Liz mentioned, and any significant recovery will depend on the outlook for higher natural gas prices and drilling activity. Volumes declined over the course of 2009 and so after this quarter it will not be as much of a negative comparison in our merchant volumes. In addition, these lower volumes have had a negative mix effect on our North American merchant pricing. 
In February, we announced the contract with ExxonMobil to build a new plant to supply nitrogen for in-store recovery in Hawkins, Texas. We're optimistic that over the long-term, we will see more ROR project opportunities around the world as energy demand increases and producers look to increase production from existing reserves. 
This month, we announced that we will be supplying CO2 under contract for an Enhanced Oil Recovery pilot project in Abu Dhabi with Abu Dhabi's future energy company or MASDAR. The Middle East has an abundance of energy related projects going on, but to date has not been a region where Praxair has participated, as many of the opportunities have just been equipment sales. 
We've had business development people on the ground in Abu Dhabi for a while, looking to see if there's an opportunity to develop an integrated industrial gas business in the region. Another energy opportunity is nitrogen dilution for LNG when we recently announced the project with Chevron and TOTAL to supply nitrogen at the Sabine Pass receiving terminal in Louisiana. This is not a large investment, but these projects are all examples of opportunities for industrial gases in the energy sector and while we feel bullish about this market over the long term.
Now please turn to Page 11 for earnings guidance. For the second quarter of 2010, our earnings guidance is for earnings per share in the range of $1.10 to $1.15. This represents sequential improvement from the first quarter based on the trends we're seeing. We're raising our EPS guidance for the full year of 2010 to a range of $4.50 to $4.65, excluding the $0.08 negative impact in the first quarter, resulting from the Venezuela currencies devaluation. This represents year-over-year earnings growth of 13% to 17% and is well above Praxair's peak earnings in 2008 of $4.20. 
Our earnings guidance including the Venezuela charge is $4.42 to $4.57. We expect full year sales to be in the area of $10 billion. The effective tax rate is expected to remain at 28%, and we still expect CapEx for the year to be about $1.4 billion. 
Large project activity around the world is picking up from what we were seeing in 2009. The bulk of these projects are in South America and Mexico, India and China where a very strong presence, a history of successful project execution and integrated businesses which will allow us to get good returns on the capital index. Our large project backlog at the end of the first quarter included 38 projects. This quarter, we started up six plants with a capital value of about $140 million, but we added four new projects with a capital value of about $170 million. So the size of our backlog is holding up and its start-up dates are now extending out into 2013. 
If you look at the chart on Page 12, you can see how fast we're growing in Asia. Of 13% growth over six quarters, 8% was from project startups and 5% was organic growth from peak to trough. Emerging markets represent about 34% of our global sales, which is a higher percentage than our competitors. I also believe we're winning more new business in China, India, South America and Mexico. This is a result of our reputation and demonstrated ability to execute in emerging economies. Additionally, our standard plant designs are a key factor in our ability to win business at high returns due to a lower capital investment, better energy efficiency and greater reliability. 
In addition, our base business in North and South America and Europe has a significant way to go to get back to pre-crisis operating levels. As you see them down 7% to 10%, realize that we also had 3% to 5% contribution from new project startups. So the dip in the base business is actually lower than it appears, implying more upside as the economy recovers. 
In closing, I believe the outlook is clearly improving. Emerging markets are experiencing significant expansion which is being led by internal demand and consumption while the material markets are recovering from the debts of 2009. 
And now, I'll be happy to take questions."

And basically, when you look at our underlying business where volumes coming back, we're getting 30% to 40% margin on that. But there are a couple of mitigating factors, particularly in this quarter, which should basically not be important more and more. But part of those is that a year ago, we had a number of on-site contracts where we were operating take-or-pay. And so we were receiving the payment, but we weren't producing the volume. And so as that volume went up, we're not making any more money for that. So that's a damper on margin expansion. But this point in time, we've moved through the threshold level of almost every take-or-pay contract. So we should get more leverage going forward. On top of that, we've got some higher expense from pension expense, and incentive comp, and so forth, which are just -- some inflation is up year-over-year. And than lastly, the areas where we had the greatest sales growth, like in electronics, are the areas we have the lowest margin. We had some kind of negative mix effect on the whole thing. And then lastly, the areas where we're going to get the biggest operating margin leverage are going to be in liquid volume and packaged gas volume and those are the areas that still haven't recovered as much."

I mean, the common denominator is the internal rate of return. The cash flow internal rate of return on capital investment. Atmospheric plants, you don't have to pay for anything except the electricity. You don't have to pay for your raw materials. So atmospheric plants tend to have low asset turnover, not a lot of sales for the capital investment, but very high margins. In hydrogen, you have to buy natural gas and pass that on to the customer. So depending on the way the contract is structured, if we're buying a gas and selling it to the customer, then we're going to have a lot more sales growth for the capital investment, but it's going to be a cosmetically lower margin. Now going back to the common denominator, the internal rate of return, they should be about the same, except for the fact that atmospheric gases has more opportunity for pro-product economics and more opportunity for vertical integration between the on-side to book and the packaged business. And so as a whole, I think what we would see is that atmospheric gases is a higher return on capital business than hydrogen. Not to say that hydrogen is bad, it just doesn't have as much pro-product economics."

Now there's another contributing factor, which I think is helping us win this business of high returns, is our standard plant designs. We are making most of our plants according to cookie-cutter standard plant designs and when we do that, each time we make another one, we bring the capital costs down, we bring the reliability up and we reduce amount of spare parts and maintenance that's required. So just to give you an example, we've built over 15 of our PL4 size plants. The project that we just announced in India is a T13 [ph] and we're building five of those.

And so when we announce a price increase, generally what we mean by that is we're just giving our sales people some backbone when they go back to a customer whose contract is being renewed after five years. And so there are a number of customers that are below market that we are increasing price on. The place that we lost to slippage was that our highest priced products in the merchant business were the CO2 and nitrogen for frac-ing.

One of them is that we're really in a growth move in Asia and we’ve got a lot of engineers on the ground and a lot of business development people on the ground. And therefore, an overhead structure, which is supporting a business that will be well over $1 billion in a couple of years. And so that's a little bit of a down pressure on the margin there. But more specifically, the electronic sales represent roughly 1/3 of our total sales in Asia. And the atmospheric gases sales and hydrogen sales have about a 20% offering margin. In other words, if I carved out the Electronics business from our business in Asia, it’d be running at a 20% operating margin. But the Electronics business is running closer to 10% operating margin and it's up 88% year-on-year. So that's why that mix caused the margin to go down relative to the prior quarter. Also in there we've got sputtering targets, which have a lot of precious metals in them and we had cost pass-through in the targets of about 9%, representing 9% of our total sales there, probably about 27% cost pass-through targets themselves. So it always looks like a disappointing thing with the low margins in Asia, but the fact is that electronics is just a bigger part of Asia. We’re not investing very much in electronics in Asia. So as we start up more oxygen plants and hydrogen plants, you'll see that operating margin go up."

But our strategy for building shareholder value is to build integrated industrial gas networks, if you will, where we've got on-site merchant and packaged gases. So that's what we're looking to see if there's a way we can enter those markets with a fairly low level of risk and build an integrated business there.

Praxair had very strong second quarter relative to both last year and last quarter. Our results showed strong volume growth, margin improvement and strong cash flow generation. Overall volumes were significantly above the prior year in all geographic segments due to continuing improvements in the global economic environment and new project startups. 
Sequentially, volume growth continued as we moved to the second quarter. South America and Asia have shown the strongest recovery from the downturn, but North America and Europe are steadily improving. Our earnings grew faster than sales, which increased our overall operating margin, reflecting the benefits of prior year cost reduction actions and ongoing productivity programs. 
This morning, we announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program. This indicate the confidence we have in our continued ability to generate cash flow in excess of what is required to fund the large amount of capital opportunities we see before us. The previous share repurchase program was authorized in July 2008 and is now substantially complete. We expect to complete this program in 18 months by the end of 2011, depending on market conditions. Now Liz will review our quarterly results in more detail."

Sales were higher to all major",1685,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Please turn to Slide 3 in our presentation for a summary of our second quarter results.
Sales in the quarter were $2.5 billion, 18% above the prior year, primarily due to 12% volume growth. Sales were higher to all major end markets, with the strongest year-over-year comparisons in chemicals, metals and electronics, the industries where production was extremely low a year ago. Sales to overall manufacturing were also higher than a year ago and strengthened during the quarter. New project startups, primarily in Asia, also contributed to volume growth. Sequentially, sales were 4% above the first quarter due to higher volumes.
Operating profit grew to $547 million in the quarter, 22% above the prior year, and the operating margin increased to 21.6%. Higher volumes, productivity savings and currency effects were the largest contributors to the growth.
Net income of $371 million rose 24% from prior year, a higher increase than the increase in operating profit due to lower interest expense. Interest expense is below the prior year, primarily due to lower rates and lower debt overseas in higher-interest-rate countries due to strong cash flow generation. Earnings per share were a record $1.19, up 24% from prior year and up 9% from the first quarter. 
Cash flow generation was very strong this quarter. Cash flow from operations was $536 million, including $106 million of pension plan contributions. Excluding these contributions, we generated cash flow equal to 25% of sales. We are keeping a tight control on working capital and carefully managing our fixed costs, despite some headwind from higher incentives and compensation accruals due to our improving business results.
Cash flow funded $325 million of capital expenditures, largely for construction of new on-site plants around the world. Cash flow after CapEx primarily funded $137 million of dividends. Total debt was reduced by $378 million. This decrease was due to the maturity of a floating-rate note issue in May, which we repaid with available cash from our most recent bond issue.
After-tax return on capital was 14.7%, up from 13.6% last quarter. The increase was due to higher earnings. Last quarter's number was low in part due to the cash temporarily sitting on our balance sheet. Our return on equity increased to 27.4%.
Please turn to Page 4 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.28 billion, 14% above prior year. Higher volumes contributed 12% growth, and currency appreciation contributed 3%, with lower price mix offsetting 1%. Sales growth was driven by stronger demand from chemical and steel customers. Refinery hydrogen demand was strong. 
Sequentially, overall volumes grew 5% from first quarter. Demand from chemicals and steel continued to increase, and demand from general manufacturing customers picked up. 
On-site volumes were 20% above prior year and 7% above first quarter, driven by oxygen and hydrogen. Our oxygen pipeline volumes have significantly rebounded but are still about 10% below 2008 peak levels. Overall merchant volumes were 13% above prior year and 4% above the first quarter. Higher demand was broad-based for all liquid products, including oxygen, argon and liquid hydrogen. Carbon dioxide sales and nitrogen volumes were higher due to increased frac-ing activity in the U.S. and Canada. Sequentially, our frac volumes were lower due to the seasonal slowdown in Canada due to warmer weather. CO2 sales increased for seasonal food and beverage demand. Liquid volumes in Mexico are significantly above last year and continued to grow through the quarter. 
Packaged gases volumes are improving as manufacturing activity has picked up in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Overall volumes grew 6% sequentially versus the first quarter. Hardgoods in the U.S. and Canada are recovering at a faster pace than gases, which is typical in an economic recovery. 
North American operating profit was $294 million, 11% above prior year. Compared to the first quarter, operating profit grew 6% on sales growth of 3%, showing solid operating leverage on improving volumes. This leverage was still masked in the year-over-year results due to take-or-pay revenue, which we were collecting in last year's quarter.
Looking forward, we expect volumes to continue to improve in the second half of the year, though the rate of growth may moderate somewhat. We are seeing new business opportunities for merchant liquids in food, energy and environmental applications. So our overall outlook is for steady growth in the second half of the year.
Please turn to Page 5 for our European results. Sales in Europe were $335 million, 9% above the 2009 quarter. Higher volumes and price contributed 11% growth, which was partially offset by currency depreciation. On-site volumes were up 16%, primarily due to higher pipeline oxygen demand in Spain and Germany. Merchant volumes across the region increased significantly from prior year. Packaged gases are showing sequential improvement, but have lagged the recovery in on-site and merchant due to weak local construction and metal fabrication markets, particularly in Spain. Demand from customers serving export-oriented industries like chemicals and steel and less cyclical industries like healthcare has improved. Sequentially, volumes grew 4% across Europe, but were offset at the sales line by currency devaluation.
Operating profit in the quarter was $73 million, 20% above the prior year and 9% above first quarter. OP included a $4 million currency hedge gain, which substantially offset the effect of the currency devaluation on operating profit. 2009’s second quarter included a similar-sized currency hedge loss. 
For the third quarter, we expect sales to be lower than the second quarter, as a result of seasonally lower sales due to the August holidays and due to about a 5% negative impact from the weaker euro. But in terms of underlying growth, we are still expecting Europe to continue on a path of recovery.
Page 6 summarizes our South American results. Sales in South America were $490 million, up 24% from prior year. Currency appreciation increased sales by 12%. Sales grew 15% and 6% sequentially from higher volumes and price. Industrial production in Brazil has averaged about 17% through May and is forecasted to average about 12% for the full year. 
Our on-site volumes have recovered strongly and are almost back to 2008 levels. Merchant liquid volumes are 13% above prior year and up 9% sequentially, excluding seasonal CO2. Packaged gases are also growing in line with increasing domestic consumption. By end market, growth is broad-based to steel, energy, food, health care and manufacturing. Other countries in Latin America are also growing nicely, with Chile, Argentina and Peru exhibiting strong year-over-year volume growth. 
Operating profit in the second quarter was $114 million versus $70 million in the prior year quarter, which included an $11 million currency hedge loss. Operating profit margin was 23.3%. 
Operating leverage came from strong volume gains, pricing and ongoing productivity and cost reduction. Our outlook for South America for the second half of the year is very positive. Brazil's currency is stable. Interest rates are low by historical standards, which has provided good economic stimulus, though they have inched up a little recently because the government is committed to keeping inflation in check. 
The country has a growing consumption-oriented middle class which is driving growth. We started up three projects this quarter and are looking at numerous new project opportunities. The long-term outlook is especially bright, with numerous opportunities in the energy sector and expected infrastructure investment for the upcoming World Cup and Olympics.
Please look at Page 7 for our Asia results. Asia had another very strong quarter, with sales of $280 million, up 41% from prior year, driven by 27% volume growth. Currency effects increased sales by 5%. Cost pass-through, which is higher power and precious metal prices used in manufacturing our sputtering targets increased sales by 10%. Volume growth came from new projects and from significant growth in on-site and liquid volumes in China, India and Korea. By end market, sales to steel and chemicals are significantly higher. Electronics is still very strong. Sales rose 32% excluding cost pass-through. The mix effect of such a strong electronics sales caused the negative 1% impact from price.
Operating profit increased to $44 million this quarter from $33 million in 2009 and up from $34 million last quarter. We expect absolute growth in Asia to be strong for the balance of the year, but we anticipate that the growth rate may moderate in the second half from what we saw in the first half as the Chinese government tries to avoid an overheated economy. 
Project proposal activity continues to be robust in the region. We have a large number of projects under construction which will start up in 2011 and 2012, supporting strong future growth.
Surface Technologies results are on Page 8. PST sales this quarter were $141 million compared to $118 million in the 2009 quarter. Excluding currency effects, sales increased due to the Sermatech acquisition, which contributed sales of $21 million this quarter. We closed this acquisition last July, and so there will no longer be an acquisition impact next quarter. 
Aviation coatings were above prior year due to strong EBPVD jet engine coatings. These are the coatings used in the new GE GEnx engines powering the 787 and 747-8 planes. We expect these volumes to increase in the second half of the year. Coatings for the aftermarket are expected to pick up slowly, in line with increases in passenger miles flown. 
Lower coatings for industrial gas turbines offset some of this growth. IGT builds by the major manufacturers turned down in the economic crisis. We do expect to see this business start to pick up, but this is long-lead-time equipment, so we are not forecasting a meaningful increase in our coatings volumes to this market until 2011. 
We completed the acquisition integration July 1, and so PST's margins should continue to improve in the second half due to the lack of integration expenses. Our goal is to move PST's operating margin to the high teens area over the next six to nine months with reasonable volume improvement. 
Now I'm going to turn this back to Jim to discuss our global end market trends and our earnings guidance."

In this slide, you do some detail in our end market sales trends, both year-over-year and compared to last quarter. We're showing you our organic sales growth excluding currency, cost pass-through and acquisition effect",854,"Thanks, Liz. Please turn to Page 9. In this slide, you do some detail in our end market sales trends, both year-over-year and compared to last quarter. We're showing you our organic sales growth excluding currency, cost pass-through and acquisition effects. Sales to the energy market are above prior year and up 9% sequentially. Hydrogen sales to refiners represent about 2/3 of our sales to the energy sector. Demand has been very steady from existing customers, and this quarter we began to find [ph 0:28:30] a new customer from our Gulf Coast pipeline system. The balance of the segment is primarily enhanced oil recovery and natural gas well frac-ing. Frac-ing volumes were above prior year and seasonally lower on a sequential basis. Our long-term outlook for energy is very bullish given many hydrogen project opportunities in Brazil, Mexico and Asia. These new projects are large and will drive significant future growth for us. And we're positive that EOR will also continue to gain traction around the world as energy demand increases.
Electronics sales have continued to be robust, up 22% from a year ago due to strong demand in Asia from semiconductor and LCD manufacturers. Sales to the photovoltaic industry and polysilicon producers also continued to grow, and we have won a number of new contracts. We expect a strong second half of the year due to industry forecast of continued strong demand for consumer electronics and a pickup in business IT spending. 
Sales to chemicals and metals markets have recovered significantly from the low levels in 2009. Sales to both markets were up 7% from last quarter from strong base business demand and new projects on stream in Asia. Demand for steel and chemicals is being fueled by infrastructure investment and growing consumer demand in the emerging markets, particularly China, India and South America. Customer demand has also picked up in the U.S. and Europe at a more moderate pace. 
Sales to manufacturing this quarter grew 6% sequentially, primarily due to continued strong growth in South America and Asia. In addition, we began to see more strength in the U.S., Canada and Europe, where merchant and packaged gases volumes improved. However, we're still about 10% below peak levels, which represent significant future upside in sales and operating leverage as volumes continue to recover.
Please turn to Page 10 for our earnings guidance. For the third quarter of 2010, our earnings guidance is for earnings per share to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.20. We expect to see our overall volumes continue to trend up sequentially. Our third quarter is typically on a par with the second quarter because it includes the slowdown in Europe due to the summer holidays. In addition, as Liz mentioned, this guidance includes a sequential headwind due to the depreciation of the euro currency, which will reduce sales by $15 million to $20 million in the third quarter versus the second quarter. 
We are raising our EPS guidance for the full year 2010 to a range of $4.60 to $4.70, excluding the $0.08 negative impact in the first quarter resulting from the Venezuela currency devaluation. This represents year-over-year earnings growth of 15% to 18% and is well above our peak earnings in 2008 of $4.20. Our earnings guidance including the Venezuela charge is $4.52 to $4.62. We expect full year sales to be the area of $10 billion and the effective tax rate to remain at about 28%. CapEx for the year is still forecasted to be about $1.4 billion. Our long-term outlook continues to improve. Our base business is clearly recovering, and there's more upside to come. In addition, large project activity around the world is strong. We are working on a host of opportunities in South America, China and India as well as the Middle East and Russia, which we believe will sustain our product backlog, and therefore, growth, in years to come.
Page 11 is the slide which indicates the confidence we have in this regard. We will be starting up about 10 projects in the second half of the year, but we're forecasting that the capital value of our backlog will rise to about $2.5 billion by year end, which will be a record for us. These projects are all under long-term contract and have at least made returns [ph 0:32:48] well in excess of our cost of capital and which should therefore drive high-quality revenue and earnings growth through 2012 and beyond. 
Our new share repurchase program and our track record of dividend increases is an indication of our commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders. It does not suggest a lack of growth opportunities in our core business. Instead, it's a result of our financial discipline, which has delivered a much higher return on capital than our peers. This has resulted in operating cash flow of nearly 25% of sales, capital spending on new projects of about 15% of sales and free cash flow of about 10% of sales. This allows us to increase dividends each year and repurchase stock without increasing leverage. 
And now I'm happy to take your questions."

Every industry is competitive. But I see some good improvement coming along in volume. Packaged gases was sort of the last distribution method to come down, as we went into the recession, and it will also be the last distribution method to fully recover. And that's because a lot of packaged gas goes into non-residential construction and equipment and so forth. And what we're seeing is that it takes a little longer for people to decide to make capital investments, and so it's a little longer for the construction cycle to come around. But we've been positive about -- we saw sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter of about 6% volume growth. So we're feeling a lot better about that.

And so a weak spot is in construction, just like it is in the United States. But I'm not pessimistic about Europe. My personal view is that this whole reaction to fiscal conservativism in Europe has kind of been overdone in the marketplace and that underlying business is not being affected by that unless you're a contractor or something to the government."

Well, PST, it’s more of a function of what's going on in its key end markets. And our strategy when we made the acquisition of Sermatech and our strategy going forward is really to be the #1 provider of high-temperature and performance coatings to turbines. And there are really two kinds of turbines. There are aircraft turbine engines and there are industrial gas turbine engines. And so in the aircraft side, there's always a very cyclical increase and decrease as the airlines decide how many planes to buy, as the plane makers figure out how fast they can make those planes and then as the engine makers figure out how much inventory that they have. So it kind of cycles from quarter to quarter. And on the industrial gas turbines side, same thing. And so our customers in industrial gas turbines are in a big inventory-correction mode right now. And our industrial gas turbine business is way off this quarter from 12 months ago. But if you take the long run, the amount of coatings we’ll provide to jet engines is, over time, is just going to be a linear function of how many air miles are flown. Either they buy new engines or they recoat the old engines. So over the long run, it's going be a function of how many air passenger miles are flown. And air passenger miles are really growing significantly in emerging markets. And then the same thing is true in the turbines. If you take the position that natural gas is going to continue to be a key fuel in the future, there will be more industrial gas turbines, both new turbines as well as recoating of existing turbines after a certain number of hours. So while we have these bumps up and down quarter to quarter, and this quarter was really impacted by industrial gas turbines, we do think that our strategy of being the #1 provider of coatings to turbines should pay off in the long run."

Praxair had very strong second quarter relative to both last year and last quarter. Our results showed strong volume growth, margin improvement and strong cash flow generation. Overall volumes were significantly above the prior year in all geographic segments due to continuing improvements in the global economic environment and new project startups. 
Sequentially, volume growth continued as we moved to the second quarter. South America and Asia have shown the strongest recovery from the downturn, but North America and Europe are steadily improving. Our earnings grew faster than sales, which increased our overall operating margin, reflecting the benefits of prior year cost reduction actions and ongoing productivity programs. 
This morning, we announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program. This indicate the confidence we have in our continued ability to generate cash flow in excess of what is required to fund the large amount of capital opportunities we see before us. The previous share repurchase program was authorized in July 2008 and is now substantially complete. We expect to complete this program in 18 months by the end of 2011, depending on market conditions. Now Liz will review our quarterly results in more detail."

Sales were higher to all major",1685,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Please turn to Slide 3 in our presentation for a summary of our second quarter results.
Sales in the quarter were $2.5 billion, 18% above the prior year, primarily due to 12% volume growth. Sales were higher to all major end markets, with the strongest year-over-year comparisons in chemicals, metals and electronics, the industries where production was extremely low a year ago. Sales to overall manufacturing were also higher than a year ago and strengthened during the quarter. New project startups, primarily in Asia, also contributed to volume growth. Sequentially, sales were 4% above the first quarter due to higher volumes.
Operating profit grew to $547 million in the quarter, 22% above the prior year, and the operating margin increased to 21.6%. Higher volumes, productivity savings and currency effects were the largest contributors to the growth.
Net income of $371 million rose 24% from prior year, a higher increase than the increase in operating profit due to lower interest expense. Interest expense is below the prior year, primarily due to lower rates and lower debt overseas in higher-interest-rate countries due to strong cash flow generation. Earnings per share were a record $1.19, up 24% from prior year and up 9% from the first quarter. 
Cash flow generation was very strong this quarter. Cash flow from operations was $536 million, including $106 million of pension plan contributions. Excluding these contributions, we generated cash flow equal to 25% of sales. We are keeping a tight control on working capital and carefully managing our fixed costs, despite some headwind from higher incentives and compensation accruals due to our improving business results.
Cash flow funded $325 million of capital expenditures, largely for construction of new on-site plants around the world. Cash flow after CapEx primarily funded $137 million of dividends. Total debt was reduced by $378 million. This decrease was due to the maturity of a floating-rate note issue in May, which we repaid with available cash from our most recent bond issue.
After-tax return on capital was 14.7%, up from 13.6% last quarter. The increase was due to higher earnings. Last quarter's number was low in part due to the cash temporarily sitting on our balance sheet. Our return on equity increased to 27.4%.
Please turn to Page 4 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.28 billion, 14% above prior year. Higher volumes contributed 12% growth, and currency appreciation contributed 3%, with lower price mix offsetting 1%. Sales growth was driven by stronger demand from chemical and steel customers. Refinery hydrogen demand was strong. 
Sequentially, overall volumes grew 5% from first quarter. Demand from chemicals and steel continued to increase, and demand from general manufacturing customers picked up. 
On-site volumes were 20% above prior year and 7% above first quarter, driven by oxygen and hydrogen. Our oxygen pipeline volumes have significantly rebounded but are still about 10% below 2008 peak levels. Overall merchant volumes were 13% above prior year and 4% above the first quarter. Higher demand was broad-based for all liquid products, including oxygen, argon and liquid hydrogen. Carbon dioxide sales and nitrogen volumes were higher due to increased frac-ing activity in the U.S. and Canada. Sequentially, our frac volumes were lower due to the seasonal slowdown in Canada due to warmer weather. CO2 sales increased for seasonal food and beverage demand. Liquid volumes in Mexico are significantly above last year and continued to grow through the quarter. 
Packaged gases volumes are improving as manufacturing activity has picked up in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Overall volumes grew 6% sequentially versus the first quarter. Hardgoods in the U.S. and Canada are recovering at a faster pace than gases, which is typical in an economic recovery. 
North American operating profit was $294 million, 11% above prior year. Compared to the first quarter, operating profit grew 6% on sales growth of 3%, showing solid operating leverage on improving volumes. This leverage was still masked in the year-over-year results due to take-or-pay revenue, which we were collecting in last year's quarter.
Looking forward, we expect volumes to continue to improve in the second half of the year, though the rate of growth may moderate somewhat. We are seeing new business opportunities for merchant liquids in food, energy and environmental applications. So our overall outlook is for steady growth in the second half of the year.
Please turn to Page 5 for our European results. Sales in Europe were $335 million, 9% above the 2009 quarter. Higher volumes and price contributed 11% growth, which was partially offset by currency depreciation. On-site volumes were up 16%, primarily due to higher pipeline oxygen demand in Spain and Germany. Merchant volumes across the region increased significantly from prior year. Packaged gases are showing sequential improvement, but have lagged the recovery in on-site and merchant due to weak local construction and metal fabrication markets, particularly in Spain. Demand from customers serving export-oriented industries like chemicals and steel and less cyclical industries like healthcare has improved. Sequentially, volumes grew 4% across Europe, but were offset at the sales line by currency devaluation.
Operating profit in the quarter was $73 million, 20% above the prior year and 9% above first quarter. OP included a $4 million currency hedge gain, which substantially offset the effect of the currency devaluation on operating profit. 2009’s second quarter included a similar-sized currency hedge loss. 
For the third quarter, we expect sales to be lower than the second quarter, as a result of seasonally lower sales due to the August holidays and due to about a 5% negative impact from the weaker euro. But in terms of underlying growth, we are still expecting Europe to continue on a path of recovery.
Page 6 summarizes our South American results. Sales in South America were $490 million, up 24% from prior year. Currency appreciation increased sales by 12%. Sales grew 15% and 6% sequentially from higher volumes and price. Industrial production in Brazil has averaged about 17% through May and is forecasted to average about 12% for the full year. 
Our on-site volumes have recovered strongly and are almost back to 2008 levels. Merchant liquid volumes are 13% above prior year and up 9% sequentially, excluding seasonal CO2. Packaged gases are also growing in line with increasing domestic consumption. By end market, growth is broad-based to steel, energy, food, health care and manufacturing. Other countries in Latin America are also growing nicely, with Chile, Argentina and Peru exhibiting strong year-over-year volume growth. 
Operating profit in the second quarter was $114 million versus $70 million in the prior year quarter, which included an $11 million currency hedge loss. Operating profit margin was 23.3%. 
Operating leverage came from strong volume gains, pricing and ongoing productivity and cost reduction. Our outlook for South America for the second half of the year is very positive. Brazil's currency is stable. Interest rates are low by historical standards, which has provided good economic stimulus, though they have inched up a little recently because the government is committed to keeping inflation in check. 
The country has a growing consumption-oriented middle class which is driving growth. We started up three projects this quarter and are looking at numerous new project opportunities. The long-term outlook is especially bright, with numerous opportunities in the energy sector and expected infrastructure investment for the upcoming World Cup and Olympics.
Please look at Page 7 for our Asia results. Asia had another very strong quarter, with sales of $280 million, up 41% from prior year, driven by 27% volume growth. Currency effects increased sales by 5%. Cost pass-through, which is higher power and precious metal prices used in manufacturing our sputtering targets increased sales by 10%. Volume growth came from new projects and from significant growth in on-site and liquid volumes in China, India and Korea. By end market, sales to steel and chemicals are significantly higher. Electronics is still very strong. Sales rose 32% excluding cost pass-through. The mix effect of such a strong electronics sales caused the negative 1% impact from price.
Operating profit increased to $44 million this quarter from $33 million in 2009 and up from $34 million last quarter. We expect absolute growth in Asia to be strong for the balance of the year, but we anticipate that the growth rate may moderate in the second half from what we saw in the first half as the Chinese government tries to avoid an overheated economy. 
Project proposal activity continues to be robust in the region. We have a large number of projects under construction which will start up in 2011 and 2012, supporting strong future growth.
Surface Technologies results are on Page 8. PST sales this quarter were $141 million compared to $118 million in the 2009 quarter. Excluding currency effects, sales increased due to the Sermatech acquisition, which contributed sales of $21 million this quarter. We closed this acquisition last July, and so there will no longer be an acquisition impact next quarter. 
Aviation coatings were above prior year due to strong EBPVD jet engine coatings. These are the coatings used in the new GE GEnx engines powering the 787 and 747-8 planes. We expect these volumes to increase in the second half of the year. Coatings for the aftermarket are expected to pick up slowly, in line with increases in passenger miles flown. 
Lower coatings for industrial gas turbines offset some of this growth. IGT builds by the major manufacturers turned down in the economic crisis. We do expect to see this business start to pick up, but this is long-lead-time equipment, so we are not forecasting a meaningful increase in our coatings volumes to this market until 2011. 
We completed the acquisition integration July 1, and so PST's margins should continue to improve in the second half due to the lack of integration expenses. Our goal is to move PST's operating margin to the high teens area over the next six to nine months with reasonable volume improvement. 
Now I'm going to turn this back to Jim to discuss our global end market trends and our earnings guidance."

This slide gives you some detail on our end market sales trends, both year-over-year and compared to last quarter. We're showing you our organic sales growth excluding currency, cost pass-through and acquisition effects",849,"Thanks, Liz. Please turn to Page 9. This slide gives you some detail on our end market sales trends, both year-over-year and compared to last quarter. We're showing you our organic sales growth excluding currency, cost pass-through and acquisition effects. Sales to the energy market are above prior year and up 9% sequentially. Hydrogen sales to refiners represent about 2/3 of our sales to the energy sector. Demand has been very steady from existing customers, and this quarter we began supplying a new customer from our Gulf Coast pipeline system. The balance of the segment is primarily enhanced oil recovery and natural gas well frac-ing. Frac-ing volumes were above prior year and seasonally lower on a sequential basis. Our long-term outlook for energy is very bullish, given many hydrogen project opportunities in Brazil, Mexico and Asia. These new projects are large and will drive significant future growth for us. And we're positive that EOR will also continue to gain traction around the world as energy demand increases.
Electronics sales have continued to be robust, up 22% from a year ago due to strong demand in Asia from semiconductor and LCD manufacturers. Sales to the photovoltaic industry and polysilicon producers also continued to grow, and we have won a number of new contracts. We expect a strong second half of the year due to industry forecast of continued strong demand for consumer electronics and a pickup in business IT spending. 
Sales to chemicals and metals markets have recovered significantly from the low levels in 2009. Sales to both markets were up 7% from last quarter from strong base business demand and new projects on stream in Asia. Demand for steel and chemicals is being fueled by infrastructure investment and growing consumer demand in the emerging markets, particularly China, India and South America. Customer demand has also picked up in the U.S. and Europe at a more moderate pace. 
Sales to manufacturing this quarter grew 6% sequentially, primarily due to continued strong growth in South America and Asia. In addition, we began to see more strength in the U.S., Canada and Europe, where merchant and packaged gases volumes improved. However, we're still about 10% below peak levels, which represents significant future upside in sales and operating leverage as volumes continue to recover.
Please turn to Page 10 for our earnings guidance. For the third quarter of 2010, our earnings guidance is for earnings per share to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.20. We expect to see our overall volumes continue to trend up sequentially. Our third quarter is typically on a par with the second quarter because it includes the slowdown in Europe due to the summer holidays. In addition, as Liz mentioned, this guidance includes a sequential headwind due to the depreciation of the euro currency, which will reduce sales by $15 million to $20 million in the third quarter versus the second quarter. 
We are raising our EPS guidance for the full year 2010 to a range of $4.60 to $4.70, excluding the $0.08 negative impact in the first quarter resulting from the Venezuela currency devaluation. This represents year-over-year earnings growth of 15% to 18% and is well above our peak earnings in 2008 of $4.20. Our earnings guidance including the Venezuela charge is $4.52 to $4.62. We expect full year sales to be the area of $10 billion and the effective tax rate to remain at about 28%. CapEx for the year is still forecasted to be about $1.4 billion. Our long-term outlook continues to improve. Our base business is clearly recovering, and there's more upside to come. In addition, large project activity around the world is strong. We're working on a host of opportunities in South America, China and India as well as the Middle East and Russia, which we believe will sustain our project backlog and therefore, growth, in years to come.
Page 11 is the slide which indicates the confidence we have in this regard. We will be starting up about 10 projects in the second half of the year, but we're forecasting that the capital value of our backlog will rise to about $2.5 billion by year end, which will be a record for us. These projects are all under long-term contract and have at least mid-teens [ph] (0:32:49.2) returns well in excess of our cost of capital and which should, therefore, drive high-quality revenue and earnings growth through 2012 and beyond. 
Our new share repurchase program and our track record of dividend increases is an indication of our commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders. It does not suggest a lack of growth opportunities in our core business. Instead, it's a result of our financial discipline, which has delivered a much higher return on capital than our peers. This has resulted in operating cash flow of nearly 25% of sales, capital spending on new projects of about 15% of sales and free cash flow of about 10% of sales. This allows us to increase dividends each year and repurchase stock without increasing leverage. 
And now I'm happy to take your questions."

South America has come back to about 3/4 of where it was before the slowdown.

Well, PST, it’s more of a function of what's going on in its key end markets. And our strategy when we made the acquisition of Sermatech and our strategy going forward is really to be the #1 provider of high-temperature and performance coatings to turbines. And there are really two kinds of turbines. There are aircraft turbine engines and there are industrial gas turbine engines. And so in the aircraft side, there's always a very cyclical increase and decrease as the airlines decide how many planes to buy, as the plane makers figure out how fast they can make those planes and then as the engine makers figure out how much inventory that they have. So it kind of cycles from quarter to quarter. And on the industrial gas turbines side, same thing. And so our customers in industrial gas turbines are in a big inventory-correction mode right now. And our industrial gas turbine business is way off this quarter from 12 months ago. But if you take the long run, the amount of coatings we’ll provide to jet engines is, over time, is just going to be a linear function of how many air miles are flown. Either they buy new engines or they recoat the old engines. So over the long run, it's going be a function of how many air passenger miles are flown. And air passenger miles are really growing significantly in emerging markets. And then the same thing is true in the turbines. If you take the position that natural gas is going to continue to be a key fuel in the future, there will be more industrial gas turbines, both new turbines as well as recoating of existing turbines after a certain number of hours. So while we have these bumps up and down quarter-to-quarter, and this quarter was really impacted by industrial gas turbines, we do think that our strategy of being the #1 provider of coatings to turbines should pay off in the long run."

Today's presentation materials are available on our website at www.praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference and website.
Praxair had a strong third quarter with overall business trends in line with our expectations. Our results showed strong volume growth in all geographies as compared to last year. Volume growth was particularly strong in South America and Asia. As we anticipated, sequential growth in the second quarter was at a more modest pace from what we were seeing in the first half of this year. We grew operating profit and net income faster than sales from productivity and cost reduction and operating leverage from higher volumes. 
We reported record net income and earnings per share despite the fact that in developed markets like the U.S., Canada and Europe, our volumes are still below pre-recession levels. We generated very strong operating cash flow, started up four new plants, signed a number of new customer contracts and acquired an investment in a leading industrial gas business in the Middle East, a region, which we believe offers significant opportunity, all of which positions us well for continued future profitable growth. Liz is going to review our quarterly results in more detail."

Please turn to Slide 3 in our presentation for a summary of our third quarter results. Please note that the results for the prior year quarter and the year-over-year comparisons have been adjusted to exclude the impact of",1781,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Please turn to Slide 3 in our presentation for a summary of our third quarter results. Please note that the results for the prior year quarter and the year-over-year comparisons have been adjusted to exclude the impact of the Brazil tax amnesty program and other charges last year. Sales in the quarter were $2.5 billion, 11% above the prior year, primarily due to 9% volume growth. Sales were higher in all our major end markets. Chemicals, metals, electronics and manufacturing have the strongest growth versus prior year. New plant start-ups in Asia and in the U.S. contributed to overall growth. Sequentially, sales were similar to the second quarter as organic volume growth was somewhat offset by summer vacation seasonality in Europe, combined with a number of customer plant outages in Europe, the U.S. and China.
Operating profit of $551 million grew 15% from the prior year and the operating margin increased to 21.7%. Excluding the effect of higher cost pass-through, operating margin was 22.1%, which is a record. The contribution of higher volumes on a lower cost structure from ongoing productivity initiatives drove this improvement. 
Net income of $377 million grew 19% from 2009, aided by lower interest expense and higher income from equity investments. Interest expense is lower due to lower rates and lower international borrowings. Equity income is higher due to higher earnings in our affiliates in Italy and Norway, and our recently acquired investment in the Middle East, the ROC Group. Earnings per share were a record $1.21, also up 19% from prior year.
We generated strong cash flow from operations of $596 million, which is 23% of sales. This cash flow funded $324 million of capital expenditures, largely related to the construction of large on-site plants in our project backlog and acquisitions of $114 million. Acquisition expenditures relate primarily to our recently announced acquisition of a 49% interest in the ROC Group, which is the leading industrial gas company in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, and which also has a growing business in Qatar. Cash flow also funded dividends of $139 million and $54 million of net stock repurchases.
After-tax return on capital was 14.7%, and return on equity was 26.4% for the quarter.
Please turn to Page 4 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.3 billion, 10% above prior year, due primarily to 7% volume growth. Higher cost pass-through, primarily higher natural gas prices, contractually passed through to our customers in hydrogen prices, increased sales by 3%. Sales to chemicals and metals customers were well above prior year and manufacturing showed nice improvement. Sequentially, sales volumes were flat with second quarter due to the mix. Merchant volumes were higher and packaged gases volumes were lower due to normal seasonality related to summer holidays. On-site volumes were modestly lower due to several seal [ph] and refining customer turnarounds.
On-site volumes were 7% above prior year driven by higher oxygen and nitrogen. Towards the end of the quarter, we started up the first hydrogen plant at BP's Whiting Refinery. Our hydrogen supply at this location will ramp up throughout 2011. This supply agreement is different than other hydrogen contract in that the natural gas feedstock is being supplied by the customer and not running through our income statement. Therefore, this contract will not add as much to our top line, but its very high margin sales.
Merchant volumes have continued to grow. Overall volumes grew 12% from prior year and 3% sequentially. Growth was broad based across all major products. Carbon dioxide was strong for seasonal food and beverage demand. Liquid sales were higher for gas well frac-ing activity related to a number of specific projects and technology testing sites. Merchant pricing trends are relatively flat year-over-year and sequentially, with some tailwind from recent price increase actions and some headwind from lower liquid hydrogen prices tied to natural gas.
Packaged gases volumes are improving more slowly. Volumes were 6% above prior year with growth led by hardgoods and some equipment sales, which is typical at the start of an economic recovery. Sequentially, packaged volumes are slightly lower as is customary in the third quarter due to summer holidays. 
Our business in Mexico is performing well, with volumes up 6% from prior year and continuing to improve sequentially. New project activity is increasing in the energy, steel and petrochem sectors, which bodes well for future growth. Pemex will continue to invest in energy production, and multinational corporations and local companies are investing in new production capacity for both domestic consumption and export.
Operating profit in North America was $314 million, 19% above prior year. Operating margin reflects good leverage from higher volumes, including the hydrogen plant start up. Please turn to Page 5 for our results in Europe.
Sales in Europe were $322 million. Excluding currency effects, sales were 10% above the prior year, driven by 7% organic volume growth. On-site merchant and packaged gases were all above 2009 levels in Germany, Italy and Spain. Merchant volumes showed the strongest growth this quarter, up 11%. Packaged gases are lagging in the recovery due to weak construction in met fab [metal fabrication] markets, particularly in Spain. 
Overall, slow positive sequential business trends continue, with Germany showing the most strength driven by exports, and Spain lagging in the economic recovery. This mix is evident in the operating profit, which was $59 million in the quarter compared to $68 million last year. Volumes have improved the most to our largest on-site and pipeline customers, some of whom were making high-margin take or pay payments last year and are now taking product. Packaged gases are higher margin and volumes have been slower to improve coming out of the downturn.
Currency effects, including a net income hedge loss this quarter combined with plant outages and expenses associated with the new business acquisitions also temporarily depressed operating profit and the margin percentage. In August, we announced the acquisition of a 49% ownership interest, but with 50% voting control of the ROC Group's businesses in the UAE, Kuwait and Qatar. This week, we announced a large on-site contract with United Steel in Bahrain. In addition, we have established a presence in two key industrial areas in Russia, and we announced this week a long-term oxygen contract for a steel company in the Volgograd region.
These investments followed several years of research and business development to identify the right locations, the best partners and the highest quality customers with whom to do business. The associated costs of establishing these footprints have been absorbed in our Europe segment, but we are now at the point of winning new business and realizing revenue and earnings growth, which we anticipate will accelerated in the future.
Page 6 summarizes our results in South America. Sales in South America were $506 million, up 16% from prior year. Currency appreciation increased sales by 4%. Underlying sales grew 12% from higher price and volume. On-site and merchant volumes have staged a strong recovery and are close to 2008 levels. Compared to last quarter, merchant and packaged gases have continued to grow, up 2% and 5%, respectively, in the quarter. On-site oxygen volumes weakened a bit, along with fuel production in Brazil due to the strengthening real. The Brazilian government has increased the IOF tax on financial investments coming into the country, what is referred to as the carry trade, in order to prevent the real from appreciating too far.
Operating profit of $117 million grew 24% from prior year, and the operating margin was 23.1%. The strong leverage was due to volume and pricing gains and productivity savings. Overall, we continue to be very bullish on growth prospects in South America. We expect our base business to continue to grow, and we are working on many new project proposals. We anticipate significant hydrogen opportunities with Petrobras, who is investing billions of dollars in upstream refining. These potential projects are large with long lead times. In addition, we are working on numerous other opportunities with fuel, chemical and other manufacturing customers. Our merchant and package businesses will grow with increasing domestic consumption and new gas applications which we bring to our customers.
Please look at Page 7 for our results in Asia. Asia sales of $287 million were 24% above prior year. Excluding the effects of currency and cost pass-through, which is primarily precious metals used in our physical vapor deposition targets business, sales grew primarily from 17% higher volumes. Volume growth came from new project start-ups in China and Korea and strong growth in merchant liquids. Our volumes in China are at record levels. 
India's volumes are 15% above prior year and up 4% from last quarter due to organic growth. Electronics has continued to be strong in Asia, though we are expecting growth to moderate next quarter and into 2011. Sales to the flat-panel display market have slowed down, but sales to the semiconductor manufacturers have held up, driven by handheld devices.
We had strong sales of PVD targets this quarter, particularly in Asia. The mix effect of electronic sales and lower xenon pricing, which primarily goes to the plasma market, accounts for the 2% lower price in the Asia segment this quarter. Pricing for merchant industrial gases is up year-over-year in both China and India.
Operating profit in the quarter was $38 million. The significant effect of cost pass-through this quarter reduced the operating margin by 170 basis points. We are also adding sales and engineering resources to support expected future growth. As an example of the new business we are winning, last week, we announced a new 1,700 ton air separation plant for Meishan Steel. This is a project which was deferred in the early days of the economic downturn. Based on the current growth outlook and new energy efficiency technologies we're working on, Meishan has expanded the original project scope and the plant will now come online in early 2012.
Page 8 shows our results for Surface Technologies. PST sales were $141 million this quarter, 8% above prior year, excluding currency effects and on par with last quarter. EBPVD jet engine coatings were strong and aviation coatings in U.S. and Asia improved from last quarter. Coatings for industrial gas turbines are below prior year due to lower new builds. Demand for coatings for oil field gate valve components grew. Operating profit of $23 million grew 28% from prior year and 5% from last quarter, showing strong operating leverage from higher volumes and productivity initiatives. Now I will turn this back to Jim to discuss what we're seeing in our global end markets and our fourth quarter earnings guidance."

This slide gives you our customary detail on sales growth to our major end markets compared to both prior year and to last quarter.

This slide gives you our customary detail on sales growth to our major end markets compared to both prior year and to last quarter. It shows an organic sales growth, excluding currency, cost pass-through and acquisition effects. Our sales in the energy markets are primarily refinery hydrogen. Our volumes from existing customers have been very steady. This quarter, we had a customer outage, which offset the positive contribution from the world scale plant we started up in Whiting, Indiana late in the quarter. 
We expect future growth to come primarily from new refinery investment in overseas markets for upgrading and new capacity. The potential number of new projects is very large and the size of these projects is large so we continue to see hydrogen as a significant growth driver for us. We also continue to be positive on new business opportunities related to enhanced oil recovery, and we are participating in a number of pilot projects around the world. 
Electronic sales were strong. Our sales were up 17% from last year, excluding the cost pass-through due to strong demand in Asia from semiconductor manufacturers and the flat-panel makers. As Liz mentioned earlier, our PVD's target sales have been strong in line with increased industry capacity utilization. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw demand from flat-panel manufacturers slowed and we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter. The solar and LED markets should continue to provide good growth. Lower pricing of specialty gases continues to offset some of the volume growth.
Sales to chemical customers have continued to be very strong in the U.S., Germany and in Asia. Infrastructure investment and rising consumer demand in emerging markets and the economic recovery in the U.S. and Europe have all been supportive of chemical production, and low natural gas prices are really helping the U.S. producers. We believe that this end market will be one of the key drivers for new on-site projects overseas in the next several years.
Sales to metals were up sharply year-over-year. However, we did see a sequential slowdown this quarter due to the end of inventory restocking and a softening of order backlog at customers. As a result, several large customers took maintenance outages in the quarter. Global steel production in Q3 declined about 6% from the second quarter, but is forecasted to increase in the fourth quarter and we're seeing this already in China. Our outlook is for modest growth to continue in 2011.
Sales to manufacturing were 12% above 2009 and flat versus second quarter. The underlying trends are positive, stronger in emerging markets and slower and more choppy in the U.S. and Europe. Our sequential results reflect the normal seasonal decline in sales in Europe due to the summer holidays. Please turn to Page 10 for our fourth quarter earnings guidance.
Our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010 is for earnings per share to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.23. We expect to see modest sequential volume growth. Year-over-year comparisons will be more muted. At this point, we expect minimal currency effects. This therefore brings our 2010 full year earnings per share guidance on an adjusted basis to a range of $4.67 to $4.72, which is up 17% to 18% above our 2009 adjusted earnings of $3.99. This represents record earnings for Praxair and is significantly above our $4.20 peak earnings in 2008. We've achieved this even though our volumes are not fully back to 2008 levels, primarily because of new projects coming on line in cost reduction and productivity, which have given us a good operating leverage on volumes as they recover.
So this should also indicate to you that as we go forward into 2011, there are still more leverage to come from our base business. We're expecting full year sales to be about $10 billion and full year capital spending to be in the area of $1.4 billion. We will begin specific earnings guidance for 2011 in January when we announce our fourth quarter earnings. But let me say a few words on our general outlook.
Our base business continues to improve. We expect the pace of growth to be slow, but steady in the U.S., Canada and in Europe where consumer spending is below pre-recession levels and where excess manufacturing capacity will mitigate the need of our customers to build new production facilities for several more years perhaps. We took a lot of cost out in these locations in the downturn and are being judicious and selective about adding them back. This is why we expect traditional margin leverage as volumes continue to improve. 
We're very bullish about growth in the less developed emerging countries. And Praxair has what we believe to be the strongest footprint for profitable growth among our major competitors in the key countries. We expect to generate strong growth in Brazil, the other Latin American countries in South America, Mexico, China and India where our existing businesses are significant.
Our recently established platforms in the Middle East and Russia will add to this footprint for growth. These are all regions where the rising standard of living is driving increased consumer spending. This in turn drives investments in industrial and manufacturing infrastructure as well as in more energy production. These projects require significant amounts of industrial gas supply and the increasing trend of our customers to outsource our gas supply rather than buy and operate their own plant as the overall growth opportunity for us.
We therefore expect our project backlog to continue to grow. As these projects start up, they should contribute about 3% to 5% revenue growth per year. It will be a little bit lumpy quarter-by-quarter and year-by-year depending on the size of the projects, timing of start up and the capital-to-sales profile. We continue to be selective about which projects we work on and want to win, and these are ones where we see the opportunity to earn a nice spread above our cost of capital from an on-site contract, coupled with merchant liquid distribution. 
As our track record has shown, we will continue to focus on developing innovative application technologies for our customers and winning new on-site opportunities, combined with a relentless focus on capital discipline and productivity. This is key to producing double-digit earnings growth, which we expect to deliver for the foreseeable future. And now I will take your questions."

And the on-site business has picked up fairly significantly in most places because it was down a lot due to inventory destocking and then restocking. Merchant has begun to pick up in the second quarter here in the U.S., but we're still right around 80% capacity utilization, which is not a good number. We'd much rather be at 85% to 90%. And then Europe is perhaps the weakest, and we suffered in Europe, but not only excess capacity, but extremely competitive pricing over there. So I'm not sure how to answer the question in terms of leveraging to 2011. But as long as we continue to see the demand grow in the merchant and packaged gas businesses around the world, we'll get operating leverage from the incremental volume, plus I expect we'll move up to a tighter capacity utilization in terms of supply and demand balance where we'll be able to increase pricing the way we did in prior years."

One of which we started in September, and the other one will start in the first quarter of next year. And what we've done with that contract, and it's really our preferable way of business, is to essentially operate at the tolling agreement where we never pay for the natural gas and we don't invoice the natural gas to the customer. Consequently, it has less than half of sales as it would if we were buying natural gas invoiced to the customer for that, but at the same operating profit. So that would add to operating margin percentage, much more than it would add to sales. But doing the contract that way takes an element of risk out of the oil project since we don't stand in a purchase agreement of natural gas and the sales agreement of hydrogen."

on our part as we spent probably five years looking after our share in deciding whether to invest there, where to invest there and how to mitigate the risks that are involved with that. But we basically are, in spite of the fact that the Russian natural gas and oil industry which is a huge opportunity for us, from a risk point of view, we've decided that's not a place where we want to go. So we're focused more on the chemicals and steel industry and mining industry. And the Volgograd region, south of Moscow, is where a lot of those chemical and steel plants are located, which we believe would offer the opportunity potentially someday to put it in a pipeline enclave, but we would only build that customer-by-customer as we sign contracts. And then secondly, way out in the euro mountains is the primary mining area and there's a lot of chemical and steel production and heavy industry there as well. All of that is currently captive. All the euro region, the Volgograd region is captive. And then the plants are extremely low efficiency, 30-year old Russian-designed plants, if you will. So there's huge opportunity to be able to decap existing customers by just building a new plant for them, and the savings that they get in energy efficiency versus operating the old plant is more than enough to allow them to pay our take-or-pay contract monthly and give us the return on capital that we're looking for. So those are the two regions, and that's kind of the strategy there."

One of them is, about 40% of our sales in Asia are in electronics with below 10% operating margins. And that tends to bring down the traditional industrial gases, which is more in the 20% range. Secondly, we've moved a lot our business expenses. We have actually moved our procurement organization to Shanghai, so that we can focus on low-cost country sourcing in China. So we'll be buying more equipment out of China and less out of Europe and the U.S. Currently, we're getting up close to about 80% of our equipment coming from China in this Chinese plant. Then on top of that, it's kind of a bad quarter for us because we had some plant outages and we had power cost increases in Korea, and then genuinely higher expenses elsewhere. So kind of as a rule of thumb, I think you could think of about, when these things are gone, kind of getting the margin up close to 20%.

Today's presentation materials are available on our website at www.praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference and website.
Praxair had a strong third quarter with overall business trends in line with our expectations. Our results showed strong volume growth in all geographies as compared to last year. Volume growth was particularly strong in South America and Asia. As we anticipated, sequential growth in the second quarter was at a more modest pace from what we were seeing in the first half of this year. We grew operating profit and net income faster than sales from productivity and cost reduction and operating leverage from higher volumes. 
We reported record net income and earnings per share despite the fact that in developed markets like the U.S., Canada and Europe, our volumes are still below pre-recession levels. We generated very strong operating cash flow, started up four new plants, signed a number of new customer contracts and acquired an investment in a leading industrial gas business in the Middle East, a region, which we believe offers significant opportunity, all of which positions us well for continued future profitable growth. Liz is going to review our quarterly results in more detail.

Please turn to Slide 3 in our presentation for a summary of our third quarter results. Please note that the results for the prior year quarter and the year-over-year comparisons have been adjusted to exclude the impact of the Brazil tax amnesty program and other charges last year. Sales in the quarter were $2.5 billion, 11% above the prior year, primarily due to 9% volume growth. Sales were higher in all our major end markets. Chemicals, metals, electronics and manufacturing have the strongest growth versus prior year. New plant start-ups in Asia and in the U.S. contributed to overall growth. Sequentially, sales were similar to the second quarter as organic volume growth was somewhat offset by summer vacation seasonality in Europe, combined with a number of customer plant outages in Europe, the U.S. and China.
Operating profit of $551 million grew 15% from the prior year and the operating margin increased to 21.7%. Excluding the effect of higher cost pass-through, operating margin was 22.1%, which is a record. The contribution of higher volumes on a lower cost structure from ongoing productivity initiatives drove this improvement. 
Net income of $377 million grew 19% from 2009, aided by lower interest expense and higher income from equity investments. Interest expense is lower due to lower rates and lower international borrowings. Equity income is higher due to higher earnings in our affiliates in Italy and Norway, and our recently acquired investment in the Middle East, the ROC Group. Earnings per share were a record $1.21, also up 19% from prior year.
We generated strong cash flow from operations of $596 million, which is 23% of sales. This cash flow funded $324 million of capital expenditures, largely related to the construction of large on-site plants in our project backlog and acquisitions of $114 million. Acquisition expenditures relate primarily to our recently announced acquisition of a 49% interest in the ROC Group, which is the leading industrial gas company in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, and which also has a growing business in Qatar. Cash flow also funded dividends of $139 million and $54 million of net stock repurchases.
After-tax return on capital was 14.7%, and return on equity was 26.4% for the quarter.
Please turn to Page 4 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.3 billion, 10% above prior year, due primarily to 7% volume growth. Higher cost pass-through, primarily higher natural gas prices, contractually passed through to our customers in hydrogen prices, increased sales by 3%. Sales to chemicals and metals customers were well above prior year and manufacturing showed nice improvement. Sequentially, sales volumes were flat with second quarter due to the mix. Merchant volumes were higher and packaged gases volumes were lower due to normal seasonality related to summer holidays. On-site volumes were modestly lower due to several seal [ph] and refining customer turnarounds.
On-site volumes were 7% above prior year driven by higher oxygen and nitrogen. Towards the end of the quarter, we started up the first hydrogen plant at BP's Whiting Refinery. Our hydrogen supply at this location will ramp up throughout 2011. This supply agreement is different than other hydrogen contract in that the natural gas feedstock is being supplied by the customer and not running through our income statement. Therefore, this contract will not add as much to our top line, but its very high margin sales.
Merchant volumes have continued to grow. Overall volumes grew 12% from prior year and 3% sequentially. Growth was broad based across all major products. Carbon dioxide was strong for seasonal food and beverage demand. Liquid sales were higher for gas well frac-ing activity related to a number of specific projects and technology testing sites. Merchant pricing trends are relatively flat year-over-year and sequentially, with some tailwind from recent price increase actions and some headwind from lower liquid hydrogen prices tied to natural gas.
Packaged gases volumes are improving more slowly. Volumes were 6% above prior year with growth led by hardgoods and some equipment sales, which is typical at the start of an economic recovery. Sequentially, packaged volumes are slightly lower as is customary in the third quarter due to summer holidays. 
Our business in Mexico is performing well, with volumes up 6% from prior year and continuing to improve sequentially. New project activity is increasing in the energy, steel and petrochem sectors, which bodes well for future growth. Pemex will continue to invest in energy production, and multinational corporations and local companies are investing in new production capacity for both domestic consumption and export.
Operating profit in North America was $314 million, 19% above prior year. Operating margin reflects good leverage from higher volumes, including the hydrogen plant start up. Please turn to Page 5 for our results in Europe.
Sales in Europe were $322 million. Excluding currency effects, sales were 10% above the prior year, driven by 7% organic volume growth. On-site merchant and packaged gases were all above 2009 levels in Germany, Italy and Spain. Merchant volumes showed the strongest growth this quarter, up 11%. Packaged gases are lagging in the recovery due to weak construction in met fab [metal fabrication] markets, particularly in Spain. 
Overall, slow positive sequential business trends continue, with Germany showing the most strength driven by exports, and Spain lagging in the economic recovery. This mix is evident in the operating profit, which was $59 million in the quarter compared to $68 million last year. Volumes have improved the most to our largest on-site and pipeline customers, some of whom were making high-margin take or pay payments last year and are now taking product. Packaged gases are higher margin and volumes have been slower to improve coming out of the downturn.
Currency effects, including a net income hedge loss this quarter combined with plant outages and expenses associated with the new business acquisitions also temporarily depressed operating profit and the margin percentage. In August, we announced the acquisition of a 49% ownership interest, but with 50% voting control of the ROC Group's businesses in the UAE, Kuwait and Qatar. This week, we announced a large on-site contract with United Steel in Bahrain. In addition, we have established a presence in two key industrial areas in Russia, and we announced this week a long-term oxygen contract for a steel company in the Volgograd region.
These investments followed several years of research and business development to identify the right locations, the best partners and the highest quality customers with whom to do business. The associated costs of establishing these footprints have been absorbed in our Europe segment, but we are now at the point of winning new business and realizing revenue and earnings growth, which we anticipate will accelerated in the future.
Page 6 summarizes our results in South America. Sales in South America were $506 million, up 16% from prior year. Currency appreciation increased sales by 4%. Underlying sales grew 12% from higher price and volume. On-site and merchant volumes have staged a strong recovery and are close to 2008 levels. Compared to last quarter, merchant and packaged gases have continued to grow, up 2% and 5%, respectively, in the quarter. On-site oxygen volumes weakened a bit, along with fuel production in Brazil due to the strengthening real. The Brazilian government has increased the IOF tax on financial investments coming into the country, what is referred to as the carry trade, in order to prevent the real from appreciating too far.
Operating profit of $117 million grew 24% from prior year, and the operating margin was 23.1%. The strong leverage was due to volume and pricing gains and productivity savings. Overall, we continue to be very bullish on growth prospects in South America. We expect our base business to continue to grow, and we are working on many new project proposals. We anticipate significant hydrogen opportunities with Petrobras, who is investing billions of dollars in upstream refining. These potential projects are large with long lead times. In addition, we are working on numerous other opportunities with fuel, chemical and other manufacturing customers. Our merchant and package businesses will grow with increasing domestic consumption and new gas applications which we bring to our customers.
Please look at Page 7 for our results in Asia. Asia sales of $287 million were 24% above prior year. Excluding the effects of currency and cost pass-through, which is primarily precious metals used in our physical vapor deposition targets business, sales grew primarily from 17% higher volumes. Volume growth came from new project start-ups in China and Korea and strong growth in merchant liquids. Our volumes in China are at record levels. 
India's volumes are 15% above prior year and up 4% from last quarter due to organic growth. Electronics has continued to be strong in Asia, though we are expecting growth to moderate next quarter and into 2011. Sales to the flat-panel display market have slowed down, but sales to the semiconductor manufacturers have held up, driven by handheld devices.
We had strong sales of PVD targets this quarter, particularly in Asia. The mix effect of electronic sales and lower xenon pricing, which primarily goes to the plasma market, accounts for the 2% lower price in the Asia segment this quarter. Pricing for merchant industrial gases is up year-over-year in both China and India.
Operating profit in the quarter was $38 million. The significant effect of cost pass-through this quarter reduced the operating margin by 170 basis points. We are also adding sales and engineering resources to support expected future growth. As an example of the new business we are winning, last week, we announced a new 1,700 ton air separation plant for Meishan Steel. This is a project which was deferred in the early days of the economic downturn. Based on the current growth outlook and new energy efficiency technologies we're working on, Meishan has expanded the original project scope and the plant will now come online in early 2012.
Page 8 shows our results for Surface Technologies. PST sales were $141 million this quarter, 8% above prior year, excluding currency effects and on par with last quarter. EBPVD jet engine coatings were strong and aviation coatings in U.S. and Asia improved from last quarter. Coatings for industrial gas turbines are below prior year due to lower new builds. Demand for coatings for oil field gate valve components grew. Operating profit of $23 million grew 28% from prior year and 5% from last quarter, showing strong operating leverage from higher volumes and productivity initiatives. Now I will turn this back to Jim to discuss what we're seeing in our global end markets and our fourth quarter earnings guidance.

This slide gives you our customary detail on sales growth to our major end markets compared to both prior year and to last quarter.

This slide gives you our customary detail on sales growth to our major end markets compared to both prior year and to last quarter. It shows an organic sales growth, excluding currency, cost pass-through and acquisition effects. Our sales in the energy markets are primarily refinery hydrogen. Our volumes from existing customers have been very steady. This quarter, we had a customer outage, which offset the positive contribution from the world scale plant we started up in Whiting, Indiana late in the quarter. 
We expect future growth to come primarily from new refinery investment in overseas markets for upgrading and new capacity. The potential number of new projects is very large and the size of these projects is large so we continue to see hydrogen as a significant growth driver for us. We also continue to be positive on new business opportunities related to enhanced oil recovery, and we are participating in a number of pilot projects around the world. 
Electronic sales were strong. Our sales were up 17% from last year, excluding the cost pass-through due to strong demand in Asia from semiconductor manufacturers and the flat-panel makers. As Liz mentioned earlier, our PVD's target sales have been strong in line with increased industry capacity utilization. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw demand from flat-panel manufacturers slowed and we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter. The solar and LED markets should continue to provide good growth. Lower pricing of specialty gases continues to offset some of the volume growth.
Sales to chemical customers have continued to be very strong in the U.S., Germany and in Asia. Infrastructure investment and rising consumer demand in emerging markets and the economic recovery in the U.S. and Europe have all been supportive of chemical production, and low natural gas prices are really helping the U.S. producers. We believe that this end market will be one of the key drivers for new on-site projects overseas in the next several years.
Sales to metals were up sharply year-over-year. However, we did see a sequential slowdown this quarter due to the end of inventory restocking and a softening of order backlog at customers. As a result, several large customers took maintenance outages in the quarter. Global steel production in Q3 declined about 6% from the second quarter, but is forecasted to increase in the fourth quarter and we're seeing this already in China. Our outlook is for modest growth to continue in 2011.
Sales to manufacturing were 12% above 2009 and flat versus second quarter. The underlying trends are positive, stronger in emerging markets and slower and more choppy in the U.S. and Europe. Our sequential results reflect the normal seasonal decline in sales in Europe due to the summer holidays. Please turn to Page 10 for our fourth quarter earnings guidance.
Our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010 is for earnings per share to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.23. We expect to see modest sequential volume growth. Year-over-year comparisons will be more muted. At this point, we expect minimal currency effects. This therefore brings our 2010 full year earnings per share guidance on an adjusted basis to a range of $4.67 to $4.72, which is up 17% to 18% above our 2009 adjusted earnings of $3.99. This represents record earnings for Praxair and is significantly above our $4.20 peak earnings in 2008. We've achieved this even though our volumes are not fully back to 2008 levels, primarily because of new projects coming on line in cost reduction and productivity, which have given us a good operating leverage on volumes as they recover.
So this should also indicate to you that as we go forward into 2011, there are still more leverage to come from our base business. We're expecting full year sales to be about $10 billion and full year capital spending to be in the area of $1.4 billion. We will begin specific earnings guidance for 2011 in January when we announce our fourth quarter earnings. But let me say a few words on our general outlook.
Our base business continues to improve. We expect the pace of growth to be slow, but steady in the U.S., Canada and in Europe where consumer spending is below pre-recession levels and where excess manufacturing capacity will mitigate the need of our customers to build new production facilities for several more years perhaps. We took a lot of cost out in these locations in the downturn and are being judicious and selective about adding them back. This is why we expect traditional margin leverage as volumes continue to improve. 
We're very bullish about growth in the less developed emerging countries. And Praxair has what we believe to be the strongest footprint for profitable growth among our major competitors in the key countries. We expect to generate strong growth in Brazil, the other Latin American countries in South America, Mexico, China and India where our existing businesses are significant.
Our recently established platforms in the Middle East and Russia will add to this footprint for growth. These are all regions where the rising standard of living is driving increased consumer spending. This in turn drives investments in industrial and manufacturing infrastructure as well as in more energy production. These projects require significant amounts of industrial gas supply and the increasing trend of our customers to outsource our gas supply rather than buy and operate their own plant as the overall growth opportunity for us.
We therefore expect our project backlog to continue to grow. As these projects start up, they should contribute about 3% to 5% revenue growth per year. It will be a little bit lumpy quarter-by-quarter and year-by-year depending on the size of the projects, timing of start up and the capital-to-sales profile. We continue to be selective about which projects we work on and want to win, and these are ones where we see the opportunity to earn a nice spread above our cost of capital from an on-site contract, coupled with merchant liquid distribution. 
As our track record has shown, we will continue to focus on developing innovative application technologies for our customers and winning new on-site opportunities, combined with a relentless focus on capital discipline and productivity. This is key to producing double-digit earnings growth, which we expect to deliver for the foreseeable future. And now I will take your questions.

It's really just a function of the fact that the growth in the first and second quarter was involved with inventory rebuilding.

And the on-site business has picked up fairly significantly in most places because it was down a lot due to inventory destocking and then restocking. Merchant has begun to pick up in the second quarter here in the U.S., but we're still right around 80% capacity utilization, which is not a good number. We'd much rather be at 85% to 90%. And then Europe is perhaps the weakest, and we suffered in Europe, but not only excess capacity, but extremely competitive pricing over there. So I'm not sure how to answer the question in terms of leveraging to 2011. But as long as we continue to see the demand grow in the merchant and packaged gas businesses around the world, we'll get operating leverage from the incremental volume, plus I expect we'll move up to a tighter capacity utilization in terms of supply and demand balance where we'll be able to increase pricing the way we did in prior years.

But we basically are, in spite of the fact that the Russian natural gas and oil industry which is a huge opportunity for us, from a risk point of view, we've decided that's not a place where we want to go. So we're focused more on the chemicals and steel industry and mining industry. And the Volgograd region, south of Moscow, is where a lot of those chemical and steel plants are located, which we believe would offer the opportunity potentially someday to put it in a pipeline enclave, but we would only build that customer-by-customer as we sign contracts. And then secondly, way out in the euro mountains is the primary mining area and there's a lot of chemical and steel production and heavy industry there as well. All of that is currently captive. All the euro region, the Volgograd region is captive. And then the plants are extremely low efficiency, 30-year old Russian-designed plants, if you will. So there's huge opportunity to be able to decap existing customers by just building a new plant for them, and the savings that they get in energy efficiency versus operating the old plant is more than enough to allow them to pay our take-or-pay contract monthly and give us the return on capital that we're looking for.

I think people realize and have asked this question for a long time why our margin in Asia are lower than the rest of the world. And there are generally two reasons for that. One of them is, about 40% of our sales in Asia are in electronics with below 10% operating margins. And that tends to bring down the traditional industrial gases, which is more in the 20% range. Secondly, we've moved a lot our business expenses. We have actually moved our procurement organization to Shanghai, so that we can focus on low-cost country sourcing in China. So we'll be buying more equipment out of China and less out of Europe and the U.S. Currently, we're getting up close to about 80% of our equipment coming from China in this Chinese plant. Then on top of that, it's kind of a bad quarter for us because we had some plant outages and we had power cost increases in Korea, and then genuinely higher expenses elsewhere. So kind of as a rule of thumb, I think you could think of about, when these things are gone, kind of getting the margin up close to 20%.

Today's presentation materials are available on our website at www.praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference and website.
Praxair had a strong third quarter with overall business trends in line with our expectations. Our results showed strong volume growth in all geographies as compared to last year. Volume growth was particularly strong in South America and Asia. As we anticipated, sequential growth in the second quarter was at a more modest pace from what we were seeing in the first half of this year. We grew operating profit and net income faster than sales from productivity and cost reduction and operating leverage from higher volumes. 
We reported record net income and earnings per share despite the fact that in developed markets like the U.S., Canada and Europe, our volumes are still below pre-recession levels. We generated very strong operating cash flow, started up four new plants, signed a number of new customer contracts and acquired an investment in a leading industrial gas business in the Middle East, a region which we believe offers significant opportunity, all of which positions us well for continued future profitable growth. Liz is going to review our quarterly results in more detail."

Please turn to Slide 3 in our presentation for a summary of our third quarter results.

Please turn to Slide 3 in our presentation for a summary of our third quarter results. Please note that the results for the prior year quarter and the year-over-year comparisons have been adjusted to exclude the impact of the Brazil tax amnesty program and other charges last year. Sales in the quarter were $2.5 billion, 11% above the prior year, primarily due to 9% volume growth. Sales were higher in all our major end markets. Chemicals, metals, electronics and manufacturing have the strongest growth versus prior year. New plant start-ups in Asia and in the U.S. contributed to overall growth. Sequentially, sales were similar to the second quarter as organic volume growth was somewhat offset by summer vacation seasonality in Europe, combined with a number of customer plant outages in Europe, the U.S. and China.
Operating profit of $551 million grew 15% from the prior year and the operating margin increased to 21.7%. Excluding the effect of higher cost pass-through, operating margin was 22.1%, which is a record. The contribution of higher volumes on a lower cost structure from ongoing productivity initiatives drove this improvement. 
Net income of $377 million grew 19% from 2009, aided by lower interest expense and higher income from equity investments. Interest expense is lower due to lower rates and lower international borrowings. Equity income is higher due to higher earnings in our affiliates in Italy and Norway, and our recently acquired investment in the Middle East, the ROC Group. Earnings per share were a record $1.21, also up 19% from prior year.
We generated strong cash flow from operations of $596 million, which is 23% of sales. This cash flow funded $324 million of capital expenditures, largely related to the construction of large on-site plants in our project backlog and acquisitions of $114 million. Acquisition expenditures relate primarily to our recently announced acquisition of a 49% interest in the ROC Group, which is the leading industrial gas company in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, and which also has a growing business in Qatar. Cash flow also funded dividends of $139 million and $54 million of net stock repurchases. After-tax return on capital was 14.7%, and return on equity was 26.4% for the quarter.
Please turn to Page 4 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.3 billion, 10% above prior year, due primarily to 7% volume growth. Higher cost pass-through, primarily higher natural gas prices, contractually passed through to our customers in hydrogen prices, increased sales by 3%. Sales to chemicals and metals customers were well above prior year and manufacturing showed nice improvement. Sequentially, sales volumes were flat with second quarter due to the mix. Merchant volumes were higher and packaged gases volumes were lower due to normal seasonality related to summer holidays. On-site volumes were modestly lower due to several seal [ph] and refining customer turnarounds.
On-site volumes were 7% above prior year driven by higher oxygen and nitrogen. Towards the end of the quarter, we started up the first hydrogen plant at BP's Whiting Refinery. Our hydrogen supply at this location will ramp up throughout 2011. This supply agreement is different than other hydrogen contract in that the natural gas feedstock is being supplied by the customer and not running through our income statement. Therefore, this contract will not add as much to our top line, but its very high margin sales.
Merchant volumes have continued to grow. Overall volumes grew 12% from prior year and 3% sequentially. Growth was broad based across all major products. Carbon dioxide was strong for seasonal food and beverage demand. Liquid sales were higher for gas well frac-ing activity related to a number of specific projects and technology testing sites. Merchant pricing trends are relatively flat year-over-year and sequentially, with some tailwind from recent price increase actions and some headwind from lower liquid hydrogen prices tied to natural gas.
Packaged gases volumes are improving more slowly. Volumes were 6% above prior year with growth led by hardgoods and some equipment sales, which is typical at the start of an economic recovery. Sequentially, packaged volumes are slightly lower as is customary in the third quarter due to summer holidays. 
Our business in Mexico is performing well, with volumes up 6% from prior year and continuing to improve sequentially. New project activity is increasing in the energy, steel and petrochem sectors, which bodes well for future growth. Pemex will continue to invest in energy production, and multinational corporations and local companies are investing in new production capacity for both domestic consumption and export.
Operating profit in North America was $314 million, 19% above prior year. Operating margin reflects good leverage from higher volumes, including the hydrogen plant start up. Please turn to Page 5 for our results in Europe.
Sales in Europe were $322 million. Excluding currency effects, sales were 10% above the prior year, driven by 7% organic volume growth. On-site merchant and packaged gases were all above 2009 levels in Germany, Italy and Spain. Merchant volumes showed the strongest growth this quarter, up 11%. Packaged gases are lagging in the recovery due to weak construction in met fab [metal fabrication] markets, particularly in Spain. 
Overall, slow positive sequential business trends continue, with Germany showing the most strength driven by exports, and Spain lagging in the economic recovery. This mix is evident in the operating profit, which was $59 million in the quarter compared to $68 million last year. Volumes have improved the most to our largest on-site and pipeline customers, some of whom were making high-margin take or pay payments last year and are now taking product. Packaged gases are higher margin and volumes have been slower to improve coming out of the downturn.
Currency effects, including a net income hedge loss this quarter combined with plant outages and expenses associated with the new business acquisitions also temporarily depressed operating profit and the margin percentage. In August, we announced the acquisition of a 49% ownership interest, but with 50% voting control of the ROC Group's businesses in the UAE, Kuwait and Qatar. This week, we announced a large on-site contract with United Steel in Bahrain. In addition, we have established a presence in two key industrial areas in Russia, and we announced this week a long-term oxygen contract for a steel company in the Volgograd region.
These investments followed several years of research and business development to identify the right locations, the best partners and the highest quality customers with whom to do business. The associated costs of establishing these footprints have been absorbed in our Europe segment, but we are now at the point of winning new business and realizing revenue and earnings growth, which we anticipate will accelerate in the future.
Page 6 summarizes our results in South America. Sales in South America were $506 million, up 16% from prior year. Currency appreciation increased sales by 4%. Underlying sales grew 12% from higher price and volume. On-site and merchant volumes have staged a strong recovery and are close to 2008 levels. Compared to last quarter, merchant and packaged gases have continued to grow, up 2% and 5%, respectively, in the quarter. On-site oxygen volumes weakened a bit, along with fuel production in Brazil due to the strengthening real. The Brazilian government has increased the IOF tax on financial investments coming into the country, what is referred to as the carry trade, in order to prevent the real from appreciating too far.
Operating profit of $117 million grew 24% from prior year, and the operating margin was 23.1%. The strong leverage was due to volume and pricing gains and productivity savings. Overall, we continue to be very bullish on growth prospects in South America. We expect our base business to continue to grow, and we are working on many new project proposals. We anticipate significant hydrogen opportunities with Petrobras, who is investing billions of dollars in upstream refining. These potential projects are large with long lead times. In addition, we are working on numerous other opportunities with fuel, chemical and other manufacturing customers. Our merchant and package businesses will grow with increasing domestic consumption and new gas applications which we bring to our customers.
Please look at Page 7 for our results in Asia. Asia sales of $287 million were 24% above prior year. Excluding the effects of currency and cost pass-through, which is primarily precious metals used in our physical vapor deposition targets business, sales grew primarily from 17% higher volumes. Volume growth came from new project start-ups in China and Korea and strong growth in merchant liquids. Our volumes in China are at record levels. 
India's volumes are 15% above prior year and up 4% from last quarter due to organic growth. Electronics has continued to be strong in Asia, though we are expecting growth to moderate next quarter and into 2011. Sales to the flat-panel display market have slowed down, but sales to the semiconductor manufacturers have held up, driven by handheld devices.
We had strong sales of PVD targets this quarter, particularly in Asia. The mix effect of electronic sales and lower xenon pricing, which primarily goes to the plasma market, accounts for the 2% lower price in the Asia segment this quarter. Pricing for merchant industrial gases is up year-over-year in both China and India.
Operating profit in the quarter was $38 million. The significant effect of cost pass-through this quarter reduced the operating margin by 170 basis points. We are also adding sales and engineering resources to support expected future growth. As an example of the new business we are winning, last week, we announced a new 1,700 ton air separation plant for Meishan Steel. This is a project which was deferred in the early days of the economic downturn. Based on the current growth outlook and new energy efficiency technologies we're working on, Meishan has expanded the original project scope and the plant will now come online in early 2012.
Page 8 shows our results for Surface Technologies. PST sales were $141 million this quarter, 8% above prior year, excluding currency effects and on par with last quarter. EBPVD jet engine coatings were strong and aviation coatings in U.S. and Asia improved from last quarter. Coatings for industrial gas turbines are below prior year due to lower new builds. Demand for coatings for oil field gate valve components grew. Operating profit of $23 million grew 28% from prior year and 5% from last quarter, showing strong operating leverage from higher volumes and productivity initiatives. Now I will turn this back to Jim to discuss what we're seeing in our global end markets and our fourth quarter earnings guidance."

This slide gives you our customary detail on sales growth to our major end markets compared to both prior year and to last quarter.

This slide gives you our customary detail on sales growth to our major end markets compared to both prior year and to last quarter. It shows an organic sales growth, excluding currency, cost pass-through and acquisition effects. Our sales in the energy markets are primarily refinery hydrogen. Our volumes from existing customers have been very steady. This quarter, we had a customer outage, which offset the positive contribution from the world scale plant we started up in Whiting, Indiana late in the quarter. 
We expect future growth to come primarily from new refinery investment in overseas markets for upgrading and new capacity. The potential number of new projects is very large and the size of these projects is large so we continue to see hydrogen as a significant growth driver for us. We also continue to be positive on new business opportunities related to enhanced oil recovery, and we are participating in a number of pilot projects around the world. 
Electronic sales were strong. Our sales were up 17% from last year, excluding the cost pass-through due to strong demand in Asia from semiconductor manufacturers and the flat-panel makers. As Liz mentioned earlier, our PVD's target sales have been strong in line with increased industry capacity utilization. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw demand from flat-panel manufacturers slow and we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter. The solar and LED markets should continue to provide good growth. Lower pricing of specialty gases continues to offset some of the volume growth.
Sales to chemical customers have continued to be very strong in the U.S., Germany and in Asia. Infrastructure investment and rising consumer demand in emerging markets and the economic recovery in the U.S. and Europe have all been supportive of chemical production, and low natural gas prices are really helping the U.S. producers. We believe that this end market will be one of the key drivers for new on-site projects overseas in the next several years.
Sales to metals were up sharply year-over-year. However, we did see a sequential slowdown this quarter due to the end of inventory restocking and a softening of order backlog at customers. As a result, several large customers took maintenance outages in the quarter. Global steel production in Q3 declined about 6% from the second quarter, but is forecasted to increase in the fourth quarter and we're seeing this already in China. Our outlook is for modest growth to continue in 2011.
Sales to manufacturing were 12% above 2009 and flat versus second quarter. The underlying trends are positive, stronger in emerging markets and slower and more choppy in the U.S. and Europe. Our sequential results reflect the normal seasonal decline in sales in Europe due to the summer holidays. Please turn to Page 10 for our fourth quarter earnings guidance.
Our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010 is for earnings per share to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.23. We expect to see modest sequential volume growth. Year-over-year comparisons will be more muted. At this point, we expect minimal currency effects. This therefore brings our 2010 full year earnings per share guidance on an adjusted basis to a range of $4.67 to $4.72, which is up 17% to 18% above our 2009 adjusted earnings of $3.99. This represents record earnings for Praxair and is significantly above our $4.20 peak earnings in 2008. We've achieved this even though our volumes are not fully past 2008 levels, primarily because of new projects coming on line, cost reduction and productivity, which have given us a good operating leverage on volumes as they recover.
So this should also indicate to you that as we go forward into 2011, there is still more leverage to come from our base business. We're expecting full year sales to be about $10 billion and full year capital spending to be in the area of $1.4 billion. We will begin specific earnings guidance for 2011 in January when we announce our fourth quarter earnings. But let me say a few words on our general outlook.
Our base business continues to improve. We expect the pace of growth to be slow, but steady in the U.S., Canada and in Europe where consumer spending is below pre-recession levels and where excess manufacturing capacity will mitigate the need of our customers to build new production facilities for several more years perhaps. We took a lot of cost out in these locations in the downturn and are being judicious and selective about adding them back. This is why we expect additional margin leverage as volumes continue to improve. 
We're very bullish about growth in the less developed emerging countries. And Praxair has what we believe to be the strongest footprint for profitable growth among our major competitors in the key countries. We expect to generate strong growth in Brazil, the other Latin American countries in South America, Mexico, China and India where our existing businesses are significant.
Our recently established platforms in the Middle East and Russia will add to this footprint for growth. These are all regions where the rising standard of living is driving increased consumer spending. This in turn drives investments in industrial and manufacturing infrastructure as well as in more energy production. These projects require significant amounts of industrial gas supply and the increasing trend of our customers to outsource our gas supply rather than buy and operate their own plant as the overall growth opportunity for us.
We therefore expect our project backlog to continue to grow. As these projects start up, they should contribute about 3% to 5% revenue growth per year. It will be a little bit lumpy quarter-by-quarter and year-by-year depending on the size of the projects, timing of start up and the capital-to-sales profile. We continue to be selective about which projects we work on and want to win, and these are ones where we see the opportunity to earn a nice spread above our cost of capital from an on-site contract, coupled with merchant liquid distribution. 
As our track record has shown, we will continue to focus on developing innovative application technologies for our customers and winning new on-site opportunities, combined with a relentless focus on capital discipline and productivity. This is key to producing double-digit earnings growth, which we expect to deliver for the foreseeable future. And now I will take your questions."

And the on-site business has picked up fairly significantly in most places because it was down a lot due to inventory destocking and then restocking. Merchant has begun to pick up in the second quarter here in the U.S., but we're still right around 80% capacity utilization, which is not a good number. We'd much rather be at 85% to 90%. And then Europe is perhaps the weakest, and we suffered in Europe, but not only excess capacity, but extremely competitive pricing over there. So I'm not sure how to answer the question in terms of leveraging to 2011. But as long as we continue to see the demand grow in the merchant and packaged gas businesses around the world, we'll get operating leverage from the incremental volume, plus I expect we'll move up to a tighter capacity utilization in terms of supply and demand balance where we'll be able to increase pricing the way we did in prior years."

And what we've done with that contract, and it's really our preferable way of business, is to essentially operate at the tolling agreement where we never pay for the natural gas and we don't invoice the natural gas to the customer. Consequently, it has less than half of sales as it would if we were buying natural gas and invoicing the customer for that, but at the same operating profit. So that would add to operating margin percentage, much more than it would add to sales. But doing the contract that way takes an element of risk out of the oil project since we don't stand in a purchase agreement of natural gas and the sales agreement of hydrogen."

So we're focused more on the chemicals and steel industry and mining industry. And the Volgograd region, south of Moscow, is where a lot of those chemical and steel plants are located, which we believe would offer the opportunity potentially someday to put in a pipeline enclave, but we would only build that customer-by-customer as we sign contracts. And then secondly, way out in the Ural Mountains is the primary mining area and there's a lot of chemical and steel production and heavy industry there as well. All of that is currently captive. All the Ural region, the Volgograd region is captive. And then the plants are extremely low efficiency, 30-year old Russian-designed plants, if you will.

I think people realize and have asked this question for a long time why are our margins in Asia lower than the rest of the world. And there are generally two reasons for that. One of them is, about 40% of our sales in Asia are in electronics with below 10% operating margins. And that tends to bring down the traditional industrial gases, which is more in the 20% range. Secondly, we've moved a lot of business expenses. We have actually moved our procurement organization to Shanghai, so that we can focus on low-cost country sourcing in China. So we'll be buying more equipment out of China and less out of Europe and the U.S. Currently, we're getting up close to about 80% of our equipment coming from China anticipating these China plant. Then on top of that, it was kind of a bad quarter for us because we had some plant outages and we had power cost increases in Korea, and then genuinely higher expenses elsewhere. So kind of as a rule of thumb, I think you could think of about, when these things are gone, kind of a getting the margin up close to 20%. So that would be about another $10 million of operating profit for the quarter."
