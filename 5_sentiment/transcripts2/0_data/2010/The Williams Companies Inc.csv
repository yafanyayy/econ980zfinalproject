As we've done in the last few quarter, Steve Malcolm will review a few slides. Be aware though, that all of our business unit heads and Don Chappel are available here to take questions which we will do right after Steve's remarks. Also as usual, we've put together our data book that includes the information that we typically provide each quarter. So, this morning, on our website williams.com, you should be able to find the slides, the data book and press releases that were issued earlier today. Those press releases are the release detailing our 2009 results as well as an additional release reporting our 2009 natural gas reserves.
Last evening, I'm sure you also saw the release announcing the completion of the asset contribution between Williams and Williams' Partners WPZ. I should note that post that transaction WPZ is a significant part of Williams. WPZ will be having their 2009 earnings call this morning at 10 a.m. Eastern. At that time WPZ management will be available to talk more about their results and their future. It might be worthwhile to tune in for that call as well.
At the beginning of the slide deck are the forward-looking statements and disclaimer on oil and gas reserves. Those are important and integral to our remarks, so you should review those. Also included are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those schedules are available and follow the presentation.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Malcolm.

Thank you for your continuing interest in our company and as Travis said we are going to use the same format that we've used in our last few earnings call. I will be the sole presenter but the entire team is on hand to answer any questions. We continue to get good feedback on that approach and we will continue it today.
So starting with slide 4, this slide talks a little bit about our 2009 results, recent developments, let me tick through the list here fairly quickly. 2009 recurring adjusted income was $552 million or $0.94 a share for 2009. I think most importantly we completed our asset contribution transaction with WPZ which is clearly designed to drive growth and value creation for our shareholders.
Our year end 3P US and International reserves are up 14%. We continue the expansion of our Marcellus Shale position with a new long-term agreement with a major producer which will expand our business in the Marcellus, allow us to construct a new 28 mile natural gas gathering pipeline which will move gas into Transco. Construction on that project is expected to begin in the latter part of 2010 and is expected to be placed into service during 2011. We also brought other expansion projects into service on Transco and Northwest. I am speaking here about the Sentinel Expansion Phase II which is a little over 100 million a day of additional capacity which went into service in the fourth quarter of '09.
The Colorado Hub Project which increases access to the Piceance Basin for our northwest pipeline customers that went into service, fourth quarter 2009. And our Eminence Storage Enhancement Project, which was placed into service in October 2009. As well, we recorded peak day delivery records on all three of our pipelines this winter. It's good to see that our pipes are getting a strong usage during peak days.
Next slide is slide five. This is a slide that investors have appreciated in the past and so I'll spend a few minutes on this slide. It shows the reconciliation of how our domestic reserves grew during the year. So starting with that first bar there, we ended last year with 4.34 Tcf of proved reserves. We added a 159 Bcf through the Piceance acquisition that we closed in the third quarter. Our wellhead production was 435 Bcf.
Then we go the next three bars, which show how the new SEC rules for reserves blow through our numbers, and so this year the rules call for using at the 12-month average price for the year rather than the year-end price and this resulted in a base in price of just over $3, which is a 33% drop from the price used for our year end 2008 proved reserved. And so at the lower price, we had 336 Bcf of price related revisions.
Also the new SEC rules are much more specific about what undeveloped locations can be counted as proved. The rules restrict development time to five years and require for the first time that we consider the conversion ratio of probable to proved locations in our drilling program. This rule requires we reclassify 496 Bcf from proved back to probable. On the plus side of the new SEC rules for the first time allow us to count undrilled locations that are more than 1 offset way from a producing well as proved where we have a reasonable certainty of production.
This allowed us to add 454 Bcf as shown on the next bar. We also added a net 570 Bcf of proved reserves through the drill bit. making our net proved reserves at the $3 price 4.255 Bcf. This is a very similar result as we've had the previous several years in spite of using a capital budget of about half the level from 2008 which reflects the strength of our overall 2009 drilling program. However since the 2009 price was unusually low and is much lower than current gas price expectations, the next couple of bars show important price sensitivities.
Our proved reserves are 4.581 Bcf. If we simply add a $1 to the SEC price, hence we get back almost all of our price-sensitive reserves at about $4 in the basin. That's an apples-to-apples comparison; our proved reserves using the same price that we used last year or $4.61 in the Rockies, our proved reserves are 4.632 Bcf. This constitutes 7% reserves growth in the year where we significantly reduced capital spending and 167% domestic reserves replacement. We reduced our three-year finding and development cost to $2.38 per Mcf and our one year drill bit only F&D was $1.53.
We were very pleased about this reserves performance which continues our multi-year trend of strong proved reserves growth and best quartile F&D costs. Looking at proved probable and possible reserves, the 3P side of the world, the story gets even better. We ended last year with 12.6 Tcf of domestic 3P reserves and have now grown that 14% to 14.4 Tcf of domestic 3P reserves.
Turning to slide six, I'm not going to spend much time on this slide. This just shows US and international reserves and I think the key takeaway here is that proved, probable and possible, 3P reserves are up 14% year-over-year.
Slide seven, yesterday we closed our $12 billion strategic transformational restructuring designed to drive growth in shareholder value. Clearly, it significantly accelerated our dropdown strategy and let me quickly run through the key points. This transaction created a large diversified MLP that has investment grade credit rating, much more reliable access to the market. It significantly increases our capital availability, improves I believe the competitiveness of our midstream and gas pipeline operations E&P and our Canadian projects will be funded from their own cash flows and WMB funds and WPZ distributions. 
Importantly, Williams is able to maintain scale, earnings, cash flows IDRs and control of the assets. This deal enhances our Williams growth profile and I think overall simplifies our corporate structure and creates a public marker in terms of having investors being able to value our company. 
The next slide I think shows that Williams and WPZ interests are clearly aligned. The moves that we've made result in two well capitalized entities that are better positioned to pursue value adding gross strategies. Certainly growth and projects at PZ lead to more value at Williams. And as you can see on the slide here, the ability of WPZ to fund the capital projects for its midstream and gas pipeline projects means that Williams can focus free cash flow on growth and diversification of our E&P portfolio. 
On the WPZ side, increased EBITDA and distributable cash flow translate into higher earnings per share for Williams, and as PZ increases its unit distributions, Williams receives more cash. And through William's significant ownership position in PZ, Williams will enjoy the value benefit of growth in PZ's unit price. 
Slide nine please; our guidance is unchanged, but just as a reminder, as you can see here, we expect that earnings growth will continue in a very strong fashion and yes, improving energy commodity prices do play a role in that earnings growth through 2011, but as you can see in these arrows in the lower left hand corner, we expect our earnings growth to be significantly greater than the improvement in commodity prices during that period. The green arrow shows 99% growth in our adjusted earnings per share from 2009 to 2011 and we don't need $100 oil, we don't need $10 gas in order to get there. You can see what assumptions that we're making with respect to crude oil prices and natural gas prices during the period and importantly the midpoint of our guidance range for 2011 moves us close to the record high earnings that we produced in 2008. 
So, clearly we're investing today in future growth. We have projects coming online this year and in the future that we expect to make significant contributions to our earnings growth. 
Slide ten, please. Here we take a look at what the 2009, 2011 growth looks like from a segment profit standpoint and overall we're expecting the increase our total recurring adjusted segment profit by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2011. We expect to see a greater than 100% growth in our E&P segment profit based on higher commodity prices and by 2011 increased production volumes, and in the WPZ and other course we're expecting increases there associated with the many growth projects that we're investing in over that time period. 
Slide 11, this slide shows the maintenance capital and growth capital for WPZ and E&P. This is a good reminder of the clear path that we have to our earnings growth. We're investing in excess of $3 billion in growth projects during 2010 and 2011 and I would remind you we're making investments with a continuing commitment to live within our means.
Slide 12, I am not going to spend much time on this slide. This type of slide is appreciated by investors as simply shows the specifics on some of the growth projects and growth CapEx that we'll be spending in 2010 and 2011 on WPZ and on E&P projects. You might be surprised when you see a fairly large number that shows up under the other category and I would just remind you that much of that capital is tied to the Canadian NGL pipeline which is a new 12 inch pipeline project that will transport NGLs and olefins from our extraction plant in Fort McMurry to our Redwater processing facility. It's expected that we'll be spending somewhere between $275 and $300 million on that project, constructed using cash previously generated from our Canadian operations or other international projects and the construction is expected to begin in November of 2010 with an anticipated in-service date in the second quarter of 2012.
Slide 13, the next few slides offer detailed comments on growth projects within all three of our business units, and I'll start with some comments on E&P and certainly in the E&P space most of our capital, most of our growth will be focused in the Piceance space, and so it's always worthwhile to emphasize the value creating strength of our Piceance space and strategy. Clearly, this is a world class resource. The drilling economics are Shale play strong. 
I've got my next slide talks a little bit about the typical well economics for a Valley well and just to foreshadow for you, the returns that we're looking at after tax returns based on current prices, current costs and the current basis differential. We're looking at after tax returns in the 53% range. So clearly, this is a world class resource that has drilling economics that match those that people are talking about in the various Shale plays as well our cost are low. We have a track record of high returns. We enjoy that benefits of scale. You know that there is extensive infrastructure in place including our own gathering, processing and pipeline assets and compare that please to the extensive investment that's still needed in some of those new Shale plays. 
So we expect to grow production. Our capital guidance numbers deliver about 12% production growth in 2011, but as the last bullet mentions, we are poised as we check sign posts along the way along the way, as we see what futures prices are doing and as we get through the heating season, we are poised to begin to accelerate our drilling activities by mid year and such an acceleration could if we decide to proceeded with that, could increase our production growth to back to the 20% range by 2011. You know we've been at that rate in the past and I think this demonstrates our ability to ramp up quickly if the commodity prices are attractive. 
I mentioned earlier next slide 14 is an update of our typical well economics for Piceance Valley well. I think we talked about this during our May call and just to compare the numbers, our net cash to margin back when we talked about this in May was $2.60, our after tax IRRs were 28% and you can see we now are looking at a net cash margin of $3.45, after tax returns north of 50% and it is simply a case of higher prices, lower basis differential translating into higher returns for a typical well in the Piceance Valley.
Slide 15 please. This just highlights some of the strategic growth projects in the midstream space. Obviously we are very excited about expanding our footprint in the Marcellus. Of course, we did the Laurel Mountain JV in 2009. We have expanded upon that with what we are calling the Springville Project which I described earlier which expands our business in the Marcellus has us building a 28 mile natural gas gathering pipeline from a central delivery point in Susquehanna County Pa to Transco in Luzerne County, Pa, a 20-inch pipeline which is expected be placed into service in 2011. Other major PZ projects, Perdido Norte we are expecting to begin contributing to segment profit in mid 2010. Wamsutter TXP4, we expect to bring in additional 350 million a day of processing capacity onstream at our Echo Springs plant in late 2010, and the Willow Creek will be enjoying a full year of operations at Willow Creek. We achieved full processing operations in September of 2009 and are currently recovering up to 20,000 barrels of NGLs at that facility.
Slide 16 please, gives a quick overview of all of the projects that we have in the gas pipeline space. We continue to receive long-term customer support to expand our footprint, along Transco, along North West pipeline and along Gulfstream. I would remind you the blue box projects are in guidance, the grey box projects are not in guidance and some of the more significant projects noted here are the 85 North Expansion is a $240 million expansion from Station 85 North to zones four and five adding over $300 million a day of capacity, that will be a two phase project going into service in mid 2010 and mid 2011.
We have the Rockaway Lateral which is $120 million Lateral into National Grid's Distribution System in New York. The Mid-South project, a $195 million expansion from Station 85 to points North. So a lot of exciting projects and again all of these are backed by a long-term customer support.
I am going to pause here for a minute in terms of my slides and go through some Q&A we did last time and deemed to play well, but we have been getting some questions from investors and some of the common themes of those questions I might cover right now, there have been a lot of questions on drilling cost on the Piceance side. We had the ability to lock-in any of the costs and as I am sure you are well aware of the cost for drilling and completion came down in 2009 and we have made efforts to try to contain future increases for 2010 and some of the success that we've had, we have locked in day rate costs for all of our rigs through 2010 in the $16,000 to $17000 per day range and I would remind you that about $2000 to $4000 a day lower than the average rates in 2009.
Pumping service costs for cement and stimulation are also under price agreements through 2010. Other key service costs such as mud, water handling, rentals, construction, these are all looking to stay flat with 2009 based on discussions with many of our vendors, probably the only area where we are seeing some upward price pressure is on steel costs. We have also had a lot of questions about midstream economics with people who have recognized that economics are very strong right now and they have been asking what's outlook for the future and so you are absolutely correct.
Our realized margin has risen from a three year low of less than $0.20 in the first quarter of 2009 to more than $0.50 in the fourth quarter of 2009 and given the current market and our assumptions about commodity relationships, the 2010 and 2011 margin should easily surpass what was achieved on average for all of 2009 and could even exceed the high point that we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2009.
We also continue to be very pleased and optimistic regarding demand for our NGLs and the resulting NGL margins. Ethane demand in the US pet-chem industry averaged in excess of 900,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2009 and this is a new record high for demand on a quarterly average basis. We continue to expect to see demand stay high as the global oiled gas relationships continue to place the US pet-chem industry in a very competitive position globally as well as the continued conversion to a more light-end feedstock slate. 
NGL inventories continue to get worked off as the combination of gas plant production and other sources are not able to keep up with demand, and so this inventory work-off will continue to put strength around our NGL pricing complex as has been recently exhibited in the NGL to oil ratio which is now exceeding 60% on a composite basis versus a year ago's quarterly average of about 55%. 
So let me turn now to our concluding slide I think its slide 17. This shows just the key takeaways around the theme that Williams is a winning long term investment. Certainly as we have gone through the slide deck here, I hope you believe that we have a wealth of value creating growth opportunities which lead to the sustained growth ahead as reflected in our 2010 and 2011 guidance. The transformational transaction will clearly help fuel that growth. The integrated businesses, the integrated model I believe gives us a competitive advantage particularly as we intend to increase our footprint in the Marcellus. I believe that we are able to offer producer, customers a more comprehensive midstream pipeline in gas marketing solution to their service needs. 
The Piceance basin is a world-class resource continues to performance very positively and I think I would refer you back to the very attractive value returns that are reflective on that slide. 
We are committed to financial discipline as we grow. We've achieved investment grade ratings, we intend to keep those ratings and I think the final point we expect 2011 earnings per share to be double our 2009 performance. 
So with that, we will be delighted to take your question.

Really the way that works is about 80% of that was in the Highlands and the way that truly works is, its very complicated but in the past basically it was in our drilling program, it basically counted as approved and developed and we were able to count that. Not if it's in the drilling program but it might be a probable location because we haven't taken advantage yet of the Highlands and the one-off rule. We were only able to book the [part] side of that world. So most of that was in the Highlands and the interesting thing about the Highlands as we increased our drilling program which were in the process of drilling went from one rig last year, we're going to be at four. In August as Steve mentioned, we may pull the trigger and do some more.
As we prove out more in that field and actually what we call triangulate some of these areas, the one-off rule could be a very big thing for us in Highlands since we have over five Tcf of problem possible in the area. So we look for that one-off rule to be a tremendous advantage for us in this five year limit to be a one-time disadvantage and we look forward to the opportunity to continue to drill, delineate the rest of that field, triangulate around that areas where we can call more than one offset and really take advantage of over 5 Tcf of problems and possibles. 
And in terms of the second part of your question, what kind of price points we're looking for. I mean there continues to be a great deal of uncertainty with respect to where prices are headed. We've been delighted by the winter, we have been delighted by the fact that storage inventories have been pulled down, but there remains uncertainty. I think people are trying to figure out the EIA supply data, trying to understand to what extent we have seen deliverability reductions, but I think the short answer would be if we get through the heating season and futures prices continue to be strong, particularly strong to the point where we are still able to capture the kinds of well economics that are shown for a typical Piceance Valley well, I think that under those circumstances we would want to accelerate our drilling activities in the Piceance.

I do think that we do bring to the table as Steve mentioned a very strong William story to the Marcellus. If you think about it, obviously E&P expertise that we have, our midstream expertise and the need, a desperate need for some midstream solutions up there. Transco runs right through the heart of the play and then our gas marketing people have been very successful in helping out in some of the ventures we have going and actually taking the producers staff and market it for them.
So we are looking at it from E&P, from a three-pronged approach, that really Williams is looking at from a four-prong approach, so we think we have a great Marcellus story and we are getting a lot of good feedback on it and a lot of good meetings held, so hopefully we will see some success with those conversations we are having

So just some good surprises, they are not surprises but just good timing of those things coming on. For 2010 essentially the plan and the guidance you've seen so far as it just basically shows like flat production for '10 and then growing to about 11% to 12% in '11 and that goes into what Steve talks about that to the extent we get back in the field earlier. We obviously plan to have a go from 12 to 22 rigs for example in the Piceance from 2010 to 2011 and you see that kind of growth as we come out with good strong prices. One of the goals would be to get into the field quicker than we are right now and since start adding rigs earlier than what the current plan has. So if we do that then we can have stronger production growth.

Steve Malcolm will be doing the presentation then we will review the few slides that we have. Be aware though, that all of our business unit heads are here and available for questions that will take right after Steve's comments. Also as usual, we've put together our data book which includes the normal information we provide each quarter. So, this morning, on the website williams.com, you should be able to find the slides, the data book, the press releases and the 10-Q, which was filed this morning as well. 
At the beginning of the slide deck is the forward-looking statements on slide number two and the disclaimer on oil and gas reserves on slide number three. Those are important and integral to our remarks this morning, so please review those. Also included are various non-GAAP numbers which have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those schedules are available and follow the presentation.
As I suspect the call today should be rather brief because as you know we will be hosting the Analyst day in New York next Tuesday. At that time, all of our senior management will be there to go into a much more robust look at each of our businesses.

Welcome to our first quarter call. Thank you for your interest in our company, and as Travis mentioned our discussion today should be very crisp as we are looking forward to our analyst and investor day next week in New York, and at that we will be talking more about strategies and tactics and the various growth opportunities at that meeting. 
So, this would be pretty quick, so looking at the first slide, slide four. A few of our first quarter results and accomplishments of course, first quarter recurring adjusted earnings per share is $0.36, which is up 64% over the first quarter of '09 results as well recurring segment profit of $589 million; it's 43% higher than our ' 09, first quarter. 
We increased our quarterly dividend by 14%. Of course, we completed our transformational transaction, which created a much larger WPZ. We've grown our position to Marcellus by adding another 11,000 acres in Columbia County, Pennsylvania, which brings our total acreage position in the Marcellus to above 45,000 acreage at a weighted average cost of about $2800 per acre. 
Began startup operations at Perdido Norte in the Western deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and I believe on Monday of this week we brought Transco's Mobile South expansion project into service adding deliverability to Southern markets. 
Turning to slide five, we are offering guidance for 2012 for the first time, but this shows that we are all about returning to significant value creation. Let me go through the prior guidance here. In 2010, our prior guidance mid-point was $1.35 you see here were to $1.28, and that's driven by obviously changes in our commodity price assumptions. 
Crude oil from $75 to $80, but Henry Hub nat gas from $575 to $450, and so that creates the change that we're reflecting here. As well, in 2011, $1.83 versus $1.87, driven by an increase in crude oil prices from $80 to $86, but nat gas going from $650 to $550. 
And then we're showing for the first time again, mid-point guidance for 2012 of $2.38, that all represents about a 36% CAGR with respect to our earnings per share. Slide six, please, shows the higher segment profit growth and shows the relative contributions by WPZ and our E&P business. 
And overall, you see a 78% increase in total recurring adjusted segment profit over this period of time. Slide seven, we've talked about our many growth opportunities, and as you see here, we're expecting to invest over $5 billion in growth in the 2010, 2012 timeframe. This slide is one that the investors are appreciative of, in that we do break out our capital by business unit and by category -- capital for maintenance of facilities, capital for maintenance of volumes and growth projects. 
So, obviously, a lot of wonderful, exciting growth opportunities during this three year timeframe. Slide eight just gives you -- reminds you of our premier E&P portfolio, anchored by our position in the Piceance. And we are a proven optimizer of resource plays; year-after-year, a leader in terms of costs. We believe that the Piceance is competitive with the best of the Shale plays. 
And I think we have a unique portfolio that allows us to ramp-up or ramp-down, depending on the price signals that the market is offering. Slide nine; if you look at all three of our business units, probably there are more growth opportunities in the midstream space. And again, we'll talk more about these in New York next week, but looking at this map, we have the growth opportunities in our traditional basins. 
Out West, we have Wamsutter TXP4 or Echo Springs TXP4, adding about 350 million a day of processing capacity, which will come on in late 2010. We have the Paradox Basin, where we continue to build toward a large scale midstream solution for producers in this promising basin. And then we're looking forward to a full year benefit of the Willow Creek facility, which is a course of 450 cubic foot per day processing facility. 
In the Gulf, Perdido Norte went into operation in late first quarter 2010, and so we'll be getting the benefit of that project. Probably the most exciting opportunities are in the Marcellus, and there we -- of course, done the Laurel Mountain Midstream, LLC. We've done the Springville project, but we just have a lot more opportunities, as producers seek to focus their resources on their E&P activities and in many cases, they are looking to outsource some of their midstream requirements. 
Slide 10 just gives you the universe of gas pipeline projects, and there are a lot of base hits here, obviously, and the outlook is excellent for steady, stable cash flows backed by customers with high quality credit. So, this is a business where you won't see us taking big risks, but all of these projects are backed by our customers. Before I conclude, let me cover a couple of questions that we have received from investors over the last couple of weeks. 
One relates to the Gulf of Mexico situation. Are we faced with any potential exposure to the efforts to clean up the oil slick? Is our production impacted in any way? And the simple answer is no. Our assets have not been affected by loss of production, have not been affected by the spill, have not been affected by any of the cleanup activities, and we have no reason to believe that they will. 
The BP platform was the drilling platform that was not connected to any infrastructure. We don't anticipate any problems related to the spill. We did limit work on Canyon Station just as a precaution, but again, we don't see any impact to our operations in the Gulf. As well, there have been questions about the WMC Exchange Offer, any updates there on timing? 
And I would just say, again, that representatives of Williams and WPZ have commenced discussions with representatives of the Conflicts Committee, of the Board of Directors of the WMZ general partner regarding the exchange offer at the ratio that was discussed earlier. And the parties are considering structural alternatives for completion of the exchange in a single transaction, including without limitation, a potential merger transaction. 
So, we're still moving ahead. We would expect a second quarter kind of close. It could slip into third quarter, but I think it will still be done on the basis that we've essentially described to you in the past. Concluding then on slide 11, we do believe that Williams is a winning value creator, and I think the key points for you to have in mind -- we've never seen as many growth opportunities that we are seeing today. Those will clearly generate value for the Company. 
And I think the fact that we have gone forward with the structural transformation that we closed earlier in the first quarter will ensure that we're able to capture these many growth opportunities. The integrated business model is working well for us. The Piceance Basin, where our production is over 600 million a day, is a world class resource, as good as any of the Shale plays. We are committed to going forward in a very disciplined manner, and a strong growth outlook, and we expect 2012 recurring adjusted earnings per share to exceed our record 2008 results. 
So with that, we look forward to seeing you next week and I'll be happy to take any questions that you have this morning.

Well, from the E&P perspective we do like the Eagle Ford. We've looked at in a number of opportunities there and continued to do that. So, w will obviously if we can put something there that makes good economic sense. We'd like to be there. 
Alan Armstrong
On the midstream side, we've got a real opportunity there right now with our Markham that we just completed the expansion on, and we have frac capacity, transport capacity out of that plant as well. So, pretty rare situation there what we've got available capacity that we basically would just be pushing out some very lean offshore volumes that are coming into Markham today, and that so we would have space available for the Eagle Ford and we're working with other pipeline including Transco to see what other capabilities are there to get that gas transported and accessed through the Eagle Ford. So, the McMullen lateral that Transco has is very well positioned right along there, and so we think we got some great opportunities and some competitive advantage there in that base.

You kind of put out there on the table the range of some things that are possible, but I would take off the table the variability on like basis differentials and interruptible because on the down side, about the only spot we have that's vulnerable to that is in the production area on Transco under the IT Feed rate. And we've got a pretty healthy decline baked into our forecast on the interruptible in that end, but it's only a modest piece of the total cost of service on Transco. 
Just for round numbers, in the ballpark of $60 million, $66 million. So it's not a huge part of the cost to service on Transco. On the upside, it will be a successful completion of growth projects, and so we'll have expansions that will bump that up along the way. And then we're always seeking opportunities to achieve better outcomes on our costs. But we'll just have to take a look at that. We have to come back in for rate cases in 2013 on both Northwest and Transco. We have come back provisions on both of those.

Don Chappel 
This is Don Chappel. Good morning. Well, as you know, we did not increase the dividend in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis and recession. Following the WPZ transformation, and the very stable business and the growth that we enjoy from WPZ and the growing distribution, we felt that an increase in the dividend was appropriate, and we thought at a level that was exceeding the level of increase that we passed on, back in the 2007, 2008 period. So that's how we're thinking about it. 
I think it will be a function of those reliable cash flows coming up from WPZ as well as alternative uses of cash. But I do believe Steve and the Board also agree that dividend is an important part of the total picture for our investors. So, I'm not sure if that helps. We don't have a formula, but we are committed to the dividend and increasing the dividend over time.

Alan, we've seen a lot of producers, most recently, Chesapeake yesterday, talking about shifting quite a bit of their capital from gas toward liquids. What is your thought on this change, and just really as far as kind of the potential impact towards the liquids market?
Alan Armstrong
Right. Well, certainly, NGL margins are very beneficial to producers today and adding a lot of value. But I would certainly say in the case where they're going into new exploration areas like Chesapeake announced that that's a long ways away from actually producing NGLs into the market. And a lot of things will change over time by the time those NGLs get into the market. So, there's a lot of infrastructure. 
The Marcellus is a great example of that, where a lot of rich gas, but we're a long ways away from having the infrastructure available to get those NGLs into the market. And so I think over time, I think if we continue to see high margins, we should continue to see NGL supplies increase. And on the heavier's end, I don't see that being a big problem because as long as crude to gas ratios remain where they are, that will still be a favored product in terms of and gasoline into those markets. 
On the ethane side, we certainly would have to see some expansion in market. We're seeing that today through conversion of heavy and cracking capacity, but eventually, there's a limit to that. Our hope, obviously, would be that we see an opportunity to long-term to expand demand in the U.S. on the petchem side, if those NGLs continue to be such favored relative to naphtha and other products that are cracked globally. 
So, certainly though, I would say the fundamentals are that we've got strong margins. We should expect supply to be chasing that margin, and I think that's what we'll see for some period of time.

On the other hand, as prices go down, we have the ability to pull back on our drilling so as not to suck too much cash in a low price environment and negatively affect our ratings. So the ratings agencies, I will tell you are very focused, not just on Williams, but all companies in the E&P space as well as more broadly in terms of outspending your operating cash flows in the E&P side of the business. 
So not to say that it can't be done, but certainly the credit agencies are very focused on that, and so we tend to flex our production up in the period of high prices and down in the period of low prices, so that our Capex tends to match our operating cash flows.

Again, I would say, and I've said this before that our credit metrics are not where we'd like to see them today in light of the low gas price environment. And certainly a stock buyback, if that's the code, would be off the table in terms of our rating. So it really gets down to the extent that we reinvest in good assets in the business, that tends to be a credit positive. But if we take the cash off the balance sheet and buy back stock, that's a bad credit answer.

We really like it in that. It's created a large-scale MLP that will have access to low cost capital, and that's going to let us capture the many growth opportunities that we see before us. 
I think Andrew that, again, as we continue to execute on the plan, as we continue to grow PZ, as we grow the distributions, I think that people will see how attractive the cash flow movement is to Williams. And I really think that there are some investors who are sitting on the sidelines saying, okay, let's see how Williams and how PZ execute on this plan. So, I'm still very excited and optimistic about the new structure. And I think, over time, that it will translate into very good things for Williams and its shareholders.

Let's jump right into the slides and I'll start here on slide five. I am most pleased with our ability to strategically expand our business lines during the quarter.
As you know, we completed a major E&P acquisition at the Williams level that establishes a significant and growing position in the Marcellus, we now have just under 100,000 acres there. And Williams' partners just recently announced two major Midstream business expansions, the increased stake at Overland Pass and the new cryo plant at Parachute. So continuing with the highlights, second quarter recurring adjusted EPS was up 35% versus the second quarter of '09 on the strength of higher NGL and olefin margins.
We've kind of passed over the breakover point in terms of production growth. I think second quarter production marks a resumption of the expected growth and you can see we're expecting 12% in '11 and 16% in 2012, while we live within our drilling cash flows. We are expanding our Marcellus position in all lines of business. The business development opportunities are extraordinary. We are benefiting from increases in the Williams Partners distributions, what is good for WPZ is good for Williams and we've increased some of our cash flow certainty with some new E&P hedges. We've taken some of the risk off the table. As you know, we're 64% hedged in 2010 from a revenue standpoint. We've increased our hedge position in 2011 from 30% to 50% during the quarter.
Turning to slide six, please - certainly a consistent theme that we have presented really over the past few years is the attractive, organic growth opportunities that exist at Williams and that's certainly reflected on this slide, one that you've seen before but which shows for the 2010-2012 timeframe, the capital intended to be spent on maintenance of facilities, on maintenance of volumes and for growth by business unit. I don't think I need to say anything more about this. Again, it shows $6 billion in growth during that timeframe. I would like to make one comment and this is the only comment I'll make about Canada, but you see the yellow growth capital in 2011 and 2012. It's fairly significant and most of that that's shown in yellow is associated with three specific projects in Canada, again continuing to take advantage of our first mover technological advantage that we have up in Canada.
Turning to page seven, please, or slide seven, continuing to talk about the theme of growth and this, of course, talks about our E&P production growth during the period. We have adopted a very disciplined approach. We are living within our cash flows until such time as we see the macroclimate improve but even though we're living within our cash flows, we are growing production at 30% over this timeframe.
You'll also note that Marcellus is becoming a bigger part of the mix. We expect to drill 100 wells in the Marcellus in 2011, running about eight rigs, close to 200 wells in 2012 as we run 14 rigs. So, clearly, Marcellus is becoming a bigger part of our mix. By 2013, it will be our second largest producing basin, by 2015, we would expect that Marcellus would be producing in excess of 500 million a day. As well, the Piceance will continue to be our low-cost workhorse basin that continues to generate very strong returns.
Slide eight, please. Continuing again to talk about growth and here we are talking about WPZ Midstream growth. You've seen this slide before. The slices of the pie there show where we will be spending our capital and I think there are just three points that I want to make here. Overland Pass and Parachute capital is now in the guidance pie chart.
Secondly, that when you look at the potential spending in each of the categories, obviously, the activity, the business development activity, continues to be very robust. And we would expect that you would see continued growth in the Marcellus, out West, where we already have a very significant position and we continue to be excited with respect to deepwater Gulf opportunities.
Slide nine, please. Again, the WPZ Gas Pipeline growth. You've seen this slide before. This talks about the base hits approach that we've used in gas pipes, where all of our projects are backed by long-term commitments with creditworthy customers and so this slide simply shows the $1.3 billion worth of inventory that we have associated with our gas pipeline projects. A few updates - projects placed into service.
The 85 North Phase 1 and Mobile Bay South projects in service now. Under construction now, the Sundance Trail. FERC certificates received with respect to the Pascagoula expansion and the Mobile Bay South 2 project, precedent agreements executed on the Midsouth expansion and I'm referring there to the remaining capacity and as well on the Cardinal expansion. And we have an open season ongoing with respect to the Opal Market Link project. So, a lot of activity - bite-sized in nature, although some of the projects, like Northeast Supply Link, which is a $307 million project and the Midsouth expansion, a $214 million project, are fairly large in terms of capital spending.
The next few slides I will endeavor to answer some of the questions that we receive most often from investors as I'm out talking, as other officers are out talking or our questions that we're receiving in IR by telephone. But the first one here relates to the slide 10 now - questions asking for more specifics about what's going on in the Marcellus. We've talked about all of the very exciting opportunities that we have there and so let me run through quickly some of the details.
As you know, from an E&P perspective, we're approaching now 100,000 acres in the Marcellus. We doubled our E&P lease acreage with the most recent acquisition. Our all-in costs for the now-97,000 acres we hold is just under $7,000 an acre. With respect to the Rex JV, 12 wells have been drilled under that JV, seven wells are now producing, we have one rig operating. Since we took over operation earlier this year, we've drilled one well. That's the Westmoreland County Slavic Trust Well and it appears to be our best well, flowing approximately 4.9 million a day on a 30-day test.
We would note that the 70,000 of our 97,000 acres are not part of the JV. We are ramping up our drilling activity. We're adding rigs. We just signed a contract for two additional fit-for-purpose rigs, one comes to us in late August; the other in February of 2011. The first rig will likely be employed in the Rex JV area; the second in the Susquehanna area. With respect to Midstream, the opportunities really here are special. We have the huge JV with Atlas, which clearly was enhanced by the Reliance deal, which is going to allocate more drilling capital near-term.
Springville is just proceeding. We may even upside this pipeline depending on business demand. There's a lot of business around the system. We're talking with many other players. I think this project will be a catalyst for other deals. You see a new green dot on the slide there, which shows the location of our Shamrock compressor station. This will likely be a central facility for us and will be the largest delivery point out of the system - out of the Atlas gathering system or the LMM system. We're building or expanding 11 compressor stations in support of Atlas' ultimate production targets and third-party growth opportunities. So a lot going on with respect to the JV with Atlas.
But in addition to that, we've talked about the fact that we have 30 confidentiality agreements, we have identified 80 prospects, a lot of deal activity. We continue to work with a number of large parties in the Northeast, Pennsylvania area around significant gathering stepouts. We continue to offer producers a short-term blending opportunity for their ethane. We think that makes a lot of sense near-term. So, a lot of activity, a lot of excitement, probably so much activity that we may need another General Manager to handle the level of activity in the area. In terms of Gas Pipeline, we show two potential projects here, the Keystone Connector and the Northeast Supply Link, both shown on the map. These continue, I believe, to be viable pipeline projects and we continue to talk with shippers.
Slide 11 is designed to answer the question. Are you going to exercise your option with respect to Overland Pass Pipeline? And obviously, we answered that earlier this week when we went forward with a press release announcing that we were increasing our interest to 50%. We do have an option to operate there. This is a $425 million transaction. The pipeline is nearly full now. It's expandable to 255,000 barrels. You see some of the announced expansion shown at the bottom of this chart.
I would say these are the ones that have been announced thus far. We certainly expect more opportunity to expand beyond this and in fact, I would be disappointed if we don't see more expansions occurring during the near-term. This is clearly a strategic pipeline for us. You look at current volumes flowing and about 60% of those are associated with Williams Midstream and E&P businesses.
Slide 12, what's happening with the Rockies basis, is a question that we have been receiving here recently. Certainly, we've seen the Rockies basis forward market for '11 and '12 move to about $0.50. We think the recent moves had to do with unusual weather, on excess hydro, on regional transportation issues but again, as we've pointed out in the past, I think the key is that E&P's exposure on a revenue basis is very modest, some might say de minimis. As a result of the transportation options that we have and the hedging that we've done and so you can see in 2010 that the exposure is about 5%; 2011, it's about 12% and we would expect to bring down the 28% in 2012 as we are successful with more hedging. I would also point out the fact that PZ Midstream benefits from the Rockies basis differential and I would encourage you to look at the data book, which we have a slide in the data book which shows our commodity exposure and we are, clearly, with respect to Rockies exposure, we're flat gas and - for the balance of 2010 and 2011.
So, turning to slide 13, a lot of questions about the impact of the moratorium on WPZ and again, you can see that we have tried to give you some numbers associated with the estimated financial effect of a six-month drilling moratorium and a one-year moratorium. As you can see, our expectation is that the moratorium shouldn't last much longer than six months and the 2011 effect is about 2% of expected WPZ segment profit in DD&A, a one-year moratorium effect would be less than 4%.
Looking at slide 14, we could probably speak at length here. I'll try to summarize my comments here and we can go into this in more detail in the Q&A session if you would like. But we have had a lot of questions about, well, what happened with NGL and methane prices in the second quarter? What's your short-term outlook? What's your long-term outlook? So let me just organize my thoughts and comments around each of those three main categories. And so in terms of what happened second-quarter versus first-quarter, we saw a steep decline in ethane margins during the second quarter.
The primary contributors toward these ethane margins were several outages that went on longer than expected at ethylene plants, which dramatically reduced ethane and EP mix consumption, particularly in the Midwest and so the bottleneck for ethane was ethylene cracking capacity during the second quarter. The ethane price decline was not caused by lack of demand for ethylene as evidenced by the very strong margins that we experienced at Williams' Geismar ethylene facility during the second quarter.
What I would point out here that, due to Williams' acquisition of BASF's capacity two years ago at Geismar that we continue to consume about half of our ethane exposure at our ethylene cracking facility at Geismar. So, the lower ethane margins were partially compensated for, during the quarter by the higher ethylene margins that we were able to capture at Geismar.
So, turning now to a few comments about the short-term outlook. We believe the fundamentals continue to be very strong for near-term ethane demand as ethane is maintaining its favorable position in being the low-cost feedstock for ethylene production. We are seeing EP storage at Conway is being drawn down to more normal levels as the Midwest ethylene plants have returned to service. Large supplies of ethane from the shale plays require significant infrastructure.
So we are not going to see the ethane production from some of these shale plays occur overnight. A great example of that is the Bakken infrastructure project that was announced by ONEOK recently. That's going to take three years before the planned startup. So we see very strong ethylene margins, likely incenting plants to invest in small plant expansions and certainly, Williams has a very low-cost expansion investment going on at Geismar right now, which is an example of that - the actions that the plants may take.
Longer-term - longer-term outlook, we believe that the U.S. right now holds a large advantage for being the next low-cost tranche of ethylene production, given the abundant natural gas supplies and we believe the U.S. should be in a strong position to export its ethylene derivative products at a lower cost than incremental production elsewhere in the world. I think the key question long-term will be, will ethylene capacity be expanded to keep pace with increased NGL supplies here in the U.S. and given the current high ethane to ethylene spreads that exist, we think, ultimately, that conversions and low-cost capacity increases will, in fact, happen.
Slide 15 just graphically shows you what margins have done over the last few quarters. We have seen strong NGL margins in recent quarters. They came back in the second quarter but again our expectation is they will continue to be very strong relative to historical averages.
Page 16, slide 16, the financial guidance update. In terms of earnings guidance, our 2010 midpoint is moving down a nickel to $1.23 on lower NGL margins and a delay with respect to the Perdido Norte startup. 2011 and '12 are unchanged.
With respect to capital, 2010 capital is increased for acquisitions, the Marcellus acreage and the Overland Pass pipeline interest and in 2011, capital is increased for the Parachute processing expansion that we talked about earlier. 2012 consolidated shows little change.
Slide 17, we introduced the slide on 17 and 18 at our Investor Day meeting. These are the 2010 priorities for value creation, things that we need to do well during the year; things that we need to execute crisply around, in order to have a very successful year and so with respect to infrastructure projects, bringing those online, we now have construction completed on five of the projects that are checked here. We continue to make progress with respect to maximizing growth in the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford. We have already talked about some of those opportunities.
On slide 18, we have been successful in initiating growth in the West where we already have a significant position. I'm speaking there about the Parachute cryo and with respect to the WPZ merger with WMZ, just point out that on August 31, the WMZ unit holders will vote to approve the proposed merger.
Proxy materials have been sent to unit holders. The record date is July 15. A majority vote of the outstanding WMZ units not held by Williams affiliates is required for approval and assuming unit holder approval, we intend to close the merger transaction shortly after that special meeting.
Slide 19, why Williams is a winning investment. We continue to believe that we have the superior assets. We have the very exciting growth opportunities. We have the balance sheet and the discipline to create significant future value for our shareholders. So with that, I will - we'll move into the Q&A session. Thank you.

Last year, we actually did cut our budget severely to save even more than that. So bottom line is, it's just a function of what we're - how much we're drilling now that we've gone to nine rigs in the Valley and four rigs in the Highlands. When the breakover point hits, which it's hitting now, the volumes start to expand rapidly and that's what we expect will happen.
So what you really see is the effect of going from basically 28 rigs down to eight and now we're at 13. And we're just starting to - as we move back up from above eight, you'll see that the volumes will start to take off. Other areas such as Powder River, our partners had a delay in the dewatering process of their volumes and that's caused the Powder River to not come on as fast as we would like that to come and then you'll see, as Steve mentioned here, in the near future, as we start to add in the Marcellus and start to drill out the acreage that we already have, the 97,000 acres, you'll see a rapid growth in the Marcellus volumes.

Second is the Canadian assets. The Canadian assets are relatively modest in size today but growing very rapidly.

So, I think we're several years away from considering the possibility of a drop-down.

In the ensuing period of time, one of the advantages we think we have is that we have a lot of blending capability and to the extent that it takes awhile to ramp up, to have ample liquids coming through, we have capacity to handle that as long as the heavies are knocked out in the southwest end. So, literally, we are evaluating the range of alternatives there and will optimize and select the most flexible one but we think that, again, an advantage is that we'll be able to ramp into that decision with more cards onto the table in the way of knowing exactly how much volume we're talking about, when it's going to come online and an ability to deal with a lot of liquids in the ensuing period of time.

On the Highlands, returns are slightly lower than the Valley because the Highlands by definition has a couple extra thousand feet to drill through before we get to the level where you start in the Valley. So going forward, I think that you'll see that the Valley and the Marcellus will be side-by-side in the capital allocations followed thereafter by the Piceance Highlands. So capital allocation-wise, I think living within our cash flows, we feel we can ably execute on all three of those areas without hurting one or the other or trying to disadvantage one over the other.

Maybe we need to do a little bit more than what we're doing here and find somebody else. So since we're in the area in a major effort and based on the expertise we've developed in doing a world-class resource play like the Piceance, we hope that we can talk with some of those producers and maybe do some additional JVs and other things to expand our position or continue with what we've done in the past, which is grassroots leasing and/or acquisitions. I will say all that saying, as I look at Don Chappel, that we will do that in a very disciplined manner and we're going to make sure that we do everything we can and do what it takes to make sure our balance sheet stays very strong.

Now you're saying 500 million a day by 2015, so obviously very impressive numbers. And the second largest producing basin for you guys by 2013, which would surpass the PRB volumes in a relatively short period of time. Can you just give us a little color on how you get there? I mean, I see the ramp and rig count, but any other specifics?

So we feel that that kind of rig count and since we're not giving guidance past '12 - but that rig count stays at basically in that range going forward and that will get us to that 500 million-type level.

So going forward, we think all those things work themselves out and normalize, a little more normal weather patterns. Obviously, the transportation and maintenance goes away. The hydro goes away and we see, that's why you look at the forward curve, it's more like in that $0.50 range. So we looked it really as just kind of several things lined up together to make a blip on the screen of a higher basis for a couple months.

So - but still, compared to the other alternatives that you look to for additional incremental ethane supplies, like the Marcellus and so forth, we think it can still compete effectively, because we think Geoffrey and the Alberta ethane consumers have a high demand there and have a very low-cost efficient infrastructure up there, that's a good place to consume some of that ethane. So I guess what I would tell you is I think Overland Pass will provide a connection for supplies, whether it is ultimately for feeding ethane supplies into Canada or whether it is to Mont Belvieu. But I think Overland Pass clearly provides that connection for the production out of the Rockies into either one of those markets, ultimately.

The question I have is, at what level of balance sheet coverage - are we looking at BBB flat kind of, BBB plus kind of metrics before we get to the point where we can put major stock buybacks into the value creation tool kit or is there a time frame when this might materialize? Because there's going to be cash buildup, you're going to have choices.

I understand the question. I would say that we're certainly looking at all the options. I would say that with low commodity prices and the down market, our credit metrics don't look nearly so good as they look in a more, I'll call it normal market. So I think one of the challenges is in a down market, it's even more difficult to buy back stock without a ratings consequence. So we're continuously looking at all the options and looking at where we stand within the credit framework. But you also have to look at what those metrics look like in that low environment. And again, the agencies also not just look at the environment in which we're living, but also look at an even more dire environment so, as they make their ratings decision.
So it's hard to answer your question other than to give you some of the considerations. But I would say we're always looking at all the options. But I think stock buyback is something that's certainly not on the table this year. We'd like to have the flexibility to be able to consider that at a future date, but certainly it's not now. And I guess we'll take a look at where everything lines up in 2011 and beyond and see if that's something that's appropriate.

So we'll see a little bit there. But as big as our portfolio is, it takes a lot to move that very much, as you can imagine. So I wouldn't expect any dramatic movement in that. What I would suggest that from an MB investor perspective, that you take a look at is the fact that much of our ethane, a little over half of our ethane, on a - if you looked at our commodity exposure, is going into our ethylene cracking business at Geismar, where we consume about 30,000 barrels a day there. So for some piece of that, you really need to look all the way through the ethylene pricing if you're trying to get to a Williams earnings impact on that but we do continue to do fee-based contracts but that won't necessarily, just a straight up fee-base contract won't necessarily change our mix; it will just lower our overall exposure to commodity - but to both the heavies and to ethane.

And that really has come true. So, you can see Midstream and Pipeline is now developing the opportunities without fear that we cannot finance them. So it's really turned our Midstream and Pipeline team loose to really develop all the opportunities that add value and do so on a disciplined basis. Again, I'd just remind you that when we did the transaction and really through this date, our earnings did not change, our cash flows did not change. We highlighted the value of those two businesses in WPZ, but our earnings and cash flows did not change in the near-term. But we're very confident that, over the course of a few years, that we will see very high returns from those incremental investments that are made in those two businesses.

Let’s just dive into the slides.
Slide 5 shows the key financial results. Of course adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations is $0.22 for the Q3; year to date of $0.86 is 28% higher than 2009. Our 2010 through ‘12 earnings guidance is relatively unchanged. We’ll go into some of the tweaks that we’ve made here a little later. And we did record a $1.7 billion non cash impairment due to the recent decline in natural gas prices.
Slide 6 please. Some of the major highlights from the quarter. We did reach agreement to sell our Piceance Basin gathering and processing assets to WPZ. I have a slide later that goes into more detail on that transaction.
Secondly, we’re very excited about the progress that we’re making to grow out businesses in the Marcellus Shale, and let me just offer some color on that. In the E&P space, we’re now operating three rigs. That number will be increasing to six by the Q4 of 2011. Current returns are greater than 30%. We have seen and expect significant continued improvements as Williams becomes operator and as we proceed with the large Susquehanna drilling program. As you know, we now have 100,000 net acres at an average cost of less than $7000 an acre, gross production near 20 million a day at the end of the Q3 and the Westmoreland County Slavic Trust wells have been the best performing to date.
As well, good growth in the mid-stream space. We’re rapidly expanding the Laurel Mountain mid-stream gathering system. Projects there will ultimately provide over 1.5 Bcf a day of gathering capacity, and 1400 miles of gathering lines including 400 new miles of large diameter pipe. As well construction has begun on our Shamrock Compressor Station, where we’ll have an initial capacity of 60 million a day, but is expandable to 350 million a day. And that Shamrock Station will likely be the largest central delivery point out of the Laurel Mountains System.
As well we have the Springville System and we now have all of the right of way. We expect to begin construction in the Q1 of 2011, in service in 2011. And given the demand from customers we’ve upped the project size from a 20-inch to a 24-inch diameter pipeline. So a lot of really exciting things going on in the Marcellus.
Moving back now to talk a little bit more about the highlights on the slide. We did close and finance the Overland Pass pipeline transaction, and there was strong demand for the WPZ share offering. We did complete the restructuring transaction with the PZMZ merger. We’re prepared for a November startup of Sundance Trail. We brought the new Echo Springs TXP4 into full operation at the end of the Q3. And just to remind you, the TXP4 plant adds about 350 million a day of processing and 30,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids production and capacity, roughly doubling what we already had there at Echo Springs.
We increased the WPZ distribution by 1.5? and did announce as you well know the leadership secession plan effective January, 2011, which has Alan coming on board as President & CEO.
Slide 7 please. This slide just gives the guidance range and midpoints for Henry Hub and Rockies net gas prices, crude oil, and NGL margins and our assumed NGL to crude oil relationship. I think there are just two points I want to make here: one, these are unchanged from the commodity price assumptions that we gave you at Barclays; and I guess the second point is yes, we have seen natural gas prices fall since then but we’ve run the numbers. And if you used strip prices you would really see the minimalist impact on our earnings per share for ‘11 and ‘12.
Slide 8 please. Steady growth even on expected low nat gas prices. This shows adjusted EPS, adjusted segment profit, cash flow from operations and capital. And just the key points here: earnings per share reflects some tightening of ranges in ‘11 and ‘12. Segment profit reflects tightening in ‘11 and a slight increase in the range in ‘12. CFFO tightens the range consistent with earnings. 2011 CAPEX, we’re seeing some carryover from 2010; as well as PZ, with its Laurel Mountains and Piceance growth, that’s added a little capital. 2012 capital as well is up a little bit as a result of Laurel Mountains and Piceance growth.
Slide 9. Again, segment profit moving up even during a low nat gas price environment. That’s good stuff.
Slide 10, please. This is the slide that we have been showing the last couple of years, which shows the maintenance cap, the maintenance to maintain volumes, the growth projects by year and divided out by WPZ, E&P, and other.
A couple points here: you’ll note in 2010, the blue WPZ growth bar is a little larger, and that’s obviously associated with the bar gas transaction, the Piceance gathering and processing transaction that I spoke about earlier. As well you’ll notice the growth capital, the yellow bar in ‘10 and ‘11 and ‘12 continues to grow quite nicely. Of course that includes that yellow bar, the other category includes Canada where, due to our first mover technological advantage we continue to anticipate making significant, attractive investments over the next three years.
Slide 11. This is our familiar pie chart for WPZ midstream, and as you well know we’ve had success in moving projects. Due to our success from the left to the right we really see huge growth opportunities in the Marcellus, opportunities out west to expand on our already significant position out there, and we’re still excited about what the Gulf offers.
Slide 12, please. The WPZ gas pipeline, inventory of projects - $1.3 billion represented here. PZ franchise, or the gas pipeline franchise is a major segment of the nation’s energy infrastructure, transporting 12% of the country’s gas on any given day. And our gas pipeline enterprise produces consistent low risks of substantial free cash flow.
You know, we’ve talked about the base hit approach that we’ve used here. Most of our growth has been and will continue to be from market whole projects within our exiting footprint, as opposed to in my view the more risky producer-push pipes which are dependent on a given supply basin. I would say looking out into the future there’s a significant opportunity for expansions to serve power generation, particularly in the Southeast US.
Slide 13, please. I think you’re familiar with our Premier E&P portfolio, and we have talked in the past that the Marcellus will soon become our second largest producing basin. A couple other key points: our drilling returns remain strong and our major operating areas of the Piceance, Marcellus, and Powder River with returns ranging from 17% to near 40% - even in this low nat gas price environment. A major reason for this is our industry leadership position on low costs. And I think a great example here is in the Piceance for 2010 we’ve improved our well costs by 3% to 6% versus 2009.
We have a unique industry portfolio that allows us to flex up our drilling program, up or down, without losing value or losing leases. And as discussed in our September guidance update we decreased our rig counts for 2011 by nine rigs and 2012 by 17 rigs from our previous guidance, and simply put we can do that and yet preserve our value and leases while we wait for gas prices to improve. And we still expect to grow our production by 3% in 2011, 7% in 2012.
Slide 14. This is the drop down slide, so this is a large scale asset and you see the bullet points on the left there: 150 miles of large diameter pipe connects to 3300 wells, six aiming and treating facilities, 160,000 horsepower of compression, 1.2 Bcf a day of dew point processing capacity. These are significant assets. The attractive financial profile and some of the key points there: $105 million of WPZ segment profit in DD&A in 2011, immediately accretive to DCF for PZ. And as the general partner, Williams will receive a favored distribution increase. WPZ is acquiring fee business, that’s good stuff. Williams’ E&P segment retains liquids upside and we have a life of lease dedication from Williams E&P. And we expect closing to occur in November of 2010.
We still get a lot of questions and there’s a lot of dialog in the industry about what’s going to happen with NGLs and ethane and ethylene, and I’m certainly not going to read all of these bullet points but there are some points I want to make. And we’ve made these in the past and continue to believe in them. Short-term the fundamentals remain very strong for near-term ethane demand, as ethane is maintaining its favorable position in being the low cost feedstock for ethylene production. A lot of people are worried about the shale plays and the large supplies of ethane that are going to come on, but you have to remember - large supplies of ethane from the shale plays will require significant infrastructure and infrastructure takes time. The very strong ethylene markets will incent plants to invest in small plant expansions and WMB, Williams, has a low cost expansion investment ongoing at Geismar which is going to increase our capacity by 12%.
Longer-term, clearly the US right now holds a large advantage for being the next low cost traunch for ethylene production given the abundant natural gas supplies. The US should be in a strong position to export its ethylene derivative products at a lower cost than incremental production elsewhere in the world. And I think ultimately the big question is will ethylene capacity be expanded to keep pace with increased NGL supplies here in the US? And given the high ethane to ethylene spreads that exist, we think ultimately that conversions and low cost capacity increases will happen.
Slide 16 and 17 talk about the progress we have made for 2010 priorities for value creation, and you can see more and more of the boxes now have checkmarks. And so we’re pleased with the progress that we’re making there.
Slide 18, please. The “Why Williams is a Winning Investment,” no change here. We think that we have the assets, the people. We have proven that we can execute crisply around our strategies. We are committed to financial discipline and believe that we’re going to have very, very attractive results in the future.
Before we go to Q&A I’ve got a few comments and Alan will as well, but I wanted to address questions about my decision to retire. There’s no hidden intrigue or back story here. As Gwen and I were thinking about the next chapter in our life, and having been with Williams for 26 years, nine of those as CEO, we decided that again, started talking about it over the summer and ultimately decided that it made sense for us to retire at the end of 2010. And as you know, the requirements are such that once you make your final decision you need to make it public in four or five days. So it’s a decision that we’re very excited about.
But the board was well prepared for this decision. We’ve had an active and comprehensive secession planning process in place. The board and I are confident in the team and confident in Alan Armstrong, and believe that Alan will take the company to new heights. I’ve had the great opportunity to work with Alan, not only in his role as heading up our midstream group but I’ve worked closely with him back in the 1990s when I was running midstream.
And I don’t want to get too carried away here, but the experience and culture here at Williams is very unique and I’ve been proud to work here for the past 26 years. I truly believe the Williams experience, the Williams culture is a competitive advantage for us. So with that I’ll turn it over to Alan.

First of all, Steve, I want to make sure that we acknowledge the accomplishments that Steve brought forward. If you think back to the very difficult and tenuous circumstances that Steve was handed, and to where he’s brought us to today with a very strong, very stable company with tremendous potential to create shareholder value from where we sit today- We have that potential in terms of financial resources. We’ve got extremely well positioned assets in the markets they serve, and we’ve got tremendous organizational capabilities in terms of exploiting resource plays, both in our E&P group and in our midstream group. And our pipes are well positioned to serve the change in the markets today that’s associated with the resource plays.
And certainly as Steve mentioned, our culture with one of the most passionate and committed workforces in the business today, leaves me with a tremendous amount of optimism about where we can take this. And I just want to say a big thanks to Steve for giving us such a tremendous platform to take the company from today.
So we are in a very enviable position. We’ve got all the tools necessary to really accelerate shareholder value. We’re going to be reviewing all alternatives and I’m charged up and can assure you that with the great platform, the well positioned assets, and organizational capabilities that we have today, we will not be sitting still. I don’t have any particular bias other than to assure ourselves that we are creating the most shareholder value that is enduring and allows our businesses to be the most successful they can be for the benefit of our investors.
  And with that I will turn this over to Q&A.

It’s the fair value model, and gross cash flows are discounted against that. So as we look at that for example on the goodwill, the internal fair value was slightly less than the carrying value, and in that case it caused an impairment in our goodwill which was, the goodwill for us was associated with a 2001, almost a decade ago acquisition of Barrett. And it wasn’t cash out the door; it was really a deferred tax liability gross up if you will. And that became our goodwill, and over the course of the last decade as we looked at prices and all that, we really didn’t have any opportunities for impairment. And then with the poor price curve it’s gone down greater than 22% since the beginning of the year. That caused us to look at that and that caused that write down.
For the Barnett it was simply just a factor of the fair value again versus the carrying value. Our Ford prices have come down substantially and we have that impairment. That really doesn’t have anything to do with go forward on where we’re headed primarily in the Piceance and the Marcellus, where most of our draw is, and a lesser extension, the Powder. So those are just accounting exercises. You look at it, you understand the value of what you’re carrying versus the value of the fair value, and those are impaired from there.
And I don’t know if your last question is more about the industry or us. We know that the level of rigs, which we did drop a substantial amount of rigs in our forecast at the Barclays conference for ‘11 and ‘12, but we know that we believe our production wasn’t growing that much. I think the industry in general hopefully at some time we’ll see our competitors put on more of a return hat and finish drilling for holding leases, and finish drilling for holding JVs and we’ll see a more rational response to the gas prices. And therefore, at that point I would expect you would see some of the gas supply to decline.

And I think that chicken and egg problem persists.
With respect to the McMullen Lateral. I know Alan will have some thoughts probably from the midstream perspective, but from the pipeline perspective I can tell you that as more drilling is done out there and as the lenses of liquids-rich and oil-rich finds sort of move northward, we’re seeing a higher level of interest in dry gas but nonetheless a very high level of interest in the McMullen Lateral.

First of all in the Mobile Bay area, we had Exxon, who is the big producer into Mobile Bay, had some outages on one of their offshore pipelines completely unrelated to the drilling moratorium that reduced input coming into the plant substantially. In addition to that, though, we also, the way those contracts work, they have rights to take their liquids for a certain number of months over the year, and it just so happened that that piled up, their option piled up in this quarter. It’s actually our election and so with their outage we elected to give them the liquids in that period when there was an outage. So that was by far the largest.
And then out west we had reduction related to a forced measure that we got from One Oak at their Bushton fractionator, and that backed up all of our plants in the west. They had some difficulties maintaining with the volumes ramping up so rapidly coming out of the west. They’ve had some difficulties keeping their infrastructure out in front of that, and that resulted in a forced measure that did impact our western volume. So all in all we are really well positioned right now with our Echo plant being now up, which just really got spinning here towards the end of September. And we’ve gotten some of the line problems resolved that we had on the Perdito tie in, which were effecting our Markham volumes as well. So going into the Q4 here we are really well positioned to get back on track on our liquids production and grow that pretty rapidly.

That has been baked into the guidance. Basically as you can see the previous guidance, at that time we owned what we call the Piceance gathering assets, we also called that Bargatt.

I think all that has to really change out there, and I’m not predicting how rapidly this will change, but I do think that what’s going to be required is for the producers to gain confidence that even though the moratorium is lifted that permits will actually be processed in a timely basis and in a reasonable fashion. And I think everybody’s waiting to see on that front. But if that does happen then there is a tremendous resource out there and it’s going to need a lot of infrastructure, and we’re very well positioned to serve that.

Let's just dive into the slides. 
Slide 5 shows the financial, the key financial results. Of course, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations is $0.22 for the third quarter, year-to-date of $0.86, it was 28% higher than 2009.
Our 2010 through '12 earnings guidance is relatively unchanged. We will go into some of the tweaks that we've made here a little later. And we did record a $1.7 billion noncash impairment due to the recent decline in natural gas prices.
Slide 6, please. Some of the major highlights from the quarter. We did reach agreement to sell our Piceance Basin gathering and processing assets to WPZ. I have a slide later that goes into more detail on that transaction.
Secondly, we're very excited about the progress that we're making to grow our businesses in the Marcellus shale. And let me just offer some color on that. In the E&P space, we're now operating 3 rigs. That number will be increasing to 6 by the fourth quarter of 2011. Current returns are greater than 30%. We have seen and expect significant continued improvements, as Williams becomes operator and as we proceed with the large Susquehanna drilling program. As you know, we now have 100,000 net acres at an average cost of less than $7,000 an acre. Gross production near $20 million a day at the end of the third quarter. And the Westmoreland County's slavic trust wells have been the best performing to date.
As well, good growth in the midstream space. We're rapidly expanding the lower mountain midstream gathering system project there will ultimately provide over 1.5 Bcf a day of gathering capacity and 1,400 miles of gathering lines, including 400 new miles of large diameter pipe.
As well, construction has begun on our shamrock compression station, where we'll have an initial capacity of 60 million a day, but is expandable to 350 million a day. And that shamrock station will likely be the largest central delivery point out of the lower mountain system.
As well, we have the Springville system. And we now have all of the right-of-way. We expect we'd begin construction in the first quarter of 2011 and service during 2011. And given the demand from customers, we've upped the project size from a 20-inch to a 24-inch diameter pipeline. So a lot of really exciting things going on in the Marcellus.
Moving back now to talk a little bit more about the highlights on the slide. We did close and finance the Overland Pass Pipeline transaction. And there was strong demand for the WPZ share offering. We did complete the restructuring transaction with the PZMZ merger. We're prepared for a November startup of Sundance trail. We've brought the new Echo Springs CXP 4 into full operation at the end of the third quarter. 
And just to remind you, that TXP 4 plant adds about 350 million a day of processing and 30,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids production and capacity, roughly doubling what we already had there at Echo Springs.
We increased the WPZ distribution by $0.015, and did announce, as you well know, the leadership succession plan effective January 2011, which has Alan coming onboard as President and CEO.
Slide 7, please. This is the slide just gives the guidance range and midpoints for Henry Hub and Rockies net gas prices, crude oil and the NGO margins and our assumed NGL to crude oil relationship.
And I think there are just 2 points that I would want to make here. One, these are unchanged from the commodity price assumptions that we debut at Barclays. And I guess, the second point is, yes, we have seen natural gas prices fall since then, but we've run the numbers and if you use strip prices, you would really see a de minimis impact on our earnings per share for '11 and '12.
Slide 8, please. The steady growth even on expected low net gas prices that shows just adjusted EPS, adjusted segment profit, cash flow from operations and capital. And just the key points here, earnings per share reflect some tightening of ranges in '11 and '12. Segment profit reflects tightening in '11 and a slight increase in the range in '12. CFFO tightens the range consistent with earnings. 2011 CapEx, we're seeing some carryover from 2010 as well, PZ is with its lower mountain and Piceance growth, that's added a little capital, 2012 capital as well, up a little bit, as a result of lower mountain and Piceance growth.
Slide 9, again, segment profit moving up even during a low net gas price environment. That's good stuff. Slide 10, please. This is the slide that we have been showing the last couple of years, which shows maintenance, the maintenance cap, the maintenance to maintain volumes, the growth projects by year and divided out by WPZ, E&P and other. 
A couple of points here. You'll note in 2010, the blue WPZ growth bar is a little larger. And that's obviously associated with the bargaph transaction, the Piceance gathering and processing transaction that I spoke about earlier.
As well, you'll notice the growth capital, the yellow bar in '10 and '11 and '12 continues to grow quite nicely. Of course, that includes that yellow bar, the other category, includes Canada, where do our first mover technological advantage. We continue to anticipate making significant, attractive investments over the next 3 years.
Slide 11. This is our familiar pie chart for WPZ midstream. And as you well know, we've had success in moving projects. Due to our success from the left to the right, we really see huge growth opportunities in the Marcellus, opportunities out West to expand on our already significant position out there. And we're still excited about what the Gulf offers.
Slide 12, please. The WPZ Gas Pipeline inventory of projects. $1.3 billion represented here. PZ franchise or the Gas Pipeline franchise is a major segment of the nation's energy infrastructure, transporting 12% of the country's gas on any given day. And our Gas Pipeline enterprise produces consistent low-risk, substantial free cash flow.
We've talked about the base hit approach that we've used here. Most of our growth has been and will continue to be from market full projects within our existing footprint, as opposed to, in my view, the more risky producer push pipes, which are dependent on a given supply basin.
I would say looking out into the future, there's a significant opportunity for expansions to serve power generation, particularly in the Southeast U.S.
Slide 13, please. I think you're familiar with our premier E&P portfolio. And we have talked in the past that the Marcellus will soon become our second largest producing basin. A couple of other key points. Our drilling returns remain strong and our major operating areas of the Piceance, Marcellus and Powder River with returns ranging from 17% to near 40%, even in the slow net gas price environment.
A major reason for this is our industry leadership position on low cost. And I think a great example here is in the Piceance, for 2010, we've improved our well costs by 3% to 6% versus 2009. 
We have a unique industry portfolio that allows us to flex up our drilling program, up or down, without losing value or losing leases. And as discussed in our September guidance update, we decreased our rig counts for 2011 by 9 rigs, in 2012, by 17 rigs from our previous guidance. And simply put, we can do that and yet preserve our value and leases, while we wait for gas prices to improve. And we still expect to grow our production by 3% in 2011, 7% in 2012.
Slide 14. This is the drop-down slide. So this is a large scale asset, and you see the bullet points on the left there. 150 miles of large diameter pipe, next to 3,300 wells, 6 aiming and treating facilities, 160,000 horsepower of compression, 1.2 Bcf a day of due point processing capacity. So these are significant assets.
The attractive financial profile in some of the key points there. $105 million of WPZ segment profit and DD&A in 2011, immediately accretive to Bcf for PZ. And as a general partner, Williams will receive the favor distribution increased. WPZ is acquiring the fee business. That's good stuff. William CMP segment retains liquids upside, and we have a life of lease dedication from William CMP. And we expect closing to occur in November of 2010.
We still get a lot of questions, and there's a lot of dialogue in the industry about what's going to happen with NGLs and ethane and ethylene. And I'm certainly not going to repeat all of these bullet points, but there are some points that I would want to make.
And we've made these in the past, and continue to believe in them. Short term, the fundamentals remain very strong for our near-term ethane demand, as ethane is maintaining its favorable position in being the low-cost feedstock for ethylene production.
Other people are worried about the shale plays and the larger supplies of ethane that are going to come on. But you have to remember, large supplies of ethane from the shale plays will require significant infrastructure, and infrastructure takes time. The very strong ethylene markets will incent plants to invest in small plant expansions. And WMD Williams has a low-cost expansion investment ongoing at Geismar, which is going to increase our capacity by 12%.
Longer-term, clearly, the U.S. right now holds a large advantage for being the next low-cost tranche of ethylene production, given the abundant natural gas supplies. The U.S. should be in a strong position to export these ethylene derivative products at a lower cost than incremental production elsewhere in the world. And I think, ultimately, the big question is, will ethylene capacity be expanded to keep pace with increased NGL supplies here in the U.S.? And given the high ethane to ethylene spreads that exist, we think, ultimately, that conversions and low-cost capacity increases will happen.
Slide 16 and 17 talk about the progress that we've made on the 2010 priorities for value creation. And you can see more and more of the boxes now have checkmarks. And so we're pleased with the progress that we're making there.
Slide 18, please. Why Williams is a winning investment? No change here. We think that we have the assets, the people. We have proven that we can execute crisply around our strategies. We are committed to financial discipline and believe that we're going to have very, very attractive results in the future.
Before we go to Q&A, I've got a few comments and Alan will as well. But I wanted to address questions about my decision to retire. There's no hidden intrigue or backstory here. As Gwen and I were thinking about the next chapter in our life and having been with Williams for 26 years, 9 of those as CEO, we decided that, again, started talking about it over the summer and ultimately, decided that it made sense for us to retire at the end of 2010.
And as you know, the requirements are such that once you make your final decision, you need to make it public in the 4 or 5 days. So it's a decision that we're very excited about.
But the Board was well-prepared for this decision we've had an active and comprehensive succession planning process in place. The Board and I are confident in the team and confident in Alan Armstrong, and believe that Alan will take the company to new heights. I've had a great opportunity to work with Alan, not only in his role as heading up our Midstream group, but I've worked closely with him back in the 1990s, when I was running Midstream.
So -- and I don't want to get too carried away here, but the experience and culture here at Williams is very unique. And I've been proud to work here for the last 26 years. I truly believe the Williams experience, the Williams culture, is a competitive advantage for us.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan."

So as we look at that, for example, on the goodwill, the internal fair value was slightly less than the carrying value. And in that case, it caused an impairment of our goodwill, which was -- goodwill for us was associated with the 2001, almost a decade ago, acquisition of Barrett. And it wasn't cash out the door. It was really deferred tax liability gross-up, if you will. And that became our goodwill. And over the course of the last decade, as we look to prices and all that, we really didn't have any opportunities for impairment than with the 4 price curve has gone down greater than 22%, since the beginning of the year, that caused us to look at that and that caused that write down. For the Barnett, it was simply just a factor of the fair value again versus the carrying value. Barnett ford prices has come down substantially. And we have that impairment. That really doesn't have anything to do with go forward on where we're headed primarily in the Piceance and in the Marcellus, where most of our donors and lesser extent, the powder. So those are just accounting exercises. If you look at it, you understand the value of what you're carrying versus the value of the fair value. And those were impaired from there. And I don't know if your last question is more about the industry or us. We know that the level of rigs that, which we did drop a substantial amount of rigs in our forecasts at the Barclays conference for '11 and '12. But we know that we believe our production is growing that much. I think the industry in general, hopefully, at some time, we'll see our competitors put on more of a return hat and finished drilling for holding leases and finish drilling for holding JVs. And we'll see a more rational response to the gas prices. And therefore, at that point, I would expect to see some of the gas supply to decline."

And you are right, it's actually fairly substantial reduction in our equity gallons.

In addition to that, though, we also, the way those contracts work, they have rights to take their liquids for a certain number of months out of the year. And it just so happened that 2 of those that piled up, they're option piled up in this quarter. It's actually our election. And so with their outage, we elected to give them the liquids in that period, where there was an outage. So that was by far the largest. And then out West, we had reduction related to a force majeure that we got from one at their Bush infractionator. And that backed up all of our plants in the West. They had some difficulties maintaining with the volumes ramping up so rapidly, coming out of the West, they've had some difficult keeping our infrastructure out in front of that. And that resulted in a force majeure that did impact over western volumes. So all in all, we are really well-positioned right now with our eco plant being now up, which just really got spinning here towards in to September. And we've gotten the some of the line problems resolved that we had on the ready tie in, which were affecting our mark and volumes as well.

Of course, adjusted earnings per share from continuing",2052,"Thank you, Travis. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call, and thanks for your interest in our company. Let's just dive into the slides. 
Slide 5 shows the financial -- the key financial results. Of course, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations is $0.22 for the third quarter. Year-to-date of $0.86 is 28% higher than 2009. Our 2010 through '12 earnings guidance is relatively unchanged. We will go into some of the tweaks that we've made here a little later. And we did record a $1.7 billion noncash impairment due to the recent decline in natural gas prices.
Slide 6, please. Some of the major highlights from the quarter. We did reach agreement to sell our Piceance Basin gathering and processing assets to WPZ. I have a slide later that goes into more detail on that transaction. Secondly, we're very excited about the progress that we're making to grow our businesses in the Marcellus shale. And let me just offer some color on that. In the E&P space, we're now operating 3 rigs. That number will be increasing to 6 by the fourth quarter of 2011. Current returns are greater than 30%. We have seen and expect significant continued improvements, as Williams becomes operator and as we proceed with the large Susquehanna drilling program. As you know, we now have 100,000 net acres at an average cost of less than $7,000 an acre. Gross production near $20 million a day at the end of the third quarter. And the Westmoreland County Slavic Trust wells have been the best performing to date.
As well, good growth in the midstream space. We're rapidly expanding the lower mountain midstream gathering system. Projects there will ultimately provide over 1.5 Bcf a day of gathering capacity and 1,400 miles of gathering lines, including 400 new miles of large diameter pipe.
As well, construction has begun on our shamrock compression station, where we'll have an initial propensity of 60 million a day but is expandable to 350 million a day. And that Shamrock station will likely be the largest central delivery point out of the lower mountain system.
As well, we have the Springville system. And we now have all of the right of way. We expect we'd begin construction in the first quarter of 2011 and service during 2011. And given the demand from customers, we've upped the project size from a 20-inch to a 24-inch diameter pipeline. So a lot of really exciting things going on in the Marcellus.
Moving back now to talk a little bit more about the highlights on the slide. We did close and finance the Overland Pass Pipeline transaction. And there was strong demand for the WPZ share offering. We did complete the restructuring transaction with the PZ-MZ merger. We're prepared for a November startup of the Sundance Trail. We've brought the new Echo Springs TXP-4 into full operation at the end of the third quarter. And just to remind you, the TXP-4 plant adds about 350 million a day of processing and 30,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids production and capacity, roughly doubling what we already had there at Echo Springs.
We increased the WPZ distribution by $0.015 and did announce, as you well know, the leadership succession plan effective January 2011, which has Alan coming onboard as President and CEO.
Slide 7, please. This is -- this slide just gives the guidance range and midpoints for Henry Hub and Rockies, net gas prices, crude oil and the NGO margins and our assumed NGL to crude oil relationship.
And I think there are just 2 points that I would want to make here. One, these are unchanged from the commodity price assumptions that we debut at Barclays. And I guess, the second point is, yes, we have seen natural gas prices fall since then, but we've run the numbers and if you ran -- if you use strip prices, you would really see a de minimis impact on our earnings per share for '11 and '12.
Slide 8, please. The steady growth even on expected low net gas prices that shows just adjusted EPS, adjusted segment profit, cash flow from operations and capital. And just the key points here, earnings per share reflects some tightening of ranges in '11 and '12. Segment profit reflects tightening in '11 and a slight increase in the range in '12. CFFO tightens the range consistent with earnings. 2011 CapEx, we're seeing some carryover from 2010 as well, PZ is with its lower mountain and Piceance growth, that's added a little capital. 2012 capital as well, up a little bit, as a result of lower mountain and Piceance growth.
Slide 9, again, segment profit moving up even during a low net gas price environment. That's good stuff. Slide 10, please. This is the slide that we have been showing the last couple of years, which shows maintenance, the maintenance cap, the maintenance to maintain volumes, the growth projects by year and divided out by WPZ, E&P and other. 
A couple of points here. You'll note in 2010, the blue WPZ growth bar is a little larger. And that's obviously associated with the bar gas transaction, the Piceance gathering and processing transaction that I spoke about earlier.
As well, you'll notice the growth capital, the yellow bar in '10 and '11 and '12 continues to grow quite nicely. Of course, that includes, the yellow bar, the other category, includes Canada, where do our first mover technological advantage. We continue to anticipate making significant, attractive investments over the next 3 years.
Slide 11. This is our familiar pie chart for WPZ midstream. And as you well know, we've had success in moving projects. Due to our success from the left to the right, we really see huge growth opportunities in the Marcellus, opportunities out West to expand on our already significant position out there. And we're still excited about what the Gulf offers.
Slide 12 please, the WPZ gas pipeline inventory of projects. $1.3 billion represented here. PZ franchise or the gas pipeline franchise is a major segment of the nation's energy infrastructure, transporting 12% of the country's gas on any given day. And our gas pipeline enterprise produces consistent, low-risk, substantial free cash flow.  We've talked about the base hit approach that we've used here. Most of our growth has been and will continue to be from market full projects within our existing footprint, as opposed to, in my view, the more risky producer push pipes, which are dependent on a given supply basin.  I would say looking out into the future, there's a significant opportunity for expansions to serve power generation, particularly in the Southeast U.S..
Slide 13 please. I think you're familiar with our premier E&P portfolio. And we have talked in the past that the Marcellus will soon become our second largest producing basin. A couple of other key points. Our drilling returns remain strong and our major operating areas are the Piceance, Marcellus and Powder River with returns ranging from 17% to near 40%, even in the slow net gas price environment. A major reason for this is our industry leadership position on low cost. And I think a great example here is in the Piceance, for 2010, we've improved our well costs by 3% to 6% versus 2009. 
We have a unique industry portfolio that allows us to flex up our drilling program, up or down, without losing value or losing leases. And as discussed in our September guidance update, we decreased our rig counts for 2011 by 9 rigs, and in 2012, by 17 rigs from our previous guidance. And simply put, we can do that and yet preserve our value and leases, while we wait for gas prices to improve. And we still expect to grow our production by 3% in 2011, 7% in 2012.
Slide 14. This is the drop-down slide. So this is a large-scale asset, and you see the bullet points on the left there. 150 miles of large-diameter pipe, connects to 3,300 wells, 6 amine treating facilities, 160,000 horsepower of compression, 1.2 Bcf a day of dew-point processing capacity. So these are significant assets.  The attractive financial profile and some other key points there. $105 million of WPZ segment profit and DD&A in 2011, immediately accretive to DCF for PZ. And as a general partner, Williams will receive a favored distribution increase. WPZ is acquiring fee business. That's good stuff. Williams E&P segment retains liquids upside, and we have a life-of-lease dedication from Williams E&P. And we expect closing to occur in November of 2010.
We still get a lot of questions, and there's a lot of dialogue in the industry about what's going to happen with NGLs and ethane and ethylene. And I'm certainly not going to repeat all of these bullet points, but there are some points that I would want to make. And we've made these in the past and continue to believe in them. short term, the fundamentals remain very strong for our near-term ethane demand, as ethane is maintaining its favorable position in being the low-cost feedstock for ethylene production.
Other people are worried about the shale plays and the large supplies of ethane that are going to come on. But you have to remember, large supplies of ethane from the shale plays will require significant infrastructure and infrastructure takes time. The very strong ethylene markets will incent plants to invest in small plant expansions. And WMZ Williams has a low-cost expansion investment ongoing at Geismar, which is going to increase our capacity by 12%.
Longer term, clearly, the U.S. right now holds a large advantage for being the next low-cost tranche of ethylene production, given the abundant natural gas supplies. The U.S. should be in a strong position to export its ethylene-derivative products at a lower cost than incremental production elsewhere in the world. And I think, ultimately, the big question is will ethylene capacity be expanded to keep pace with the increased NGL supplies here in the U.S.? And given the high ethane to ethylene spread that exists, we think ultimately that conversions and low-cost capacity increases will happen.
Slide 16 and 17 talk about the progress that we've made on the 2010 priorities for value creation. And you can see more and more of the boxes now have checkmarks. And so we're pleased with the progress that we're making there.
Slide 18 please. Why Williams is a winning investment? No change here. We think that we have the assets, the people, we have proven that we can execute crisply around our strategies. We are committed to financial discipline and believe that we're going to have very, very attractive results in the future.
Before we go to Q&A, I've got a few comments and Alan will as well. But I wanted to address questions about my decision to retire. There's no hidden intrigue or back story here. As Gwen and I were thinking about the next chapter in our life and having been with Williams for 26 years, 9 of those as CEO, we decided that -- again started talking about it over the summer and ultimately, decided that it made sense for us to retire at the end of 2010. And as you know, the requirements are such that once you make your final decision, you need to make it public in 4 or 5 days. So it's a decision that we're very excited about.
But the board was well prepared for this decision. We've had an active and comprehensive succession planning process in place. The board and I are confident in the team and confident in Alan Armstrong and believe that Alan will take the company to new heights. I've had a great opportunity to work with Alan, not only in his role as heading up our Midstream group, but I've worked closely with him back in the 1990s when I was running Midstream.
So -- and I don't want to get too carried away here, but the experience and culture here at Williams is very unique. And I've been proud to work here for the last 26 years. I truly believe the Williams' experiences, the Williams' culture is a competitive advantage for us.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan."

First of all, Steve, I want to make sure that we acknowledge the accomplishments that Steve brought forth. If you take back to the very difficult and tenuous circumstances that Steve was handed and to where he brought us to today with a very strong, very stable company with tremendous potential to create shareholder value from where we sit today. We have that potential in terms of financial resources. We've got extremely well-positioned assets in the markets they serve, and we've got tremendous organizational capabilities in terms of exporting resource play, both in our E&P group and in our Midstream group, and our pipes are well positioned to serve the change in the markets today associated with the resource plays. And certainly, as Steve mentioned, our culture with one of the most passionate and committed workforces in the business today leave me with a tremendous amount of optimism about where we can take this. And I just want to say a big thanks to Steve for giving us such a tremendous platform to take the company on today.
So we are in a very enviable position. We've got all the tools necessary to really accelerate shareholder value. We're going to be reviewing all alternatives. And I'm charged up and can assure you that with the great platform, the well-positioned assets and organizational capabilities that we have today, we will not be sitting still. I don't have any particular bias other than to assure ourselves that we are creating the most shareholder value that is enduring and allows our businesses to be the most successful they can be for the benefit of our investors.
And with that, I will turn this over to Q&A."

It's the fair value model, and gross cash flows are discounted against that. So as we look at that, for example, on the goodwill, the internal fair value was slightly less than the carrying value. And in that case, it caused an impairment of our goodwill, which was -- goodwill for us was associated with the 2001, almost a decade ago, acquisition of Barrett. And it wasn't cash out the door. It was really a deferred tax liability gross up, if you will. And that became our goodwill. And over the course of the last decade, as we looked at prices and all that, we really didn't have any opportunities for impairment and then with the forward price curve has gone down greater than 22% since the beginning of the year, that caused us to look at that and that caused that write-down. For the Barnett, it was simply just a factor of the fair value again versus the carrying value. Barnett forward prices have come down substantially and we have that impairment. That really doesn't have anything to do with go forward on where we're headed primarily in the Piceance and in the Marcellus, where most of our draw is in and lesser extent, the powder. So those are just accounting exercises. If you look at it, you understand the value of what you're carrying versus the value of the fair value. And those were impaired from there. And I don't know if your last question is more about the industry or us. We know that the level of rigs that were -- which we did drop a substantial amount of rigs in our forecasts at the Barclays conference for '11 and '12. But we know that we believe our production is growing that much. I think the industry in general -- hopefully, at some time, we'll see our competitors put on more of a return hat and finish drilling for holding leases and finish drilling for holding JVs. And we'll see a more rational response to the gas prices and therefore, at that point, I would expect to see some of the gas supply to decline."

And you are right, it's actually fairly substantial reduction in our equity gallons. First of all, in the Mobile Bay area, we had Exxon, who is the big producer in to Mobile Bay, had some outages on one of their offshore pipelines, completely unrelated to the drilling moratorium that reduced input coming into the plant substantially. In addition to that, though, we also -- the way those contracts work, they have rights to take their liquids for a certain number of months out of the year. And it just so happened that 2 of those that piled up, their option piled up in this quarter. It's actually our election. And so with their outage, we elected to give them the liquids in that period where there was an outage. So that was by far the largest. And then out West, we had reduction related to a force majeure that we got from ONEOK at their Bushton fractionator [ph]. And that backed up all of our plants in the West. They had some difficulties maintaining with the volumes ramping up so rapidly, coming out of the West, they've had some difficulty keeping our infrastructure out in front of that. And that resulted in a force majeure that did impact our western volumes. So all in all, we are really well positioned right now with our eco-plant being now up, which just really got spinning here in -- towards the end of September. And we've gotten some of the line problems resolved that we had on the Perdido tie-in, which were affecting our market volumes as well.

Of course, adjusted earnings per share from continuing",2052,"Thank you, Travis. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call, and thanks for your interest in our company. Let's just dive into the slides. 
Slide 5 shows the financial -- the key financial results. Of course, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations is $0.22 for the third quarter. Year-to-date of $0.86 is 28% higher than 2009. Our 2010 through '12 earnings guidance is relatively unchanged. We will go into some of the tweaks that we've made here a little later. And we did record a $1.7 billion noncash impairment due to the recent decline in natural gas prices.
Slide 6, please. Some of the major highlights from the quarter. We did reach agreement to sell our Piceance Basin gathering and processing assets to WPZ. I have a slide later that goes into more detail on that transaction. Secondly, we're very excited about the progress that we're making to grow our businesses in the Marcellus shale. And let me just offer some color on that. In the E&P space, we're now operating 3 rigs. That number will be increasing to 6 by the fourth quarter of 2011. Current returns are greater than 30%. We have seen and expect significant continued improvements, as Williams becomes operator and as we proceed with the large Susquehanna drilling program. As you know, we now have 100,000 net acres at an average cost of less than $7,000 an acre. Gross production near $20 million a day at the end of the third quarter. And the Westmoreland County Slavic Trust wells have been the best performing to date.
As well, good growth in the midstream space. We're rapidly expanding the Laurel Mountain midstream gathering system. Projects there will ultimately provide over 1.5 Bcf a day of gathering capacity and 1,400 miles of gathering lines, including 400 new miles of large diameter pipe.
As well, construction has begun on our Shamrock compressor station, where we'll have an initial capacity of 60 million a day. That is expandable to 350 million a day. And that Shamrock station will likely be the largest central delivery point out of the Laurel Mountain system.
As well, we have the Springville system. And we now have all of the right of way. We expect we'd begin construction in the first quarter of 2011, in service during 2011. And given the demand from customers, we've upped the project size from a 20-inch to a 24-inch diameter pipeline. So a lot of really exciting things going on in the Marcellus.
Moving back now to talk a little bit more about the highlights on the slide. We did close and finance the Overland Pass Pipeline transaction. And there was strong demand for the WPZ share offering. We did complete the restructuring transaction with the PZ-MZ merger. We're prepared for a November startup of Sundance Trail. We've brought the new Echo Springs TXP-4 into full operation at the end of the third quarter. And just to remind you, the TXP-4 plant adds about 350 million a day of processing and 30,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids production and capacity, roughly doubling what we already had there at Echo Springs.
We increased the WPZ distribution by $0.015 and did announce, as you well know, the leadership succession plan effective January 2011, which has Alan coming onboard as President and CEO.
Slide 7, please. This is -- this slide just gives the guidance range and midpoints for Henry Hub and Rockies, net gas prices, crude oil and the NGO margins and our assumed NGL to crude oil relationship.
And I think there are just 2 points that I would want to make here. One, these are unchanged from the commodity price assumptions that we gave you at Barclays. And I guess, the second point is, yes, we have seen natural gas prices fall since then, but we've run the numbers and if you ran -- if you use strip prices, you would really see a de minimis impact on our earnings per share for '11 and '12.
Slide 8, please. The steady growth even on expected low net gas prices. This shows adjusted EPS, adjusted segment profit, cash flow from operations and capital. And just the key points here, earnings per share reflects some tightening of ranges in '11 and '12. Segment profit reflects tightening in '11 and a slight increase in the range in '12. CFFO tightens the range consistent with earnings. 2011 CapEx, we're seeing some carryover from 2010 as well, PZ is with its Laurel Mountain and Piceance growth, that's added a little capital. 2012 capital as well, up a little bit, as a result of Laurel Mountain and Piceance growth.
Slide 9, again, segment profit moving up even during a low net gas price environment. That's good stuff. Slide 10, please. This is the slide that we have been showing the last couple of years, which shows maintenance, the maintenance cap, the maintenance to maintain volumes, the growth projects by year and divided out by WPZ, E&P and other. 
A couple of points here. You'll note in 2010, the blue WPZ growth bar is a little larger. And that's obviously associated with the bar GAP transaction, the Piceance gathering and processing transaction that I spoke about earlier.
As well, you'll notice the growth capital, the yellow bar in '10 and '11 and '12 continues to grow quite nicely. Of course, that includes, the yellow bar, the other category, includes Canada, where due  our first mover technological advantage, we continue to anticipate making significant, attractive investments over the next 3 years.
Slide 11. This is our familiar pie chart for WPZ midstream. And as you well know, we've had success in moving projects. Due to our success from the left to the right, we really see huge growth opportunities in the Marcellus, opportunities out West to expand on our already significant position out there. And we're still excited about what the Gulf offers.
Slide 12 please, the WPZ gas pipeline inventory of projects. $1.3 billion represented here. PZ franchise or the gas pipeline franchise is a major segment of the nation's energy infrastructure, transporting 12% of the country's gas on any given day. And our gas pipeline enterprise produces consistent, low-risk, substantial free cash flow.  We've talked about the base hit approach that we've used here. Most of our growth has been and will continue to be from market full projects within our existing footprint, as opposed to, in my view, the more risky producer push pipes, which are dependent on a given supply basin.  I would say looking out into the future, there's a significant opportunity for expansions to serve power generation, particularly in the Southeast U.S..
Slide 13 please. I think you're familiar with our premier E&P portfolio. And we have talked in the past that the Marcellus will soon become our second largest producing basin. A couple of other key points. Our drilling returns remain strong in our major operating areas of the Piceance, Marcellus and Powder River with returns ranging from 17% to near 40%, even in this low net gas price environment. A major reason for this is our industry leadership position on low cost. And I think a great example here is in the Piceance, for 2010, we've improved our well costs by 3% to 6% versus 2009. 
We have a unique industry portfolio that allows us to flex up our drilling program, up or down, without losing value or losing leases. And as discussed in our September guidance update, we decreased our rig counts for 2011 by 9 rigs, and in 2012, by 17 rigs from our previous guidance. And simply put, we can do that and yet preserve our value and leases, while we wait for gas prices to improve. And we still expect to grow our production by 3% in 2011, 7% in 2012.
Slide 14. This is the drop-down slide. So this is a large-scale asset, and you see the bullet points on the left there. 150 miles of large-diameter pipe, connects to 3,300 wells, 6 amine treating facilities, 160,000 horsepower of compression, 1.2 Bcf a day of dew-point processing capacity. So these are significant assets.  The attractive financial profile and some other key points there. $105 million of WPZ segment profit and DD&A in 2011, immediately accretive to DCF for PZ. And as a general partner, Williams will receive a favored distribution increase. WPZ is acquiring fee business. That's good stuff. Williams E&P segment retains liquids upside, and we have a life-of-lease dedication from Williams E&P. And we expect closing to occur in November of 2010.
We still get a lot of questions, and there's a lot of dialogue in the industry about what's going to happen with NGLs and ethane and ethylene. And I'm certainly not going to repeat all of these bullet points, but there are some points that I would want to make. And we've made these in the past and continue to believe in them. Short term, the fundamentals remain very strong for our near-term ethane demand, as ethane is maintaining its favorable position in being the low-cost feedstock for ethylene production.
A lot of people are worried about the shale plays and the large supplies of ethane that are going to come on. But you have to remember, large supplies of ethane from the shale plays will require significant infrastructure and infrastructure takes time. The very strong ethylene markets will incent plants to invest in small plant expansions. And WMB Williams has a low-cost expansion investment ongoing at Geismar, which is going to increase our capacity by 12%.
Longer term, clearly, the U.S. right now holds a large advantage for being the next low-cost tranche of ethylene production, given the abundant natural gas supplies. The U.S. should be in a strong position to export its ethylene-derivative products at a lower cost than incremental production elsewhere in the world. And I think, ultimately, the big question is will ethylene capacity be expanded to keep pace with increased NGL supplies here in the U.S.? And given the high ethane to ethylene spread that exists, we think ultimately that conversions and low-cost capacity increases will happen.
Slide 16 and 17 talk about the progress that we've made on the 2010 priorities for value creation. And you can see more and more of the boxes now have checkmarks. And so we're pleased with the progress that we're making there.
Slide 18 please. Why Williams is a winning investment? No change here. We think that we have the assets, the people, we have proven that we can execute crisply around our strategies. We are committed to financial discipline and believe that we're going to have very, very attractive results in the future.
Before we go to Q&A, I've got a few comments and Alan will as well. But I wanted to address questions about my decision to retire. There's no hidden intrigue or back story here. As Gwen and I were thinking about the next chapter in our life and having been with Williams for 26 years, 9 of those as CEO, we decided that -- again started talking about it over the summer and ultimately, decided that it made sense for us to retire at the end of 2010. And as you know, the requirements are such that once you make your final decision, you need to make it public in 4 or 5 days. So it's a decision that we're very excited about.
But the board was well prepared for this decision. We've had an active and comprehensive succession planning process in place. The board and I are confident in the team and confident in Alan Armstrong and believe that Alan will take the company to new heights. I've had a great opportunity to work with Alan, not only in his role as heading up our Midstream group, but I've worked closely with him back in the 1990s when I was running Midstream.
So -- and I don't want to get too carried away here, but the experience and culture here at Williams is very unique. And I've been proud to work here for the last 26 years. I truly believe the Williams' experience, the Williams' culture is a competitive advantage for us.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan."

And certainly, as Steve mentioned, our culture with one of the most passionate and committed workforces in the business today leave me with a tremendous amount of optimism about where we can take this. And I just want to say a big thanks to Steve for giving us such a tremendous platform to take the company from today.
So we are in a very enviable position. We've got all the tools necessary to really accelerate shareholder value. We're going to be reviewing all alternatives. And I'm charged up and can assure you that with the great platform, the well-positioned assets and organizational capabilities that we have today, we will not be sitting still. I don't have any particular bias other than to assure ourselves that we are creating the most shareholder value that is enduring and allows our businesses to be the most successful they can be for the benefit of our investors.

It's the fair value model, and gross cash flows are discounted against that. So as we look at that, for example, on the goodwill, the internal fair value was slightly less than the carrying value. And in that case, it caused an impairment of our goodwill, which was -- goodwill for us was associated with the 2001, almost a decade ago, acquisition of Barrett. And it wasn't cash out the door. It was really a deferred tax liability gross up, if you will. And that became our goodwill. And over the course of the last decade, as we looked at prices and all that, we really didn't have any opportunities for impairment and then with the forward price curve has gone down greater than 22% since the beginning of the year, that caused us to look at that and that caused that write-down. For the Barnett, it was simply just a factor of the fair value again versus the carrying value. Barnett forward prices have come down substantially and we have that impairment. That really doesn't have anything to do with go forward on where we're headed primarily in the Piceance and in the Marcellus, where most of our draw is in [ph]  And lesser extent, the powder. So those are just accounting exercises. If you look at it, you understand the value of what you're carrying versus the value of the fair value. And those were impaired from there. And I don't know if your last question is more about the industry or us. We know that the level of rigs that were -- which we did drop a substantial amount of rigs in our forecasts at the Barclays conference for '11 and '12. But we know that we believe our production is growing that much. I think the industry in general -- hopefully, at some time, we'll see our competitors put on more of a return hat and finish drilling for holding leases and finish drilling for holding JVs. And we'll see a more rational response to the gas prices and therefore, at that point, I would expect to see some of the gas supply to decline."

And it just so happened that 2 of those -- that piled up, their option piled up in this quarter. It's actually our election. And so with their outage, we elected to give them the liquids in that period where there was an outage. So that was by far the largest. And then out West, we had reduction related to a force majeure that we got from ONEOK at their Bushton fractionator. And that backed up all of our plants in the West. They had some difficulties maintaining with the volumes ramping up so rapidly, coming out of the West, they've had some difficulty keeping our infrastructure out in front of that.

So all in all, we are really well positioned right now with our Echo plant being now up, which just really got spinning here in -- towards the end of September.
