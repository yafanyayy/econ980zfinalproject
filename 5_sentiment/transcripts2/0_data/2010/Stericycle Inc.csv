Joining me on today's call will be Rich Kogler, COO; and Mark Miller, CEO. I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle on this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward-looking.  Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the company's Form 10-K, 10-Q, as well as its other filings with the SEC could affect the company's actual results and could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from expected results. The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements.Now into the results, the results for the fourth quarter are as follows: Revenues grew $39.5 million to $313.5 million, up 14.4% from $274 million in Q4 of '08; revenues grew 13.5% when adjusted for the favorable foreign exchange impact of $2.6 million;  Domestic internal growth, excluding returns managements, was up approximately 6%; and International internal growth adjusted for foreign exchange was up over 5%. Domestic internal growth consisted of SQ up 8% and LQ up 3%. The regulated recalls and returns management services revenues were $16.1 million.Gross profit was $147.1 million or 46.9% of revenues. Excluding the restructuring costs, the gross margin would have been 47.2%. SG&A expense was $61.8 million or 19.7% of revenues. Net interest expense was $8.8 million and net income attributable to Stericycle was $44.6 million or $0.52 per share on an as-reported basis and $0.55 adjusted for transactional expenses related to acquisitions and restructuring costs.At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $382 million. Currently, $100 million of our revolver is hedged at an average fixed 2.83% LIBOR rate plus 75 basis points. The remaining $282 million is floating at LIBOR plus 75 basis points or the prime rate, whichever is lower. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $244 million.We repurchased 93,670 shares of common stock on the open market at an amount of $4.5 million in the quarter. Cumulatively, we have purchased approximately 13.2 million shares. We still have authorization to purchase an additional 3 million shares. Our CapEx was $10.3 million, and our DSO at the end of the quarter was 52 days. The cash provided from operations in the quarter was $63.3 million and $277.2 million for the year. And now, I will turn it over to Rich."

We want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their solid performance and continued commitment to our customers and shareholders. In the quarter, we enjoyed strong sales growth in all of our business segments. SQ growth was primarily driven by Steri-Safe with 80% of new Steri-Safe customers choosing select or preferred programs. LQ sales growth was driven by the continued adoption of our Bio Systems offering and new service agreements. In summary, we ended Q4 with over 459,000 accounts, of which approximately 447,900 were small and the remainder, large. Now I'll turn it over to Mark."

Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. During the fourth quarter, we completed six acquisitions, two domestic and four international. The incremental revenue impact in the fourth quarter of this year was approximately $6.3 million. The annualized revenues of these acquisitions is approximately $59.9 million. But please keep in mind that our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and the related transactional expenses, but our guidance does include these items for the MedServe transaction completed at the end of Q4. We believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.34 to $2.40 which we're comfortable with. Please note that this guidance includes approximately $0.04 negative impact per share of acquisition integration expenses. We believe the analyst revenue estimates for 2010 will be in the range of $1.32 billion to $1.35 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange. We believe analysts will have estimates for net income between $202 million and $208 million, depending upon assumptions for margin improvement and interest expense. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow of $245 million to $255 million with CapEx anticipated between $45 million and $50 million.In closing, we're very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities this year and beyond. We thank you for your time. And operator, we'll now switch to the Q&A session."

And so I think in the end, we don't really see much change, and we don't see anything dramatically different that resulted from the outcome. And obviously, we're moving forward."

Joining me on today's call will be Rich Kogler, COO; and Mark Miller, CEO. I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle on this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward-looking.  Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the company's Form 10-K, 10-Q, as well as its other filings with the SEC could affect the company's actual results and could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from expected results. The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements.Now into the results, the results for the fourth quarter are as follows: Revenues grew $39.5 million to $313.5 million, up 14.4% from $274 million in Q4 of '08; revenues grew 13.5% when adjusted for the favorable foreign exchange impact of $2.6 million;  Domestic internal growth, excluding returns managements, was up approximately 6%; and International internal growth adjusted for foreign exchange was up over 5%. Domestic internal growth consisted of SQ up 8% and LQ up 3%. The regulated recalls and returns management services revenues were $16.1 million.Gross profit was $147.1 million or 46.9% of revenues. Excluding the restructuring costs, the gross margin would have been 47.2%. SG&A expense was $61.8 million or 19.7% of revenues. Net interest expense was $8.8 million and net income attributable to Stericycle was $44.6 million or $0.52 per share on an as-reported basis and $0.55 adjusted for transactional expenses related to acquisitions and restructuring costs.At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $382 million. Currently, $100 million of our revolver is hedged at an average fixed 2.83% LIBOR rate plus 75 basis points. The remaining $282 million is floating at LIBOR plus 75 basis points or the prime rate, whichever is lower. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $244 million.We repurchased 93,670 shares of common stock on the open market at an amount of $4.5 million in the quarter. Cumulatively, we have purchased approximately 13.2 million shares. We still have authorization to purchase an additional 3 million shares. Our CapEx was $10.3 million, and our DSO at the end of the quarter was 52 days. The cash provided from operations in the quarter was $63.3 million and $277.2 million for the year. And now, I will turn it over to Rich."

LQ sales growth was driven by the continued adoption of our Bio Systems offering and new service agreements. In summary, we ended Q4 with over 459,000 accounts, of which approximately 447,900 were small and the remainder, large. Now I'll turn it over to Mark."

Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. During the fourth quarter, we completed six acquisitions, two domestic and four international. The incremental revenue impact in the fourth quarter of this year was approximately $6.3 million. The annualized revenues of these acquisitions is approximately $59.9 million. But please keep in mind that our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and the related transactional expenses, but our guidance does include these items for the MedServe transaction completed at the end of Q4. We believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.34 to $2.40 which we're comfortable with. Please note that this guidance includes approximately $0.04 negative impact per share of acquisition integration expenses. We believe the analyst revenue estimates for 2010 will be in the range of $1.32 billion to $1.35 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange. We believe analysts will have estimates for net income between $202 million and $208 million, depending upon assumptions for margin improvement and interest expense. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow of $245 million to $255 million with CapEx anticipated between $45 million and $50 million.In closing, we're very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities this year and beyond. We thank you for your time. And operator, we'll now switch to the Q&A session."

The results for the first quarter are as follows: Revenues grew $58.1 million to $335.2 million, up 21% from $277.1 million in the first quarter of ’09. Revenues grew 19.1% when adjusted for the favorable foreign exchange impact of $5.2 million. Domestic internal growth, excluding returns management, was up 7%; and international internal growth adjusted for foreign exchange was up 7%. Domestic internal growth consisted of SQ up 8% and LQ up 5%. Regulated recalls and returns management services returns revenues were $26.3 million.
Gross profit was $155.3 million or 46.3% of revenues. Excluding the regulated returns management services restructuring cost, the gross margin would have been 46.5%. SG&A expense was $66 million or 19.7% of revenues. Net interest expense was $8.9 million, and the net income attributable to Stericycle was $48.1 million or $0.56 per share on an as-reported basis and $0.57 adjusted for after-tax transaction expenses related to acquisitions and restructuring costs.
At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $405 million, which is floating at LIBOR plus 75 basis points. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $251 million.
We repurchased 207,114 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $11.3 million, of which cash in the quarter to settle was $10.6 million. Cumulatively, we have repurchased approximately 13.4 million shares, and we still have authorization to purchase an additional 2.8 million shares.
Our capital spending in the quarter was $12.8 million, the DSO in the quarter was 51 days, and the cash provided from operations was $81.1 million for the quarter.

And please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. At the end of the first quarter, we completed six acquisitions, two domestic and four international. The annualized revenue of these six acquisitions is over $37 million. Keep in mind our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and the related transaction expenses, but our guidance does include these items for the MedServe transaction we spoke about in the last call.
We believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.38 per share to $2.44 per share, which we are comfortable with. And please note that this guidance includes approximately $0.04 per share negative impact from the acquisition integration expenses for MedServe. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2010 will be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.38 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange.
And we believe analysts will have estimates for net income between $206 million and $211 million depending on assumptions for margin improvement and interest expense. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow of between $245 million to $255 million, with CapEx anticipated between $45 million and $50 million.
In closing, we are very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities in 2010 and beyond. We thank you for listening to our prepared comments. And we’ll now answer your questions.

Some of our employees actually had severe damage to their homes. And again, the team pulled together across the world. The Stericycle folks kicked in money to help rebuild their homes and help them get back on track. So really a first-class effort by everybody in the local operations, and we were very impressed how quickly they recovered from a very dramatic natural disaster.

The results for the quarter are as follows: Revenues grew $58.1 million to $335.2 million, up 21% from $277.1 million in the first quarter of '09. Revenues grew 19.1% when adjusted for the favorable foreign exchange impact of $5.2 million. Domestic internal growth excluding Returns Management was up 7%, and international internal growth adjusted for exchange was up 7%.
Domestic internal growth consisted of SQ of 8% and LQ of 5%. Regulated Recalls and Returns Management Services revenues were $26.3 million. Gross profit was $155.3 million or 46.3% of revenues. Excluding the regulated Returns Management Service and restructuring costs, the gross margin would have been 46.5%. SG&A expense was $66 million or 19.7% of revenues. Net interest expense was $8.9 million and the net income attributable to Stericycle was $48.1 million or $0.56 per share on an as-reported basis and $0.57 adjusted for after-tax transaction expenses related to acquisitions and restructuring costs.
At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $405 million, which is floating at LIBOR plus 75 basis points. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $251 million. We repurchased 207,114 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $11.3 million of which cash in the quarter to settle was $10.6 million. Cumulatively, we have repurchased approximately 13.4 million shares, and we still have authorization to purchase an additional 2.8 million shares.
Our capital spending in the quarter was $12.8 million. The DSO in the quarter was 51 days, and the cash provided from operations was $81.1 million for the quarter.

And please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. At the end of the first quarter, we completed six acquisitions: Two domestic and four international. The annualized revenue of these six acquisitions is over $37 million. Keep in mind our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and the related transaction expenses, but our guidance does include these items for the MedServe transaction we spoke about in the last call. 
We believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.38 per share to $2.44 per share, which we are comfortable with. And please note that this guidance includes approximately $0.04 per share negative impact from the acquisition integration expenses for MedServe. 
We believe analysts revenue estimates for 2010 will be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.38 billion depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange. And we believe analysts will have estimates for net income between $206 million and $211 million depending on assumptions for margin improvement and interest expense. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow of between $245 million and $255 million with CapEx anticipated between $45 million and $50 million. In closing, we're very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities in 2010 and beyond.

So again, Steri-Safe is a three-legged stool. New customers coming in, signing them up for the higher levels, existing customers to get them into, and they may start at the entry level and then upsell them. And just for everyone's information, the upselling is very powerful. So a premium level customer is almost six times more lucrative for us because we get about $700 maybe to $1,000 more in revenues from them whereas an entry level for just the standard entry level for the training is maybe like $200, $250 more. So again, it's not just the people that are on the program, but then also the mix of people within the program. And there is opportunities on both sides to expand with customers that are not yet on domestic and international as well as the upselling, which is a huge opportunity for us still."

Revenues grew 19.1% when adjusted for the favorable foreign exchange impact of $5.2 million. Domestic internal growth excluding Returns Management was up 7%, and international internal growth adjusted for exchange was up 7%.
Domestic internal growth consisted of SQ of 8% and LQ of 5%. Regulated Recalls and Returns Management Services revenues were $26.3 million. Gross profit was $155.3 million or 46.3% of revenues. Excluding the regulated Returns Management Service and restructuring costs, the gross margin would have been 46.5%. SG&A expense was $66 million or 19.7% of revenues. Net interest expense was $8.9 million and the net income attributable to Stericycle was $48.1 million or $0.56 per share on an as-reported basis and $0.57 adjusted for after-tax transaction expenses related to acquisitions and restructuring costs.
At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $405 million, which is floating at LIBOR plus 75 basis points. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $251 million. We repurchased 207,114 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $11.3 million of which cash in the quarter to settle was $10.6 million. Cumulatively, we have repurchased approximately 13.4 million shares, and we still have authorization to purchase an additional 2.8 million shares.

The annualized revenue of these six acquisitions is over $37 million. Keep in mind our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and the related transaction expenses, but our guidance does include these items for the MedServe transaction we spoke about in the last call. 
We believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.38 per share to $2.44 per share, which we are comfortable with. And please note that this guidance includes approximately $0.04 per share negative impact from the acquisition integration expenses for MedServe. 
We believe analysts revenue estimates for 2010 will be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.38 billion depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange. And we believe analysts will have estimates for net income between $206 million and $211 million depending on assumptions for margin improvement and interest expense. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow of between $245 million and $255 million with CapEx anticipated between $45 million and $50 million.

Revenues grew $58.5 million to $347.7 million up 20.2% from $289 million in the second quarter of 09.  Domestic internal growth excluding returns management was up 8.1% and international internal growth adjusted forex change was up 9.4%.  Domestic internal growth consists of SQ of 9% and large quantity of 6%.   Regulated recalls and returns management services revenues were $25.4 million.  
The gross profit was $161.5 million or 46.5% of revenues.  Excluding the regulator returns management services restructuring costs, the gross margin would have been 46.7%
SG&A expense was $67.3 million or 19.3% of revenues.  Net interest expense was $8.8 million and net income attributable to Stericycle was $53.1 million or $0.61 per share on an as-reported basis and $0.62 adjusted for after-tax transaction expenses related to various non operating items.
At the end of the quarter the revolver borrowings were approximately $359 million which is floating at LIBOR plus 75 basis points.  The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $297 million.
On July 16th, 2010, we received informal commitments from 22 institutional investors to purchase $175 million of min 3.89% seven-year unsecured senior notes and $225 million of new ten-year 4.47% on secured senior notes.  We anticipate that the note purchase agreement will be signed in August of 2010 and that the new senior notes will be issued in October, 2010.  The proceeds of this new agreement will be used to repay return debts and a portion of the revolver.  
We repurchased 235,436 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $13 million in the quarter.  Cumulatively we have purchased approximately 13.6 million shares and we still have authorization to purchase an additional 2.6 million shares.  
The capital spending in the quarter was $12.2 million, our DSO was 51 days and the cash provided from operations was $129.3 for the first six months of 2010.

At the end of the quarter we had over 471,000 accounts of which approximately 459,000 were small and 12,000 were large.

At the end of the quarter we had over 471,000 accounts of which approximately 459,000 were small and 12,000 were large.  We continue to see strong growth across all geographies fuelled by new customers and a continued adoption of our value added services.
Let me quote the worldwide growth opportunity in the context for you.  With our large quantity customers we now have multiple service offerings which can potentially triple the value of each account.  Today less than 20% of LQ customers are using multiple services leaving more than 80% of our LQ customer base available for growth by adding services such as Sharps Management and RX Waste.  
Likewise, with our small quantity customers we offer multiple services which can also triple the value of each account.  Today approximately a third of our SQ customers utilize multiple services leaving two-thirds of our customer base available for growth by adding services like Steri-Safe clinical services and RX Waste.
We’re particularly excited about the recently launched RX Waste program for our domestic large and small customers.  This program is now rolled out across the entire U.S. and is also available in a number of our international geographies. We’re getting favorable feedback from customers about our unique in-service capability which helps them stay compliant.
In closing we want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their solid performance and continued commitment to our customers and our shareholders.
I’ll turn it over to Mark.

And please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. At the end of the second quarter we completed four acquisitions; two domestic and two international.  The analyzed revenues of these four acquisitions is approximately $12 million.  Now keep in mind our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures of the related transaction expenses, but our guidance does include these items for the transactions already closed.
We believe analysts EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.42 to $2.46 which we are comfortable with.  We believe analyst’s revenue estimates for 2010 will be in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.39 billion depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange.
We believe analysts will have estimates for net income between $210 million and $213 million depending on assumptions for margin improvement and interest expense.  And we believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow of between $245 million and $255 million with capital expenditures anticipated between $45 million to $50 million.
In closing, we are very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities in 2010 and beyond. We thank you for listening to our prepared comments. And the operator will now turn it over to the Q&A session.

And it’s very different from country to country because volume could impact it if you think about it because of down economy. But then in countries where there is national health care and the like, that’s not really an impact.
So if you look overall to all the recessions now that have been here at, we have not seen an impact on our volumes and as we’ve indicated before. So this again is an industry that’s insulated it seems from the economic up and downs. There is probably slightly less volume growth in large quantity because they keep losing it to the outpatient centers and the like.
So it’s more volume growth in the outpatient and the small customers. What’s driving industry growth is the baby boom, what’s driving it is more regulatory frameworks like Pharma is also being driven by regulatory framework. Those are very positive for us and overall the percent of business that really gets bill based on volume is not that high.
Steri-Safe is a fixed monthly fee with overages, the remainder of the customers that are small are billed by the container and so the weight and the container is really not a driver of the amount of revenues. If you look at large customers, they may be volume driven both on the container or a per pound basis but also the programs such the RX Waste and even Bio charts are fixed monthly fees.
So again all those combined make the percentage of business that’s volume driven not that high.
