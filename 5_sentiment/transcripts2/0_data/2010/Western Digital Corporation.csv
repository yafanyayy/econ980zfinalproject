Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. For the third consecutive quarter, demand for hard drives was at the high end of expectations, as the positive industry conditions that first materialized in the June quarter continued throughout",1116,"Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. For the third consecutive quarter, demand for hard drives was at the high end of expectations, as the positive industry conditions that first materialized in the June quarter continued throughout the second half of the calendar year. The demand strength continues to be primarily consumer-driven, but we are now also seeing some signs of recovery in the commercial sector.We believe that overall hard drive shipments in the December quarter totaled 160 million units, up 29% on the year-ago quarter and 5% sequentially. Industry inventory, OEM and distribution combined remains extremely lean at approximately two weeks of sales, reflecting the strong demand in the quarter, constraints in the industry supply chain, particularly in media and substrate, and continued industry discipline and managing the supply demand dynamic in those segments where supply constraints are not dominant.We're very pleased with WD's continued progress in pursuit of our primary objective of sustained profitable growth, as we continue to respond the strength in customer demand. For the third consecutive quarter, we significantly increased output in a supply constrained environment, providing strong support of our customers' growth opportunities. Strength in overall market demand, continued customer preference for WD products. Our timely investments in capital, the support of our supply partners and strong execution by the WD team generated record revenue on profits on record unit shipments.A moderate pricing environment, combined with our passionate focus on cost and efficiency, enabled gross margins well above the high end of our model range. We contained operating expenses under the low end of our model, yet we continued to grow our R&D investments by 8% sequentially.Asset management remained crisp, resulting in record cash generation. I'm particularly pleased that our management through the difficulties of the recession and our subsequent response to improving market conditions since April have increased our calendar year 2009 revenues and net income by 4% and 34%, respectively, compared with calendar year 2008. Our compound annual growth rate over the last three calendar years, which includes the dampening of effect of the recession was 19% for revenue, 25% for units and 29% for net income.We continue to realize tangible benefit from the substantial investments we've made in technology, products, processes and capacity over the last few years, with several notable product achievements in the last quarter. Most significant, as part of our sustained portfolio diversification and expansion strategy, is our entry into the traditional enterprise market, with the shipment of our 2.5-inch 10K SAS product line beginning in early November.This new product family complements the range of enterprise SATA drives, which we have been shipping for some years now, and will allow us to both expand our business with many existing customers and add new customers in the enterprise storage arena. In the December quarter, driven by strong customer adoption of our newest products, we led the industry and volume shipments of the market's largest capacity points in the industry's fastest growing segments. 1 terabyte, 750 gigabyte and 640 gigabyte 2.5-inch drives in the branded products and notebook markets and 2 terabyte 3.5-inch drives in the branded and enterprise SATA sectors.In the branded products area, we continue to innovate. Our new WD SmartWare, which is now available across our refreshed My Passport and My Book external storage product lines has received very positive reviews for its highly intuitive, easy-to-use visual representation of the backup and synchronization process, providing a highly differentiated and superior user experience. Further developing the theme of convenience and ease of use, we also introduced e-label display features on our premium external storage product lines.In media players, we expanded our popular WD TV range with the successful launch of our WD TV Live product, which adds network connectivity, enabling home content aggregation, as well as direct access to stream external content. Additionally, this month, we launched the industry's first certified USB 3.0 external drive with the My Book 3.0, an industry-leading high-performance solution for power users.Entering calendar 2010, we are very excited about the immediate and the long-term growth opportunities for WD in both the Consumer and Commercial Storage segments. Over the last nine months, despite the backdrop of a worldwide recession, we have seen increasing levels of demand for high-capacity, cost-effective storage. We believe this demand is driven by the ubiquitous role of digital content in everyday life and spurred in the Consumer segment by increasingly versatile and powerful devices and PCs with new attractive price points.In support of this thesis, yesterday's New York Times cited a recent study from the Kaiser Family Foundation that determined the average young American now spends practically every waking minutes, except for time of school, using a smartphone, computer, television or other electronic device, amounting to more than 7.5 hours a day. This compares with less than six and a half hours five years ago. And this does not count the hour and a half that you'd spend texting or the half hour they talk on their phones. And because so many of them are multi-tasking, they pack an average of nearly 11 hours of media content into that seven and a half hours.Meanwhile, in the commercial sector, the prospects for a recovery in corporate IT spending, the demand for green IT infrastructure solutions and a PC refresh cycle provide more optimistic indicators than a year ago at this time. We are addressing what we believe is a secular shift to increase usage of mass volume storage in all walks of life. To do so, we are focusing on enhancing the advantaged business model we have developed over the last several years.In responding to our customers needs and earning their business in the fastest growing markets, we provide a critical combination of quality and reliability, portfolio breadth, technology and product availability, underpinned by our low cost model, our vertical integration, the industry's fastest asset turns and strongest balance sheet. We believe this WD focus represents a sustainable advantage, as we continue to respond to customer needs in our existing markets, and as we move into new markets for WD, such as the traditional enterprise.However, our enthusiasm is tempered by current microeconomic uncertainties. And we continually monitor the actual demand data and remain on guard against excessive optimism about the 2010 outlook. We are maintaining our flexibility and agility and are willing to apply the brakes, if conditions warrant. Before I pass the call to Tim Leyden, I want to thank the WD team and our supply partners for outstanding execution in seizing the opportunities that emerged throughout the quarter and our customers for providing those opportunities. Once again, we have further strengthened WD and our long-term mission of generating sustained profitable growth. Tim?"

Revenue for our second fiscal quarter was $2.6 billion, up 44% from the prior year and 19% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 49.5 million units, up 39% from the prior year periods and 12%, sequentially. Non-hard drive revenue, including sales of WD TV HD Media players and Solid-State Drives totaled approximately $47 million, compared to $12 million in the prior year and $36 million in the September quarter.Average have drive selling price was approximately $52 per unit, up $1 from the year-ago quarter and up $3 from the September quarter. Industry demand was strong, coming in at the high-end of our anticipated range of 152 million to 160 million units. Within that environment, demand for WD's products was stronger than expected. We satisfied a disproportionate share of the overall market growth, which is a validation of the benefits of having a large-scale virtually-integrated and agile business model. Our low-cost focus, combined with a favorable products and segments mix, moderate price declines enabled us to service that demand at margins that exceeded our business model parameters.This tough demand was stronger than expected due in part to the re-emerging commercial market and growth in China. The market size was constrained by supply and pricing remained stable. We see unfulfilled demand rolling over into the third quarter. We shipped 21.2 million mobile drives in the December quarter, compared to 13.8 million in the year-ago quarter and 19.2 million in the September quarter. This above-market growth was driven primarily by our ability to meet customer appetite for high-capacity drives at 640 gigabytes and above.During the December quarter, we shipped 4.1 million drives into the DDR market, flat with the year ago quarter and up from 3.1 million in the September quarter. This improvement in sequential quarterly volume was driven by an improved market demand and adoption of our WD GreenPower drive platforms.Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV, was $569 million, up 41% from $403 million in the year-ago quarter, and 49% sequentially from $382 million in the September quarter. The increase in branded revenue is partly due to increasing demand for external storage, the refresh of our branded products line and continued consumer preference for WD products in this space.On the enterprise front, demand for near-line storage once again exceeded expectations. And our SATA product portfolio was well-positioned to avail of this market expansion and mix up, particularly at the high-capacity point. The traditional enterprise markets continues to recover. In this space, we are pleased with the acceptance of our new SAS products.Moving on to our sales channel and geographic results. Revenue by channel was 48% OEM, 30% distribution and 22% branded products in the December quarter, compared with 57%, 21% and 22% in the year-ago quarter, and 52%, 31% and 17% in the September quarter, respectively. The geographic space of our revenue was 25% Americas, 25% Europe and 50% Asia, as compared to 23%, 29% and 48% in the year-ago quarter, and 22%, 22% and 56% in the September quarter.The increases in the percentages for Americas and Europe from the September quarter which reflects strength in branded products and in components distribution. There was one customer, HP, that comprise more than 10% of our total revenue. Our gross margin percentage for the quarter was 26.2%, up from 15.9% in the year-ago quarter and 23.3% in the September call. As mentioned earlier, our low-cost focused, our favorable products and segment mix and moderate price declines, contributed to gross margin favorability.Total R&D and SG&A spending was $214 million or 8.2% of revenue. This compares with $161 million or 8.8% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $195 million or 8.8% of revenue in the September call. Our spending reflects our confidence in the strong future opportunities for storage and in the environment of expanding digital content.Operating income was $473 million or 18.1% of revenue. This compares with $16 million or 1% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $319 million or 14.4% of revenue in the September call.Interest and other non-operating expenses were approximately $2 million. Tax expense for the December quarter was $42 million or 8.9% of pretax income. And that's within our model range of 7% to 10%. Our cash tax rate is expected to be between 1% and 2% for the fiscal year. Our net income totaled $429 million or $1.85 per share. This compares with $14 million or $0.06 per share and $288 million or $1.25 per share in the year-ago and September quarters, respectively. Turning to the balance sheet, for the December quarter, our cash conversion cycle was a negative three days. This consisted of 47 days of receivables outstanding, 21 days of inventory or 17 turns and 71 days of payables.We generated $557 million in cash flows from operations, capital expenditures were $199 million and depreciation and amortization totaled $126 million. We also made our third quarterly debt repayment installment of $19 million, thus reducing our debt balance to $444 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $379 million, ending at $2.435 billion.The 49.5 million hard drives we shipped in the December quarter represent a new output record for the company. We believe that 2010 will be a strong year for the proliferation of digital storage and continued customer preference for WD products. Consequently, we are increasing our capital expenditure forecasts for fiscal 2010 to between $650 million and $750 million, compared with our previous projection of $650 million. Depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2010 is now expected to be about $550 million as compared to our previous estimate of $540 million.We are ever mindful of the potential for a dip in demand that may be caused by economic circumstances beyond our control. And we remained focused on supply-demand equilibrium and poised to use our flexible and agile business model to respond quickly to demand changes.Over the medium term, we continue to have strong growth potential in the existing markets we serve and in currently on addressed markets. Given our market position stock portfolio leading us to invest in R&D and production assets and our strong balance sheet. Nevertheless, we are actively seeking to augment this strength by selective investments in product line expansion, both internally and externally.We have $466 million remaining in our stock repurchase authorization as we evaluate the merits of further repurchases against internal and external investment alternatives. Now I will discuss our expectations for the third quarter of our fiscal year 2010.First, let me outline the market situation as we see it. We believe that continued demand for storage of digital contents will drive positive growth for the storage industry as a whole, despite global macro economic conditions, continuing to be challenging. In this robust storage demand environment, we believe that WD is well-positioned within the industry to benefit from this growing market because of our agility, flexibility, product lineup, technology and financial resources.Historically, March quarter demand has been down sequentially in a range from 5% to 7%. However, we believe that true demand in the December quarter was not entirely satisfied. And this couples with an expectation of continuing strong demand from digital storage, leads us to model the market size of between 152 million to 158 million units, a sequential decline of 1% to 5%.We anticipate that pricing would be flat to down but will be rational based on supply-demand balance in all markets. Consequently, we expect current quarter revenue for WD to be in a range from $2.45 billion to $2.6 billion. R&D and SG&A are expected to total approximately $220 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $2 million. We expect our tax rate to be about 9%. We anticipate our share counts to be approximately 235 million. Accordingly, we estimate earnings per share of between $1.45 and $1.55 for the March quarter.  Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions."

If you look at total industry demonstrated capability last quarter, and I certainly don't think anybody was holding back product, then potentially, we could rebuild a couple of million units into inventory through the quarter running full out, which wouldn't move the needle very much off of the very lean inventory environment. So I expect if there's any real inventory replenishment to get things into a more traditional sustainable model, that will occur in the June quarter. And that will be required to occur in the June quarter in order to support what we expect to be a very robust back half of the year. And again, I believe industry supply chain investments are lagging opportunity and will constrain total availability through the entire calendar year."

And so those devices are interacting with tons of storage of content that people want to capture and store for extended periods. They're generating content. If you look at the number of devices today that have high-resolution cameras, I mean and high-resolution video capability. So the amount of content being generated by the small devices with small capacity solid-state storage onboard is generating huge demand for transfer to max storage capability. The best of which is the externally attached hard drive. So we think that's the fundamental underlying driver. Relative to WD's success in this area, I think we've talked before and we're continuing to focus on the means of use, where the style, the convenience of the product and delivering leading capacity points to the market. And I think all of these things combined with our consistent interaction with our channel partners and consistent positioning of our product line makes that a very attractive line for our partners and results in a very high level of access to consumers for the WD brand."

We believe you've seen in our performance and Seagate's performance in the past quarter, I think you're beginning to see the power of the large-scale, vertically-integrated companies when executing effectively and the consequent ability to continue to invest substantially in the technology to drive future solutions to that storage demand. So I think all of those things point towards a very positive environment, we're not yet at the point where we're altering our model.

In relation to desktop, I think that the primary driver there, there's a healthy resurgence in commercial desktop demand. That's a -- continues to be a price-sensitive business. And the difference between desktop, replacing a desktop system which potentially can reuse a lot of accessories and so on, versus going to mobile. Combine that with CIO concerns about security and mobility of data and so on. I think there's good life ahead of us in the desktop PC arena. On the consumer side of the desktop, it's really the high-end machines there that offer the geeks and freaks the ability to configure systems as they desire with very high-performance, high-capacity solutions. And then of course, the 3.5-inch drives going into external solutions, where increasingly, we're seeing adoption of all network systems. Things like the WD World Edition and WD Share Space, which provide whole home solutions for a multiple network computers that are very simple to operate. These also have a healthy appetite for a very high-capacity 3.5-inch drives. So I think they're the fundamental drivers of demand there."

Now we believe these are very strong secular moves that are offering a growth path that is layered on top of the modest recovery that we're seeing in worldwide economic activity today. Frankly, we think the worldwide economic recovery is a lot more fragile than the growth in demand for digital content distribution and storage of all kinds. So what could go wrong would be, I think the primary concern would be a macro economic event, a macro economic deterioration. And we're watching actual demand very closely and events in the world around us to track that. And what we can do in that environment, if it were to occur, will be similar to what we did when it occurred last year. On the other front, I think concerns that seem to swirl around about capacity investments being made in the industry are way overblown, if you look at our capital investment behavior over the past several years and recognize the activities in which we're investing have significantly changed. You go back to 2003, we were a pure play drive assembly company, with very low CapEx requirements. We added heads, which engendered the significant increase in CapEx requirements. We then added media in 2007, which adds a further level of CapEx requirement. But in all cases, we have been very close coupled in terms of our investment decisions relative to -- are all made on a back off the day, we think they're needed by the lead time of the equipment. And we worked very hard with our capital equipment supply base to limit those lead times and to continually shorten those lead times. So we're very focused on just-in-time investment to support what we believe is real demand. We've also shown in the last year a willingness and ability to tune our utilization of the assets that we have invested in to the actual market requirements. And we've demonstrated that doing that, that behavior generates far more reward for us than any other behavior. And I think most of our colleagues in the industry have demonstrated similar learning and similar behavior. So I'm very positive about the industry's ability to see what's going on in terms of real demand and take appropriate actions to match supply to that demand. The biggest concern I have right now is that the level of investment being put into capital by the extended supply chain is inadequate to support the opportunities that we believe are there through the end of the calendar year and beyond."

So again, I think we'll break them out somewhat more as they become individually larger and significant for the overall business results.

Overall demand for hard drives in the March quarter was stronger than we anticipated at 163 million units. As we saw a sequential industry time, grow 2% in contrast to a typical seasonal decline of five to 7%. This adds support to the growing body of evidence that in the midst of significant economic uncertainty over the last 12 months, the creation, transmission, consumption and storage of digital content has become much more pervasive in our lives than anyone had previously appreciated. 
Over the last year, we have seen increasing levels of demand for high capacity cost effective storage. We believe this demand is at core driven by the ubiquitous role of digital content in every day life. Spared in the consumer segment by increasingly versatile and powerful handheld devices and PCs with new and attractive price points, and in the commercial sector by a drive for growth and efficiency especially in developing markets. 
Industry inventory, OEM, distribution and retail combined remains at just over two weeks of sales, reflecting continued strong demand, continuing spotty constraints in the industry supply chain and continued industry discipline in managing the supply demand dynamic. For more than eight years now WD has generated sustained profitable growth and outstanding returns for our shareholders by consistently executing to our customer centric business strategy with passion, focus and perseverance. 
Customers continued to demonstrate a strong preference for WD products in the March quarter. And this enabled us to again post record unit shipments and revenue with strong profitability. We’re very pleased that in such a dynamic environment we again helped our customers to succeed in their markets by responding quickly to their changing requirements for volume and mix. A relatively moderate pricing environment combined with our cross segment agility and our focus on cost and efficiency, once again enabled gross margins above the high end of our model range. 
Asset management remained crisp resulting in record cash generation. We continued to innovate and lead and multiple markets based on the significant investments we have made in people, products, processes, capacity and technology over the last few years with several recent notable product achievements. 
In our client business, we began volume shipment of the industries highest aerial density, Standard 2-Disk, 2.5 inch drive, the 750 gigabyte WD Scorpio Blue Hard Drive for mainstream notebook computers. We doubled the capacity of the WD VelociRaptor, the worlds fastest SATA hard drive to 600 gigabytes delivering high performance and capacity for both enthusiast and enterprise customers. 
We launched our first consumer oriented solid state drive family, the WD SiliconEdge Blue in capacities up to 256 gigabytes. In our branded products business, this week we introduced a new app for the iPhone called WD Photos, a photo viewer that gives our customers quick access to all their photos stored on their My Book World Edition or WD Share Space network drives from their iPhone or iPod Touch. Also specifically designed for Mac users, we added a new high speed My Passport Studio Family and a one terabyte Passport SE to our range of popular hard drives. 
In the CE market, we launched the WD AV-25 range of 2.5 inch SATA drives engineered specifically for demanding always on multimedia streaming applications such as DVR and surveillance. We also introduced the My Passport AV media drive family optimized for video storage and playback and designed to work directly with select Sony camcorders, Blu-ray players and other popular media players. 
In the embedded market, we introduced the WD silicon drive in 1X family of (SLZ) based solid-state drives with capacities up to 128 gigabytes delivering high performance and high reliability for embedded system OEM applications. Our participation in the traditional enterprise market, part of our portfolio diversification and expansion strategy which started with the shipment of our 2.5 inch 10K SAS product line beginning in early November is preceding inline with our measured multiyear plan to establish solid experience and a representative share in this important market segment. 
We remain committed to continued investment in the development of our people, technology, product breadth and appropriate capacity while enhancing the advantage business model we have developed over the last several years. In responding to our customers needs and earning their business in the fastest growing markets we provide a critical combination of quality and reliability, portfolio breadth, technology and product availability under pinned by our low cost model, our vertical integration, our rapid inventory turns and our balance sheet strength. 
We believe this WD focus represents a sustainable advantage as we continue to respond to customer needs in our existing markets and as move into new markets for WD. We believe that calendar year 2010 will be an extremely strong year for storage and we’re excited about the opportunity to continue to satisfy customer requirements to meet this demand. 
Before I pass the call to Tim Leyden, I want to mention that tomorrow Friday April 23, WD will mark its 40th Anniversary spending four decades of innovation, passion, perseverance and success. I want to acknowledge the contributions of our thousands of employees our customers and suppliers in helping us every step of the way. In particular I want to acknowledge the team’s outstanding execution in ceasing the customer opportunities that emerge throughout the most recent quarter which has further strengthened WD in our long term mission of generating sustained profitable growth.

Pricing remains stable as a result of the unexpectedly strong demand. We shipped 19.8 million mobile drives in the March quarter, compared to 10.1 in the year ago quarter and 21.2 million in the December quarter. We reduced our mobile volumes in response to the expected seasonality in branded products and to balance the effect of competitors in the mobile market, who diverted their capacity from the gaming segment. 
During the March quarter, we shipped 4.6 million drives into the DVR market compared to 3.5 million in the year ago quarter and 4.1 million in the December quarter. Our strong product line up led to revenue gains in both our OEM and channel businesses. Revenue from sales of our branded products including WD TV was $467 million, up 36% from $343 million from the year ago quarter and down 18% sequentially from $569 million in the December quarter, reflecting the typical seasonality of the retail market.

The Americas and European regions performed as expected at 24% for the Americas and 24% for Europe in the March quarter, compared to 26% and 28% in the year ago quarter and 25% and 25% in the December quarter. 
Our gross margin for the quarter was 25.2% up from 15.9% in the year ago quarter and down from 26.2% in the December quarter. Total on the SG&A spending was $224 million or 8.5% of revenue. This compares with $174 million or 10.9% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $214 million or 8.2% of revenue in the December quarter. Our R&D investment is focused on broadening our product offerings in response to customer needs and developing technologies in order to maintain our market competitiveness. 
Operating income was $441 million or 16.7% of revenue. This compares with $61 million or 3.8% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $473 million or 18.1% of revenue in the December quarter. Interest and other non-operating expenses were approximately $1 million. Tax expense for the March quarter was $40 million a 9.1% of free tax income, within our model range of seven to 10%. Our cash tax rate is expected to be between one and 2% for the fiscal year. 
Our net income totaled $400 million or $1.71 per share. This compares with $50 million or $0.22 per share and $429 million or $1.85 per share in the year ago and December quarters respectively. Turning to the balance sheet for the March quarter, our cash conversion cycle was a negative three days, this consisted of 43 days of receivables, 23 days of inventory or 16 turns and 69 days of payables. We generated $588 in cash flow from operations. 
Capital expenditures were $177 million and depreciation and amortization totaled $128 million. We also made our fourth quarterly debt repayment installments of $19 million, reducing our debt balance to $425 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $391 million ending at $2.826 billion. 
On our January call, we updated our capital expenditure forecast for fiscal 2010 to be between $650 and $750 million. We now expect to be at the high end of that range as we put investments in place to support the expected strength in the market as well as continued customer preference for WD products. Depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2010 is expected to be about $520 million. As we have consistently demonstrated in the past, we remained focused on supply demand equilibrium and ready to adjust capacity utilization in accordance with market needs. 
Our strong cash position allows us to maintain an adequate buffer in times of continued global economic uncertainty are still providing the operational flexibility to secure component supply, increase our investments in advanced technology and expand our product breadth through pursuing internal and external opportunities. We have $466 million remaining in our stock repurchase authorization as we continue to evaluate the merits of further repurchases against the internal and external investment alternatives. 
Now I will discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2010. Market indicators and customer inputs continued to strengthen our beliefs that demand for hard drives will be strong throughout the calendar year and beyond. WD remains ideally positioned to service these market needs to draw the existing customer and supplier relationships, product line up, operational agility, technology and financial resources. 
Historically, June quarter demand has been slight to moderately down when compared to March volumes and we expect that seasonality pattern to continue. Consequently we are forecasting volumes in the 157 to 162 million unit range. We anticipate that pricing will be competitive or will be rational based on advanced technology deployment, supply demand balance and inventory positions in all channels. 
I would note that our outlook is based on an assumption that the con disruption of the European air traffic is short lived and that the economic activity is made up during the balance of the quarter. Accordingly we expect current quarter revenue for WD to be in a range from $2.475 billion to $2.575 billion. R&D and SG&A are expected to total approximately $230 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $1 million. We expect our tax rate to be about 9%. We anticipate our share counts to be approximately 236 million. We estimate earnings per share between $1.40 and $1.50 for the June quarter. Bob?

If you model the actual for March the high end of our expectation for TAM in the   June quarter at 162 and then take a 12 or 13% increase into the third quarter and three to 5% in the fourth quarter, you come to 690. We think that range is highly probable and towards the high end of that range. We are working diligently with our supply base to ensure that WD supports the growth opportunities of our customers in relation to that anticipated market size. There is a risk that it will be hotter than that, given that we’re not only are we seeing the strength we’ve seen in the last 12 months in consumer which has been considerable and above everyone’s expectations, now being augmented by the beginnings of a corporate purchasing cycle. 
If I had to bet on which end of that range would come up or to be the high end with possible topside opportunity from a TAM perspective. We’re working with a supply base to support that, its going to be a real stretch, as a result of last years economic recession, the level of capital investment that was made during that period was minimal and we’ve been in catch up mode ever since and supply base for capital equipment is pretty stretched. So even we’re the best one in the world, we’re going to have difficulty as an industry I believe across the entire supply chain in fully reaping the benefits of that opportunity.

As Tim mentioned in his remarks, I mean we diverted some of our builds capacity and supply chain capacity to 3.5 inch where we saw significant strength in demand and that offered a better business opportunity for us in a overall restricted supply situation. So we focused on those areas, which offered us the best return.
As you go down or go to other competitors particularly those who traditionally have serviced the gaming market, which is as heavy demand for 2.5 inch in the back half of the calendar year, to them the business at least attractive to us in the first couple of quarters of the year looks highly attractive relative to gaming. 
So typically they divert their seasonally available capacity that was dedicated to gaming in the back half of the year, they diverted it to the low end of the 2.5 mainstream business in the first couple of quarters that would typically be the component supply into the second tier branded external storage box manufacturers and some diversion into notebook support.

I think it’s a - I think when you look at the overall increase in transparency and the increased information they provided yesterday, it’s a very impressive recovery story. 
And it demonstrates I think clearly, if you look at Hitachi’s product mix model, it’s much closer to the Seagate model than it is to WD’s. If you look at Seagate, you can see they derive somewhere in the between 25% and 30% of revenue from enterprise, all enterprise that includes traditional and near line storage. 
You can see that Hitachi probably derives somewhere in the mid-20 to 25% range and WD derives about 10%. So it’s a - an overall business mix thing, plus my earlier comment about the smaller you are, the more appropriate and able you are to pick your products and cherry pick your overall business. 
So - but I think a - a superb recovery story there that that just reinforces I think what we and Seagate have been saying to the investment community for several years now that with the proper business model with which at a scale of this opportunity today is a vertically integrated large scale, efficiently run manufacturing operation with measured marketing and failed activity that this is a highly desirable business. 
And when we look at the opportunities and the level of content generation that’s going on around us and the demand level for storage, this properly addressed, this is a fantastic business opportunity. 
And I think the fact that Hitachi have now opened the Kimono and being more forthcoming with how they are running the business, I think the investment community should be a lot more prepared to give the HDD industry a little more of its due relative to its opportunity provide significant return on investment.

One, NAND flash supply is going to be even tighter than the supply chain for the - for hard drives based on the success of highly mobile devices that absolutely have to have NAND flash to make them work. And that represents the vast bulk of the demand profile for NAND flash. And when you look at the level of investment that’s been put in to the flash market, it will be very tight through the back half of the year we believe.
Your follow-up relative - also NAND flash does not address the storage requirements of the vast bulk of those devices that traditionally use hard drives. If it did, I guess the only thing we would be selling is single head single platter. 
So then on your tablet question, that makes it even more unlikely that there is going to be an SSD migration in the mainstream PC business, and we see tablets similar to net book that it will create yet another category of device which will initially consume created content which must be stored from where, which will drive requirements for near line storage, cloud support. And as we look at the specs of some of the prospective tablets that are coming along, they will also have content generation capability. And we see it all as positive addition to the total infrastructural demand that’s going to drive our business into the future.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Overall demand for hard drives in the March quarter was stronger than we anticipated at 163 million units as we saw a sequential industry turn grow 2% in contrast to a typical seasonal decli",891,"Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Overall demand for hard drives in the March quarter was stronger than we anticipated at 163 million units as we saw a sequential industry turn grow 2% in contrast to a typical seasonal decline of 5% to 7%. This adds support to the growing body of evidence that in the midst of significant economic uncertainty over the last 12 months, the creation, transmission, consumption and storage of digital content has become much more pervasive in our lives than anyone had previously appreciated.
Over the last year, we have seen increasing levels of demand for high-capacity cost-effective storage. We believe this demand is at core driven by the ubiquitous role of digital content in everyday life, spurred in the Consumer segment by increasingly versatile and powerful handheld devices and PCs with new and attractive price points. And in the Commercial sector by a drive in growth and efficiency, especially in developing markets.
Industry inventory. OEM, distribution and retail combined remains at just over two weeks of sales, reflecting continued strong demand, continuing spotty constraints in the industry supply chain and continued industry discipline in managing the supply-demand dynamic. For more than eight years now WD has generated sustained profitable growth and outstanding returns for our shareholders by consistently executing to our customer-centric business strategy with passion, focus and perseverance. 
Customers continue to demonstrate a strong preference for WD products in the March quarter. And this enabled us to again post record unit shipments and revenue with strong profitability. We're very pleased that in such a dynamic environment we again helped our customers to succeed in their markets by responding quickly to their changing requirements for volume and mix.
A relatively moderate pricing environment, combined with our cross-segment agility and our focus on cost and efficiency, once again enabled gross margins above the high end of our model range. Asset-management remained crisp, resulting in record cash generation.
We continue to innovate and lead in multiple markets based on the significant investments we have made in people, products, processes, capacity and technology over the last few years with several recent notable product achievements.
In our Client business we began volume shipment of the industry's highest aerial density standard 2-disc 2.5-inch drive, the 750 GB WD Scorpio Blue hard drive for mainstream notebook computers. We doubled the capacity of the WD VelociRaptor, the world's fastest SATA hard drive to 600 GB, delivering high performance and capacity for both enthusiast and enterprise customers. We launched our first consumer-oriented solid-state drive family, the WD SiliconEdge Blue in capacities up to 256 gigabytes.
In our Branded Products business, this week we introduced a new app for the iPhone called WD Photos, a photo viewer that gives our customers quick access to all their photos stored on their My Book World Edition or WD ShareSpace network drives from their iPhone or iPod Touch. Also specifically designed for Mac users, we added a new high-speed My Passport Studio family and a 1 TB Passport SE to our range of popular hard drives.
In the CE market, we launched that WD AV 25 range off 2.5-inch SATA drives engineered specifically for demanding, always on, multimedia streaming applications, such as DVR and surveillance. We also introduced the My Passport AV Media Drive family optimized for video storage and playback, and designed to work directly with select Sony camcorders, Blu-ray players and other popular media players.
In the embedded market, we introduced the WD SiliconDrive N1x family of SLC-based solid state drives with capacities up to 128 gigabytes, delivering high performance and high reliability for embedded system OEM applications.
Our participation in the traditional enterprise market, part of our portfolio diversification and expansion strategy, which started with the shipment of our 2.5-inch 10K SAS product line beginning in early November, is proceeding in line with our measured, multi-year plan to establish solid experience and a representative share in this important market segment.
We remain committed to continued investment in the development of our people, technology, product breadth and appropriate capacity while enhancing the advantage business model we have developed over the last several years. In responding to our customers' needs and earning their business in the fastest-growing markets, we provide a critical combination of quality and reliability, portfolio breadth, technology and product availability underpinned by our low-cost model, our vertical integration, our rapid inventory turns and our balance sheet strength.
We believe this WD focus represents a sustainable advantage as we continue to respond to customer needs in our existing markets and as we move into new markets for WD.
We believe that calendar year 2010 will be an extremely strong year for storage. And we're excited about the opportunity to continue to satisfy customer requirements to meet this demand.
Before I pass the call to Tim Leyden, I want to mention that tomorrow, Friday, April 23, WD will mark its 40th anniversary, spanning four decades of innovation, passion, perseverance and success. 
I want to acknowledge the contributions of our thousands of employees, our customers and suppliers in helping us every step of the way. In particular, I want to acknowledge the team's outstanding execution in seizing the customer opportunities that emerged throughout the most recent quarter, which has further strengthened WD in our long-term mission of generating sustained profitable growth.

This, c",1158,"As John noted, the overall market was stronger than anticipated during the March quarter. Once again, our agile business model allowed us to scale up our supply and adjust our mix to respond to the demand in the more robust segments of the market. This, combined with moderate price declines and our low-cost focus, contributed to gross margin exceeding the upper threshold of our model range and our implied guidance.
Revenue for our third fiscal quarter was $2.6 billion, up 66% from the prior year and 1% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 51.1 million units, up 62% from the prior-year period and 3% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV and Media players and solid-state drives totaled approximately $46 million, up 48% from the prior year and essentially flat with the December quarter.
Average hard drive selling price was approximately $51 per unit, up $1 from the year-ago quarter and down $1 from the December quarter. Growth in emerging markets and a recovering Commercial segment led to desktop growth being stronger than expected. Pricing remained stable as a result of the unexpectedly strong demand.
We shipped 19.8 million mobile drives in the March quarter compared to 10.1 million in the year-ago quarter and 21.2 million in the December quarter. We reduced our mobile volumes in response to the expected seasonality in branded products and to balance the effect of competitors in the mobile market who diverted their capacity from the Gaming segment.
During the March quarter, we shipped 4.6 million drives into the DVR market compared to 3.5 million in the year-ago quarter and 4.1 million in the December quarter. Our strong product line up led to revenue gains in both our OEM and Channel businesses. 
Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV, was $467 million up 36% from $343 million in the year-ago quarter and down 18% sequentially from $569 million in the December quarter, reflecting the typical seasonality of the retail market.
On the enterprise front there was strong sequential demand for our nearline storage products, and our SAS products are making progress towards our multi-year plan to gain a representative share of the traditional enterprise market.
Moving on to our sales channel and geographic results. Revenue by channel was 49% OEM, 33% distribution and 18% branded products in the March quarter compared with 48%, 30% and 22% in both the year-ago and December quarters. 
Relative to the geographics state of our revenue, the Asian market showed continued strength, increasing to 52% of revenue in the March quarter from 46% in the year-ago quarter and 50% in the December quarter. The Americas and European regions performed as expected at 24% for the Americas and 24% for Europe in the March quarter compared to 26% and 28% in the year-ago quarter and 25% and 25% in the December quarter.
Our gross margin for the quarter was 25.2%, up from 15.9% in the year-ago quarter and down from 26.2% in the December quarter. Total R&D and SG&A spending was $254 million or 8.5% of revenue. This compares with $174 million or 10.9% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $214 million or 8.2% of revenue in the December quarter. Our R&D investment is focused on broadening our product offerings in response to customer needs and developing technologies in order to maintain our market competitiveness.
Operating income was $441 million or 16.7% of revenue. This compares with $61 million or 3.8% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $473 million or 18.1% of revenue in the December quarter.
Interest and other non-operating expenses were approximately $1 million. Tax expense for the March quarter was $40 million or 9.1% of pretax income within our model range of 7% to 10%. Our cash tax rate is expected to be between 1% and 2% for the fiscal year.
Our net income totaled $400 million or $1.71 per share. This compares with $50 million or $0.22 per share and $429 million or $1.85 per share in the year-ago and December quarters, respectively.
Turning to the balance sheet. For the March quarter, our cash conversion cycle was a negative three days. This consisted of 43 days of receivables, 23 days of inventory or 16 turns and 69 days of payables. We generated $588 million in cash flow from operations. 
Capital expenditures were $177 million and depreciation and amortization totaled $128 million. We also made our fourth quarterly debt repayment installment of $19 million, reducing our debt balance to $425 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $391 million ending at $2.826 billion. 
On our January call we updated our capital expenditure forecast for fiscal 2010 to be between $650 million and $750 million. We now expect to be at the high end of that range as we put investments in place to support the expected strength in the market as well as continued customer preference for WD products.
Depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2010 is expected to be about $520 million. As we have consistently demonstrated in the past, we remain focused on supply-demand equilibrium and ready to adjust capacity utilization in accordance with market needs.
Our strong cash position allows us to maintain an adequate buffer in times of continued global economic uncertainty while still providing the operational flexibility to secure component supply, increase our investments in advanced technology and expand our product breadth through pursuing internal and external opportunities.
We have $466 million remaining in our stock repurchase authorization as we continue to evaluate the merits of further purchases against internal and external investment alternatives.
Now I will discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2010.
Market indicators and customer inputs continue to strengthen our belief that demand for hard drives will be strong throughout the calendar year and beyond. WD remains ideally positioned to service these market needs due to our existing customer and supplier relationships, product line up, operational agility, technology and financial resources. 
Historically, June-quarter demand has been flat to moderately down when compared to March volumes, and we expect that seasonality pattern to continue. Consequently, we are forecasting volumes in the 157 million to 162 million unit range. We anticipate that pricing will be competitive but will be rational based on advanced technology deployment, supply-demand balance and inventory positionings in all channels.
I would note that our outlook is based on an assumption that the current disruption of the European air traffic is short-lived, and that the economic activity is made up during the balance of the quarter. Accordingly, we expect current-quarter revenue for WD to be in the range from $2.475 billion to $2.575 billion. R&D and SG&A are expected to total approximately $230 million. 
Our net interest expense is projected to be about $1 million. We expect our tax rate to be about 9%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 236 million. We estimate earnings per share of between $1.40 and $1.50 for the June quarter. Bob?"

But if you take the actual for the first quarter, first calendar quarter, you take the low side of our expectations for the second quarter and you model the low end of seasonality, which is typically 10% in the third quarter and 2% or 3% in the fourth quarter, then you would come up with a number somewhere around $670 million for the full calendar year. If you model the actual for March, the high end of our expectation for TAM in the June quarter at 162, and then take 12% or 13% increase into the third quarter and 3% to 5% in the fourth quarter, you come to 690. We think that, that range is highly probable and towards the high end of that range. We are working diligently with our supply base to ensure that WD supports the growth opportunities of our customers in relation to that anticipated market size. There is a risk that it'll be hotter than that given that not only are we seeing the -- the strength we've seen in the last 12 months in Consumer, which has been considerable, and above everyone's expectations, now being augmented by the beginnings of a corporate purchasing cycle. If I have to bet on which end of that range would come up, it would be the high end with possible upside opportunity from a TAM perspective. We're working with a supply base to support that, it's going to be a real stretch. As a result of last year's economic recession, the level of capital investment that was made during that period was minimal and we've been in catch-up mode ever since. And the supply base for capital equipment is pretty stretched. So even with the best will in the world we're going to have difficulty as an industry, I believe, across the entire supply chain in fully reaping the benefits of that opportunity."

So typically, they divert their seasonally available capacity that was dedicated to gaming in the back half of the year, they divert it into the low-end of the 2.5 mainstream business in the first couple of quarters that would typically be the component supply into the second tier, branded, external storage, box manufacturers and some diversion into notebook support."

You can see that Hitachi probably derives somewhere in the 20% to 25% range and WD derives about 10%. So it's an overall business mix thing. Plus my earlier comment about the smaller you are, the more appropriate and able you are to pick your products and cherry-pick your overall business. But I think a superb recovery story there that just reinforces I think what we and Seagate have been saying to the investment community for several years now, that with the proper business model, which at the scale of this opportunity today is a vertically-integrated, large-scale, efficiently-run manufacturing operation with measured marketing and sales activity, that this is a highly desirable business. And when we look at the opportunities and the level of content generation that's going on around us and the demand level for storage, this properly addressed, this is a fantastic business opportunity.

And when you look at the level of investment that's been put into the flash market, it'll be very tight through the back half of the year, we believe. Your follow-up question relative -- also NAND flash does not address the storage requirements of the vast bulk of those devices that traditionally use hard drives. If it did, I guess the only thing we'd be selling is single-head, single-platter. So then on your tablet question, that makes it even more unlikely that there's going to be an SSD migration in the mainstream PC business. And we see tablets similar to netbook that it will create yet another category of device which will initially consume created content which most be stored somewhere which will drive requirements for nearline storage cloud support.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Overall demand for hard drives in the March quarter was stronger than we anticipated at 163 million units as we saw a sequential industry turn grow 2% in contrast to a typical seasonal decline of 5% to 7%. This adds support to the growing body of evidence that in the midst of significant economic uncertainty over the last 12 months, the creation, transmission, consumption and storage of digital content has become much more pervasive in our lives than anyone had previously appreciated.
Over the last year, we have seen increasing levels of demand for high-capacity cost-effective storage. We believe this demand is at core driven by the ubiquitous role of digital content in everyday life, spurred in the Consumer segment by increasingly versatile and powerful handheld devices and PCs with new and attractive price points. And in the Commercial sector by a drive in growth and efficiency, especially in developing markets.
Industry inventory. OEM, distribution and retail combined remains at just over two weeks of sales, reflecting continued strong demand, continuing spotty constraints in the industry supply chain and continued industry discipline in managing the supply-demand dynamic. For more than eight years now WD has generated sustained profitable growth and outstanding returns for our shareholders by consistently executing to our customer-centric business strategy with passion, focus and perseverance. 
Customers continued to demonstrate a strong preference for WD products in the March quarter. And this enabled us to again post record unit shipments and revenue with strong profitability. We're very pleased that in such a dynamic environment we again helped our customers to succeed in their markets by responding quickly to their changing requirements for volume and mix.
A relatively moderate pricing environment, combined with our cross-segment agility and our focus on cost and efficiency, once again enabled gross margins above the high end of our model range. Asset management remained crisp, resulting in record cash generation.
We continue to innovate and lead in multiple markets based on the significant investments we have made in people, products, processes, capacity and technology over the last few years with several recent notable product achievements.
In our Client business we began volume shipment of the industry's highest aerial density standard 2-disc 2.5-inch drive, the 750 GB WD Scorpio Blue hard drive for mainstream notebook computers. We doubled the capacity of the WD VelociRaptor, the world's fastest SATA hard drive to 600 gigabytes, delivering high performance and capacity for both enthusiast and enterprise customers. We launched our first consumer-oriented solid-state drive family, the WD SiliconEdge Blue in capacities up to 256 gigabytes.
In our Branded Products business, this week we introduced a new app for the iPhone called WD Photos, a photo viewer that gives our customers quick access to all their photos stored on their My Book World Edition or WD ShareSpace network drives from their iPhone or iPod Touch. Also specifically designed for Mac users, we added a new high-speed My Passport Studio family and a 1 TB Passport SE to our range of popular hard drives.
In the CE market, we launched that WD AV-25 range off 2.5-inch SATA drives engineered specifically for demanding, always on, multimedia streaming applications, such as DVR and surveillance. We also introduced the My Passport AV media drive family optimized for video storage and playback, and designed to work directly with select Sony camcorders, Blu-ray players and other popular media players.
In the embedded market, we introduced the WD SiliconDrive N1x family of SLC-based solid-state drives with capacities up to 128 gigabytes, delivering high performance and high reliability for embedded system OEM applications.
Our participation in the traditional enterprise market, part of our portfolio diversification and expansion strategy, which started with the shipment of our 2.5-inch 10K SAS product line beginning in early November, is proceeding in line with our measured, multi-year plan to establish solid experience and a representative share in this important market segment.
We remain committed to continued investment in the development of our people, technology, product breadth and appropriate capacity while enhancing the advantage business model we have developed over the last several years. In responding to our customers' needs and earning their business in the fastest-growing markets, we provide a critical combination of quality and reliability, portfolio breadth, technology and product availability underpinned by our low-cost model, our vertical integration, our rapid inventory turns and our balance sheet strength.
We believe this WD focus represents a sustainable advantage as we continue to respond to customer needs in our existing markets and as we move into new markets for WD.
We believe that calendar year 2010 will be an extremely strong year for storage. And we're excited about the opportunity to continue to satisfy customer requirements to meet this demand.
Before I pass the call to Tim Leyden, I want to mention that tomorrow, Friday, April 23, WD will mark its 40th anniversary, spanning four decades of innovation, passion, perseverance and success. 
I want to acknowledge the contributions of our thousands of employees, our customers and suppliers in helping us every step of the way.

This, c",1156,"As John noted, the overall market was stronger than anticipated during the March quarter. Once again, our agile business model allowed us to scale up our supply and adjust our mix to respond to the demand in the more robust segments of the market. This, combined with moderate price declines and our low-cost focus, contributed to gross margin exceeding the upper threshold of our model range and our implied guidance.
Revenue for our third fiscal quarter was $2.6 billion, up 66% from the prior year and 1% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 51.1 million units, up 62% from the prior-year period and 3% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV and Media players and solid-state drives totaled approximately $46 million, up 48% from the prior year and essentially flat with the December quarter.
Average hard drive selling price was approximately $51 per unit, up $1 from the year-ago quarter and down $1 from the December quarter. Growth in emerging markets and a recovering Commercial segment led to desktop growth being stronger than expected. Pricing remained stable as a result of the unexpectedly strong demand.
We shipped 19.8 million mobile drives in the March quarter compared to 10.1 million in the year-ago quarter and 21.2 million in the December quarter. We reduced our mobile volumes in response to the expected seasonality in branded products and to balance the effect of competitors in the mobile market who diverted their capacity from the gaming segment.
During the March quarter, we shipped 4.6 million drives into the DVR market compared to 3.5 million in the year-ago quarter and 4.1 million in the December quarter. Our strong product line-up led to revenue gains in both our OEM and Channel businesses. 
Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV, was $467 million, up 36% from $343 million in the year-ago quarter and down 18% sequentially from $569 million in the December quarter, reflecting the typical seasonality of the retail market.
On the enterprise front there was strong sequential demand for our nearline storage products, and our SAS products are making progress towards our multi-year plan to gain a representative share of the traditional enterprise market.
Moving on to our sales channel and geographic results. Revenue by channel was 49% OEM, 33% distribution and 18% branded products in the March quarter compared with 48%, 30% and 22% in both the year-ago and December quarters. 
Relative to the geographic split of our revenue, the Asian market showed continued strength, increasing to 52% of revenue in the March quarter from 46% in the year-ago quarter and 50% in the December quarter. The Americas and European regions performed as expected at 24% for the Americas and 24% for Europe in the March quarter, compared to 26% and 28% in the year-ago quarter and 25% and 25% in the December quarter.
Our gross margin for the quarter was 25.2%, up from 15.9% in the year-ago quarter and down from 26.2% in the December quarter. Total R&D and SG&A spending was $224 million or 8.5% of revenue. This compares with $174 million or 10.9% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $214 million or 8.2% of revenue in the December quarter. Our R&D investment is focused on broadening our product offerings in response to customer needs and developing technologies in order to maintain our market competitiveness.
Operating income was $441 million or 16.7% of revenue. This compares with $61 million or 3.8% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $473 million or 18.1% of revenue in the December quarter.
Interest and other non-operating expenses were approximately $1 million. Tax expense for the March quarter was $40 million or 9.1% of pretax income within our model range of 7% to 10%. Our cash tax rate is expected to be between 1% and 2% for the fiscal year.
Our net income totaled $400 million or $1.71 per share. This compares with $50 million or $0.22 per share and $429 million or $1.85 per share in the year-ago and December quarters, respectively.
Turning to the balance sheet. For the March quarter, our cash conversion cycle was a negative three days. This consisted of 43 days of receivables, 23 days of inventory or 16 turns and 69 days of payables. We generated $588 million in cash flow from operations. 
Capital expenditures were $177 million and depreciation and amortization totaled $128 million. We also made our fourth quarterly debt repayment installment of $19 million, reducing our debt balance to $425 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $391 million ending at $2.826 billion. 
On our January call we updated our capital expenditure forecast for fiscal 2010 to be between $650 million and $750 million. We now expect to be at the high end of that range as we put investments in place to support the expected strength in the market as well as continued customer preference for WD products.
Depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2010 is expected to be about $520 million. As we have consistently demonstrated in the past, we remain focused on supply-demand equilibrium and ready to adjust capacity utilization in accordance with market needs.
Our strong cash position allows us to maintain an adequate buffer in times of continued global economic uncertainty while still providing the operational flexibility to secure component supply, increase our investments in advanced technology and expand our product breadth through pursuing internal and external opportunities.
We have $466 million remaining in our stock repurchase authorization as we continue to evaluate the merits of further purchases against internal and external investment alternatives.
Now I will discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2010.
Market indicators and customer inputs continue to strengthen our belief that demand for hard drives will be strong throughout the calendar year and beyond. WD remains ideally positioned to service these market needs due to our existing customer and supplier relationships, product line-up, operational agility, technology and financial resources. 
Historically, June-quarter demand has been flat to moderately down when compared to March volumes, and we expect that seasonality pattern to continue. Consequently, we are forecasting volumes in the 157 million to 162 million unit range. We anticipate that pricing will be competitive but will be irrational based on advanced technology deployment, supply-demand balance and inventory positionings in all channels.
I would note that our outlook is based on an assumption that the current disruption of the European air traffic is short-lived, and that the economic activity is made up during the balance of the quarter. Accordingly, we expect current-quarter revenue for WD to be in the range from $2.475 billion to $2.575 billion. R&D and SG&A are expected to total approximately $230 million. 
Our net interest expense is projected to be about $1 million. We expect our tax rate to be about 9%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 236 million. We estimate earnings per share of between $1.40 and $1.50 for the June quarter. Bob?"

But if you take the actual for the first quarter, first calendar quarter, you take the low side of our expectations for the second quarter and you model the low end of seasonality, which is typically 10% in the third quarter and 2% or 3% in the fourth quarter, then you would come up with a number somewhere around $670 million for the full calendar year. If you model the actual for March, the high end of our expectation for TAM in the June quarter at 162, and then take 12% or 13% increase into the third quarter and 3% to 5% in the fourth quarter, you come to 690. We think that, that range is highly probable and towards the high end of that range. We are working diligently with our supply base to ensure that WD supports the growth opportunities of our customers in relation to that anticipated market size. There is a risk that it'll be hotter than that given that not only are we seeing the -- the strength we've seen in the last 12 months in Consumer, which has been considerable, and above everyone's expectations, now being augmented by the beginnings of a corporate purchasing cycle. If I have to bet on which end of that range would come up, it would be the high end with possible upside opportunity from a TAM perspective. We're working with a supply base to support that, it's going to be a real stretch. As a result of last year's economic recession, the level of capital investment that was made during that period was minimal and we've been in catch-up mode ever since. And the supply base for capital equipment is pretty stretched. So even with the best will in the world we're going to have difficulty as an industry, I believe, across the entire supply chain in fully reaping the benefits of that opportunity."

As you go down or go to other competitors, particularly those who traditionally have serviced the gaming market which has heavy demand for 2.5-inch in the back half of the calendar year, to them, the business that's least attractive to us in the first couple of quarters of a year looks highly attractive relative to gaming. So typically, they divert their seasonally available capacity that was dedicated to gaming in the back half of the year, they divert it into the low-end of the 2.5 mainstream business in the first couple of quarters that would typically be the component supply into the second tier, branded, external storage, box manufacturers and some diversion into notebook support."

But I think a superb recovery story there that just reinforces I think what we and Seagate have been saying to the investment community for several years now, that with the proper business model, which at the scale of this opportunity today is a vertically-integrated, large-scale, efficiently-run manufacturing operation with measured marketing and sales activity, that this is a highly desirable business. And when we look at the opportunities and the level of content generation that's going on around us and the demand level for storage, this properly addressed, this is a fantastic business opportunity. And I think the fact that Hitachi have now opened the kimono and been more forthcoming with how they are running the business, I think the investment community should be a lot more prepared to give the HDD industry a little more of its due relative to its opportunity to provide significant return on investment."

And that represents the vast bulk of the demand profile for NAND flash. And when you look at the level of investment that's been put into the flash market, it'll be very tight through the back half of the year, we believe. Your follow-up question relative # also NAND flash does not address the storage requirements of the vast bulk of those devices that traditionally use hard drives. If it did, I guess the only thing we'd be selling is single-head, single-platter. So then on your tablet question, that makes it even more unlikely that there's going to be an SSD migration in the mainstream PC business. And we see tablets similar to netbook that it will create yet another category of device which will initially consume created content which most be stored somewhere which will drive requirements for nearline storage cloud support. And as we look at the specs of some of the prospective tablets that are coming along, they will also have content generation capability. And we see it all as positive addition to the total infrastructural demand that's going to drive our business into the future."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Overall demand for hard drives in the March quarter was stronger than we anticipated at 163 million units as we saw sequential industry TAM grow 2% in contrast to a typical seasonal decline",889,"Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Overall demand for hard drives in the March quarter was stronger than we anticipated at 163 million units as we saw sequential industry TAM grow 2% in contrast to a typical seasonal decline of 5% to 7%. This adds support to the growing body of evidence that in the midst of significant economic uncertainty over the last 12 months, the creation, transmission, consumption and storage of digital content has become much more pervasive in our lives than anyone had previously appreciated.
Over the last year, we have seen increasing levels of demand for high-capacity cost-effective storage. We believe this demand is at core driven by the ubiquitous role of digital content in everyday life, spurred in the Consumer segment by increasingly versatile and powerful handheld devices and PCs with new and attractive price points; and in the Commercial sector by a drive in growth and efficiency, especially in developing markets.
Industry inventory. OEM, distribution and retail combined remains at just over two weeks of sales, reflecting continued strong demand, continuing spotty constraints in the industry supply chain and continued industry discipline in managing the supply-demand dynamic. For more than eight years now, WD has generated sustained profitable growth and outstanding returns for our shareholders by consistently executing to our customer-centric business strategy with passion, focus and perseverance. 
Customers continued to demonstrate a strong preference for WD products in the March quarter. And this enabled us to again post record unit shipments and revenue with strong profitability. We're very pleased that in such a dynamic environment we again helped our customers to succeed in their markets by responding quickly to their changing requirements for volume and mix.
A relatively moderate pricing environment, combined with our cross-segment agility and our focus on cost and efficiency, once again enabled gross margins above the high end of our model range. Asset management remained crisp, resulting in record cash generation.
We continue to innovate and lead in multiple markets based on the significant investments we have made in people, products, processes, capacity and technology over the last few years with several recent notable product achievements.
In our Client business we began volume shipment of the industry's highest aerial density standard 2-disc 2.5-inch drive, the 750 GB WD Scorpio Blue hard drive for mainstream notebook computers. We doubled the capacity of the WD VelociRaptor, the world's fastest SATA hard drive to 600 gigabytes, delivering high performance and capacity for both enthusiast and enterprise customers. We launched our first consumer-oriented solid-state drive family, the WD SiliconEdge Blue in capacities up to 256 gigabytes.
In our Branded Products business, this week we introduced a new app for the iPhone called WD Photos, a photo viewer that gives our customers quick access to all their photos stored on their My Book World Edition or WD ShareSpace network drives from their iPhone or iPod Touch. Also specifically designed for Mac users, we added a new high-speed My Passport Studio family and a 1 TB Passport SE to our range of popular hard drives.
In the CE market, we launched that WD AV-25 range off 2.5-inch SATA drives engineered specifically for demanding, always on, multimedia streaming applications, such as DVR and surveillance. We also introduced the My Passport AV media drive family optimized for video storage and playback, and designed to work directly with select Sony camcorders, Blu-ray players and other popular media players.
In the embedded market, we introduced the WD SiliconDrive N1x family of SLC-based solid-state drives with capacities up to 128 gigabytes, delivering high performance and high reliability for embedded system OEM applications.
Our participation in the traditional enterprise market, part of our portfolio diversification and expansion strategy, which started with the shipment of our 2.5-inch 10K SAS product line beginning in early November, is proceeding in line with our measured, multi-year plan to establish solid experience and a representative share in this important market segment.
We remain committed to continued investment in the development of our people, technology, product breadth and appropriate capacity while enhancing the advantage business model we have developed over the last several years. In responding to our customers' needs and earning their business in the fastest-growing markets, we provide a critical combination of quality and reliability, portfolio breadth, technology and product availability underpinned by our low-cost model, our vertical integration, our rapid inventory turns and our balance sheet strength.
We believe this WD focus represents a sustainable advantage as we continue to respond to customer needs in our existing markets and as we move into new markets for WD.
We believe that calendar year 2010 will be an extremely strong year for storage. And we're excited about the opportunity to continue to satisfy customer requirements to meet this demand.
Before I pass the call to Tim Leyden, I want to mention that tomorrow, Friday, April 23, WD will mark its 40th anniversary, spanning four decades of innovation, passion, perseverance and success. 
I want to acknowledge the contributions of our thousands of employees, our customers and suppliers in helping us every step of the way. In particular, I want to acknowledge the team's outstanding execution in seizing the customer opportunities that emerged throughout the most recent quarter, which has further strengthened WD in our long-term mission of generating sustained, profitable growth.

This, c",1155,"As John noted, the overall market was stronger than anticipated during the March quarter. Once again, our agile business model allowed us to scale up our supply and adjust our mix to respond to the demand in the more robust segments of the market. This, combined with moderate price declines and our low-cost focus, contributed to gross margin exceeding the upper threshold of our model range and our implied guidance.
Revenue for our third fiscal quarter was $2.6 billion, up 66% from the prior year and 1% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 51.1 million units, up 62% from the prior-year period and 3% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV Media Players and solid-state drives totaled approximately $46 million, up 48% from the prior year and essentially flat with the December quarter.
Average hard drive selling price was approximately $51 per unit, up $1 from the year-ago quarter and down $1 from the December quarter. Growth in emerging markets and a recovering Commercial segment led to desktop growth being stronger than expected. Pricing remained stable as a result of the unexpectedly strong demand.
We shipped 19.8 million mobile drives in the March quarter compared to 10.1 million in the year-ago quarter and 21.2 million in the December quarter. We reduced our mobile volumes in response to the expected seasonality in branded products and to balance the effect of competitors in the mobile market who diverted their capacity from the gaming segment.
During the March quarter, we shipped 4.6 million drives into the DVR market compared to 3.5 million in the year-ago quarter and 4.1 million in the December quarter. Our strong product line-up led to revenue gains in both our OEM and Channel businesses. 
Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV, was $467 million, up 36% from $343 million in the year-ago quarter and down 18% sequentially from $569 million in the December quarter, reflecting the typical seasonality of the retail market.
On the enterprise front there was strong sequential demand for our nearline storage products, and our SAS products are making progress towards our multi-year plan to gain a representative share of the traditional enterprise market.
Moving on to our sales channel and geographic results. Revenue by channel was 49% OEM, 33% distribution and 18% branded products in the March quarter compared with 48%, 30% and 22% in both the year-ago and December quarters. 
Relative to the geographic split of our revenue, the Asian market showed continued strength, increasing to 52% of revenue in the March quarter from 46% in the year-ago quarter and 50% in the December quarter. The Americas and European regions performed as expected at 24% for the Americas and 24% for Europe in the March quarter, compared to 26% and 28% in the year-ago quarter and 25% and 25% in the December quarter.
Our gross margin for the quarter was 25.2%, up from 15.9% in the year-ago quarter and down from 26.2% in the December quarter. Total R&D and SG&A spending was $224 million or 8.5% of revenue. This compares with $174 million or 10.9% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $214 million or 8.2% of revenue in the December quarter. Our R&D investment is focused on broadening our product offerings in response to customer needs and developing technologies in order to maintain our market competitiveness.
Operating income was $441 million or 16.7% of revenue. This compares with $61 million or 3.8% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $473 million or 18.1% of revenue in the December quarter.
Interest and other non-operating expenses were approximately $1 million. Tax expense for the March quarter was $40 million or 9.1% of pretax income, within our model range of 7% to 10%. Our cash tax rate is expected to be between 1% and 2% for the fiscal year.
Our net income totaled $400 million or $1.71 per share. This compares with $50 million or $0.22 per share and $429 million or $1.85 per share in the year-ago and December quarters, respectively.
Turning to the balance sheet. For the March quarter, our cash conversion cycle was a negative three days. This consisted of 43 days of receivables, 23 days of inventory or 16 turns and 69 days of payables. We generated $588 million in cash flow from operations. 
Capital expenditures were $177 million and depreciation and amortization totaled $128 million. We also made our fourth quarterly debt repayment installment of $19 million, reducing our debt balance to $425 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $391 million ending at $2.826 billion. 
On our January call we updated our capital expenditure forecast for fiscal 2010 to be between $650 million and $750 million. We now expect to be at the high end of that range as we put investments in place to support the expected strength in the market as well as continued customer preference for WD products.
Depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2010 is expected to be about $520 million. As we have consistently demonstrated in the past, we remain focused on supply-demand equilibrium and ready to adjust capacity utilization in accordance with market needs.
Our strong cash position allows us to maintain an adequate buffer in times of continued global economic uncertainty, while still providing the operational flexibility to secure components supply, increase our investments in advanced technology and expand our product breadth through pursuing internal and external opportunities.
We have $466 million remaining in our stock repurchase authorization as we continue to evaluate the merits of further repurchases against internal and external investment alternatives.
Now I will discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2010. Market indicators and customer inputs continue to strengthen our belief that demand for hard drives will be strong throughout the calendar year and beyond. WD remains ideally positioned to service these market needs due to our existing customer and supplier relationships, product lineup, operational agility, technology and financial resources. 
Historically, June-quarter demand has been flat to moderately down when compared to March volumes, and we expect that seasonality pattern to continue. Consequently, we are forecasting volumes in the 157 million to 162 million unit range. We anticipate that pricing will be competitive but will be irrational based on advanced technology deployment, supply-demand balance and inventory positions in all channels.
I would note that our outlook is based on an assumption that the current disruption of the European air traffic is short-lived, and that the economic activity is made up during the balance of the quarter. Accordingly, we expect current-quarter revenue for WD to be in the range from $2.475 billion to $2.575 billion. R&D and SG&A are expected to total approximately $230 million. 
Our net interest expense is projected to be about $1 million. We expect our tax rate to be about 9%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 236 million. We estimate earnings per share of between $1.40 and $1.50 for the June quarter. Bob?"

But if you take the actual for the first quarter, first calendar quarter, you take the low side of our expectations for the second quarter and you model the low end of seasonality which is typically 10% in the third quarter and 2% or 3% in the fourth quarter, then you would come up with a number somewhere around $670 million for the full calendar year. If you model the actual for March, the high end of our expectation for TAM in the June quarter at 162 million, and then take 12% or 13% increase into the third quarter and 3% to 5% in the fourth quarter, you come to $690 million. We think that, that range is highly probable and towards the high end of that range. We are working diligently with our supply base to ensure that WD supports the growth opportunities of our customers in relation to that anticipated market size. There is a risk that it'll be hotter than that given that not only are we seeing the strength we've seen in the last 12 months in consumer, which has been considerable and above everyone's expectations, now being augmented by the beginnings of a corporate purchasing cycle. If I had to bet on which end of that range would come up, it'd be the high end with possible upside opportunity from a TAM perspective. We're working with the supply base to support that. It's going to be a real stretch. As a result of last year's economic recession, the level of capital investment that was made during that period was minimal and we've been in catch-up mode ever since. And the supply base for capital equipment is pretty stretched. So even with the best will in the world we're going to have difficulty as an industry, I believe, across the entire supply chain in fully reaping the benefits of that opportunity."

We also think that, that level of transparency will also be beneficial to the investment community as they see the behavior of people that now hold somewhere close to around 80% of the total market. So everybody has got the information available to them in order to make their decisions relative to capacity additions. And then once they have the capacity additions in place, they have the information available to them relative to capacity utilization. So we think that's a positive. We see the benefits of the large vertically-integrated players really being displayed in the results of the three companies. And that's a positive for the industry, we believe."

I think when you look at the overall increase in transparency in the increased information they provided yesterday, it's a very impressive recovery story. And it demonstrates, I think clearly, if you look at Hitachi's product mix model, it's much closer to the Seagate model than it is to WD's. If you look at Seagate, you can see they derive somewhere between 25% and 30% of revenue from enterprise. All enterprise, that includes traditional and nearline storage. You can see that Hitachi probably derives somewhere in the 20% to 25% range and WD derives about 10%. So it's an overall business mix thing. Plus my earlier comment about the smaller you are, the more appropriate and able you are to pick your products and cherry-pick your overall business. But I think a superb recovery story there that just reinforces I think what we and Seagate have been saying to the investment community for several years now, that with the proper business model, which at the scale of this opportunity today is a vertically-integrated, large-scale, efficiently-run manufacturing operation with measured marketing and sales activity, that this is a highly desirable business. And when we look at the opportunities and the level of content generation that's going on around us and the demand level for storage, properly addressed this is a fantastic business opportunity.

And that represents the vast bulk of the demand profile for NAND flash. And when you look at the level of investment that's been put into the flash market, it'll be very tight through the back half of the year, we believe. Also NAND flash does not address the storage requirements of the vast bulk of those devices that traditionally use hard drives. If it did, I guess the only thing we'd be selling is single-head, single-platter. So then on your tablet question, that makes it even more unlikely that there's going to be an SSD migration in the mainstream PC business.

Fiscal 2010 was another highly profitable growth year for WD. Ever increasing demand for cost effective and high capacity storage continues to provide opportunity for substantial growth and consistent value creation over an extended term when addressed with an effective business model. With a relentless focus on customer needs, quality, low cost and high asset efficiency, WD has become solidly and increasingly profitable throughout the last decade. Over the last five years, WD has profitably grown revenue at a compound annual rate of 22%. In this same period, we have grown operating income at a compound rate of 50% per annum.
For fiscal year 2010, we grew revenue 32% to $9.8 billion. We increased operating income by 194% year-on-year.
The hard drive demand growth story continues to be driven by the proliferation of multiple devices and applications that are resulting in the generation, utilization and storage either locally or in the cloud of massive amounts of digital content on low cost high capacity hard drives. We believe that the industry's growth trajectory will continue over the foreseeable future creating significant additional opportunity for WD with its well-honed business model and expanding product set to continue to generate growth on a sustained and profitable basis.
This growth opportunity has been created in large part by our ability to continually drive down average cost per gigabyte leading to attractive price points but have driven mass market adoption of devices incorporating hard drives. At the same time, we have gradually expanded gross margins while growing revenues by continuously increasing efficiencies and reducing costs.
Our assessment in late April of a June quarter time in the range of 157 million to 162 million proved overly optimistic. Actual demand for hard drives in the quarter was about 156 million units, down 4% sequentially but up 16% from the year ago period. The major factors leading to the lower time were weakness in Europe, destocking by OEM customers and a shift in OEM ordering patterns to take advantage of lower cost sea versus air freight. In hindsight, this expanded the March quarter at the expense of the June quarter.
Given the change in the demand during the June quarter, WD and others in the industry responded quickly to adjusted bill times, resulting in quarter ending inventory modestly increased but at manageable levels.
Chip inventory increased from seven to 10 days, while component distribution inventories increased slightly but remained at the midpoint of the normal four to six-week range including in transit.
Taking these market dynamics into account, we were pleased to deliver one of the strongest fiscal fourth quarter performances in company history. While market dynamics in the June quarter will tamper short-term growth rates and affect price levels in the September quarter, we believe that the second half of the calendar year and calendar year 2011 will continue to present substantial growth opportunities and rewards for hard drive industry participants with effective business models and compelling product offerings.
WD continues to generate substantial free cash flow while continuing to reinvest significantly in our business, both in expanding and enhancing our product offerings and in improving our operations.
Over the course of fiscal 2010, we continue to lead the industry's fastest-growing segment, 2.5-inch drives, deploying industry-leading aerial density products at the 640 gigabyte, 750 gigabytes and 1 terabyte capacity points. We made our entry into the traditional enterprise market with the introduction of our first 2.5-inch SAS hard drives for server applications, part of our multi-year commitment to serve this important and heretofore, unserved market for WD.
We brought to market our first client-oriented solid-state drive to complement our existing portfolio of high reliability embedded SSDs and we are in development of our first solid-state drive for high-end enterprise applications.
In our Branded Products business, we broadened our portfolio of WD storage devices with the introduction of My Book Studio RX, hard drives for Apple users and the My Book AV DVR Expander hard drives, which allow users to keep more of their favorite movies and TV shows.
We extended our family of WD Media Players with the WD TV Live Plus featuring added services such as Netflix, YouTube, Flickr, Pandora, Live 365 as well as Media Flight that enable consumers to stream their favorite shows and personal content directly to their TVs. It is also the first network Media Player compatible with Windows 7.
On the manufacturing side, we improved the security of supply of glass substrates, and enhanced our long-term cost structure with the acquisition of Hoya's media operations.
Before I pass the call to Tim Leyden, I want to acknowledge our loyal customers, who are the primary reason for WD's continued significant growth as a leading supplier of storage devices. We will continue to work passionately and diligently to earn their ongoing business. I also want to thank the WD team and our supply partners for their exceptional contribution to WD's revenue, profitability and cash generation in the fiscal year just ended. Tim?

In the June quarter, demand was weaker and more back-end loaded than we had anticipated. We believe that the weaker and less linear demand resulted from a number of things.
OEM restocking during Q3 reduced market size in Q4. In European credit crisis led to some purchasing pause by retailers for a number of weeks due to the euro-exchange fluctuation, and there was relative weakness in the consumer space.
The combination of these factors and the pressure exerted by some competitors increasing their production in a smaller market contributed to more downward pressure on selling prices than we had expected. Given these conditions, we acted to optimize our financial results, but at the same time, defending our market position.
We are pleased that despite these challenging fiscal Q4 conditions, we achieved growth margins of 22.5% for the quarter, a 15-year high for WD in the fiscal Q4, and at the high-end of our long-term gross margin model range.
For our full fiscal year 2010, total revenue was $9.8 billion. Hard drive shipments were 194 million units and ASP was $50. Revenue from non-hard drive sales totaled approximately $154 million. The corresponding numbers for fiscal 2009 were total revenue of $7.5 billion, shipments of 146 million units and ASP of $51.
Revenue from non-hard drive sales totaled approximately $62 million. Compared with 2009, gross margin in fiscal 2010 was 24.4% versus 17.9%. Operating income was $1.525 billion versus $519 million. Net income was $1.382 billion versus $417 million, and earnings per share was $5.93 versus $2.08.
Net income in fiscal 2010 included $27 million of expense related to litigation settlement. Net income in fiscal 2009 included a $14 million in-process R&D charge related to the acquisition of Silicon Systems, $112 million of restructuring charges offset by related tax benefits of $4 million, and an $18 million gain on the sale of the company's substrate manufacturing facility in Sarawak, Malaysia.
Turning to the 2010 fourth quarter results. Total revenue was $2.4 billion, up 24% from the prior year, but down 10% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 49.7 million units, up 24% from the prior year period but down 3% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV and Media Players and solid-state drives totaled approximately $27 million, up 20% from the prior year and down 41% versus the March quarter.
Average hard drive selling price was approximately $47 per unit, down $1 from the year-ago quarter and down $4 from the March quarter.
We shipped 19.9 million mobile drives in the June quarter, compared to 16.9 million in the year-ago quarter and 19.8 million in the March quarter, reflecting unit consumer demand in the U.S. and India, offset by commercial and emerging market growth.
During the June quarter, we shipped 5.3 million drives into the DVR market, compared to 3.7 million in the year-ago quarter and 4.6 million in the March quarter. The strength in this market in the June quarter was in line with historical-seasonal patterns.
Revenue from sales of our Branded Products including WD TV was $400 million, up 26% from $318 million in the year-ago quarter, and down 14% sequentially from $467 million in the March quarter reflecting the typical seasonality of the retail market. In addition to normal seasonality, the decline in the value of the euro impacted selling in Europe for a number of weeks.
Enterprise SATA demand continues to grow in fiscal Q4, particularly at the high-capacity points. Our product lineup has us well-positioned in this segment. Our SAS products are making progress towards our multi-year plan to gain a representative share of the traditional enterprise market.
Moving on to our sales channels and geographic results. Revenue by channel was 54% OEM, 29% distribution and 17% Branded Products in the June quarter, knowing the same percentage split as in the year-ago quarter and 49%, 33% and 18% in the March quarter. No single customer comprised more than 10% of total revenue.
Relative to the geographic split and on our revenue, the Asian market continued to be strong by 54% of revenue in the June quarter as compared to 54% in the year-ago quarter and 52% in the March quarter. The Americas and European regions contributed 25% and 21%, respectively, in the June quarter compared to 24% and 22% in the year-ago quarter and 24% in the March quarter.
Our gross margins for the quarter was 22.5%, up from 19.2% in the year-ago quarter and down from 25.2% in the March quarter. Gross margin was impacted on a sequential basis by pricing, channel mix, segment mix and volume reductions. Total R&D and SG&A spending was $242 million or 10.2% of revenue. This includes the $27 million of litigation settlements and compares with $184 million or 9.5% revenue in the year-ago quarter and $224 million or 8.5% of revenue in the March quarter.
Operating income was $293 million or 12.3% of revenue. This compares with $209 million or 10.8% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $441 million or 16.7% of revenue in the March quarter. Net interest and other nonoperating expenses were approximately $1 million. Tax expense for the June quarter was $27 million or 9.2% of pretax income.
Our net income totaled to $265 million or $1.13 per share. This compares with $196 million or $0.86 per share, and $400 million or $1.71 per share in the year-ago and March quarters, respectively.
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations during fiscal 2010, including $362 million during our fourth quarter. Our cash conversion cycles for the fourth quarter was a positive of two days. This consisted of 48 days of receivables outstanding, 28 days of inventory or 13 turns and 74 days of payables. Our inventory turns were reduced by approximately one turn as the result of including the higher inventory that we acquired on June 30th.
Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for the June quarter were $185 million. Our non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense totaled $134 million.
Capital additions for fiscal 2010 totaled $737 million lower than our April projection of $750 million as we scale back in line with lower demand. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal '10 totaled $510 million.
During the fourth quarter, we acquired the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya Corporation for $233 million in cash. We expect that the Hoya will be mildly accretive to WD's long-term growth margin model by the end of the calendar year. But prior to that, it will have about a 50 basis points negative impact on the gross margin as we get it tuned to WD's production standards.
We made $82 million of debt repayment installments during fiscal 2010, including $25 million during our fourth quarter. We reduced our debt balance to $400 million at the end of fiscal 2010.
We exited fiscal Q4 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion, a decrease of $92 million from the March quarter. We continue to hold the cash balance in excess of our anticipated operating needs. With the strategy to maintain operational flexibility, increase our investments in advanced technology, expand our product breathe through the pursuit of internal and external opportunities, and to protect against macroeconomic weakness. The balance remaining in our stock repurchase authorization is $466 million.
Now, I will discuss our expectations for capital, depreciation and tax for fiscal 2011.
We expect our capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 to be between 78% of revenue with an additional $200 million related to our 6-inch to 8-inch wafer conversion and some expenditure to optimize the output from our recently acquired Hoya production facility. We expect total CapEx in Q1 to come in around $275 million. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $650 million for the fiscal year.
We expect our book effective tax rate to range between 6% and 9% and our cash tax rate to be between 1% and 2%.
Now, we'll move on to our long-term business model.
We believe annual growth in the unit shipments of the hard drive market will continue in the 10% to 15% range into the foreseeable future. It should generate industry-revenue growth of between 5% and 7.5%. Given this industry-growth rate, we expect to operate within our long-term growth margin model range of 18% to 23%, with some longer term off of momentum from an increasing percentage on local media as well as advancing our presence in the traditional enterprise market.
Our OpEx model target has continued in the 9% to 10% range and our resulting operating income will range from 8% to 14%. Tax expense is estimated to be in the range of 6% to 9% income before taxes. These parameters would yield net income in the 7% to 12.5% range.
Now, turning to our guidance for fiscal Q1. Historically, September-quarter demand has been up by 10 to 13% when compared to June volumes. However, a number of factors are leading us to forecast lower growth this quarter. We believe that some of July's natural OEM demands was fulfilled at the end of June, and that OEMs are less concerned about shortages than they were a few months ago.
U.S. retails sales statistics also suggests that there has been some emerging consumer demand weakness. Additionally, we believe that OEMs have planned for a regular back-to-school season and that components to satisfy those demand expectations are either in their manufacturing pipelines or in transit at this point in time.
As we entered the quarter, demand has started out slowly as some customers deplete on-hand customer inventory and await confirmation of the extent of back-to-school demand. These factors will dampen the typical season of uplift to an expected range of between 2% and 6%, which translates into a TAM range of between 160 to 165 million units.
Taking these factors into account, we anticipate that pricing will be competitive and further dependent on emerging demand level dynamics as-back-to-school season gets underway. Should demand turn out to be stronger than anticipated, we expect to be able to respond to the upside. Accordingly, we expect current quarter revenue for WD to be in a range from $2.350 billion to $2.450 billion.
R&D and SG&A are expected to total approximately $235 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $1 million. We expect our tax rate to be about 7.5%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately $236 million. We estimated earnings per share between $0.80 and $0.90 for the September quarter. Bob?

Half of that has been driven by growth of our business and the other half has been driven by our vertical integration of our business and efficiency and cost efforts. And so we started out at the beginning of the decade '01, '02 averaged 12% gross margin; '03, '04 was 16; '05, '06 was 18; '07 and '08 was 19; '09 and '10 was 21.

And we think part of the forward positive guidance relates to the fact that as they did a product transition to Capella, there was no buildup of the inventory at the component level in the OEM customers. In fact there was a brief shortage as they transition from old to new. So I think there's a different stocking dynamic in Intel versus the drive industry. There is however, and we are seeing it, an uplift in commercial. But the combination of the macroeconomic conditions in Europe allied to the strong proportion of our business in distribution and retail and in OEM consumer is - the commercial boost is not making up completely in terms of overall growth rate for the softness we currently see in consumer and what we saw through last quarter was some flushing of inventory by the OEMs, and we are building in to our forward look for this quarter an expectation that they will release another little bit of on-hand component inventory. However, all of that being said - so we're planning on the conservative basis from a capacity-utilization perspective and a CapEx perceptive. However, as our history indicates, we're ever mindful of close attention to the actual numbers and the ability to sprint talk to address opportunity as they present themselves.

There is of course, you have to recognize the models. And whenever quarter-over-quarter demand is lower, that all those favors the small player in that environment in terms of their growth because if you have, let's say, pick a number, if you have 10% share at a major OEM and your two major competitors have 45% each and the market goes down. As the small player, you can afford to bid aggressively to get an increasing share and either keep your volume constant or grow it, and get the benefit of that growth on your bottom line. For the very large participant at any given customer to lean into that wind and price to grow volume, it's usually too costly to do that. So there's a natural tendency for the small players to grow when the market goes down, and then the ability of the large players to scale up rapidly causes them to typically grow when the market demand moves up.

Fiscal 2010 was another highly profitable growth year for WD. Ever-increasing demand for cost-effective, high-capacity storage continues to provide opportunity for substantial growth and consistent value creation over an extended term when addressed with an effective business model.
With a relentless focus on customer needs, quality, low cost and high-asset efficiency, WD has become solidly and increasingly profitable throughout the last decade. Over the last five years, WD has profitably grown revenue at a compound annual rate of 22%. In this same period, we have grown operating income at a compound rate of 50% per annum.
For fiscal year 2010, we grew revenue 32% to $9.8 billion. We increased operating income by 194% year-on-year. The hard drive demand growth story continues to be driven by the proliferation of multiple devices and applications that are resulting in the generation, utilization and storage, either locally or in the cloud of massive amounts of digital content on low-cost, high-capacity hard drives. 
We believe that the industry's growth trajectory will continue over the foreseeable future, creating significant additional opportunity for WD with its well-honed business model and expanding product set to continue to generate growth on a sustained and profitable basis.
This growth opportunity has been created in large part by our ability to continually drive down average cost-per-gigabyte, leading to attractive price points that have driven mass-market adoption of devices incorporating hard drives. At the same time, we have gradually expanded gross margins, while growing revenues by continuously increasing efficiencies and reducing costs.
Our assessment in late April of  a June quarter time in the range of 157 million to 162 million units proved overly optimistic. Actual demand for hard drives in the quarter was about 156 million units, down 4% sequentially but up 16% from the year-ago period. The major factors leading to the lower TAM were weakness in Europe, de-stocking by OEM customers and the shift in OEM ordering patterns to take advantage of lower-cost sea-versus-air freight. In hindsight, this expanded the March quarter at the expense of the June quarter. 
Given the change in the demand during the June quarter, WD and others in the industry responded quickly to adjust build plans, resulting in quarter ending inventory modestly increased, but at manageable levels.
Ship inventory increased from seven to 10 days, while component distribution inventories increased slightly but remained at the midpoint of the normal four- to six-week range including in transit.
Taking these market dynamics into account, we were pleased to deliver one of the strongest fiscal fourth quarter performances in company history. While market dynamics in the June quarter will temper short-term growth rates and affect price levels in the September quarter, we believe that the second half of the calendar year and calendar year 2011 will continue to present substantial growth opportunities and rewards for hard drive industry participants with effective business models and compelling product offerings.
WD continues to generate substantial free cash flow while continuing to reinvest significantly in our business, both in expanding and enhancing our product offerings, and in improving our operations.
Over the course of fiscal 2010, we continued to lead the industry's fastest-growing segment 2.5-inch drives, deploying industry-leading aerial density products at the 640 GB, 750 GB and 1 TB capacity points. We made our entry into the traditional enterprise market with the introduction of our first 2.5-inch SAS hard drives for server applications, part of our multi-year commitment to serve this important and heretofore, un-served market for WD.
We brought to market our first client-oriented solid state drive [SSD] to complement our existing portfolio of high-reliability embedded SSDs and we are in development of our first solid state drive for high-end enterprise applications. In our Branded Products business, we broadened our portfolio of WD storage devices with the introduction of My Book Studio LX, hard drives for Apple users, and the My Book AV DVR Expander hard drives, which allow users to keep more of their favorite movies and TV shows.
We extended our family of WD media players with the WD TV Live Plus featuring added services such as Netflix, YouTube, Flickr, Pandora, Live365 as well as Mediafly, that enable consumers to stream their favorite shows and personal content directly to their TVs. It is also the first network media player compatible with Windows 7.
On the manufacturing side, we improved the security of supply of glass substrates and enhanced our long-term cost structure with the acquisition of Hoya's media operations.
Before I pass the call to Tim Leyden, I want to acknowledge our loyal customers who are the primary reason for WD's continued significant growth as a leading supplier of storage devices. We will continue to work passionately and diligently to earn their ongoing business. I also want to thank the WD team and our supply partners for their exceptional contribution to WD's revenue, profitability and cash generation in the fiscal year just ended. Tim?"

We believe that the weaker and less linear demand resulted from a number of things. 
OEM restocking during Q3 reduced market size in Q4. The European credit crisis led to some purchasing pause by retailers for a number of weeks due to the euro exchange fluctuation, and there was relative weakness in the consumer space.
The combination of these factors and the pressure exerted by some competitors increasing their production in a smaller market contributed to more downward pressure on selling prices than we had expected. Given these conditions, we acted to optimize our financial results, but at the same time, defending our market position. 
We are pleased that despite these challenging fiscal Q4 conditions, we achieved growth margins of 22.5% for the quarter, a 15-year high for WD in the fiscal Q4, and at the high-end of our long-term gross margin model range.
For our full fiscal year 2010, total revenue was $9.8 billion. Hard drive shipments were 194 million units and ASP was $50. Revenue from non-hard drive sales totaled approximately $154 million. The corresponding numbers for fiscal 2009 were total revenue of $7.5 billion, shipments of 146 million units and ASP of $51.
Revenue from non-hard drive sales totaled approximately $62 million. Compared with 2009, gross margin in fiscal 2010 was 24.4% versus 17.9%. Operating income was $1.525 billion versus $519 million. Net income was $1.382 billion versus $470 million, and the earnings per share was $5.93 versus $2.08.
Net income in fiscal 2010 included $27 million of expense related to litigation settlements. Net income in fiscal 2009 included a $14 million in-process R&D charge related to the acquisition of SiliconSystems, $112 million of restructuring charges offset by related tax benefits of $4 million, and an $18 million gain on the sale of the company's substrate manufacturing facility in Sarawak, Malaysia.
Turning to the 2010 fourth quarter results. Total revenue was $2.4 billion, up 24% from the prior year but down 10% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 49.7 million units, up 24% from the prior year period but down 3% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV media players and solid state drives totaled approximately $27 million, up 20% from the prior year and down 41% versus the March quarter.
Average hard drive selling price was approximately $47 per unit, down $1 from the year-ago quarter and down $4 from the March quarter.
We shipped 19.9 million mobile drives in the June quarter, compared to 16.9 million in the year-ago quarter and 19.8 million in the March quarter, reflecting unit consumer demand in the U.S. and India, offset by commercial and emerging market growth.
During the June quarter, we shipped 5.3 million drives into the DVR market, compared to 3.7 million in the year-ago quarter and 4.6 million in the March quarter. The strength in this market in the June quarter was in line with historical-seasonal patterns.
Revenue from sales of our Branded Products including WD TV was $400 million, up 26% from $318 million in the year-ago quarter and down 14% sequentially from $467 million in the March quarter, reflecting the typical seasonality of the retail market. In addition to normal seasonality, the decline in the value of the euro impacted selling in Europe for a number of weeks.
Enterprise SATA demand continued to grow in fiscal Q4, particularly at the high-capacity points. Our product lineup handles one position in this segment. Our SAS products are making progress towards our multi-year plan to gain a  representative share of the traditional enterprise market.
Moving on to our sales channel and geographic results. Revenue by channel was 54% OEM, 29% distribution and 17% Branded Products in the June quarter, nearing the same percentage splits as in the year-ago quarter and 49%, 33% and 18% in the March quarter. No single customer comprised more than 10% of total revenue.
Relative to the geographic split of all revenue, the Asian market continues to be strong at 54% of revenue in the June quarter, as compared to 54% in the year-ago quarter and 52% in the March quarter. The Americas and European regions contributed 25% and 21%, respectively, in the June quarter, compared to 24% and 22% in the year-ago quarter and 24% in the March quarter.
Our gross margin for the quarter was 22.5%, up from 19.2% in the year-ago quarter and down from 25.2% in the March quarter. Gross margin was impacted on a sequential basis by pricing, channel mix, segment mix and volume reductions. Total R&D and SG&A spending was $242 million, or 10.2% of revenue. This includes the $27 million of litigation settlements and compares with $184 million, or 9.5%  of revenue, in the year-ago quarter and $224 million, or 8.5% of revenue, in the March quarter.
Operating income was $293 million, or 12.3% of revenue. This compares with $209 million, or 10.8% of revenue, in the year-ago quarter and $441 million, or 16.7% of revenue, in the March quarter. Net interest and other non-operating expenses were approximately $1 million. Tax expense for the June quarter was $27 million and 9.2% of pretax income.
Our net income totaled to $265 million, or $1.13 per share. This compares with $196 million, or $0.86 per share, and $400 million, or $1.71 per share, in the year-ago and March quarters, respectively.
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations during fiscal 2010, including $363 million during our fourth quarter. Our cash conversion cycle for the fourth quarter was a positive two days. This consisted of 48 days of receivables outstanding, 28 days of inventory or 13 turns, and 74 days of payables. Our inventory turns were reduced by approximately one turn as the result of including the higher inventory that we acquired on June 30.
Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for the June quarter were $185 million. Our non-cash charges from depreciation and amortization expense totaled $134 million.
Capital additions for fiscal 2010 totaled $737 million, lower than our April projection of $750 million, as we scale back in line with lower demand. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal '10 totaled $510 million.
During the fourth quarter, we acquired the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya Corporation for $233 million in cash. We expect that the Hoya facility will be mindfully accretive to WD's long-term gross margin model by the end of the calendar year. But prior to that, we will have about a 50-basis point negative impact on the gross margin as we get it tuned to WD's production standards.
We made $82 million of debt repayment installments during fiscal 2010, including $25 million during our fourth quarter. We reduced our debt balance to $400 million at the end of fiscal 2010.
We exited fiscal Q4 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion, a decrease of $92 million from the March quarter. We continue to hold a cash balance in excess of our anticipated operating needs with a strategy to maintain operational flexibility, increase our investments in advanced technology, expand our product breadth for the pursuit of internal and external opportunities and to predict protect against macroeconomic weakness. The balance remaining in our stock repurchase authorization is $466 million. Now I will discuss our expectations for capital, depreciation and tax for fiscal 2011.
We expect our capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 to be between 7% and 8% of revenue with an additional $200 million related to our 6-inch to 8-inch wafer conversion and some expenditure to optimize the output from our recently acquired Hoya production facility. We expect total CapEx in Q1 to come in around $275 million. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $650 million for the fiscal year.
We expect our book effective tax rate to range between 6% and 9% and our cash tax rate to be between 1% and 2%. Now I will move on to our long-term business model.
We believe that annual growth in unit shipments of the hard drive market will continue in the 10% to 15% range into the foreseeable future. It should generate industry revenue growth of between 5% and 7.5%. Given this industry growth rate, we expect to operate within our long-term gross margin model range of 18% to 23%, with some longer-term upward momentum from increasing our percentage of internal media, as well as advancing our presence in the traditional enterprise market. 
Our OpEx model is targeted to continue in the 9% to 10% range and our resulting operating income will the range from 8% to 14%. Tax expense is estimated to be in the range of 6% to 9% of income before taxes. These parameters would yield net income in the 7% to 12.5% range. 
Now turning to our guidance for fiscal Q1. Historically, September quarter demand has been up by 10% to 13% when compared to June volumes. However, a number of factors were leading us to forecast lower growth this quarter. We believe that some of July's OEM demand was fulfilled at the end of June, and as the OEMs are less concerned about shortages than they were a few months ago. U.S. retails sales statistics also suggest that there has been some emerging consumer demand weakness. Additionally, we believe that OEMs have planned for a regular back-to-school season and that components to satisfy those demand expectations are either in their manufacturing pipelines or in transit at this point in time.
As we enter the quarter, demand has started out slowly as some customers deplete on-hand component inventory and await confirmation of the extent of back-to-school demand. These factors will dampen the typical seasonal uplift to an expected range of between 2% and 6%, which translates to a TAM range of between 160 to 165 million units.
Taking these factors into account, we anticipate that pricing will be competitive and further dependent on emerging demand level dynamics as back-to-school season gets underway. Should demand turn out to be stronger than anticipate, we expect to be able to respond to the upside. Accordingly, we expect current quarter revenue for WD to be in a range from $2.350 billion to $2.450 billion. 
R&D and SG&A are expected to total approximately $235 million. Our net interest expense was projected to be about $1 million. We expect our tax rate to be about 7.5%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately to 236 million. We estimate earnings per share are between $0.80 and $0.90 for the September quarter. Bob?"

So we’re expecting that, for Q1, in what would normally have been an expectation of either a flat to up base fee [ph], that the price declines will be worse than historical. And even though there will be a little bit of mix-up because of the consumer demand, the weighting of consumer demands as we get headed for back-to-school season, we don't think that, that will be sufficient to offset the pricing decline."

I think if you look at the long-term cadence of the industry, we've consistently expanded margins as we've moved through the last decade, and we've done that. Half of that has been driven by growth of our business and the other half has been driven by our vertical integration of our business and our efficiency and cost efforts. And so we started out at the beginning of the decade '01, '02, average 12% gross margin; '03 '04 was 16; '05, '06 was 18; '07, '08 was 19; '09,'10 was 21.

And when the currency fluctuations settled down a bit, it did come back into the market and started refilling their pipeline, but at a muted level versus what would have been normal otherwise.

And that is based upon the fact that we – they'd fallen a little behind our model of internal versus external.

Their growth for the PC-related market was 2%, and we believe the bulk of that was ASP growth rather than unit growth. And we think part of their forward positive guidance relates to the fact that as they did a product transition to Capella, there was no build-up of inventory at the component level in the OEM customers. In fact, there was a brief shortage as they transitioned from old to new. So I think there's a different stocking dynamic in Intel versus the drive industry. There is, however, and we are seeing it, an uplift in Commercial. But the combination of the macroeconomic conditions in Europe allied to the strong proportion of our business in distribution and retail and in OEM consumer, is the commercial boost is not making up completely, in terms of overall growth rate, for the softness we currently see in Consumer and the, what we saw through last quarter was some flushing of inventory by the OEMs, and we are building into our forward look for this quarter an expectation that they will release another little bit of on-hand component inventory. However, all of that being said -- so we're planning on a conservative basis from a capacity-utilization perspective and a CapEx perceptive. However, as our history indicates, we're ever mindful of close attention to the actual numbers and the ability to sprint up to address opportunities as they present themselves."

Fiscal 2010 was another highly profitable growth year for WD. Ever increasing demand for cost effective and high capacity storage continues to provide opportunity for substantial growth and consistent va",839," Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Fiscal 2010 was another highly profitable growth year for WD. Ever increasing demand for cost effective and high capacity storage continues to provide opportunity for substantial growth and consistent value creation over an extended term when addressed with an effective business model. With a relentless focus on customer needs, quality, low cost and high asset efficiency, WD has become solidly and increasingly profitable throughout the last decade. Over the last five years, WD has profitably grown revenue at a compound annual rate of 22%. In this same period, we have grown operating income at a compound rate of 50% per annum.
 For fiscal year 2010, we grew revenue 32% to $9.8 billion. We increased operating income by 194% year-on-year.
 The hard drive demand growth story continues to be driven by the proliferation of multiple devices and applications that are resulting in the generation, utilization and storage either locally or in the cloud of massive amounts of digital content on low cost high capacity hard drives. We believe that the industry's growth trajectory will continue over the foreseeable future creating significant additional opportunity for WD with its well-honed business model and expanding product set to continue to generate growth on a sustained and profitable basis.
 This growth opportunity has been created in large part by our ability to continually drive down average cost per gigabyte leading to attractive price points but have driven mass market adoption of devices incorporating hard drives. At the same time, we have gradually expanded gross margins while growing revenues by continuously increasing efficiencies and reducing costs.
 Our assessment in late April of a June quarter time in the range of 157 million to 162 million proved overly optimistic. Actual demand for hard drives in the quarter was about 156 million units, down 4% sequentially but up 16% from the year ago period. The major factors leading to the lower time were weakness in Europe, destocking by OEM customers and a shift in OEM ordering patterns to take advantage of lower cost sea versus air freight. In hindsight, this expanded the March quarter at the expense of the June quarter.
 Given the change in the demand during the June quarter, WD and others in the industry responded quickly to adjusted bill times, resulting in quarter ending inventory modestly increased but at manageable levels.
 Chip inventory increased from seven to 10 days, while component distribution inventories increased slightly but remained at the midpoint of the normal four to six-week range including in transit.
 Taking these market dynamics into account, we were pleased to deliver one of the strongest fiscal fourth quarter performances in company history. While market dynamics in the June quarter will tamper short-term growth rates and affect price levels in the September quarter, we believe that the second half of the calendar year and calendar year 2011 will continue to present substantial growth opportunities and rewards for hard drive industry participants with effective business models and compelling product offerings.
 WD continues to generate substantial free cash flow while continuing to reinvest significantly in our business, both in expanding and enhancing our product offerings and in improving our operations.
 Over the course of fiscal 2010, we continue to lead the industry's fastest-growing segment, 2.5-inch drives, deploying industry-leading aerial density products at the 640 gigabyte, 750 gigabytes and 1 terabyte capacity points. We made our entry into the traditional enterprise market with the introduction of our first 2.5-inch SAS hard drives for server applications, part of our multi-year commitment to serve this important and heretofore, unserved market for WD.
 We brought to market our first client-oriented solid-state drive to complement our existing portfolio of high reliability embedded SSDs and we are in development of our first solid-state drive for high-end enterprise applications.
 In our Branded Products business, we broadened our portfolio of WD storage devices with the introduction of My Book Studio RX, hard drives for Apple users and the My Book AV DVR Expander hard drives, which allow users to keep more of their favorite movies and TV shows.
 We extended our family of WD Media Players with the WD TV Live Plus featuring added services such as Netflix, YouTube, Flickr, Pandora, Live 365 as well as Media Flight that enable consumers to stream their favorite shows and personal content directly to their TVs. It is also the first network Media Player compatible with Windows 7.
 On the manufacturing side, we improved the security of supply of glass substrates, and enhanced our long-term cost structure with the acquisition of Hoya's media operations.
 Before I pass the call to Tim Leyden, I want to acknowledge our loyal customers, who are the primary reason for WD's continued significant growth as a leading supplier of storage devices. We will continue to work passionately and diligently to earn their ongoing business. I also want to thank the WD team and our supply partners for their exceptional contribution to WD's revenue, profitability and cash generation in the fiscal year just ended. Tim?

We believe that the weaker and less linear demand resulted from a number of things.
 OEM restocking during Q3 reduced market size in Q4. In European credit crisis led to some purchasing pause by retailers for a number of weeks due to the euro-exchange fluctuation, and there was relative weakness in the consumer space.
 The combination of these factors and the pressure exerted by some competitors increasing their production in a smaller market contributed to more downward pressure on selling prices than we had expected. Given these conditions, we acted to optimize our financial results, but at the same time, defending our market position.
 We are pleased that despite these challenging fiscal Q4 conditions, we achieved growth margins of 22.5% for the quarter, a 15-year high for WD in the fiscal Q4, and at the high-end of our long-term gross margin model range.
 For our full fiscal year 2010, total revenue was $9.8 billion. Hard drive shipments were 194 million units and ASP was $50. Revenue from non-hard drive sales totaled approximately $154 million. The corresponding numbers for fiscal 2009 were total revenue of $7.5 billion, shipments of 146 million units and ASP of $51.
 Revenue from non-hard drive sales totaled approximately $62 million. Compared with 2009, gross margin in fiscal 2010 was 24.4% versus 17.9%. Operating income was $1.525 billion versus $519 million. Net income was $1.382 billion versus $417 million, and earnings per share was $5.93 versus $2.08.
 Net income in fiscal 2010 included $27 million of expense related to litigation settlement. Net income in fiscal 2009 included a $14 million in-process R&D charge related to the acquisition of Silicon Systems, $112 million of restructuring charges offset by related tax benefits of $4 million, and an $18 million gain on the sale of the company's substrate manufacturing facility in Sarawak, Malaysia.
 Turning to the 2010 fourth quarter results. Total revenue was $2.4 billion, up 24% from the prior year, but down 10% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 49.7 million units, up 24% from the prior year period but down 3% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV and Media Players and solid-state drives totaled approximately $27 million, up 20% from the prior year and down 41% versus the March quarter.
 Average hard drive selling price was approximately $47 per unit, down $1 from the year-ago quarter and down $4 from the March quarter.
 We shipped 19.9 million mobile drives in the June quarter, compared to 16.9 million in the year-ago quarter and 19.8 million in the March quarter, reflecting unit consumer demand in the U.S. and India, offset by commercial and emerging market growth.
 During the June quarter, we shipped 5.3 million drives into the DVR market, compared to 3.7 million in the year-ago quarter and 4.6 million in the March quarter. The strength in this market in the June quarter was in line with historical-seasonal patterns.
 Revenue from sales of our Branded Products including WD TV was $400 million, up 26% from $318 million in the year-ago quarter, and down 14% sequentially from $467 million in the March quarter reflecting the typical seasonality of the retail market. In addition to normal seasonality, the decline in the value of the euro impacted selling in Europe for a number of weeks.
 Enterprise SATA demand continues to grow in fiscal Q4, particularly at the high-capacity points. Our product lineup has us well-positioned in this segment. Our SAS products are making progress towards our multi-year plan to gain a representative share of the traditional enterprise market.
 Moving on to our sales channels and geographic results. Revenue by channel was 54% OEM, 29% distribution and 17% Branded Products in the June quarter, knowing the same percentage split as in the year-ago quarter and 49%, 33% and 18% in the March quarter. No single customer comprised more than 10% of total revenue.
 Relative to the geographic split and on our revenue, the Asian market continued to be strong by 54% of revenue in the June quarter as compared to 54% in the year-ago quarter and 52% in the March quarter. The Americas and European regions contributed 25% and 21%, respectively, in the June quarter compared to 24% and 22% in the year-ago quarter and 24% in the March quarter.
 Our gross margins for the quarter was 22.5%, up from 19.2% in the year-ago quarter and down from 25.2% in the March quarter. Gross margin was impacted on a sequential basis by pricing, channel mix, segment mix and volume reductions. Total R&D and SG&A spending was $242 million or 10.2% of revenue. This includes the $27 million of litigation settlements and compares with $184 million or 9.5% revenue in the year-ago quarter and $224 million or 8.5% of revenue in the March quarter.
 Operating income was $293 million or 12.3% of revenue. This compares with $209 million or 10.8% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $441 million or 16.7% of revenue in the March quarter. Net interest and other nonoperating expenses were approximately $1 million. Tax expense for the June quarter was $27 million or 9.2% of pretax income.
 Our net income totaled to $265 million or $1.13 per share. This compares with $196 million or $0.86 per share, and $400 million or $1.71 per share in the year-ago and March quarters, respectively.
 Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations during fiscal 2010, including $362 million during our fourth quarter. Our cash conversion cycles for the fourth quarter was a positive of two days. This consisted of 48 days of receivables outstanding, 28 days of inventory or 13 turns and 74 days of payables. Our inventory turns were reduced by approximately one turn as the result of including the higher inventory that we acquired on June 30th.
 Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for the June quarter were $185 million. Our non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense totaled $134 million.
 Capital additions for fiscal 2010 totaled $737 million lower than our April projection of $750 million as we scale back in line with lower demand. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal '10 totaled $510 million.
 During the fourth quarter, we acquired the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya Corporation for $233 million in cash. We expect that the Hoya will be mildly accretive to WD's long-term growth margin model by the end of the calendar year. But prior to that, it will have about a 50 basis points negative impact on the gross margin as we get it tuned to WD's production standards.
 We made $82 million of debt repayment installments during fiscal 2010, including $25 million during our fourth quarter. We reduced our debt balance to $400 million at the end of fiscal 2010.
 We exited fiscal Q4 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion, a decrease of $92 million from the March quarter. We continue to hold the cash balance in excess of our anticipated operating needs. With the strategy to maintain operational flexibility, increase our investments in advanced technology, expand our product breathe through the pursuit of internal and external opportunities, and to protect against macroeconomic weakness. The balance remaining in our stock repurchase authorization is $466 million.
 Now, I will discuss our expectations for capital, depreciation and tax for fiscal 2011.
 We expect our capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 to be between 78% of revenue with an additional $200 million related to our 6-inch to 8-inch wafer conversion and some expenditure to optimize the output from our recently acquired Hoya production facility. We expect total CapEx in Q1 to come in around $275 million. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $650 million for the fiscal year.
 We expect our book effective tax rate to range between 6% and 9% and our cash tax rate to be between 1% and 2%.
 Now, we'll move on to our long-term business model.
 We believe annual growth in the unit shipments of the hard drive market will continue in the 10% to 15% range into the foreseeable future. It should generate industry-revenue growth of between 5% and 7.5%. Given this industry-growth rate, we expect to operate within our long-term growth margin model range of 18% to 23%, with some longer term off of momentum from an increasing percentage on local media as well as advancing our presence in the traditional enterprise market.
 Our OpEx model target has continued in the 9% to 10% range and our resulting operating income will range from 8% to 14%. Tax expense is estimated to be in the range of 6% to 9% income before taxes. These parameters would yield net income in the 7% to 12.5% range.
 Now, turning to our guidance for fiscal Q1. Historically, September-quarter demand has been up by 10 to 13% when compared to June volumes. However, a number of factors are leading us to forecast lower growth this quarter. We believe that some of July's natural OEM demands was fulfilled at the end of June, and that OEMs are less concerned about shortages than they were a few months ago.
 U.S. retails sales statistics also suggests that there has been some emerging consumer demand weakness. Additionally, we believe that OEMs have planned for a regular back-to-school season and that components to satisfy those demand expectations are either in their manufacturing pipelines or in transit at this point in time.
 As we entered the quarter, demand has started out slowly as some customers deplete on-hand customer inventory and await confirmation of the extent of back-to-school demand. These factors will dampen the typical season of uplift to an expected range of between 2% and 6%, which translates into a TAM range of between 160 to 165 million units.
 Taking these factors into account, we anticipate that pricing will be competitive and further dependent on emerging demand level dynamics as-back-to-school season gets underway. Should demand turn out to be stronger than anticipated, we expect to be able to respond to the upside. Accordingly, we expect current quarter revenue for WD to be in a range from $2.350 billion to $2.450 billion.
 R&D and SG&A are expected to total approximately $235 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $1 million. We expect our tax rate to be about 7.5%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately $236 million. We estimated earnings per share between $0.80 and $0.90 for the September quarter. Bob?

I think if you look at the long-term cadence of the industry, we've consistently expanded margins as we move through the last decade, and we've done that.
 Half of that has been driven by growth of our business and the other half has been driven by our vertical integration of our business and efficiency and cost efforts. And so we started out at the beginning of the decade '01, '02 averaged 12% gross margin; '03, '04 was 16; '05, '06 was 18; '07 and '08 was 19; '09 and '10 was 21. So, we've seen a continuous expansion in margins at the same time that we've seen north of 20% compound annual revenue growth throughout that period.

And we think part of the forward positive guidance relates to the fact that as they did a product transition to Capella, there was no buildup of the inventory at the component level in the OEM customers. In fact there was a brief shortage as they transition from old to new. So I think there's a different stocking dynamic in Intel versus the drive industry. There is however, and we are seeing it, an uplift in commercial. But the combination of the macroeconomic conditions in Europe allied to the strong proportion of our business in distribution and retail and in OEM consumer is – the commercial boost is not making up completely in terms of overall growth rate for the softness we currently see in consumer and what we saw through last quarter was some flushing of inventory by the OEMs, and we are building in to our forward look for this quarter an expectation that they will release another little bit of on-hand component inventory. However, all of that being said – so we're planning on the conservative basis from a capacity-utilization perspective and a CapEx perceptive. However, as our history indicates, we're ever mindful of close attention to the actual numbers and the ability to sprint talk to address opportunity as they present themselves.

There is of course, you have to recognize the models. And whenever quarter-over-quarter demand is lower, that all those favors the small player in that environment in terms of their growth because if you have, let's say, pick a number, if you have 10% share at a major OEM and your two major competitors have 45% each and the market goes down. As the small player, you can afford to bid aggressively to get an increasing share and either keep your volume constant or grow it, and get the benefit of that growth on your bottom line. For the very large participant at any given customer to lean into that wind and price to grow volume, it's usually too costly to do that. So there's a natural tendency for the small players to grow when the market goes down, and then the ability of the large players to scale up rapidly causes them to typically grow when the market demand moves up.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Fiscal 2010 was another highly profitable growth year for WD.

Fiscal 2010 was another highly profitable growth year for WD. Ever-increasing demand for cost-effective, high-capacity storage continues to provide opportunity for substantial growth and consistent value creation over an extended term when addressed with an effective business model.
With a relentless focus on customer needs, quality, low cost and high-asset efficiency, WD has become solidly and increasingly profitable throughout the last decade. Over the last five years, WD has profitably grown revenue at a compound annual rate of 22%. In this same period, we have grown operating income at a compound rate of 50% per annum.
For fiscal year 2010, we grew revenue 32% to $9.8 billion. We increased operating income by 194% year-on-year. The hard drive demand growth story continues to be driven by the proliferation of multiple devices and applications that are resulting in the generation, utilization and storage, either locally or in the cloud of massive amounts of digital content on low-cost, high-capacity hard drives. 
We believe that the industry's growth trajectory will continue over the foreseeable future, creating significant additional opportunity for WD with its well-honed business model and expanding product set to continue to generate growth on a sustained and profitable basis.
This growth opportunity has been created in large part by our ability to continually drive down average cost-per-gigabyte, leading to attractive price points that have driven mass-market adoption of devices incorporating hard drives. At the same time, we have gradually expanded gross margins, while growing revenues by continuously increasing efficiencies and reducing costs.
Our assessment in late April of  a June quarter time in the range of 157 million to 162 million units proved overly optimistic. Actual demand for hard drives in the quarter was about 156 million units, down 4% sequentially but up 16% from the year-ago period. The major factors leading to the lower TAM were weakness in Europe, de-stocking by OEM customers and the shift in OEM ordering patterns to take advantage of lower-cost sea-versus-air freight. In hindsight, this expanded the March quarter at the expense of the June quarter. 
Given the change in the demand during the June quarter, WD and others in the industry responded quickly to adjust build plans, resulting in quarter ending inventory modestly increased, but at manageable levels.
Ship inventory increased from seven to 10 days, while component distribution inventories increased slightly but remained at the midpoint of the normal four- to six-week range including in transit.
Taking these market dynamics into account, we were pleased to deliver one of the strongest fiscal fourth quarter performances in company history. While market dynamics in the June quarter will temper short-term growth rates and affect price levels in the September quarter, we believe that the second half of the calendar year and calendar year 2011 will continue to present substantial growth opportunities and rewards for hard drive industry participants with effective business models and compelling product offerings.
WD continues to generate substantial free cash flow while continuing to reinvest significantly in our business, both in expanding and enhancing our product offerings, and in improving our operations.
Over the course of fiscal 2010, we continued to lead the industry's fastest-growing segment 2.5-inch drives, deploying industry-leading aerial density products at the 640 GB, 750 GB and 1 TB capacity points. We made our entry into the traditional enterprise market with the introduction of our first 2.5-inch SAS hard drives for server applications, part of our multi-year commitment to serve this important and heretofore, un-served market for WD.
We brought to market our first client-oriented solid state drive [SSD] to complement our existing portfolio of high-reliability embedded SSDs and we are in development of our first solid state drive for high-end enterprise applications. In our Branded Products business, we broadened our portfolio of WD storage devices with the introduction of My Book Studio LX, hard drives for Apple users, and the My Book AV DVR Expander hard drives, which allow users to keep more of their favorite movies and TV shows.
We extended our family of WD media players with the WD TV Live Plus featuring added services such as Netflix, YouTube, Flickr, Pandora, Live365 as well as Mediafly, that enable consumers to stream their favorite shows and personal content directly to their TVs. It is also the first network media player compatible with Windows 7.
On the manufacturing side, we improved the security of supply of glass substrates and enhanced our long-term cost structure with the acquisition of Hoya's media operations.
Before I pass the call to Tim Leyden, I want to acknowledge our loyal customers who are the primary reason for WD's continued significant growth as a leading supplier of storage devices. We will continue to work passionately and diligently to earn their ongoing business.

In the June quarter, demand was weaker and more back-end loaded than we had anticipated. We believe that the weaker and less linear demand resulted from a number of things.

We believe that the weaker and less linear demand resulted from a number of things. 
OEM restocking during Q3 reduced market size in Q4. The European credit crisis led to some purchasing pause by retailers for a number of weeks due to the euro exchange fluctuation, and there was relative weakness in the consumer space.
The combination of these factors and the pressure exerted by some competitors increasing their production in a smaller market contributed to more downward pressure on selling prices than we had expected. Given these conditions, we acted to optimize our financial results, but at the same time, defending our market position. 
We are pleased that despite these challenging fiscal Q4 conditions, we achieved growth margins of 22.5% for the quarter, a 15-year high for WD in the fiscal Q4, and at the high-end of our long-term gross margin model range.
For our full fiscal year 2010, total revenue was $9.8 billion. Hard drive shipments were 194 million units and ASP was $51. Revenue from non-hard drive sales totaled approximately $154 million. The corresponding numbers for fiscal 2009 were total revenue of $7.5 billion, shipments of 146 million units and ASP of $51.
Revenue from non-hard drive sales totaled approximately $62 million. Compared with 2009, gross margin in fiscal 2010 was 24.4% versus 17.9%. Operating income was $1.525 billion versus $519 million. Net income was $1.382 billion versus $470 million, and the earnings per share was $5.93 versus $2.08.
Net income in fiscal 2010 included $27 million of expense related to litigation settlements. Net income in fiscal 2009 included a $14 million in-process R&D charge related to the acquisition of SiliconSystems, $112 million of restructuring charges offset by related tax benefits of $4 million and an $18 million gain on the sale of the company's substrate manufacturing facility in Sarawak, Malaysia.
Turning to the 2010 fourth quarter results. Total revenue was $2.4 billion, up 24% from the prior year but down 10% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 49.7 million units, up 24% from the prior year period but down 3% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV media players and solid state drives totaled approximately $27 million, up 20% from the prior year and down 41% versus the March quarter.
Average hard drive selling price was approximately $47 per unit, down $1 from the year-ago quarter and down $4 from the March quarter.
We shipped 19.9 million mobile drives in the June quarter compared to 16.9 million in the year-ago quarter and 19.8 million in the March quarter, reflecting unit consumer demand in the U.S. and India, offset by commercial and emerging market growth.
During the June quarter, we shipped 5.3 million drives into the DVR market compared to 3.7 million in the year-ago quarter and 4.6 million in the March quarter. The strength in this market in the June quarter was in line with historical-seasonal patterns.
Revenue from sales of our Branded Products including WD TV was $400 million, up 26% from $318 million in the year-ago quarter and down 14% sequentially from $467 million in the March quarter, reflecting the typical seasonality of the retail market. In addition to normal seasonality, the decline in the value of the euro impacted selling in Europe for a number of weeks.
Enterprise SATA demand continued to grow in fiscal Q4, particularly at the high-capacity points. Our product lineup has us one position in this segment. Our SAS products are making progress towards our multi-year plan to gain a representative share of the traditional enterprise market.
Moving on to our sales channel and geographic results. Revenue by channel was 54% OEM, 29% distribution and 17% Branded Products in the June quarter, mirroring the same percentage splits as in the year-ago quarter and 49%, 33% and 18% in the March quarter. No single customer comprised more than 10% of total revenue.
Relative to the geographic split of all revenue, the Asian market continued to be strong at 54% of revenue in the June quarter as compared to 54% in the year-ago quarter and 52% in the March quarter. The Americas and European regions contributed 25% and 21%, respectively, in the June quarter compared to 24% and 22% in the year-ago quarter and 24% and 24% in the March quarter.
Our gross margin for the quarter was 22.5%, up from 19.2% in the year-ago quarter and down from 25.2% in the March quarter. Gross margin was impacted on a sequential basis by pricing, channel mix, segment mix and volume reductions. Total R&D and SG&A spending was $242 million or 10.2% of revenue. This includes the $27 million of litigation settlements and compares with $184 million or 9.5% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $224 million or 8.5% of revenue in the March quarter.
Operating income was $293 million, or 12.3% of revenue. This compares with $209 million, or 10.8% of revenue, in the year-ago quarter and $441 million, or 16.7% of revenue, in the March quarter. Net interest and other non-operating expenses were approximately $1 million. Tax expense for the June quarter was $27 million and 9.2% of pretax income.
Our net income totaled to $265 million, or $1.13 per share. This compares with $196 million, or $0.86 per share, and $400 million, or $1.71 per share, in the year-ago and March quarters, respectively.
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations during fiscal 2010, including $363 million during our fourth quarter. Our cash conversion cycle for the fourth quarter was a positive two days. This consisted of 48 days of receivables outstanding, 28 days of inventory or 13 turns, and 74 days of payables. Our inventory turns were reduced by approximately one turn as the result of including the higher inventory that we acquired on June 30.
Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for the June quarter were $185 million. Our non-cash charges from depreciation and amortization expense totaled $134 million.
Capital additions for fiscal 2010 totaled $737 million, lower than our April projection of $750 million, as we scale back in line with lower demand. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal '10 totaled $510 million.
During the fourth quarter, we acquired the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya Corporation for $233 million in cash. We expect that the Hoya facility will be mindfully accretive to WD's long-term gross margin model by the end of the calendar year. But prior to that, we will have about a 50-basis point negative impact on the gross margin as we get it tuned to WD's production standards.
We made $82 million of debt repayment installments during fiscal 2010, including $25 million during our fourth quarter. We reduced our debt balance to $400 million at the end of fiscal 2010.
We exited fiscal Q4 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion, a decrease of $92 million from the March quarter. We continue to hold a cash balance in excess of our anticipated operating needs with a strategy to maintain operational flexibility, increase our investments in advanced technology, expand our product breadth for the pursuit of internal and external opportunities and to predict protect against macroeconomic weakness. The balance remaining in our stock repurchase authorization is $466 million. Now I will discuss our expectations for capital, depreciation and tax for fiscal 2011.
We expect our capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 to be between 7% and 8% of revenue with an additional $200 million related to our 6-inch to 8-inch wafer conversion and some expenditure to optimize the output from our recently acquired Hoya production facility. We expect total CapEx in Q1 to come in around $275 million. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $650 million for the fiscal year.
We expect our book effective tax rate to range between 6% and 9% and our cash tax rate to be between 1% and 2%. Now I will move on to our long-term business model.
We believe that annual growth in unit shipments of the hard drive market will continue in the 10% to 15% range into the foreseeable future. It should generate industry revenue growth of between 5% and 7.5%. Given this industry growth rate, we expect to operate within our long-term gross margin model range of 18% to 23%, with some longer-term upward momentum from increasing our percentage of internal media, as well as advancing our presence in the traditional enterprise market. 
Our OpEx model is targeted to continue in the 9% to 10% range and our resulting operating income will the range from 8% to 14%. Tax expense is estimated to be in the range of 6% to 9% of income before taxes. These parameters would yield net income in the 7% to 12.5% range. 
Now turning to our guidance for fiscal Q1. Historically, September quarter demand has been up by 10% to 13% when compared to June volumes. However, a number of factors were leading us to forecast lower growth this quarter. We believe that some of July's OEM demand was fulfilled at the end of June, and as the OEMs are less concerned about shortages than they were a few months ago. U.S. retails sales statistics also suggest that there has been some emerging consumer demand weakness. Additionally, we believe that OEMs have planned for a regular back-to-school season and that components to satisfy those demand expectations are either in their manufacturing pipelines or in transit at this point in time.
As we enter the quarter, demand has started out slowly as some customers deplete on-hand component inventory and await confirmation of the extent of back-to-school demand. These factors will dampen the typical seasonal uplift to an expected range of between 2% and 6%, which translates to a TAM range of between 160 to 165 million units.
Taking these factors into account, we anticipate that pricing will be competitive and further dependent on emerging demand level dynamics as back-to-school season gets underway. Should demand turn out to be stronger than anticipate, we expect to be able to respond to the upside. Accordingly, we expect current quarter revenue for WD to be in a range from $2.350 billion to $2.450 billion. 
R&D and SG&A are expected to total approximately $235 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $1 million. We expect our tax rate to be about 7.5%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 236 million. We estimate earnings per share of between $0.80 and $0.90 for the September quarter. Bob?"

Of course, it was heavily in the segments where consumers are strongest, which is retail and the channel, and then as a result of that, it takes a little while longer, but OEMs do seek to reset their prices as a result of the prices that they’re seeing coming out of those channels. So we’re expecting that for Q1, in what would normally have been an expectation of either a flat to up ASP, that the price declines will be worse than historical. And even though there will be a little bit of mix-up because of the consumer demand, the weighting of consumer demands as we head into the back-to-school season, we don't think that, that will be sufficient to offset the pricing decline."

So we're looking for that to tell us whether the rest of the quarter will be one of muted expectations for the future leading to consumption of on-hand component stock or whether the view of the future by our customers will be more positive, which would lead them to immediately begin to replenish stocks of components."

Their growth for the PC-related market was 2%, and we believe the bulk of that was ASP growth rather than unit growth. And we think part of their forward positive guidance relates to the fact that as they did a product transition to Capella, there was no build up of inventory at the component level in the OEM customers. In fact, there was a brief shortage as they transitioned from old to new. So I think there's a different stocking dynamic in Intel versus the drive industry. There is, however, and we are seeing it, an uplift in Commercial. But the combination of the macroeconomic conditions in Europe allied to the strong proportion of our business in distribution and retail and in OEM consumer is the Commercial boost is not making up completely, in terms of overall growth rate, for the softness we currently see in Consumer. And what we saw through last quarter was some flushing of inventory by the OEMs, and we are building into our forward look for this quarter an expectation that they will release another little bit of on-hand component inventory. However, all of that being said -- so we're planning on a conservative basis from a capacity-utilization perspective and a CapEx perspective. However, as our history indicates, we're ever mindful of close attention to the actual numbers and the ability to sprint up to address opportunities as they present themselves."

Of course, you have to recognize the models. And whenever quarter-over-quarter demand is lower, that always favors the smaller player in that environment in terms of their growth because if you have, let's say -- pick a number. If you have 10% share at a major OEM and your two major competitors have 45% each and the market goes down, as the small player, you can afford to bid aggressively to get an increasing share and either keep your volume constant or grow it and get the benefit of that growth on your bottom line. For the very large participant at any given customer to lean into that wind and price to grow volume, it's usually too costly to do that. So there's a natural tendency for the smaller players to grow when the market goes down, and then, the ability of the large players to scale up rapidly causes them to typically grow when the market demand moves up."

Fiscal 2010 was another highly profitable growth year for WD. Ever-increasing demand for cost-effective, high-capacity storage continues to provide opportunity for substantial growth and consistent value creation over an extended term when addressed with an effective business model.
With a relentless focus on customer needs, quality, low cost and high-asset efficiency, WD has become solidly and increasingly profitable throughout the last decade. Over the last five years, WD has profitably grown revenue at a compound annual rate of 22%. In this same period, we have grown operating income at a compound rate of 50% per annum.
For fiscal year 2010, we grew revenue 32% to $9.8 billion. We increased operating income by 194% year-on-year. The hard drive demand growth story continues to be driven by the proliferation of multiple devices and applications that are resulting in the generation, utilization and storage, either locally or in the cloud of massive amounts of digital content on low-cost, high-capacity hard drives. 
We believe that the industry's growth trajectory will continue over the foreseeable future, creating significant additional opportunity for WD with its well-honed business model and expanding product set to continue to generate growth on a sustained and profitable basis.
This growth opportunity has been created in large part by our ability to continually drive down average cost-per-gigabyte, leading to attractive price points that have driven mass-market adoption of devices incorporating hard drives. At the same time, we have gradually expanded gross margins, while growing revenues by continuously increasing efficiencies and reducing costs.
Our assessment in late April of  a June quarter time in the range of 157 million to 162 million units proved overly optimistic. Actual demand for hard drives in the quarter was about 156 million units, down 4% sequentially but up 16% from the year-ago period. The major factors leading to the lower TAM were weakness in Europe, de-stocking by OEM customers and the shift in OEM ordering patterns to take advantage of lower-cost sea-versus-air freight. In hindsight, this expanded the March quarter at the expense of the June quarter. 
Given the change in the demand during the June quarter, WD and others in the industry responded quickly to adjust build plans, resulting in quarter ending inventory modestly increased, but at manageable levels.
Ship inventory increased from seven to 10 days, while component distribution inventories increased slightly but remained at the midpoint of the normal four- to six-week range including in transit.
Taking these market dynamics into account, we were pleased to deliver one of the strongest fiscal fourth quarter performances in company history. While market dynamics in the June quarter will temper short-term growth rates and affect price levels in the September quarter, we believe that the second half of the calendar year and calendar year 2011 will continue to present substantial growth opportunities and rewards for hard drive industry participants with effective business models and compelling product offerings.
WD continues to generate substantial free cash flow while continuing to reinvest significantly in our business, both in expanding and enhancing our product offerings, and in improving our operations.
Over the course of fiscal 2010, we continued to lead the industry's fastest-growing segment 2.5-inch drives, deploying industry-leading aerial density products at the 640 GB, 750 GB and 1 TB capacity points. We made our entry into the traditional enterprise market with the introduction of our first 2.5-inch SAS hard drives for server applications, part of our multi-year commitment to serve this important and heretofore, un-served market for WD.
We brought to market our first client-oriented solid state drive [SSD] to complement our existing portfolio of high-reliability embedded SSDs and we are in development of our first solid state drive for high-end enterprise applications. In our Branded Products business, we broadened our portfolio of WD storage devices with the introduction of My Book Studio LX, hard drives for Apple users, and the My Book AV DVR Expander hard drives, which allow users to keep more of their favorite movies and TV shows.
We extended our family of WD media players with the WD TV Live Plus featuring added services such as Netflix, YouTube, Flickr, Pandora, Live365 as well as Mediafly, that enable consumers to stream their favorite shows and personal content directly to their TVs. It is also the first network media player compatible with Windows 7.
On the manufacturing side, we improved the security of supply of glass substrates and enhanced our long-term cost structure with the acquisition of Hoya's media operations.
Before I pass the call to Tim Leyden, I want to acknowledge our loyal customers who are the primary reason for WD's continued significant growth as a leading supplier of storage devices. We will continue to work passionately and diligently to earn their ongoing business. I also want to thank the WD team and our supply partners for their exceptional contribution to WD's revenue, profitability and cash generation in the fiscal year just ended. Tim?"

In the June quarter, demand was weaker and more back-end loaded than we had anticipated. We believe that the weaker and less linear demand resulted from a number of things.

We believe that the weaker and less linear demand resulted from a number of things. 
OEM restocking during Q3 reduced market size in Q4. The European credit crisis led to some purchasing pause by retailers for a number of weeks due to the euro exchange fluctuation, and there was relative weakness in the consumer space.
The combination of these factors and the pressure exerted by some competitors increasing their production in a smaller market contributed to more downward pressure on selling prices than we had expected. Given these conditions, we acted to optimize our financial results, but at the same time, defending our market position. 
We are pleased that despite these challenging fiscal Q4 conditions, we achieved growth margins of 22.5% for the quarter, a 15-year high for WD in the fiscal Q4, and at the high-end of our long-term gross margin model range.
For our full fiscal year 2010, total revenue was $9.8 billion. Hard drive shipments were 194 million units and ASP was $51. Revenue from non-hard drive sales totaled approximately $154 million. The corresponding numbers for fiscal 2009 were total revenue of $7.5 billion, shipments of 146 million units and ASP of $51.
Revenue from non-hard drive sales totaled approximately $62 million. Compared with 2009, gross margin in fiscal 2010 was 24.4% versus 17.9%. Operating income was $1.525 billion versus $519 million. Net income was $1.382 billion versus $470 million, and the earnings per share was $5.93 versus $2.08.
Net income in fiscal 2010 included $27 million of expense related to litigation settlements. Net income in fiscal 2009 included a $14 million in-process R&D charge related to the acquisition of SiliconSystems, $112 million of restructuring charges offset by related tax benefits of $4 million and an $18 million gain on the sale of the company's substrate manufacturing facility in Sarawak, Malaysia.
Turning to the 2010 fourth quarter results. Total revenue was $2.4 billion, up 24% from the prior year but down 10% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 49.7 million units, up 24% from the prior year period but down 3% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV media players and solid state drives totaled approximately $27 million, up 20% from the prior year and down 41% versus the March quarter.
Average hard drive selling price was approximately $47 per unit, down $1 from the year-ago quarter and down $4 from the March quarter.
We shipped 19.9 million mobile drives in the June quarter compared to 16.9 million in the year-ago quarter and 19.8 million in the March quarter, reflecting unit consumer demand in the U.S. and India, offset by commercial and emerging market growth.
During the June quarter, we shipped 5.3 million drives into the DVR market compared to 3.7 million in the year-ago quarter and 4.6 million in the March quarter. The strength in this market in the June quarter was in line with historical-seasonal patterns.
Revenue from sales of our Branded Products including WD TV was $400 million, up 26% from $318 million in the year-ago quarter and down 14% sequentially from $467 million in the March quarter, reflecting the typical seasonality of the retail market. In addition to normal seasonality, the decline in the value of the euro impacted selling in Europe for a number of weeks.
Enterprise SATA demand continued to grow in fiscal Q4, particularly at the high-capacity points. Our product lineup has us one position in this segment. Our SAS products are making progress towards our multi-year plan to gain a representative share of the traditional enterprise market.
Moving on to our sales channel and geographic results. Revenue by channel was 54% OEM, 29% distribution and 17% Branded Products in the June quarter, mirroring the same percentage splits as in the year-ago quarter and 49%, 33% and 18% in the March quarter. No single customer comprised more than 10% of total revenue.
Relative to the geographic split of all revenue, the Asian market continued to be strong at 54% of revenue in the June quarter as compared to 54% in the year-ago quarter and 52% in the March quarter. The Americas and European regions contributed 25% and 21%, respectively, in the June quarter compared to 24% and 22% in the year-ago quarter and 24% and 24% in the March quarter.
Our gross margin for the quarter was 22.5%, up from 19.2% in the year-ago quarter and down from 25.2% in the March quarter. Gross margin was impacted on a sequential basis by pricing, channel mix, segment mix and volume reductions. Total R&D and SG&A spending was $242 million or 10.2% of revenue. This includes the $27 million of litigation settlements and compares with $184 million or 9.5% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $224 million or 8.5% of revenue in the March quarter.
Operating income was $293 million, or 12.3% of revenue. This compares with $209 million, or 10.8% of revenue, in the year-ago quarter and $441 million, or 16.7% of revenue, in the March quarter. Net interest and other non-operating expenses were approximately $1 million. Tax expense for the June quarter was $27 million and 9.2% of pretax income.
Our net income totaled to $265 million, or $1.13 per share. This compares with $196 million, or $0.86 per share, and $400 million, or $1.71 per share, in the year-ago and March quarters, respectively.
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations during fiscal 2010, including $363 million during our fourth quarter. Our cash conversion cycle for the fourth quarter was a positive two days. This consisted of 48 days of receivables outstanding, 28 days of inventory or 13 turns, and 74 days of payables. Our inventory turns were reduced by approximately one turn as the result of including the higher inventory that we acquired on June 30.
Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for the June quarter were $185 million. Our non-cash charges from depreciation and amortization expense totaled $134 million.
Capital additions for fiscal 2010 totaled $737 million, lower than our April projection of $750 million, as we scale back in line with lower demand. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal '10 totaled $510 million.
During the fourth quarter, we acquired the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya Corporation for $233 million in cash. We expect that the Hoya facility will be mindfully accretive to WD's long-term gross margin model by the end of the calendar year. But prior to that, we will have about a 50-basis point negative impact on the gross margin as we get it tuned to WD's production standards.
We made $82 million of debt repayment installments during fiscal 2010, including $25 million during our fourth quarter. We reduced our debt balance to $400 million at the end of fiscal 2010.
We exited fiscal Q4 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion, a decrease of $92 million from the March quarter. We continue to hold a cash balance in excess of our anticipated operating needs with a strategy to maintain operational flexibility, increase our investments in advanced technology, expand our product breadth for the pursuit of internal and external opportunities and to predict protect against macroeconomic weakness. The balance remaining in our stock repurchase authorization is $466 million. Now I will discuss our expectations for capital, depreciation and tax for fiscal 2011.
We expect our capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 to be between 7% and 8% of revenue with an additional $200 million related to our 6-inch to 8-inch wafer conversion and some expenditure to optimize the output from our recently acquired Hoya production facility. We expect total CapEx in Q1 to come in around $275 million. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $650 million for the fiscal year.
We expect our book effective tax rate to range between 6% and 9% and our cash tax rate to be between 1% and 2%. Now I will move on to our long-term business model.
We believe that annual growth in unit shipments of the hard drive market will continue in the 10% to 15% range into the foreseeable future. It should generate industry revenue growth of between 5% and 7.5%. Given this industry growth rate, we expect to operate within our long-term gross margin model range of 18% to 23%, with some longer-term upward momentum from increasing our percentage of internal media, as well as advancing our presence in the traditional enterprise market. 
Our OpEx model is targeted to continue in the 9% to 10% range and our resulting operating income will the range from 8% to 14%. Tax expense is estimated to be in the range of 6% to 9% of income before taxes. These parameters would yield net income in the 7% to 12.5% range. 
Now turning to our guidance for fiscal Q1. Historically, September quarter demand has been up by 10% to 13% when compared to June volumes. However, a number of factors were leading us to forecast lower growth this quarter. We believe that some of July's OEM demand was fulfilled at the end of June, and as the OEMs are less concerned about shortages than they were a few months ago. U.S. retails sales statistics also suggest that there has been some emerging consumer demand weakness. Additionally, we believe that OEMs have planned for a regular back-to-school season and that components to satisfy those demand expectations are either in their manufacturing pipelines or in transit at this point in time.
As we enter the quarter, demand has started out slowly as some customers deplete on-hand component inventory and await confirmation of the extent of back-to-school demand. These factors will dampen the typical seasonal uplift to an expected range of between 2% and 6%, which translates to a TAM range of between 160 to 165 million units.
Taking these factors into account, we anticipate that pricing will be competitive and further dependent on emerging demand level dynamics as back-to-school season gets underway. Should demand turn out to be stronger than anticipate, we expect to be able to respond to the upside. Accordingly, we expect current quarter revenue for WD to be in a range from $2.350 billion to $2.450 billion. 
R&D and SG&A are expected to total approximately $235 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $1 million. We expect our tax rate to be about 7.5%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 236 million. We estimate earnings per share of between $0.80 and $0.90 for the September quarter. Bob?"

So we’re expecting that for Q1, in what would normally have been an expectation of either a flat to up ASP, that the price declines will be worse than historical. And even though there will be a little bit of mix-up because of the consumer demand, the weighting of consumer demands as we head into the back-to-school season, we don't think that, that will be sufficient to offset the pricing decline."

The pause that they felt for a number of weeks was when they -- currency was fluctuating mostly in a downward direction as far as they were concerned, so consequently, they were unsure about what to do as they grappled with having to buy goods that were denominated in dollars and had to operate on the market to the end user at a fixed price point. So they were concerned, they had uncertainty so they have hesitated to refill their pipeline. And when the currency fluctuations settled down a bit, it did come back into the market and started refilling their pipeline, but at a muted level versus what would have been normal otherwise. And the second question is the Hoya gross margin? As we've indicated it to be, mildly accretive is the terms we used. And that is based upon the fact that we -- we had fallen a little behind our model of internal versus external. And in getting back to our model, which the Hoya acquisition will help us to do, it will add something in the region of about a half a percentage point or so to gross margins in the longer term."

Their growth for the PC-related market was 2%, and we believe the bulk of that was ASP growth rather than unit growth. And we think part of their forward positive guidance relates to the fact that as they did a product transition to Capella, there was no build-up of inventory at the component level in the OEM customers. In fact, there was a brief shortage as they transitioned from old to new. So I think there's a different stocking dynamic in Intel versus the drive industry. There is, however, and we are seeing it, an uplift in Commercial. But the combination of the macroeconomic conditions in Europe allied to the strong proportion of our business in distribution and retail and in OEM consumer, is the commercial boost is not making up completely, in terms of overall growth rate, for the softness we currently see in Consumer and the, what we saw through last quarter was some flushing of inventory by the OEMs, and we are building into our forward look for this quarter an expectation that they will release another little bit of on-hand component inventory. However, all of that being said -- so we're planning on a conservative basis from a capacity-utilization perspective and a CapEx perceptive. However, as our history indicates, we're ever mindful of close attention to the actual numbers and the ability to sprint up to address opportunities as they present themselves."

There is of course, you have to recognize the models.

For the very large participant at any given customer to lean into that wind and price to grow volume, it's usually too costly to do that. So there's a natural tendency for the smaller players to grow when the market goes down, and then the ability of the large players to scale up rapidly causes them to typically grow when the market demand moves up."

Fiscal 2010 was another highly profitable growth year for WD. Ever-increasing demand for cost-effective, high-capacity storage continues to provide opportunity for substantial growth and consistent value creation over an extended term when addressed with an effective business model.
With a relentless focus on customer needs, quality, low cost and high-asset efficiency, WD has become solidly and increasingly profitable throughout the last decade. Over the last five years, WD has profitably grown revenue at a compound annual rate of 22%. In this same period, we have grown operating income at a compound rate of 50% per annum.
For fiscal year 2010, we grew revenue 32% to $9.8 billion. We increased operating income by 194% year-on-year. The hard drive demand growth story continues to be driven by the proliferation of multiple devices and applications that are resulting in the generation, utilization and storage, either locally or in the cloud of massive amounts of digital content on low-cost, high-capacity hard drives. 
We believe that the industry's growth trajectory will continue over the foreseeable future, creating significant additional opportunity for WD with its well-honed business model and expanding product set to continue to generate growth on a sustained and profitable basis.
This growth opportunity has been created in large part by our ability to continually drive down average cost-per-gigabyte, leading to attractive price points that have driven mass-market adoption of devices incorporating hard drives. At the same time, we have gradually expanded gross margins, while growing revenues by continuously increasing efficiencies and reducing costs.
Our assessment in late April of  a June quarter time in the range of 157 million to 162 million units proved overly optimistic. Actual demand for hard drives in the quarter was about 156 million units, down 4% sequentially but up 16% from the year-ago period. The major factors leading to the lower TAM were weakness in Europe, de-stocking by OEM customers and the shift in OEM ordering patterns to take advantage of lower-cost sea-versus-air freight. In hindsight, this expanded the March quarter at the expense of the June quarter. 
Given the change in the demand during the June quarter, WD and others in the industry responded quickly to adjust build plans, resulting in quarter ending inventory modestly increased, but at manageable levels.
Ship inventory increased from seven to 10 days, while component distribution inventories increased slightly but remained at the midpoint of the normal four- to six-week range including in transit.
Taking these market dynamics into account, we were pleased to deliver one of the strongest fiscal fourth quarter performances in company history. While market dynamics in the June quarter will temper short-term growth rates and affect price levels in the September quarter, we believe that the second half of the calendar year and calendar year 2011 will continue to present substantial growth opportunities and rewards for hard drive industry participants with effective business models and compelling product offerings.
WD continues to generate substantial free cash flow while continuing to reinvest significantly in our business, both in expanding and enhancing our product offerings, and in improving our operations.
Over the course of fiscal 2010, we continued to lead the industry's fastest-growing segment 2.5-inch drives, deploying industry-leading aerial density products at the 640 GB, 750 GB and 1 TB capacity points. We made our entry into the traditional enterprise market with the introduction of our first 2.5-inch SAS hard drives for server applications, part of our multi-year commitment to serve this important and heretofore, un-served market for WD.
We brought to market our first client-oriented solid state drive [SSD] to complement our existing portfolio of high-reliability embedded SSDs and we are in development of our first solid state drive for high-end enterprise applications. In our Branded Products business, we broadened our portfolio of WD storage devices with the introduction of My Book Studio LX, hard drives for Apple users, and the My Book AV DVR Expander hard drives, which allow users to keep more of their favorite movies and TV shows.
We extended our family of WD media players with the WD TV Live Plus featuring added services such as Netflix, YouTube, Flickr, Pandora, Live365 as well as Mediafly, that enable consumers to stream their favorite shows and personal content directly to their TVs. It is also the first network media player compatible with Windows 7.
On the manufacturing side, we improved the security of supply of glass substrates and enhanced our long-term cost structure with the acquisition of Hoya's media operations.
Before I pass the call to Tim Leyden, I want to acknowledge our loyal customers who are the primary reason for WD's continued significant growth as a leading supplier of storage devices. We will continue to work passionately and diligently to earn their ongoing business. I also want to thank the WD team and our supply partners for their exceptional contribution to WD's revenue, profitability and cash generation in the fiscal year just ended. Tim?"

In the June quarter, demand was weaker and more back-end loaded than we had anticipated. We believe that the weaker and less linear demand resulted from a number of things.

We believe that the weaker and less linear demand resulted from a number of things. 
OEM restocking during Q3 reduced market size in Q4. The European credit crisis led to some purchasing pause by retailers for a number of weeks due to the euro exchange fluctuation, and there was relative weakness in the consumer space.
The combination of these factors and the pressure exerted by some competitors increasing their production in a smaller market contributed to more downward pressure on selling prices than we had expected. Given these conditions, we acted to optimize our financial results, but at the same time, defending our market position. 
We are pleased that despite these challenging fiscal Q4 conditions, we achieved growth margins of 22.5% for the quarter, a 15-year high for WD in the fiscal Q4, and at the high-end of our long-term gross margin model range.
For our full fiscal year 2010, total revenue was $9.8 billion. Hard drive shipments were 194 million units and ASP was $51. Revenue from non-hard drive sales totaled approximately $154 million. The corresponding numbers for fiscal 2009 were total revenue of $7.5 billion, shipments of 146 million units and ASP of $51.
Revenue from non-hard drive sales totaled approximately $62 million. Compared with 2009, gross margin in fiscal 2010 was 24.4% versus 17.9%. Operating income was $1.525 billion versus $519 million. Net income was $1.382 billion versus $470 million, and the earnings per share was $5.93 versus $2.08.
Net income in fiscal 2010 included $27 million of expense related to litigation settlements. Net income in fiscal 2009 included a $14 million in-process R&D charge related to the acquisition of SiliconSystems, $112 million of restructuring charges offset by related tax benefits of $4 million and an $18 million gain on the sale of the company's substrate manufacturing facility in Sarawak, Malaysia.
Turning to the 2010 fourth quarter results. Total revenue was $2.4 billion, up 24% from the prior year but down 10% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 49.7 million units, up 24% from the prior year period but down 3% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV media players and solid state drives totaled approximately $27 million, up 20% from the prior year and down 41% versus the March quarter.
Average hard drive selling price was approximately $47 per unit, down $1 from the year-ago quarter and down $4 from the March quarter.
We shipped 19.9 million mobile drives in the June quarter compared to 16.9 million in the year-ago quarter and 19.8 million in the March quarter, reflecting unit consumer demand in the U.S. and India, offset by commercial and emerging market growth.
During the June quarter, we shipped 5.3 million drives into the DVR market compared to 3.7 million in the year-ago quarter and 4.6 million in the March quarter. The strength in this market in the June quarter was in line with historical-seasonal patterns.
Revenue from sales of our Branded Products including WD TV was $400 million, up 26% from $318 million in the year-ago quarter and down 14% sequentially from $467 million in the March quarter, reflecting the typical seasonality of the retail market. In addition to normal seasonality, the decline in the value of the euro impacted selling in Europe for a number of weeks.
Enterprise SATA demand continued to grow in fiscal Q4, particularly at the high-capacity points. Our product lineup has us one position in this segment. Our SAS products are making progress towards our multi-year plan to gain a representative share of the traditional enterprise market.
Moving on to our sales channel and geographic results. Revenue by channel was 54% OEM, 29% distribution and 17% Branded Products in the June quarter, mirroring the same percentage splits as in the year-ago quarter and 49%, 33% and 18% in the March quarter. No single customer comprised more than 10% of total revenue.
Relative to the geographic split of all revenue, the Asian market continued to be strong at 54% of revenue in the June quarter as compared to 54% in the year-ago quarter and 52% in the March quarter. The Americas and European regions contributed 25% and 21%, respectively, in the June quarter compared to 24% and 22% in the year-ago quarter and 24% and 24% in the March quarter.
Our gross margin for the quarter was 22.5%, up from 19.2% in the year-ago quarter and down from 25.2% in the March quarter. Gross margin was impacted on a sequential basis by pricing, channel mix, segment mix and volume reductions. Total R&D and SG&A spending was $242 million or 10.2% of revenue. This includes the $27 million of litigation settlements and compares with $184 million or 9.5% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $224 million or 8.5% of revenue in the March quarter.
Operating income was $293 million, or 12.3% of revenue. This compares with $209 million, or 10.8% of revenue, in the year-ago quarter and $441 million, or 16.7% of revenue, in the March quarter. Net interest and other non-operating expenses were approximately $1 million. Tax expense for the June quarter was $27 million and 9.2% of pretax income.
Our net income totaled to $265 million, or $1.13 per share. This compares with $196 million, or $0.86 per share, and $400 million, or $1.71 per share, in the year-ago and March quarters, respectively.
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations during fiscal 2010, including $363 million during our fourth quarter. Our cash conversion cycle for the fourth quarter was a positive two days. This consisted of 48 days of receivables outstanding, 28 days of inventory or 13 turns, and 74 days of payables. Our inventory turns were reduced by approximately one turn as the result of including the higher inventory that we acquired on June 30.
Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for the June quarter were $185 million. Our non-cash charges from depreciation and amortization expense totaled $134 million.
Capital additions for fiscal 2010 totaled $737 million, lower than our April projection of $750 million, as we scale back in line with lower demand. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal '10 totaled $510 million.
During the fourth quarter, we acquired the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya Corporation for $233 million in cash. We expect that the Hoya facility will be mindfully accretive to WD's long-term gross margin model by the end of the calendar year. But prior to that, we will have about a 50-basis point negative impact on the gross margin as we get it tuned to WD's production standards.
We made $82 million of debt repayment installments during fiscal 2010, including $25 million during our fourth quarter. We reduced our debt balance to $400 million at the end of fiscal 2010.
We exited fiscal Q4 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion, a decrease of $92 million from the March quarter. We continue to hold a cash balance in excess of our anticipated operating needs with a strategy to maintain operational flexibility, increase our investments in advanced technology, expand our product breadth for the pursuit of internal and external opportunities and to predict protect against macroeconomic weakness. The balance remaining in our stock repurchase authorization is $466 million. Now I will discuss our expectations for capital, depreciation and tax for fiscal 2011.
We expect our capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 to be between 7% and 8% of revenue with an additional $200 million related to our 6-inch to 8-inch wafer conversion and some expenditure to optimize the output from our recently acquired Hoya production facility. We expect total CapEx in Q1 to come in around $275 million. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $650 million for the fiscal year.
We expect our book effective tax rate to range between 6% and 9% and our cash tax rate to be between 1% and 2%. Now I will move on to our long-term business model.
We believe that annual growth in unit shipments of the hard drive market will continue in the 10% to 15% range into the foreseeable future. It should generate industry revenue growth of between 5% and 7.5%. Given this industry growth rate, we expect to operate within our long-term gross margin model range of 18% to 23%, with some longer-term upward momentum from increasing our percentage of internal media, as well as advancing our presence in the traditional enterprise market. 
Our OpEx model is targeted to continue in the 9% to 10% range and our resulting operating income will the range from 8% to 14%. Tax expense is estimated to be in the range of 6% to 9% of income before taxes. These parameters would yield net income in the 7% to 12.5% range. 
Now turning to our guidance for fiscal Q1. Historically, September quarter demand has been up by 10% to 13% when compared to June volumes. However, a number of factors were leading us to forecast lower growth this quarter. We believe that some of July's OEM demand was fulfilled at the end of June, and as the OEMs are less concerned about shortages than they were a few months ago. U.S. retails sales statistics also suggest that there has been some emerging consumer demand weakness. Additionally, we believe that OEMs have planned for a regular back-to-school season and that components to satisfy those demand expectations are either in their manufacturing pipelines or in transit at this point in time.
As we enter the quarter, demand has started out slowly as some customers deplete on-hand component inventory and await confirmation of the extent of back-to-school demand. These factors will dampen the typical seasonal uplift to an expected range of between 2% and 6%, which translates to a TAM range of between 160 to 165 million units.
Taking these factors into account, we anticipate that pricing will be competitive and further dependent on emerging demand level dynamics as back-to-school season gets underway. Should demand turn out to be stronger than anticipate, we expect to be able to respond to the upside. Accordingly, we expect current quarter revenue for WD to be in a range from $2.350 billion to $2.450 billion. 
R&D and SG&A are expected to total approximately $235 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $1 million. We expect our tax rate to be about 7.5%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 236 million. We estimate earnings per share of between $0.80 and $0.90 for the September quarter. Bob?"

So we’re expecting that for Q1, in what would normally have been an expectation of either a flat to up ASP, that the price declines will be worse than historical. And even though there will be a little bit of mix-up because of the consumer demand, the weighting of consumer demands as we head into the back-to-school season, we don't think that, that will be sufficient to offset the pricing decline."

Their growth for the PC-related market was 2%, and we believe the bulk of that was ASP growth rather than unit growth. And we think part of their forward positive guidance relates to the fact that as they did a product transition to Capella, there was no buildup of inventory at the component level in the OEM customers. In fact, there was a brief shortage as they transitioned from old to new. So I think there's a different stocking dynamic in Intel versus the drive industry. There is, however, and we are seeing it, an uplift in Commercial. But the combination of the macroeconomic conditions in Europe allied to the strong proportion of our business in distribution and retail and in OEM consumer is the Commercial boost is not making up completely, in terms of overall growth rate, for the softness we currently see in Consumer. And what we saw through last quarter was some flushing of inventory by the OEMs, and we are building into our forward look for this quarter an expectation that they will release another little bit of on-hand component inventory. However, all of that being said -- so we're planning on a conservative basis from a capacity-utilization perspective and a CapEx perspective. However, as our history indicates, we're ever mindful of close attention to the actual numbers and the ability to sprint up to address opportunities as they present themselves."

Of course, you have to recognize the models. And whenever quarter-over-quarter demand is lower, that always favors the smaller player in that environment in terms of their growth because if you have, let's say -- pick a number. If you have 10% share at a major OEM and your two major competitors have 45% each and the market goes down, as the small player, you can afford to bid aggressively to get an increasing share and either keep your volume constant or grow it and get the benefit of that growth on your bottom line. For the very large participant at any given customer to lean into that wind and price to grow volume, it's usually too costly to do that. So there's a natural tendency for the smaller players to grow when the market goes down, and then, the ability of the large players to scale up rapidly causes them to typically grow when the market demand moves up."

With me are Tim Leyden, recently named Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our newly appointed Chief Financial Officer. Although my titles of President and CEO are unchanged, my emphasis has shifted to how we can best leverage our resources to accelerate our growth in the years ahead.
As the new leader of all WD operations and keeper of our low cost model, Tim will discuss current industry dynamics and the company’s performance in the September quarter. While Wolfgang will report on our financial results and provide our outlook for the December quarter.
With the advantage of the deeply experienced dedicated and passionate team we are excited as we lead WD into its fifth decade. As we look out over the next 10 years, the role of digital content in our daily lives at home and in the workplace will become increasingly ubiquitous with the explosion of data and video rich applications creating huge amounts of digital content that need to be stored and managed.
This will be driven by both the traditional computing markets and by new or evolutionary platforms such as hand held devices, television and other home entertainment devices for the analog to digital conversion is in its infancy.
In addition to the continuing growth of traditional PC platforms, the growth of cloud computing, tablet computing and the proliferation of smartphones creates myriad opportunities for storage companies and traditional hard drive and emerging solid state drive markets.
We will shape the future of WD by sorting through all of these opportunities and acting decisively in our core business and in our business development efforts to continue delivering value to customers and shareholders. You have seen some early indications of one new strategic direction for WD into the movement of data and content around the home, with our WD TV Live HD Media Players, our WD My Book Live Network Storage Solutions and most recently our WD Livewire Powerline Network offering.
Going forward, we are looking for ways in which to pursue strategic growth initiatives such as these both organically and through acquisition.
Turning to the current hard drive industry environment, we are again reminded that this is a competitive industry of seasons and cycles. The management of supply and demand remains an imperfect science. The moderation and industry demand growth in the last two quarters came on the heels of an unprecedented four quarters of strong sequential growth coming out of the great recession.
As an industry we purely overshot the recent market demand and we’ve spent the last six months correcting for that. We believe this will prove to be an interlude to the resumption of the industries traditional cadence of growth over the last 10 years.
Having said this, it’s important to note that growth has not disappeared in the hard drive industry post-recession. Expected year-on-year volume growth and calendar year 2010 of 15% brings the five-year industry compound growth rate, which includes the recession of late 2008 to about 11%, while the average growth rate over the last 10 years has been 12.5%.
In the last two quarters, some competitors have made aggressive bids to recover market share. This is a scenario we have seen play out from time-to-time over the years in the drive industry. Our observation is that these are temporary skirmishes, which do not derail our fundamental long-term profitable growth story as we address these challenges with a tested business model we have developed and honed overtime.
For the last 10 years, WD has been navigating these industry swings and consistently winning share with our focus on customer value by having the lowest cost model in the industry. We have grown revenues by 18% annually over the past 10 years and by 22% annually for the past five years, by providing exceptional value to our customers through the high quality, reliability and desirability of our products along with predictable availability and competitive prices.
At the same time, we have expanded our full year gross margins from 11% in 2001 to 24% in 2010. This was accomplished primarily through successful vertical integration, expanding our product breath, delighting our customers and execution of our low cost model. We will continue with this approach as we go forward.
Tim Leyden will now comment on how the September quarter played out for WD and the industry.

As John indicated we have navigated through most of the market driven supply demand imbalances in the hard drive industry and WD remains prepared to address them with what we believe is the industry’s lowest cost market.
Continuing our unwavering focus on low cost leadership is my top priority in my new position. Encompass with a focus on staying on the industry area inventory curve and continued depreciation of customer needs and a broad and diverse set of competitive product offerings in all segments will keep us in an advantage position. This proven approach to the hard drive business has served us, our customers and our shareholders well over the last 10 years.
As John mentioned earlier, we saw an increase into four consecutive quarters of increasing hard drive shipments from April 2009 to March 2010 and it is now apparent that we have been experiencing correction of PC maker inventories beginning in the June quarter of this year. Despite weak demand for the first two months of the September quarter and a quieter than normal back-to-school season, industry shipments nevertheless climb towards the high-end of our 165 million unit forecast for the September quarter. But to accomplish this, shipment volumes in week 13 were over twice the average of previous weeks.
In light of the sluggish demand in July and August, we reduced our bill plans for September, delayed our capital spending and selectively stepped back from participating in some very aggressive pricing at the end of the quarter.
Lower than expected demand early in the quarter led to a buildup of manufactures inventory during the first eight weeks of quarter and contrary to prior fiscal first quarter historical trends, it contributed to aggressive pricing during the remainder of the quarter.
We maintain shares in the 3.5-inch market and uses 1.5 points per share in 2.5-inch as a result of our temporary pullback. We exited the quarter with well controlled inventories in each of our segments. We expect that the instrumental parts of the week 13 shipments will be consumed during the current quarter because customers will not wish to carry this inventory into a seasonally weaker March quarter and we believe this set the stage for a TAM in the December quarter that will be essentially flat with the September quarter.
We believe that HDD hardware and software are pivotal to the data and content management infrastructure ecosystem. The value delivered is not proportional to your reward in the broader marketplace. Particularly in the level of unique skills and investments in technology and capital are taken into consideration.
Consequently, we are in the midst of reviewing the comparative returns on investments that we are currently achieving across our customer and product ranges, with a view to reaching the levels of ROI we need in order to continue investing and provide a product availability that the market demands.
As the industry’s low cost provider, we believe that it is in the best interest of our customers and shareholders that we offer products at a price that cover the cost of doing business and provides the margin and the funding required to continue investing in all that remain a valued HDD supplier on a long-term sustainable basis.
Looking at our third markets in the September quarter, in the compute space we saw continuation of softness in consumer demand in all channels, with somewhat of an offset coming from healthier desktops and commercial notebook demand. We expect desktop demand to be marginally down and notebook demand to be marginally up in the December quarter.
In the enterprise segment, we saw continued demand strength particularly in enterprise data with the traditional enterprise segment been essentially flat sequentially. We expect overall enterprise demand to show us some modest growth in the December quarter.
In a non-compute space, we saw the CE market volumes decline marginally quarter-on-quarter as the market try to start a seasonal demand pattern. At the same time the branded products market showed seasonal demand strength for both 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch categories showing growth.
We expect the non-compute space to be essentially flat in the December quarter. I can see volume increases in branded and CE are offset by the seasonal decline in gaining volume. Geographically, Asia has showed continued strength, Europe showed the best comparative improvement from the previous quarter helped by the currency appreciation, while the U.S. market is up modestly from the prior quarter.
We shipped 50.7 million units in the September quarter up 15% from the year ago period, while the overall market grew by 8%. Revenues totaled $2.4 billion, gross margin was 18.2%, we remain solidly profitable with net income of $197 million. Importantly, we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations of $390 million.
We continue to invest in the business and are doing so by improving and expanding our operations and by enhancing our product line up, both in our industry leading hard drive offerings and in the nascent the promising market for management of content in the home.
In our traditional businesses, we deliver new models of our popular My Book and My Passport external hard drives with USB 3 connectivity and up to the 3 terabytes of storage. Significantly improving content transfer speed and providing our customers with future proofing as newer PCs and other devices begin shipping in volume with USB 3.
And in the component space we began shipping the highest area of entity 3.5-inch hard drive in the industry.

I would like to refer you to a new and expanded summary of financial information that been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. Much of the data that we have re-sited during past conference calls is included in that spreadsheet.
During my prepared remarks, I will focus on highlights and significant changes in some of our key metrics. At the end of this call the summary of financial information will be updated to include our Q2 guidance which I will discuss in a few moments.
The September quarter was characterized by unusually aggressive pricing that lasted throughout the quarter, with like-to-like prices decline in excess of 8%. Pricing pressure was most prevalent in the 2.5-inch segment. We made a conscious decision to limit our participation in this segment in an effort to optimize profitability. Our operating model allowed us to adjust our operating expenses to offset the impact of pricing on operating markets, in close the quarter near the midpoint of our EPS guidance range.
We actively managed capital receipts and working capital and generated significant free cash flow. Revenues for the first fiscal quarter were $2.4 billion, up 9% from the prior year and 1% sequentially. This included $51 million of sales of media from our newly acquired Singapore media facility to fulfill contractual obligations carrying over from poised existing sales commitment.
We do not expect any external media sales in Q2. Our price shipments totaled 50.7 million units, up 15% from the prior year period and 2% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV Media Players, WD Livewire, Network Kits and solid state drive totaled approximately $33 million. Roughly flat with the prior year and up 22% from the June quarter.
Average hard drive selling price was approximately $46 per unit, down $3 from the year ago quarter and down $1 from the June quarter. Revenue from sales of our branded products including WD TV and WD Livewire products were $425 million, up 11% from $382 million in the year ago quarter and 6% sequentially from $400 million in the June quarter. There was no customer that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue.
Our first margin for the quarter was 18.2%, down from 23.3% in the year ago quarter and down from 22.5% in the June quarter. The lower and expected gross margin percentage was prematurely due to the price decline, I spoke to you earlier. Product and segment mix as well as product cost decline were largely in line with expectations.
Total R&D and SG&A spending was $226 million or 9.4% of revenue. This compares with $195 million or 8.8% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $242 million or 10.2% of revenue in the June quarter. As a reminder, total operating expenses for the June quarter include a $27 million of litigation settlement.
Operating income was $211 million or 8.8% of revenue. This compares with $319 million or 14.4% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $293 million or 12.3% of revenue in the June quarter.
Net interest and other non-operating expenses were less than $1 million. Tax expense for the September quarter was $14 million or 6.6% of the pre-tax income. Our net incomes totaled $197 million or $0.84 per share. This compares with $288 million or $1.25 per share and $265 million or $1.13 per share in the year ago and June quarter’s, respectively.
Turning to the balance sheet, we generated $390 million in cash flow from operations during the September quarter. Our cash conversion cycle for the first quarter was a negative three-day. It consisted of 50 days of residual outstanding, 26 days of inventory or 14 turns and 79 days of payables.
Capital additions for the September quarter totaled $200 million, lower than our July projections of $275 million as we scale back in line with lower shipments. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter totaled $150 million.
We continue to expect our capital expenditure for fiscal 2011 to be between 7% and 8% of revenue with an additional $200 million related to our 6-inch to 8-inch wafer conversion and some expenditure to optimize the output from our recently acquired media facility in Singapore. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be at about $630 million for the fiscal year.
We made $25 million of debt repayment installments during the first quarter and thereby reduced our debt balance to $375 million. We exited fiscal Q1 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion, an increase of $124 million from the June quarter.
During the quarter we repurchased 1.8 million shares at a total cost of $60 million. The balance remaining on our stock repurchase authorization is $460 million. From a balance sheet credit perspective our first priority is to create shareholder value through strategic investments both in markets currently served and adjacent markets. Any larger scale share buyback would be considered only after we have started our strategic option.
Now turning to our expectations for Q2. Historically, industry shipment increased by 5% to 7% from the September through the December quarter. As Tim mentioned, we have seen approximately twice the shipments volume in the last week of last quarter than in average of the preceding 12 weeks of the quarter.
We believe that customers will not want to carry extra inventory into the March quarter and therefore expect some inventory correction. We consequently assume that the December quarter industry TAM will be roughly flat with the September quarter at around 165 million units.
Some of the aggressive pricing we have seen last quarter has carried over into this quarter and our guidance includes like-to-like price decline of approximately 5%. We are actively reviewing our plan shipment portfolio to identify business that is not meeting our business model requirements.
We have contractual obligations do not exist we may review our shipments to low contribution products and seek to ship sales to more profitable segments. As previously indicated, we are currently calibrating our new Singapore media facility to our own recipes and as a result, we are experiencing dilution of first margin of 50 basis points during this quarter.
Accordingly, our guidance for fiscal Q2 is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range from $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion. R&D and SG&A spending is expected to total approximately $230 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $1 million, expect our tax rate to be within our business model of 6% to 9%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 235 million. We estimate earnings per share of between $0.50 and $0.60 for the December quarter.
Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.

And so with the working off the inventory that has occurred during the course of the September quarter and with the HDD market being up about 5% versus what would normally be a much stronger position, somewhere in the 10% to 12% I would imagine.
And going into a December quarter that’s essentially flat we think that the opportunity will come more from supply, demand - in supply case and demand again. So we think that it will and the industry will have to manage the inventory supply demand equilibrium and stabilize that situation and that will have more of an impact on us than any of the new products exception.

So everything we hear indicates that roughly half of the iPad sales are to existing Apple households and that somewhere in the region of 13% to 15% of the folks buying iPads admit to substituting the iPad for a previously planned PC purchase and some 23% of purchasers indicate that they are buying an iPad as an alternative to a Kindle or other eReader. So, what we see, I think, is a complementary additional device sale to the overall ecosystem of content consumption.
We think that when you look at the numbers, certainly there has been some fall off in netbook over the last couple quarters. They’re also -- you have to take the price point of the iPad into account. It’s likely that over the next several quarters as other tablets emerge, they will address lower price points than the iPad currently occupies. But on overall assessment, we’re seeing, maybe somewhere in the 10% to 20% impact range on the growth of low end notebook/netbook products.

But we do believe that there is some shift to the overall traditional seasonality of the industry and unfortunately the timing of the big recession makes it -- and the recovery out of that -- makes it very difficult to clearly discern shifts in the multi-year seasonal patterns. But we do believe that there is a (inaudible) of the rise of China as an important market, creating demand in the first calendar quarter of the year.
We believe there is a shift from air freight to sea freight from Asia to the U.S. and Europe causing a shift, a pull forward of back to school builds into the second calendar quarter of the year. And that we’re, over time, the seasonality of the business will flatten out. But it’s, it’s difficult to get a precise handle on that because of the massive disruption that the recession put on top of those patterns.

I want to come back to just what has been going on here over the past six months or so. John and Tim, if you could kind of weigh in here. Is there something that’s structurally wrong right now with the overall disk drive industry in terms of how the industry interfaces with both the OEMs and the distributors?
And I think back to 2004 how there was a lot of challenges and the industry participants worked to have greater transparency and greater dialogue to manage the inventories and supply demand and balances. Because I just get confused when you can have this huge 13th week and then suddenly the spigot gets turned off again by the OEMs. I mean, are they having these quick solid demand cycles?

It is very typical. We saw -- we have never before seen in the industry four sequential quarters where the demand presented to the industry outstripped the industry’s demand for supply -- ability to supply. And it’s pretty natural coming out of that that the pendulum is going to swing back a little the other way. It is very difficult to land without a little over shoot.
And so I think what you have seen in the last six months has been, you know, the wealth created in the four quarter runoff allowed people to -- encourage everybody to get more invested in the industry. And initially, as the demand softened, people have tried to maintain their momentum. And it takes a little while for folks to realize that the -- if everybody overbuilds then there’s going to be pressure and then there is going to be -- you know, our customers are smart people. They are going to take advantage of that. And we need to get things back in balance and move on with life. And that is the cycle that has been played through.
I think if you analyze the numbers however, you will see that -- you know things are not a disaster right now. Where we finished last quarter above the bottom of our model, you can go back many years into the last 10 years and find periods where we dropped out of the model for periods of time. And I would remind you that the model was a significantly lower bottom to it that it has today.
So the industry and WD have expanded gross margin model consistently over the last 10 years. And we are still -- you know, yeah, we do not like being under the bottom of the model. And we are going to work to move ourselves back into it as soon as we can but we are also going to work to ensure that we have the right product set and the right availability and the right approach with our customers to have them prefer WD product over others and continue to grow our business profitably.

With me are Tim Leyden, recently named Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our newly appointed Chief Financial Officer. 
Although my titles of President and CEO are unchanged, my emphasis has shifted to how we can best leverage our resources to accelerate our growth in the years ahead. As the new leader of all WD operations and keeper of our low cost model, Tim will discuss current industry dynamics and the company's performance in the September quarter while Wolfgang will report on our financial results and provide our outlook for the December quarter. With the advantage of a deeply experienced, dedicated and passionate team, we're excited as we lead WD into its fifth decade. 
As we look out over the next 10 years, the role of digital content in our daily lives at home and in the workplace will become increasingly ubiquitous, with the explosion of data and video rich applications creating huge amounts of digital content that need to be stored and managed. This will be driven by both the traditional computing markets and by new or evolutionary platforms such as handheld devices, televisions and other home entertainment devices for the analog to digital conversion is in its infancy. 
In addition to the continuing growth of traditional PC platforms, the growth of cloud computing, tablet computing and the proliferation of smartphones creates myriad opportunities for storage companies in traditional hard drive and emerging solid state drive markets. We will shape the future of WD by sorting through all these opportunities and acting decisively in our core business and in our business development efforts to continue delivering value to customers and shareholders. 
You have seen some early indications of one new strategic direction for WD into the movement of data and content around the home with our WD TV Live Media Players, our WD My Book Live network storage solutions and most recently, our WD Livewire powerline network offering. Going forward, we are looking for ways in which to pursue strategic growth initiatives such as this, both organically and through acquisition.
Turning to the current hard drive industry environment. We are again reminded that this is a competitive industry of seasons and cycles. The management of supply and demand remains an imperfect science. The moderation in industry demand growth in the last two quarters came on the heels of an unprecedented four quarters of strong sequential growth coming out of the great recession. As an industry, we clearly overshot the recent market demand, and we have spent the last six months correcting for that. We believe this will prove to be an interlude to the resumption of the industry's traditional cadence of growth over the last 10 years. 
Having said this, it's important to note that growth has not disappeared in the hard drive industry post recession. Expected year-on-year volume growth in calendar year 2010 of 15% brings the five-year industry compound growth rate, which includes the recession of late 2008 to about 11%, while the average growth rate over the last 10 years has been 12.5%. 
In the last two quarters, some competitors have made aggressive bids to recover market share. This is a scenario we have seen play out from time to time over the years in the drive industry. Our observation is that these are temporary skirmishes, which do not derail our fundamental long-term profitable growth story as we address these challenges with the tested business model we have developed and honed over time.
For the last 10 years, WD has been navigating these industry swings and consistently winning share with our focus on customer value by having the lowest cost model in the industry. We have grown revenues by 18% annually over the last 10 years and by 22% annually for the last five years by providing exceptional value to our customers through the high quality, reliability and desirability of our products along with predictable availability and competitive prices. At the same time, we have expanded our full year gross margins from 11% in 2001 to 24% in 2010. This was accomplished primarily through successful vertical integration, expanding our product breadth, delighting our customers and execution of our low-cost model. We will continue with this approach as we go forward. Tim Leyden, will now comment on how the September quarter played out for WD and the industry."

As John indicated, we have navigated through multiple market-driven supply/demand imbalances in the hard drive industry.

As John indicated, we have navigated through multiple market-driven supply/demand imbalances in the hard drive industry. And WD remains prepared to address them with what we believe is the industry's lowest cost model. Continuing our unwavering focus on low-cost leadership is my top priority in my new position. This couples with the focus on staying on the industry area density curve, a continued appreciation of customer needs and a broad and diverse set of competitive product offerings in all segments will keep us in an advantage position. This proven approach to the hard drive business has served us, our customers and our shareholders well for the last 10 years. 
As John mentioned earlier, we saw an unprecedented four consecutive quarters of increasing hard drive shipments from April 2009 to March 2010. And it is now apparent that we have been experiencing a correction of PC makers inventories beginning in the June quarter of this year. 
Despite weak demand for the first two months of the September quarter and the quite-than-normal back-to-school season, industry shipments nevertheless climbed towards the high end of our 165 million unit forecast for the September quarter. But to accomplish this, shipment volumes in week 13 were over twice the average of the previous 12 weeks. 
In light of the sluggish demand in July and August, we reduced our bill plans for September, delayed our capital spending and selectively step back from participating in some very aggressive pricing at the end of the quarter. The lower-than-expected demand earlier in the quarter made to a build up of manufacturers inventory during the first eight weeks of the quarter. And contrary to prior fiscal first quarter historical trend, this contributed to aggressive pricing during the reminder of the quarter. 
We maintained share in the 3.5-inch market and yielded 1.5 points of share in 2.5-inch as a result of our temporary process. We exited the quarter with well-controlled inventories in each of our segments. 
We expect that the incremental parts of the week 13 shipments will be consumed during the current quarter because customers will not wish to carry this inventory into a seasonally weaker March quarter. And we believe this sets the stage for a TAM in the December quarter that will be essentially flat with the September quarter.
We believe that HDD hardware and software are pivotal to the data and content management infrastructure ecosystem. The value delivers is not proportionately rewarded in the broader market space, particularly even the level of unique skills and investments in technology and capital are taken into consideration. 
Consequently, we under the midst of reviewing the comparative returns on investments that we are currently achieving across our customer and product ranges, with the view to reaching the levels of ROI we need in order to continue investing and to provide a product availability with the market demand. As the industry's lowest cost provider, we believe that it is in the best interest of our customers and shareholders that we offer products at a price that covers the cost of doing business and provides the margin and the funding required to continue investing in order to remain a valued HDD supplier on a long-term sustainable basis.
Looking at our served markets in the September quarter. In the compute space, we saw a continuation of softness in consumer demand in all channels, with somewhat of an offset coming from healthier desktop and commercial notebook demand. We expect desktop demand to be marginally down and notebook demand to be marginally up in the December quarter. 
In the Enterprise segment, we saw a continued demand strength particularly in Enterprise SATA with the traditional Enterprise segment being essentially flat sequentially. We expect overall Enterprise demand to show us some modest growth in the December quarter. 
In the non-compute space, we saw the CE market volume decline marginally quarter-on-quarter as the market track historical seasonal demand pattern. At the same time, the branded products market showed seasonal demand strength to both 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch categories showing growth. We expect the non-compute space to be essentially flat in the December quarter, and healthy volume increases in branded and CE are offset by the seasonal declines in gaming volume. 
Geographically, Asia has showed continued strength. Europe showed the best comparative improvements from the previous quarter helped by the currency appreciation, while the U.S. market was up modestly from the prior quarter. 
We shipped 50.7 million units in the September quarter, up 15% from the year-ago period while the overall market grew by 8%. Revenues totaled $2.4 billion, gross margin was 18.2%, and we remain solidly profitable with net income of $197 million.  Importantly, we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations of $390 million.
We continue to invest in the business and are doing so by improving and expanding our operation and by enhancing our product lineup, both in our industry-leading hard drive offerings and in the recent but promising market for management of content in the home. 
In our traditional businesses, we delivered new models of our popular My Book and My Passport external hard drives with USB 3.0 connectivity and up to three terabytes of storage. Significantly improving content transfer speed and providing our customers with future proofing as newer PCs and other devices began shipping in volume with USB 3.0. And in the component space, we began shipping the highest area of infancy, 3.5-inch hard drive in the industry, the WD Caviar bringing three terabytes, which fits 750 gigabytes on each of its four platters. 
Reflecting our increasing focus on enabling our comprehensive and easy-to-use experience for management of content in the home, we've added several new products and features including the WD Livewire powerline AV network kit, a home plug AV compatible solution that enables consumers to use their existing electrical wiring to extend secure high-speed Internet connection throughout the home. 
The My Book Live home network drive, which gives consumers the fastest storage of and access to their content and provides the same set up centralizing digital media in the home. The one terabyte WD Elements play multimedia drive, with high-definition capability onboard, and we also recently introduced the newest version of WD Photos or photo viewer application now optimize for the iPad, the iPhone 4 and iPod Touch. WD Photos enable users to view photos stored on their WD home network drive from any location. I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q1 financial performance and our outlook for the second quarter."

I would like to refer you to a new and expanded summary of financial information that has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. Much of the data that we have resided during past conference calls is included in that",1118,"Thank you, Tim. I would like to refer you to a new and expanded summary of financial information that has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. Much of the data that we have resided during past conference calls is included in that fact sheet. During my prepared remarks, I will focus on highlights and significant changes in some of our key metrics. At the end of this call, the summary of financial information will be updated to include our Q2 guidance, which I will discuss in a few moments.
The September quarter was characterized by unusually aggressive pricing that lasted throughout the quarter with like-for-like prices decline in excess of 8%. Pricing pressure was most prevalent in the 2.5-inch segment. We made a conscious decision to limit our participation in the segment in an effort to optimize profitability. Our flexible operating model allowed us to adjust our operating expenses to offset the impact of pricing on operating margin and closed the quarter near the midpoint of our EPS guidance range. 
We actively managed capital receipts and working capital and generated significant free cash flow. Revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $2.4 billion, up 9% from the prior year and 1% sequentially. This include its $51 million of sales of media from our newly acquired Singapore media facility to fulfill contractual obligation carrying over from Hoya's existing sales commitment. We do not expect any external media sales in Q2. 
Authorized shipments totaled 50.7 million units, up 15% from the prior year period and 2% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV Media Player, WD Livewire network kit and stock solid state drive totals approximately $33 million, roughly flat with the prior year and up 22% from the June quarter. 
Average hard drive selling price was approximately $46 per unit, down $3 from the year-ago quarter and down $1 from the June quarter. Revenue from sales of our branded products including WD TV and WD Livewire product was $425 million, up 11% from $382 million in the year-ago quarter and 6% sequentially from $400 million in the June quarter. 
There was no customer that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue. Our first margin for the quarter was 18.2%, down from 23.3% in the year-ago quarter and down from 22.5% in the June quarter. The lower-than-expected gross margin percentage was primarily due to the price declines I referred to earlier. Products and segment mix, as well as product cost declines, were largely in line with our expectations.
Total R&D and SG&A spending was $226 million or 9.4% of revenue. This compares with $195 million or 8.8% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $242 million or 10.2% of revenue in the June quarter. As a reminder, total operating expenses for the June quarter include a $27 million of litigation settlement. 
Operating income was $211 million or 8.8% of revenue. This compares with $319 million or 14.4% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $293 million or 12.3% of revenue in the June quarter. Net interest and other nonoperating expenses were less than $1 million. 
Tax expense for the September quarter was $14 million or 6.6% of pretax income. Our net income totaled $197 million or $0.84 per share. This compares with $288 million or $1.25 per share and $265 million or $1.13 per share in the year-ago and June quarter, respectively.
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $390 million in cash flow from operations during the September quarter. Our cash conversion cycle for the first quarter was a negative three days. This consisted of 50 days of receivables outstanding, 26 days of inventory or 14 turns and 79 days of payables. 
Capital addition for the September quarter totaled $200 million, lower than our July projections of $275 million as we scaled back in line with lower shipments. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter totaled $115 million. We continue to expect our capital expenditure for fiscal 2011 to be between 7% and 8% of revenue with an additional $200 million related to our 6-inch to 8-inch wafer conversion and some expenditures to optimize the output from our recently acquired media facility in Singapore. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be at about $630 million for the fiscal year. 
We made $25 million of debt repayment installments during the first quarter, and thereby reduced our debt balance to $375 million. We exited fiscal Q1 with cash and cash equivalent of $2.9 billion, an increase of $124 million from the June quarter. Here in the quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares at a total cost of $50 million. The balance remaining on our stock repurchase authorization is $416 million. From a balance sheet strategy perspective, our first priority is to create shareholder value through strategic investments both in markets currently served and adjacent markets. Any larger scale share buybacks would be considered only after we have exhausted our strategic options. 
Now turning to our expectations for fiscal Q2. Historically, industry shipment increased by 5% to 7% from the September to the December quarter. As Tim mentioned, we have seen approximately twice the shipment volume in the last week of last quarter than an average of the preceding 12 weeks of the quarter. We believe that customers will not want to carry extra inventory into the March quarter and therefore, expect some inventory correction. We consequently assume that the December quarter industry TAM will be roughly flat with the September quarter at around 165 million units. 
Some of the aggressive pricing we have seen last quarter is carried over into this quarter, and our guidance includes like-for-like pricing line of approximately 5%. We are actively reviewing our planned shipment portfolio to identify business that is not meeting our business model requirements. We have contractual obligations do not exist. We may refuse our shipments to low contribution products and seek to shift sales to more profitable segment. 
As previously indicated, we are currently calibrating our new Singapore media facility through our own recipes, and as a result, we are experiencing a dilution of first margin of 50 basis points during this quarter. Accordingly, our guidance for fiscal Q2 is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range from $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion. R&D and SG&A spending is expected to total approximately $230 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $1 million. Expect our tax rate to be within our business model of 6% to 9%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately $235 million. We estimate earnings per share of between $0.50 and $0.60 for the December quarter. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

From everything we can gather with multiple different stores reporting on tablets, I mean we see the first two quarters of the iPad is about 8 million units, to put it in context, that compares with the first two quarters of the EPC netbook emergence, which was 5 million units first two quarters.

And some 23% of purchasers indicate they're buying an iPad as an alternative to a Kindle or other eReader. So what we see, I think, is a complementary additional device sale to the overall ecosystem of content consumption. We think that when you look at the numbers, certainly, there has been some falloff in netbook over the last couple of quarters. They're also -- you have to take the price point of the iPad into account, so likely that over the next several quarters as other tablets emerge, they will address lower price points than the iPad currently occupies.

And it's very typical. We saw -- we have never before seen in the industry four sequential quarters where the demand presented to the industry outstrip the industry's demand ability to supply. And it's pretty natural coming out of that pendulum is going to swing back a little the other way. It's very difficult to land without a little overshoot. And so I think what you've seen in the last six months has been the wealth created in the four-quarter runoff allowed people to encourage everybody to get more invested in the industry. And initially, as the demand softens, people have tried to maintain their momentum. And it takes a little while for folks to realize that if everybody overbuilds, then there's going to be pressure and then there's going to be -- our customers are smart people, they're going to take advantage of that. And we need to get things back in balance and move on with life. And that's the cycle that's been played through. I think if you analyze the numbers, however, you'll see that things are not a disaster right now. We finished last quarter above the bottom of our model. You can go back many years into the last 10 years and find periods where we dropped out of the model for periods of time, and I would remind you that the model was a significantly lower bottom to it than it has today. So the industry and WD have expanded the gross margin model consistently over the last 10 years, and we're still -- yes, we don't like being under the bottom of the model, and we're going to work to move ourselves back into it as soon as we can, but we're also willing to work to ensure that we have the right products set and the right availability and the right approach with our customers that has them prefer WD products over others and continue to grow our business profitably."

With me are Tim Leyden, recently named Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our newly appointed Chief Financial Officer. 
Although my titles of President and CEO are unchanged, my emphasis has shifted to how we can best leverage our resources to accelerate our growth in the years ahead. As the new leader of all WD operations and keeper of our low cost model, Tim will discuss current industry dynamics and the company's performance in the September quarter while Wolfgang will report on our financial results and provide our outlook for the December quarter. With the advantage of a deeply experienced, dedicated and passionate team, we're excited as we lead WD into its fifth decade. 
As we look out over the next 10 years, the role of digital content in our daily lives at home and in the workplace will become increasingly ubiquitous, with the explosion of data and video rich applications creating huge amounts of digital content that need to be stored and managed. This will be driven by both the traditional computing markets and by new or evolutionary platforms such as handheld devices, televisions and other home entertainment devices where the analog to digital conversion is in its infancy. 
In addition to the continuing growth of traditional PC platforms, the growth of cloud computing, tablet computing and the proliferation of smartphones creates myriad opportunities for storage companies in traditional hard drive and emerging solid state drive markets. We will shape the future of WD by sorting through all these opportunities and acting decisively in our core business and in our business development efforts to continue delivering value to customers and shareholders. 
You have seen some early indications of one new strategic direction for WD into the movement of data and content around the home with our WD TV Live Media Players, our WD My Book Live network storage solutions and most recently, our WD Livewire powerline network offering. Going forward, we are looking for ways in which to pursue strategic growth initiatives such as this, both organically and through acquisition.
Turning to the current hard drive industry environment. We are again reminded that this is a competitive industry of seasons and cycles. The management of supply and demand remains an imperfect science. The moderation in industry demand growth in the last two quarters came on the heels of an unprecedented four quarters of strong sequential growth coming out of the great recession. As an industry, we clearly overshot the recent market demand, and we have spent the last six months correcting for that. We believe this will prove to be an interlude to the resumption of the industry's traditional cadence of growth over the last 10 years. 
Having said this, it's important to note that growth has not disappeared in the hard drive industry post recession. Expected year-on-year volume growth in calendar year 2010 of 15% brings the five-year industry compound growth rate, which includes the recession of late 2008 to about 11%, while the average growth rate over the last 10 years has been 12.5%. 
In the last two quarters, some competitors have made aggressive bids to recover market share. This is a scenario we have seen play out from time to time over the years in the drive industry. Our observation is that these are temporary skirmishes, which do not derail our fundamental long-term profitable growth story as we address these challenges with the tested business model we have developed and honed over time.
For the last 10 years, WD has been navigating these industry swings and consistently winning share with our focus on customer value by having the lowest cost model in the industry. We have grown revenues by 18% annually over the last 10 years and by 22% annually for the last five years by providing exceptional value to our customers through the high quality, reliability and desirability of our products along with predictable availability and competitive prices. At the same time, we have expanded our full year gross margins from 11% in 2001 to 24% in 2010. This was accomplished primarily through successful vertical integration, expanding our product breadth, delighting our customers and execution of our low-cost model. We will continue with this approach as we go forward. Tim Leyden, will now comment on how the September quarter played out for WD and the industry."

As John indicated, we have navigated through multiple market-driven supply/demand imbalances in the hard drive industry.

As John indicated, we have navigated through multiple market-driven supply/demand imbalances in the hard drive industry. And WD remains prepared to address them with what we believe is the industry's lowest cost model. Continuing our unwavering focus on low-cost leadership is my top priority in my new position. This couples with the focus on staying on the industry area density curve, a continued appreciation of customer needs and a broad and diverse set of competitive product offerings in all segments will keep us in an advantage position. This proven approach to the hard drive business has served us, our customers and our shareholders well for the last 10 years. 
As John mentioned earlier, we saw an unprecedented four consecutive quarters of increasing hard drive shipments from April 2009 to March 2010. And it is now apparent that we have been experiencing a correction of PC makers inventories beginning in the June quarter of this year. 
Despite weak demand for the first two months of the September quarter and the quieter-than-normal back-to-school season, industry shipments nevertheless climbed towards the high end of our 165 million unit forecast for the September quarter. But to accomplish this, shipment volumes in week 13 were over twice the average of the previous 12 weeks. 
In light of the sluggish demand in July and August, we reduced our build plans for September, delayed our capital spending and selectively stepped back from participating in some very aggressive pricing at the end of the quarter. The lower-than-expected demand earlier in the quarter led to a build-up of manufacturers inventory during the first eight weeks of the quarter. And contrary to prior fiscal first quarter historical trend, this contributed to aggressive pricing during the reminder of the quarter. 
We maintained share in the 3.5-inch market and yielded 1.5 points of share in 2.5-inch as a result of our temporary process. We exited the quarter with well-controlled inventories in each of our segments. 
We expect that the incremental part of the week 13 shipments will be consumed during the current quarter because customers will not wish to carry this inventory into a seasonally weaker March quarter. And we believe this sets the stage for a TAM in the December quarter that will be essentially flat with the September quarter.
We believe that HDD hardware and software are pivotal to the data and content management infrastructure ecosystem. The value delivers is not proportionately rewarded in the broader market space, particularly even the level of unique skills and investments in technology and capital are taken into consideration. 
Consequently, we under the midst of reviewing the comparative returns on investments that we are currently achieving across our customer and product ranges, with the view to reaching the levels of ROI we need in order to continue investing and to provide a product availability that the market demands. As the industry's lowest cost provider, we believe that it is in the best interest of our customers and shareholders that we offer products at a price that covers the cost of doing business and provides the margin and the funding required to continue investing in order to remain a valued HDD supplier on a long-term sustainable basis.
Looking at our served markets in the September quarter. In the compute space, we saw a continuation of softness in consumer demand in all channels, with somewhat of an offset coming from healthier desktop and commercial notebook demand. We expect desktop demand to be marginally down and notebook demand to be marginally up in the December quarter. 
In the Enterprise segment, we saw a continued demand strength particularly in Enterprise SATA with the traditional Enterprise segment being essentially flat sequentially. We expect overall Enterprise demand to show us some modest growth in the December quarter. 
In the non-compute space, we saw the CE market volumes decline marginally quarter-on-quarter as the market tracked historical seasonal demand patterns. At the same time, the branded products market showed seasonal demand strength to both 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch categories showing growth. We expect the non-compute space to be essentially flat in the December quarter, and healthy volume increases in branded and CE are offset by the seasonal declines in gaming volume. 
Geographically, Asia has showed continued strength. Europe showed the best comparative improvements from the previous quarter helped by the currency appreciation, while the U.S. market was up modestly from the prior quarter. 
We shipped 50.7 million units in the September quarter, up 15% from the year-ago period while the overall market grew by 8%. Revenues totaled $2.4 billion, gross margin was 18.2%, and we remain solidly profitable with net income of $197 million.  Importantly, we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations of $390 million.
We continue to invest in the business and are doing so by improving and expanding our operations and by enhancing our product lineup, both in our industry-leading hard drive offerings and in the recent but promising market for management of content in the home. 
In our traditional businesses, we delivered new models of our popular My Book and My Passport external hard drives with USB 3.0 connectivity and up to three terabytes of storage. Significantly improving content transfer speed and providing our customers with future proofing as newer PCs and other devices began shipping in volume with USB 3.0. And in the component space, we began shipping the highest area of infancy, 3.5-inch hard drive in the industry, the WD Caviar bringing three terabytes, which fits 750 gigabytes on each of its four platters. 
Reflecting our increasing focus on enabling our comprehensive and easy-to-use experience for management of content in the home, we've added several new products and features including the WD Livewire powerline AV network kit, a home plugged AV compatible solution that enables consumers to use their existing electrical wiring to extend secure high-speed Internet connection throughout the home. 
The My Book Live home network drive, which gives consumers the fastest storage of and access to their content and provides the same set up centralizing digital media in the home. The one terabyte WD Elements play multimedia drive, with high-definition capability onboard, and we also recently introduced the newest version of WD Photos, our photo viewer application now optimize for the iPad, the iPhone 4 and iPod Touch. WD Photos enable users to view photos stored on their WD home network drive from any location. I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q1 financial performance and our outlook for the second quarter."
314057,114307234,80297,"Western Digital Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Western Digital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tim. I would like to refer you to a new and expanded summary of financial information that has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. Much of the data that we have recited during past conference calls is included in that",1117,"Thank you, Tim. I would like to refer you to a new and expanded summary of financial information that has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. Much of the data that we have recited during past conference calls is included in that fact sheet. During my prepared remarks, I will focus on highlights and significant changes in some of our key metrics. At the end of this call, the summary of financial information will be updated to include our Q2 guidance, which I will discuss in a few moments.
The September quarter was characterized by unusually aggressive pricing that lasted throughout the quarter with like-for-like prices decline in excess of 8%. Pricing pressure was most prevalent in the 2.5-inch segment. We made a conscious decision to limit our participation in the segment in an effort to optimize profitability. Our flexible operating model allowed us to adjust our operating expenses to offset the impact of pricing on operating margin and closed the quarter near the midpoint of our EPS guidance range. 
We actively managed capital receipts and working capital and generated significant free cash flow. Revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $2.4 billion, up 9% from the prior year and 1% sequentially. This include its $51 million of sales of media from our newly acquired Singapore media facility to fulfill contractual obligation carrying over from Hoya's existing sales commitment. We do not expect any external media sales in Q2. 
Authorized shipments totaled 50.7 million units, up 15% from the prior year period and 2% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV Media Player, WD Livewire network kit and stock solid state drive totals approximately $33 million, roughly flat with the prior year and up 22% from the June quarter. 
Average hard drive selling price was approximately $46 per unit, down $3 from the year-ago quarter and down $1 from the June quarter. Revenue from sales of our branded products including WD TV and WD Livewire product was $425 million, up 11% from $382 million in the year-ago quarter and 6% sequentially from $400 million in the June quarter. 
There was no customer that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue. Our first margin for the quarter was 18.2%, down from 23.3% in the year-ago quarter and down from 22.5% in the June quarter. The lower-than-expected gross margin percentage was primarily due to the price declines I referred to earlier. Products and segment mix, as well as product cost declines, were largely in line with our expectations.
Total R&D and SG&A spending was $226 million or 9.4% of revenue. This compares with $195 million or 8.8% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $242 million or 10.2% of revenue in the June quarter. As a reminder, total operating expenses for the June quarter include a $27 million of litigation settlement. 
Operating income was $211 million or 8.8% of revenue. This compares with $319 million or 14.4% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $293 million or 12.3% of revenue in the June quarter. Net interest and other non-operating expenses were less than $1 million. 
Tax expense for the September quarter was $14 million or 6.6% of pretax income. Our net income totaled $197 million or $0.84 per share. This compares with $288 million or $1.25 per share and $265 million or $1.13 per share in the year-ago and June quarters, respectively.
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $390 million in cash flow from operations during the September quarter. Our cash conversion cycle for the first quarter was a negative three days. This consisted of 50 days of receivables outstanding, 26 days of inventory or 14 turns and 79 days of payables. 
Capital addition for the September quarter totaled $200 million, lower than our July projections of $275 million as we scaled back in line with lower shipments. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter totaled $115 million. We continue to expect our capital expenditure for fiscal 2011 to be between 7% and 8% of revenue with an additional $200 million related to our 6-inch to 8-inch wafer conversion and some expenditures to optimize the output from our recently acquired media facility in Singapore. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be at about $630 million for the fiscal year. 
We made $25 million of debt repayment installments during the first quarter, and thereby reduced our debt balance to $375 million. We exited fiscal Q1 with cash and cash equivalent of $2.9 billion, an increase of $124 million from the June quarter. Here in the quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares at a total cost of $50 million. The balance remaining on our stock repurchase authorization is $416 million. From a balance sheet strategy perspective, our first priority is to create shareholder value through strategic investments both in markets currently served and adjacent markets. Any larger scale share buybacks would be considered only after we have exhausted our strategic options. 
Now turning to our expectations for fiscal Q2. Historically, industry shipment increased by 5% to 7% from the September to the December quarter. As Tim mentioned, we have seen approximately twice the shipment volume in the last week of last quarter than an average of the preceding 12 weeks of the quarter. We believe that customers will not want to carry extra inventory into the March quarter and therefore, expect some inventory correction. We consequently assume that the December quarter industry TAM will be roughly flat with the September quarter at around 165 million units. 
Some of the aggressive pricing we have seen last quarter is carried over into this quarter, and our guidance includes like-for-like pricing line of approximately 5%. We are actively reviewing our planned shipment portfolio to identify business that is not meeting our business model requirements. Where contractual obligations do not exist, we may refuse our shipments of low contribution products and seek to shift sales to more profitable segments. 
As previously indicated, we are currently calibrating our new Singapore media facility through our own recipes, and as a result, we are experiencing a dilution of first margin of 50 basis points during this quarter. Accordingly, our guidance for fiscal Q2 is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range from $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion. R&D and SG&A spending is expected to total approximately $230 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $1 million. Expect our tax rate to be within our business model of 6% to 9%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately $235 million. We estimate earnings per share of between $0.50 and $0.60 for the December quarter. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

So with the working off of the inventory that has occurred during the course of the September quarter and with the HDD market being up about by 5% versus what would normally be a much stronger position somewhere in the 10% to 12%, I would imagine. And going into a December quarter that's essentially flat, we think that the opportunity will come more from supply chain demand again.

I'll take this tablet question. From everything we can gather with multiple different source reporting on tablets, I mean we see the first two quarters of the iPad is about 8 million units, to put it in context, that compares with the first two quarters of the EPC netbook emergence, which was 5 million units first two quarters. So everything we hear indicates that roughly half of the iPad sales are to existing Apple households, and that somewhere in the region of 13% to 15% of the folks buying iPads admit to substituting the iPad for a previously planned PC purchase. And some 23% of purchasers indicate they're buying an iPad as an alternative to a Kindle or other eReader. So what we see, I think, is a complementary additional device sale to the overall ecosystem of content consumption. We think that when you look at the numbers, certainly, there has been some falloff in netbook over the last couple of quarters. They're also -- you have to take the price point of the iPad into account, so likely that over the next several quarters as other tablets emerge, they will address lower price points than the iPad currently occupies. But on overall assessment, we're seeing maybe somewhere in the 10% to 20% impact range on the growth of low-end notebooks, netbook products."

And it's pretty natural coming out of that pendulum is going to swing back a little the other way. It's very difficult to land without a little overshoot. And so I think what you've seen in the last six months has been the wealth created in the four-quarter runoff allowed people to encourage everybody to get more invested in the industry. And initially, as the demand softens, people have tried to maintain their momentum. And it takes a little while for folks to realize that if everybody overbuilds, then there's going to be pressure and then there's going to be -- our customers are smart people, they're going to take advantage of that. And we need to get things back in balance and move on with life. And that's the cycle that's been played through. I think if you analyze the numbers, however, you'll see that things are not a disaster right now. We finished last quarter above the bottom of our model. You can go back many years into the last 10 years and find periods where we dropped out of the model for periods of time, and I would remind you that the model was a significantly lower bottom to it than it has today. So the industry and WD have expanded the gross margin model consistently over the last 10 years, and we're still -- yes, we don't like being under the bottom of the model, and we're going to work to move ourselves back into it as soon as we can, but we're also going to work to ensure that we have the right products set and the right availability and the right approach with our customers that has them prefer WD products over others and continue to grow our business profitably."

And I say that because if I think about industry to the industry's credit, you have a lot more efficient and effective participants than we did say, five or six years ago and as Rich alluded to earlier, it's going to be difficult to kind of reset the price curve, I think, for the time being."
