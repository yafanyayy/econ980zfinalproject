Excellent operating performance across the company, delivered higher bottom-line results in the second quarter. New orders, stronger than the prior year in both the firs",2047,"Thank you, Pam, and welcome everyone to our second quarter fiscal 2010 earnings call. Excellent operating performance across the company, delivered higher bottom-line results in the second quarter. New orders, stronger than the prior year in both the first and second quarters, are expected to drive significant revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2010. As a result, we have again increased our revenue and earnings guidance for the fiscal year. Looking beyond 2010, our backlog has grown considerably and the business opportunity pipeline for our short communications solutions remains quite robust. We continue to invest in new products, new capabilities and adjacent new markets to fuel growth for the longer term. We believe that our strategies will continue to drive growth and deliver solid returns to create value for our shareholders.Revenue in the second quarter was $1.22 billion compared with $1.33 billion in the prior year. New orders for the company were significantly higher at $1.42 billion compared with $1.03 billion in the prior year, led by strong demand for Harris tactical radios, which are delivering combat-proven solutions for the most demanding missions in defense and global security applications. Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related costs, was also higher in the second quarter at $142 million or $1.08 per diluted share compared with a strong prior year of $141 million or $1.05 per share. Combination of factors continue to enhance our bottom-line performance in the quarter, including excellent program award fees across the Government Communications Systems business and strong product gross margins at the RF Communications business.Now let's move on to the segment results. Second quarter revenue for the RF Communications segment was $463 million compared with $438 million in the prior year. Tactical Radio revenue was $355 million in the quarter, and Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue was $108 million. Non-GAAP segment income at RF was $171 million in the second quarter, excluding acquisition charges, compared with $144 million in the prior year. Segment operating margin was exceptionally strong at 37% as a result of favorable product mix, the impact of cost reduction actions that we implemented in the second half of fiscal 2009 and strong operating efficiencies.New orders for the segment were also very strong at $626 million in the quarter, and that included $554 million for tactical radio systems. Tactical radio orders were much higher than revenue, resulting in a 1.6 book-to-bill. Strong new orders in the first two quarters increased our Tactical revenue, Tactical Radio backlog to $953 million at the end of the second quarter. As a result, we now expect year-over-year organic Tactical Radio revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 with a book-to-bill for the fiscal year greater than one.  We expect to enter fiscal 2011 with a solid order backlog of at least $800 million, much higher than at the beginning of fiscal 2010. And we continue to see a very robust pipeline of new opportunities in both the U.S. and international markets.Major tactical radio orders in the quarter included $119 million for our JTRS-approved Falcon III AN/PRC-152 multi-band handheld radio systems, and a $228 million order for our Falcon II HF radio systems. To date, we've received $555 million in orders for radios for use in the new M-ATVs that are being deployed to Afghanistan. Enabled by our successful Commercial business model, we began shipping both the Falcon III and Falcon II radios for the M-ATVs literally within hours after receiving the orders in the second quarter.A major milestone in the quarter was the completion of testing and Department of Defense approval of the Harris ANW2 Wideband Networking Waveform. This clears yet another hurdle to widespread adoption and fielding of the only wideband networking tactical radio available today, the Harris Falcon III 117G. The 117G is NSA-certified. It utilizes the new JTRS software communications architecture, and it supports streaming video and other data-intensive applications. It interfaces seamlessly into the Department of Defense Secure Internet Protocol Network known as SIPRNet, thereby enabling classified voice, data and video exchange between commanders in the Pentagon and soldiers on the battlefield. The networking capability of the 117G enables the highest command levels for the first time ever to experience first hand, over video, exactly what soldiers on the ground are experiencing.Another example of our continued advancement in technology is the incorporation of the ROVER waveform [Remote Operated Video Enhanced Receiver waveform] into our radios. This enables video surveillance to be transmitted directly from unmanned aircraft to all of the soldiers connected to the 117G wideband network, without carrying extra equipment to accomplish this or wasting valuable time retransmitting. When you put it all together, it should be clear that Harris has established a strong leadership beachhead. We're delivering much-needed JTRS-compatible tactical radio solutions to the Department of Defense today, headed the programs of record and at a lower cost.Turning to the international markets, major orders were received in the second quarter from customers in Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Sweden and Pakistan. In Central Asia in the quarter, Harris received its largest international order to date for our Falcon III radios, international version. Our international sales force reports that their opportunity pipeline has grown to about $2 billion, with additional major orders expected this fiscal year from customers in the U.K., Australia, Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Middle East. In the recently acquired Public Safety and Professional Communications business, we believe we're still on target to meet the guidance provided for this fiscal year for revenue and income. Pro forma revenue in this business was up about 6% in the quarter compared to the prior year. New orders were lower than revenue and reflected a few program delays into the second half of the fiscal year. The funnel of opportunities, however, is still very strong. And we ended the second quarter with a healthy backlog in this business of $443 million. Major wins in the quarter in the Public Safety and Professional Communications business included a four-year IDIQ contract from General Dynamics, with an estimated value of $130 million. Harris will provide land mobile radio infrastructure for the first two regions of the Integrated Wireless Network program. Under the contract, Harris was awarded an initial $10 million order to begin work on the Mid-Atlantic region, including Washington D.C. The IWN program will implement a new P25 digital communications system to unite mission-critical communications for federal first responders throughout its six regions across the country. The program is being led by the U.S. Department of Justice in collaboration with the Department of the Treasury. The new network will be shared by the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], ATF [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives], DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] and the U.S. Marshals Service. Motorola was the incumbent supplier. This important win illustrates our ability to capitalize in the synergies gained from this acquisition and to expand market share. Now let's look at our results for Government Communications Systems. Revenue in this segment was $647 million compared to $748 million in the prior year. Revenue in the prior year benefited from $172 million in revenue for the Field Data Collection Automation program supporting the 2010 Census, which, as you know, is now winding down.  Year-over-year revenue growth, excluding the FDCA program and adjusting for the impact of acquisitions, was a very strong 9% for the first half of the fiscal year. On that same basis, all of our business areas achieved revenue growth, with particular strength seen in Civil Programs and IT Services. The ramping up of several major new program wins continue to drive revenue growth in the second quarter. These included the GOES-R [Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite] weather satellite program for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, where we successfully completed the GOES-R initial Systems Requirements Review. Harris is the prime contractor on this project and systems integrator for the ten-year potential $736 million contract. And on the Modernization of Enterprise Terminals or MET program for the Army, we successfully completed satellite terminal system qualification testing during the second quarter.Strategic acquisitions continue to be an important part of our growth strategy. During the quarter, we acquired Patriot Technologies, allowing Harris to be an even stronger provider of interoperable and secure healthcare IT solutions for the federal government markets. This acquisition positions us to deliver a comprehensive solution for integrating the Veterans Affairs and Military Health Systems. Our healthcare solutions growth initiative should deliver $60 million to $70 million in revenue this fiscal year. And the opportunity pipeline has increased to over $500 million in new potential program value.SolaCom ATC contributed to our second quarter results, with new international air traffic control communications contracts and contract extensions. Harris will provide critical air-to-ground and ground-to-ground digital communications services for new Manila Control Center in the Philippines, the Turkish Air Force's mobile radar approach control shelters and air traffic control sites in Angola. Second quarter operating income for Government Communications Systems increased to $87 million compared with $85 million in the prior year. Operating margin was higher at 13.4%, reflecting excellent award fees and program performance across the businesses.Significant milestones were completed during the quarter on the two remaining hoop design satellite reflectors, with the first one now delivered to the customer for spacecraft integration. Second reflector is on schedule, and it is expected to a delivered within the current estimated cost at completion. Final deliveries for both should occur in fiscal 2010. Finally, here are the Broadcast Communications results. Revenue was $117 million, about flat sequentially with first quarter revenue. New orders were greater than revenue at $139 million and were sequentially also higher than the first quarter. The sequential flattening of revenue and the rebound in orders in a still very tough market environment were both encouraging, and are hopefully signs that we are in fact beginning to see recovery in the global broadcast markets. As the economy improves and advertising revenues begin to improve, we should see some acceleration in capital spending by global broadcast and media networks. In the second quarter, the Broadcast Communications segment posted an operating loss of about $5 million. Operating performance was impacted by product mix, combined with our increasing investments in new media initiatives including markets, such as mobile TV and digital signage, and higher investments in international markets. These are all areas we believe critical to the future success of this business. We were encouraged by several new wins in the quarter and other initiatives that are underway. In Australia, we had a key win at the Seven network in the quarter, where we began work on converting their first six of 36 channels to HDTV. This follows a previous win at Sydney Broadcasting Systems, also in Australia. During the quarter, we also announced the significant role we are playing in assisting Canada's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium to provide live broadcasting for the Winter Games in Vancouver. Every broadcaster in the world will be there as we showcase our latest solutions. We expect our performance to position Harris quite well to earn more business, to support broadcast of the 2012 World Cup and the Summer Games.In sports and live-event venues, Harris is quickly becoming the acknowledged leader in providing solutions, which combine broadcast and IPTV services to enhance both fan and viewer experiences. Many arenas and stadiums are modernizing their facilities, including updating their broadcast control rooms and broadcast infrastructure capabilities. We previously announced a major project with the Orlando Magic in the new Amway Center in Orlando. In the second quarter, we were awarded new business at the Madison Square Garden Network and the new Meadowlands Stadium. And we are in active negotiations with other venues, looking to upgrade their facilities and their capabilities.In one of our more exciting cross-division initiatives, we have successfully integrated broadcast and government communications technology to create FAME, the Harris Full-Motion Video Asset Management Engine. FAME, the Harris Full Motion Video Asset Management Engine. FAME helps government customers capture, store, retrieve, analyze and distribute video intelligence information. Several systems have already been deployed in the field. And we are getting major media and industry attention on this unique Harris capability. We now have a FAME opportunity pipeline totaling $250 million. Let me now ask our CFO, Gary McArthur, to comment on the financial results for the second quarter."

From balance sheet and liquidity perspectives, we had another very solid quarter. As of quarter end, we had $310 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, and $705 million available under our $750 million revolving credit facility. We generated $187 million in cash flow from operations and $165 million in free cash flow. Our revolving credit facility does not come up for renewal until 2013, and we have no long-term debt maturities coming due until October of 2015. On a separate but related note, all our domestic retirement plans are defined contribution plans. Worldwide, we have only one defined benefit plan, with benefit obligations of just over $50 million, which are funded with accordance with U.K. law.  Based on our very strong first-half results and our outlook for a strong second half, we are increasing our forecast for cash flow from operations for the year from a range of $600 million to $650 million to between $650 million and $700 million. During the quarter, we acquired Patriot Technologies for $35 million in cash. We purchased $50 million of our outstanding common stock at an average purchase price of $43.78 per share. And as of quarter end, we have $550 million remaining under our stock repurchase program. Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $39 million as compared to $43 million in the second quarter of the prior year. Our expectations for depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 2010 are unchanged at $160 million to $170 million. Capital expenditures were $22 million for the second quarter as compared to $35 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Our current guidance for fiscal year 2010 for CapEx is unchanged at between $150 million and $160 million. The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 32%. Our outlook for the full year tax rate for fiscal 2010 remains at 34%, noting again that the tax rate for any given quarter could vary, up or down, as a result of discrete tax events. In summary, we continue to operate from a very strong financial foundation. Back to you, Howard."

Before we open up the line for your questions, let me provide some perspective on our revised revenue and earnings outlook for fiscal 2010. As we said, we once again increased our full year non-GAAP earnings guidance for fiscal 2010. The new range is $4.25 to $4.35 per share. That's about a 10% increase compared to our previous range of $3.85 to $3.95 per share. Revenue in fiscal 2010 is now expected to be in a range of 5% to 6% higher for the year than the prior year, between $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion. For the RF Communications segment, fiscal 2010 revenue is now expected to be in a range 17% to 19% higher than fiscal 2009. That includes the contribution of the acquired Public Safety and Professional Communications business of about $500 million, consistent with our prior guidance. Segment operating margin for the year is now projected to be about 33%, and that's compared to our previous guidance of 29% to 31%. We expect segment operating margin in the third fiscal quarter to remain quite high at about 37%, comparable to the second quarter and then because of mix to decline to a more typical level in the fourth quarter.Again, the higher operating margin is being driven by favorable tax for radio product mix, the impact of cost reduction actions that we're taking and favorable operational efficiencies. The acquired Public Safety and Professional Communications business is performing about as we expected. For Government Communications Systems, we expect revenue for fiscal 2010 in a range of 0% to 2% above the prior year. After adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and excluding the FDCA program supporting the 2010 Census, which we've noted is winding down, the guidance reflects underlying growth of about 9% compared to the prior year. Operating margin is now expected to be about 12.5%, that's slightly higher than our previous guidance as a result of continued strong program performance and related award fees. For Broadcast Communications, we've reduced our expected revenue a bit to a range of $490 million to $510 million, with operating margin of 1% to 3% of revenue. The new outlook reflects a pickup, though, in both revenue and income in the second half as a result of our building backlog in the first half on better first-half orders. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line. And we'll be pleased to take your questions."

Q4, we expect sequentially to have lower margins in Tactical Radios and the segment than in Q3. Where it goes in the long run is still TBD.

I certainly see that as a floor going forward. We're doing much better than that this year. The whole segment were up to now 33%. And as we go into next year, it's going to have a lot to do with the mix, and the volume and our ability to continue to leverage it. So I think the endpoints in that discussion are probably kind of the guidance we've provided at the beginning of this year and where we are now. But I don't expect it, Gautam, to drop off a step to that but we would expect to see in '11 somewhat lower margins. How much?

Is it vehicular adaptor? There's a lot of ancillary equipment. What contracts are they buying under? So there's a fair amount of variability depending on those factors. Clearly, it's being driven in aggregate by the $555 million of orders to date for the M-ATV program. With regard to the costs side of the equation, clearly, this year is turning out to be a lot stronger than we expected. We took actions in the second half of last year to take cost out. Frankly, we didn't take a lot out of R&D. We took it out of other areas and we also, what we did reduce from R&D was largely on R&D provided by outside partners rather than our inside headcount. As we're going through this year now, we're ramping some of that back up but as usually the case, the revenues coming in stronger than we're adding cost. So that's where we talk about getting the benefit of the cost reductions. I feel like we're spending at a very good rate in R&D. We're not starving R&D at all. In fact, we'll continue to invest as effectively as we can because that engine of new products is what we'll continue to drive our growth going forward, as it has in the past, producing the whole Falcon III product line, making enhancements to the product line and adding on it additional capabilities. And then finally, when you get a big ramp up in volume after you've taken your manufacturing overhead cost down, expecting a slowdown, you get a lot of operational efficiency leverage on that. So it's lots of factors coming together. We're going to benefit from it in a major way in Q2 and Q3. We're still going to have very good margins in Q4 and going forward, but not quiet at this overheated level of Q2 and Q3."

We've to go into that business in the same way that we did the orders we've received. So I don't want you to conclude because we haven't concluded that those are going to be given to us 100%. Again, it plays on winning the business and also how they decide to configure. They may not configure the next 4,000. Some of those are M-ATVs from Oshkosh, some of those are other vehicles coming from other manufacturers, and they may choose to configure them slightly different in terms of the mix of which ones gets an HF radio, which ones get the VHF and multi-band radios. Make no mistake, we're going to go after all the business we can and it does represent an upside of potentially as high as suppose as $300 million to $350 million.

The total Tactical Radio pipeline has been pretty steady in the $3.5 billion to $4 billion range. So we've seen a little bit of a reduction in the U.S. pipeline as we've gotten the orders and a little bit of increase in the international pipeline, as some of those orders have slipped into the second half of the year. So the total pipeline hasn't changed much, it's really more of a function of the timing. We still are very bullish and are probably in Central Asia, our optimism for countries, Afghanistan, Pakistan and many of the other markets around the current conflict. And as a result of NATO forces going into support along with U.S. Forces, we're feeling pretty strongly that probably there's more, not less, demand in that part of the world. But overall, feeling very good about the international market. In selected countries, I think we have probably seen some delay in orders due to the overall economies in countries where they're funding their own purchases. And even a few FMS programs have slipped a little, not because of money issues, but because all the focus in procurement in DoD, as it should be, has been focused around the M-ATV program and urgent operational needs. So the important point is we haven't lost any international business. I think we're going to see a very strong second half in orders international, and we're going to see a very strong fiscal '11 in international."

And now what we felt was just a very important statement that the Department of Defense made in putting the AN/PRC 152 and its vehicular adapter version, the 110. So the Falcon III handheld into the M-ATVs suggest that adoption of the Harris Falcon III is now in kind of full bloom. I don't know the precise percentages is, it's still going to be well less than half of our revenue because the HF radios are still classified as Falcon II technology. So it's still going to be less than half but it's growing, obviously. And I think what I'm very excited about with our team, is not only the adoption, but the margins on the Falcon IIIs are right there with our previous technology, even though we're still fairly early in its life. So to me, that's very encouraging. It says that our team's doing a great job in taking cost out. I think it continues to validate the value of the commercial model in allowing us to price based on value but earn improved margins when we can take cost out. With regard to the specific mix of international and domestic, obviously, it has changed. When we were at the beginning of the year, we were kind of saying 50/50. Now it's clearly swung more on the side of the Department of Defense business, not because international customers don't want the product, but because of the prioritization. We pushed out international though about as far as we will push them out. So again, I don't know specifically what the mix is. I'm not sure it's all that significant, Larry. I think going forward, what's important is we expect to certainly see more of that 50/50 kind of mix broadly in the long run. We expect to see FY '11 and beyond returning to year-over-year growth in shipments. We will have a good year in orders but shipments won't be all that robust and international because of the timing and our scheduling of the orders."

In terms of growth, beyond that, all I will say is I'm feeling much better about this business and the outlook than we were six months ago. And I think back to a year ago on this call, when we were talking about '10 being a down year, obviously, we were far too pessimistic. At this point, we have a lot of very good momentum, not just in tactical radios but the contribution from the acquisition in Public Safety, given us great platform for growth there, Government Systems, which we don't spend a lot talking about the other $2.5 billion or $3 billion business but it's outgrowing its peers and providing us significantly, I think, a very good competitive margins there.

The blue-ribbon panel is doing their work as announced. There's also a technical panel. And I believe that both of them will conclude that this was an anomaly, having to do with the changeover of network to the new optical backbone. Certainly, there'll be some lessons learned that we'll take away from it, and if they have FAA take away from it and that'll help us to work better together and more effectively in the future. But it really was an anomaly, not something we expect to repeat. And overall, the FTI network has had exemplary performance in terms of its availability and its ability to lower the operating cost for the FAA, which were both objectives in the program. So I don't think there'll be any ongoing negative impact."

We had another excellent quarter of financial results. And perhaps even more importantly, we've set ourselves up for a continued growth in the fiscal fourth quarter and",2451,"Thank you, Pam, and welcome, everyone to our third quarter fiscal 2010 earnings call. We had another excellent quarter of financial results. And perhaps even more importantly, we've set ourselves up for a continued growth in the fiscal fourth quarter and in fiscal 2011. Our growth strategies are clearly working. We are gaining market share in our core markets, while also moving the company into important adjacent markets to capitalize on growth opportunities. Our mission-critical, assured communications capabilities are in strong demand across a broad range of market applications. 
Revenue in the third quarter was $1.33 billion, 10% higher than $1.21 billion in the prior year. Non-GAAP income excluding acquisition-related costs was $170 million or $1.30 per diluted share, an increase of 27% compared with the prior year $136 million or $1.02 per share. Our bottom line continued to be driven by excellent program performance and award fees across the Government  Communications segment and strong gross margins and operational efficiencies in the RF Communications segment. 
New orders for the company were very strong again this quarter at $1.45 billion, offering excellent forward momentum. They were significantly higher than orders of $1.03 billion in the prior year and higher than third quarter revenue. Third quarter revenue for the RF Communications segment was $551 million compared with $439 million in the prior year. 
Tactical Radio Communications business revenue for the quarter was $429 million, about flat with the prior year, although Public Safety and Professional Communications business revenue contributed $122 million in the quarter. 
Non-GAAP segment income was $208 million in the third quarter. That's excluding charges related to the Tyco Electronics Wireless Systems acquisition, and it's compared to $151 million in the prior year. Segment operating margin was exceptionally strong again this quarter at 38%. We are continuing to benefit from favorable tax for radio product mix and significant operating leverage provided by cost reduction actions. 
New orders for the RF segment were $656 million in the quarter. That included $488 million in Tactical Radio Communications systems and $168 million for Public Safety and Professional Communications systems. Both businesses had book-to-bill ratios of significantly greater than one. Tactical Radio Communications order backlog at the end of the third quarter increased to $1 billion. 
Given our strong Q3 orders and our good Q4 momentum, we now expect to enter fiscal 2011 with a Tactical Radio order backlog above $1 billion, much higher than our previous expectation of $800 million. Several factors continue to drive new orders. Customer demand for our next-generation Falcon III radios is accelerating, and not just in the U.S. market. Adoption in the international market is beginning, as evidenced by the significant order from Australia in the quarter. 
Overall, international market demand has strengthened with some very large opportunities getting underway. And we continue to be the primary tactical radio supplier for the MRAP-ATV program by equipping the military's initial 6,644 vehicle purchases, vehicles that will be used across all of the services. 
The importance of the M-ATV program to Harris is twofold. Naturally, it's a significant revenue opportunity, but it also offers a platform to showcase the advanced capabilities of our next-generation Falcon III radios. This grassroots effort fields the new radios across a broad spectrum of users and encourages further adoption, a strategy that continues to be very successful for us. 
Demand for the JTRS-approved Falcon III family of radios has resulted in year-to-date Falcon III orders through the third quarter, now totaling $620 million. Our Falcon III 117G wideband networking radio is enabling war fighters with unprecedented situational awareness by providing streaming video, simultaneous voice and data feeds, collaborative chat and secure network connectivity. Reports on the field confirmed to us that the 117G is changing the way war fighters are conducting their missions. 
Falcon III orders during the third quarter included $73 million for the 117G multiband manpack from the Marine Corps for use in Afghanistan, $12 million from Marine Corps to upgrade existing 152(C) multiband handheld systems from 20 to 50 watts to allow communications over longer distances and in rough terrain and $74 million for 152(C) multiband handheld radios in vehicular adapters to equip the MRAP-ATVs. And then following the close of the quarter, we received an additional $20 million order for Falcon III 117G multiband manpack radios from a DoD customer. 
Other significant U.S. orders in the quarter included $78 million for Falcon II HF radios to equip MRAP-ATVs. And then following the close of the quarter, Harris received a $101 million order for Falcon II 117F multiband vehicular radios for the next phase of MRAP-ATV purchases and to retrofit other existing MRAP vehicles. This is important because it represents the first order that Harris has received to equip the 4,000 additional vehicles approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, JROC, earlier this year. 
International Tactical Communications orders in the third quarter included $112 million from the Australian Department of Defense, as part of their communications modernization program. The order was predominantly Falcon III 152(C) multiband handheld radios. The potential opportunity is $300 million to $500 million over five years. We believe this is an important milestone and we fully expect to see other allied nations standardize on the Harris Falcon III family going forward. 
We also received a $44 million international order from a customer in Asia and a $10 million order from the Iraq Ministry of Interior for Falcon II HF radio systems. Additional significant international orders are still expected this fiscal year from several customers.
We believe in the future of our Global Tactical Radio business to maintain its market leadership and our ability to continue to expand into adjacent markets. Our strategy is simple, listen to our customers and utilize our commercial business model to quickly solve their evolving mission requirements. We are constantly innovating and advancing our technology, years ahead of competition and the programs of record. 
As an example, let's take a look at the emerging ISR mission needs in Afghanistan. UAVs are proliferating overhead, gathering valuable realtime video on possible targets and missions. Although ISR and ground tactical communications have always been viewed as separate missions, accomplished with separate radios, our customers asked if it was possible to integrate these capabilities into a single solution. Our engineers seized the opportunity. In only a few months, we responded with a design that integrated the UAVs ROVER waveform into our Falcon III 117G wideband networking radio. Video can now be received and then retransmitted over the 117G wideband network without the soldier carrying another device. The ROVER waveform was not, of course, contemplated in the JTRS program of record specification, but it's already inside the Harris radio. And our engineering team has been busy developing even more extensive ISR solutions as we speak. 
In our Public Safety and Professional Communications business, revenue in the third quarter was $122 million, and that was about flat compared to the prior year on a pro forma basis. The pipeline of large projects in both the public safety and professional communications markets remains robust. It's driven by requirements for improved interoperability and upgrades from analog to digital networks. And we scored some major wins in the quarter, which will help drive our future growth. 
On the flipside, the weak U.S. economy is having an impact on state and local budgets and is constraining some of our sales of products into existing systems. New orders in the quarter were $168 million, much higher than the revenue. We ended the quarter with a very strong backlog of $489 million, and we're still on track to meet the guidance we established for this fiscal year. 
Major wins in the quarter included $100 million to upgrade the Miami-Dade County public communications infrastructure to a P25 digital radio system. This project also includes the new P25 radios providing interoperability across more than 80 different agencies with over 32,000 users. 
A $13 million order was received in the quarter for our OpenSky system to connect employees at a Texas-based public utility serving 50 counties. The system features over-the-air programming to provide remote reconfiguration and software updates. This win is an excellent example of our ability to provide assured communications to the enterprise market. 
And then following the close of the quarter, Harris received an order from the New York State Police for 1,100 Unity XG-100P multiband radios. The new Harris Unity radios will provide interoperability between the state police and local, metro and county law enforcement officers, allowing them to communicate with radio systems that are both conventional and digital and that operate on various VHF, UHF, 700- or 800-megahertz bands, all in one radio. 
During the quarter, we acquired the technology assets of OSI Geospatial's Situational Awareness business. With this acquisition, Harris gained advanced software for capturing, viewing and disseminating critical tactical information. The software provides commanders and team members alike in the field with real-time information, including the location of personnel. The applications are capable of being embedded in both our tactical and our public safety radios, as well as in other electronic devices and laptop computers. 
Revenue in the Government Communications System segment was $666 million in the third quarter compared with $649 million in the prior year. Revenue in the prior year benefited from the Field Data Collection Automation, or FDCA program, for the U.S. Census Bureau, which is nearing completion. Year-to-date revenue, excluding the FDCA program and adjusting for the impact of the acquisitions, is 7% above the prior year. We believe this is excellent growth and highlights that our businesses continue to be very well positioned in the market. 
Revenue growth benefited from the ramp up of the GOES-R weather satellite program for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. We recently announced the opening of a new Harris office in Greenbelt, Maryland to support the GOES-R program. The modernization of enterprise terminals, or MET program for the Army, also contributed to revenue growth in the quarter. We successfully completed the Critical Implementation Review, or CIR milestone for the program. And we did this just nine months after program award. With the design baseline for the ground terminals now established, the program can move on into its next phase. 
Other contributors to revenue growth in the quarter included the IT Services program, where we're supporting the U.S. Southern Command headquarters relocation, several classified programs for national intelligence customers and acquisitions related to our growth initiatives in Cyber Integrated Solutions and Healthcare Solutions. 
Operating income in the third quarter for the Government Communications Systems segment increased to $90 million compared with $74 million in the prior year. Operating margin was higher at 13.6% and reflected continued excellent program performance, as well as favorable timing on award fees. 
Harris was awarded a significant contract related to our Healthcare Solutions business in the quarter. A three-year potential $72 million contract from the Department of Veterans Affairs to improve the complex billing and collection activities across the nationwide VA organization. After completing a very successful pilot program, this contract was awarded to cover the remainder of the nationwide network. As you know, the VA manages one of the world's largest healthcare delivery organizations. 
Also during the quarter, Harris was awarded a $25 million contract to provide our new Highband Networking Radios for the U.S. Army. They will carry critical battle command information and form the communications backbone of the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System or IBCS. These radios provide the first ever use of directive beam technology to achieve higher throughput over longer distances within a self-forming, self-healing mesh network.
Revenue in the quarter at Broadcast Communications was $123 million or 7% lower than $132 million in the prior year quarter, but a little better sequentially than our second quarter. The segment posted an operating loss of $5 million. Revenue continues to be impacted by lower U.S. broadcaster capital spending. 
Gross margins were about flat with the prior-year quarter on much lower revenue, indicating the positive contribution of cost reduction activities that have been implemented. The third quarter operating loss included restructuring charges in the quarter of about $1 million with $3 million in charges year-to-date. Additional actions are expected to result in restructuring costs for the full fiscal year of about $10 million. Operating expenses were slightly higher than the prior year in the third quarter, as we continue to redeploy resources into new media and international markets where we believe there are significant new business opportunities. 
Orders in the quarter were $130 million, much higher than the prior year quarter and orders exceeded revenue. Order momentum in the second and third quarters suggest that the market is at the bottom and showing at least some signs of improvement. Some major orders in the quarter included $12 million from Cox Broadcasting for our integrated application suite for traffic, billing, order processing, sales management reporting and sales proposal generation. $4 million from the Abu Dhabi Media Company for a high-definition production and play-out center and $4 million in Rwanda for turnkey DVB-T transmission solution in support of the country's transition from analog to digital broadcasting. 
We continue to experience strong interest from company's new media growth initiatives, and these are now finally beginning to contribute to segment revenue. This includes live-event venue broadcast networks such as the new Amway Center in Orlando, Florida. These systems leverage our combined broadcast and IT services offerings to provide solutions which enhance the fan experience. We are in active negotiations with a number of other venues, also looking to upgrade their broadcast capabilities. Another new-media initiative is FAME, our Full-Motion Video Asset Management Engine, which allows our government customers to capture, store, retrieve, analyze and distribute video intelligence information. Earlier this month, we demonstrated enhanced FAME capabilities at the National Association of Broadcasters Exhibition. This topic was also the focus of my keynote speech during the Military & Government Summit in NAB, where I discussed the benefits of using crossover commercial technologies to solve these difficult government ISR challenges.
Harris also made important announcements in NAB related to our 3D and mobile TV solutions. We introduced the industry's most comprehensive end-to-end 3D workflows, allowing content creators and broadcasters to build a complete solution from the camera all the way to the monitor. The Harris solution assures broadcasters updating their infrastructure to HD that their investments will also support 3D. Harris joined with the Open Mobile Video Coalition to announce the start of mobile TV field trials in Washington, D.C. next month. Harris solutions will be used by Fox Television, Gannett Broadcasting, ION Media Networks, PBS, MHz Networks and Univision. 
Let me now ask Harris' CFO, Gary McArthur, to comment on some of the financial results in the quarter."

Q3 was a very strong balance sheet quarter for Harris. We ended the quarter with $406 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. Return on invested capital was 21%. Return on equity, 25% and debt to total ca",514,"Thank you, Howard. Good afternoon, everyone. Q3 was a very strong balance sheet quarter for Harris. We ended the quarter with $406 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. Return on invested capital was 21%. Return on equity, 25% and debt to total capital was 36%, down from its recent high of 41% following the May 2009 Tyco Wireless acquisition. Further, our entire $750 million revolving credit facility is available to us with no long-term debt maturities coming due until October of 2015.
Cash flow from operations increased $99 million to $314 million versus $215 million in the third quarter of the prior year, primarily as a result of strong performance at our RF Communications and Government Communications Systems segments. In light of this, we are increasing our expectation for cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2010 to a range of $700 million to $725 million, up from our previous guidance of $650 million to $700 million. 
Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter was $40 million as compared to $44 million for the third quarter of 2009. Our expectation for depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 2010 continues to be in the range of $160 million $170 million. 
Capital expenditures were $94 million for the third quarter as compared to $30 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. And included the acquisition of a new 573,000-square-foot manufacturing facility near Rochester, New York, wherein four existing RF Communications manufacturing sites will be consolidated, and the purchase of a new facility in the Mid-Atlantic region for use by our Government Communications Systems business. Our guidance for fiscal year 2010 for CapEx is now $200 million to $210 million, up from our previous guidance of between $150 million and $160 million. 
During the quarter, we used $50 million to repurchase 1.1 million shares of our outstanding stock at an average price of $44.63 per share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 32.6%, and assuming the investment in research and development credit is enacted by Congress in our fourth quarter, our outlook for the full year tax rate for fiscal 2010 is now 33.3%. Our initial outlook for the 2011 full year tax rate is 34%. However, the tax rate for any given quarter could vary up or down as a result of discrete tax events. 
Other areas of guidance for fiscal 2011 are as follows: Cash flow from operations, a range of $675 million to $725 million; depreciation and amortization, from $170 million to $180 million; and capital expenditures, including capitalized software, a range of $200 million to $210 million. 
Our current priorities for cash that is expected to be generated remain the same. One, fund internal investment to drive growth and generate higher earnings; two, acquire companies that meet our strategic objectives and enhance financial returns; three, pay appropriate dividends, we're targeting a payout ratio of 20%; and four, repurchase shares. 
In summary, we expect to finish fiscal 2010 on a very strong financial foundation with expectations for another solid year in fiscal 2011. Back to you, Howard."
177934,100000416,58352,"Harris Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-28-2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","L3Harris Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. Before we open the line up for your questions, let me provide some additional perspective on the revisions and increases we've made to our earnings outlook for fiscal 2010, and a little color around our initial earnings guidance for fiscal 2",692,"Thanks, Gary. Before we open the line up for your questions, let me provide some additional perspective on the revisions and increases we've made to our earnings outlook for fiscal 2010, and a little color around our initial earnings guidance for fiscal 2011. 
First for 2010, we've once again increased our full year non-GAAP earnings guidance to a new range of $4.35 to $4.45 per share. This represents a $0.10 per share increase compared to the previous range of $4.25 to $4.35 per share. 
Revenue in fiscal 2010 is still expected to be $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion. In the RF Communications segment, fiscal 2010 revenue is now expected to be in a range of 18% to 19% higher than fiscal 2009. Now this includes the contribution, of course, of the acquired Public Safety and Professional Communications business coming in at about $500 million.
Segment operating margin for the year for the RF Communications segment is now projected to be higher in a range of 34% to 35% as compared to our previous guidance of 33%. The higher operating margin continues to be driven by more favorable Tactical Radio product mix, cost reductions and improving operational efficiencies. The acquired Public Safety and Professional Communications business is performing about as expected this year. 
For Government Communications Systems, we expect revenue for fiscal 2010 to be about flat with the prior year on a reported basis. Now after you adjusted for the impact of acquisitions and excluding the ending of the FDCA [Field Data Collection Automation] program, the guidance reflects we've been very strong organic growth for the year of about 8%. And operating margins are still expected to be about 12.5% for fiscal 2010. 
In Broadcast Communications for fiscal 2010, we've reduced expected revenue to a new range of $480 million to 490 million. We expect an operating loss of about $20 million for the year including $10 million of that related to restructuring charges. The reduction in segment income since our previous guidance is based on the lower sales volume, somewhat higher investments in international and new media markets and higher restructuring charges associated with additional cost reduction actions. So that's fiscal 2010. 
Let me move on now to fiscal 2011. Of course, we're very pleased to initiate earnings guidance in a range of $4.55 to $4.65 per share, 3% to 6% above our fiscal 2010 guidance midpoint. Revenue in fiscal 2011 is expected to be $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion, about 5% to 7% higher than fiscal 2010 guidance. Talk a little bit about the segments.
For the RF Communications segment, fiscal 2011 revenue is expected to be 6% to 8% higher than fiscal 2010. This includes the Public Safety and Professional Communications business in fiscal '11 at $540 million to $550 million, about 8% to 10% higher than fiscal 2010. 
Segment operating margin for 2011 is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33%. That's about 200 basis points lower than fiscal 2010, as the impact of more typical, Tactical Radio product mix is partially offset by higher public safety and Professional Communications business margins. We will continue to actively invest in R&D programs to further enhance the capabilities of our current products and introduce additional new products into adjacent markets. 
Moving to the Government Communications Systems segment, we expect revenue for fiscal 2011 to be 5% to 7% higher than fiscal 2010. Operating margin is expected to be 11.5%, that's about 100 basis points lower than fiscal 2010. This is due to the impact of lower pricing on the follow-on contracts for the Navy Marine Corps Intranet program and the FTI program, still very strong margins. 
For the Broadcast Communications segment, we're projecting modest revenue growth in fiscal 2011 in a range of $490 million to $510 million with break-even operating results.  Additionally for fiscal 2011, we expect net interest expense to be about flat with this year while unallocated corporate expense will be lower than this year in a range of $76 million to $78 million.

So we think it's a significant driver not just with the products we're offering now, the solution but we're continuing to enhance that with additional products. And broadly across Harris, we think that our engagement in tactical Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance, ISR, is a big growth opportunity for the company. And we see it in broadcast technology that can be applied, we see it in capabilities that we have, certainly in our RF and our Tactical Radios, we also see it in systems integrations opportunities to support the customers in the Government System segment.

We had another excellent quarter of financial results. And perhaps even more importantly, we've set ourselves up for a continued growth in the fiscal fourth quarter and",2449,"Thank you, Pam, and welcome, everyone to our third quarter fiscal 2010 earnings call. We had another excellent quarter of financial results. And perhaps even more importantly, we've set ourselves up for a continued growth in the fiscal fourth quarter and in fiscal 2011. Our growth strategies are clearly working. We are gaining market share in our core markets, while also moving the company into important adjacent markets to capitalize on growth opportunities. Our mission-critical, assured communications capabilities are in strong demand across a broad range of market applications. 
Revenue in the third quarter was $1.33 billion, 10% higher than $1.21 billion in the prior year. Non-GAAP income excluding acquisition-related costs was $170 million or $1.30 per diluted share, an increase of 27% compared with the prior year $136 million or $1.02 per share. Our bottom line continued to be driven by excellent program performance and award fees across the Government  Communications segment and strong gross margins and operational efficiencies in the RF Communications segment. 
New orders for the company were very strong again this quarter at $1.45 billion, offering excellent forward momentum. They were significantly higher than orders of $1.03 billion in the prior year and higher than third quarter revenue. Third quarter revenue for the RF Communications segment was $551 million compared with $439 million in the prior year. 
Tactical Radio Communications business revenue for the quarter was $429 million, about flat with the prior year, although Public Safety and Professional Communications business revenue contributed $122 million in the quarter. 
Non-GAAP segment income was $208 million in the third quarter. That's excluding charges related to the Tyco Electronics Wireless Systems acquisition, and it's compared to $151 million in the prior year. Segment operating margin was exceptionally strong again this quarter at 38%. We are continuing to benefit from favorable tactical radio product mix and significant operating leverage provided by cost reduction actions. 
New orders for the RF segment were $656 million in the quarter. That included $488 million in Tactical Radio Communications systems and $168 million for Public Safety and Professional Communications systems. Both businesses had book-to-bill ratios of significantly greater than one. Tactical Radio Communications order backlog at the end of the third quarter increased to $1 billion. 
Given our strong Q3 orders and our good Q4 momentum, we now expect to enter fiscal 2011 with a Tactical Radio order backlog above $1 billion, much higher than our previous expectation of $800 million. Several factors continue to drive new orders. Customer demand for our next-generation Falcon III radios is accelerating, and not just in the U.S. market. Adoption in the international market is beginning, as evidenced by the significant order from Australia in the quarter. 
Overall, international market demand has strengthened with some very large opportunities getting underway. And we continue to be the primary tactical radio supplier for the MRAP-ATV program by equipping the military's initial 6,644 vehicle purchases, vehicles that will be used across all of the services. 
The importance of the M-ATV program to Harris is twofold. Naturally, it's a significant revenue opportunity, but it also offers a platform to showcase the advanced capabilities of our next-generation Falcon III radios. This grassroots effort fields the new radios across a broad spectrum of users and encourages further adoption, a strategy that continues to be very successful for us. 
Demand for the JTRS-approved Falcon III family of radios has resulted in year-to-date Falcon III orders through the third quarter, now totaling $620 million. Our Falcon III 117G wideband networking radio is enabling warfighters with unprecedented situational awareness by providing streaming video, simultaneous voice and data feeds, collaborative chat and secure network connectivity. Reports on the field confirmed to us that the 117G is changing the way warfighters are conducting their missions. 
Falcon III orders during the third quarter included $73 million for the 117G multiband manpack from the Marine Corps for use in Afghanistan, $12 million from Marine Corps to upgrade existing 152(C) multiband handheld systems from 20 to 50 watts to allow communications over longer distances and in rough terrain and $74 million for 154 152(C) multiband handheld radios and vehicular adapters to equip the MRAP-ATVs. And then following the close of the quarter, we received an additional $20 million order for Falcon III 117G multiband manpack radios from a DoD customer. 
Other significant U.S. orders in the quarter included $78 million for Falcon II HF radios to equip MRAP-ATVs. And then following the close of the quarter, Harris received a $101 million order for Falcon II 117F multiband vehicular radios for the next phase of MRAP-ATV purchases and to retrofit other existing MRAP vehicles. This is important because it represents the first order that Harris has received to equip the 4,000 additional vehicles approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, JROC, earlier this year. 
International Tactical Communications orders in the third quarter included $112 million from the Australian Department of Defense, as part of their communications modernization program. The order was predominantly Falcon III 152(C) multiband handheld radios. The potential opportunity is $300 million to $500 million over five years. We believe this is an important milestone and we fully expect to see other allied nations standardize on the Harris Falcon III family going forward. 
We also received a $44 million international order from a customer in Asia and a $10 million order from the Iraq Ministry of Interior for Falcon II HF radio systems. Additional significant international orders are still expected this fiscal year from several customers.
We believe in the future of our Global Tactical Radio business to maintain its market leadership and our ability to continue to expand into adjacent markets. Our strategy is simple, listen to our customers and utilize our commercial business model to quickly solve their evolving mission requirements. We are constantly innovating and advancing our technology, years ahead of competition and the programs of record. 
As an example, let's take a look at the emerging ISR mission needs in Afghanistan. UAVs are proliferating overhead, gathering valuable realtime video on possible targets and missions. Although ISR and ground tactical communications have always been viewed as separate missions, accomplished with separate radios, our customers asked if it was possible to integrate these capabilities into a single solution. Our engineers seized the opportunity. In only a few months, we responded with a design that integrated the UAVs ROVER waveform into our Falcon III 117G wideband networking radio. Video can now be received and then retransmitted over the 117G wideband network without the soldier carrying another device. The ROVER waveform was not, of course, contemplated in the JTRS program of record specification, but it's already inside the Harris radio. And our engineering team has been busy developing even more extensive ISR solutions as we speak. 
In our Public Safety and Professional Communications business, revenue in the third quarter was $122 million, and that was about flat compared to the prior year on a pro forma basis. The pipeline of large projects in both the public safety and professional communications markets remains robust. It's driven by requirements for improved interoperability and upgrades from analog to digital networks. And we scored some major wins in the quarter, which will help drive our future growth. 
On the flipside, the weak U.S. economy is having an impact on state and local budgets and is constraining some of our sales of products into existing systems. New orders in the quarter were $168 million, much higher than the revenue. We ended the quarter with a very strong backlog of $489 million, and we're still on track to meet the guidance we established for this fiscal year. 
Major wins in the quarter included $100 million to upgrade the Miami-Dade County public communications infrastructure to a P25 digital radio system. This project also includes the new P25 radios providing interoperability across more than 80 different agencies with over 32,000 users. 
A $13 million order was received in the quarter for our OpenSky system to connect employees at a Texas-based public utility serving 50 counties. The system features over-the-air programming to provide remote reconfiguration and software updates. This win is an excellent example of our ability to provide assured communications to the enterprise market. 
And then following the close of the quarter, Harris received an order from the New York State Police for 1,100 Unity XG-100P multiband radios. The new Harris Unity radios will provide interoperability between the state police and local, metro and county law enforcement officers, allowing them to communicate with radio systems that are both conventional and digital and that operate on various VHF, UHF, 700- or 800-megahertz bands, all in one radio. 
During the quarter, we acquired the technology assets of OSI Geospatial's Situational Awareness business. With this acquisition, Harris gained advanced software for capturing, viewing and disseminating critical tactical information. The software provides commanders and team members alike in the field with real-time information, including the location of personnel. The applications are capable of being embedded in both our tactical and our public safety radios, as well as in other electronic devices and laptop computers. 
Revenue in the Government Communications System segment was $666 million in the third quarter compared with $649 million in the prior year. Revenue in the prior year benefited from the Field Data Collection Automation, or FDCA program, for the U.S. Census Bureau, which is nearing completion. Year-to-date revenue, excluding the FDCA program and adjusting for the impact of the acquisitions, is 7% above the prior year. We believe this is excellent growth and highlights that our businesses continue to be very well positioned in the market. 
Revenue growth benefited from the ramp up of the GOES-R weather satellite program for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. We recently announced the opening of a new Harris office in Greenbelt, Maryland to support the GOES-R program. The modernization of enterprise terminals, or MET program for the Army, also contributed to revenue growth in the quarter. We successfully completed the Critical Implementation Review, or CIR milestone for the program. And we did this just nine months after program award. With the design baseline for the ground terminals now established, the program can move on into its next phase. 
Other contributors to revenue growth in the quarter included the IT Services program, where we're supporting the U.S. Southern Command headquarters relocation, several classified programs for national intelligence customers and acquisitions related to our growth initiatives in Cyber Integrated Solutions and Healthcare Solutions. 
Operating income in the third quarter for the Government Communications Systems segment increased to $90 million compared with $74 million in the prior year. Operating margin was higher at 13.6% and reflected continued excellent program performance, as well as favorable timing on award fees. 
Harris was awarded a significant contract related to our Healthcare Solutions business in the quarter. A three-year potential $72 million contract from the Department of Veterans Affairs to improve the complex billing and collection activities across the nationwide VA organization. After completing a very successful pilot program, this contract was awarded to cover the remainder of the nationwide network. As you know, the VA manages are one of the world's largest healthcare delivery organizations. 
Also during the quarter, Harris was awarded a $25 million contract to provide our new Highband Networking Radios for the U.S. Army. They will carry critical battle command information and form the communications backbone of the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System or IBCS. These radios provide the first ever use of directive beam technology to achieve higher throughput over longer distances within a self-forming, self-healing mesh network.
Revenue in the quarter at Broadcast Communications was $123 million or 7% lower than $132 million in the prior-year quarter, but a little better sequentially than our second quarter. The segment posted an operating loss of $5 million. Revenue continues to be impacted by lower U.S. broadcaster capital spending. 
Gross margins were about flat with the prior-year quarter on much lower revenue, indicating the positive contribution of cost reduction activities that have been implemented. The third quarter operating loss included restructuring charges in the quarter of about $1 million with $3 million in charges year-to-date. Additional actions are expected to result in restructuring costs for the full fiscal year of about $10 million. Operating expenses were slightly higher than the prior year in the third quarter, as we continue to redeploy resources into new media and international markets, where we believe there are significant new business opportunities. 
Orders in the quarter were $130 million, much higher than the prior-year quarter and orders exceeded revenue. Order momentum in the second and third quarters suggest that the market is at the bottom and showing at least some signs of improvement. Some major orders in the quarter included $12 million from Cox Broadcasting for our integrated application suite for traffic, billing, order processing, sales management reporting and sales proposal generation; $4 million from the Abu Dhabi Media Company for a high-definition production and playout center and; $4 million in Rwanda for turnkey DVB-T transmission solution in support of the country's transition from analog to digital broadcasting. 
We continue to experience strong interest in the company's new media growth initiatives, and these are now finally beginning to contribute to segment revenue. This includes live-event venue broadcast networks such as the new Amway Center in Orlando, Florida. These systems leverage our combined broadcast and IT services offerings to provide solutions which enhance the fan experience. We are in active negotiations with a number of other venues also looking to upgrade their broadcast capabilities. Another new-media initiative is FAME, our Full-Motion Video Asset Management Engine, which allows our government customers to capture, store, retrieve, analyze and distribute video intelligence information. Earlier this month, we demonstrated enhanced FAME capabilities at the National Association of Broadcasters Exhibition. This topic was also the focus of my keynote speech during the Military & Government Summit in NAB, where I discussed the benefits of using crossover commercial technologies to solve these difficult government ISR challenges.
Harris also made important announcements in NAB related to our 3D and mobile TV solutions. We introduced the industry's most comprehensive end-to-end 3D workflows, allowing content creators and broadcasters to build a complete solution from the camera all the way to the monitor. The Harris solution assures broadcasters updating their infrastructure to HD that their investments will also support 3D. Harris joined with the Open Mobile Video Coalition to announce the start of mobile TV field trials in Washington, D.C. next month. Harris solutions will be used by FOX Television, Gannett Broadcasting, ION Media Networks, PBS, MHz Networks and Univision. 
Let me now ask Harris' CFO, Gary McArthur, to comment on some of the financial results in the quarter."

In light of this, we are increasing our expectation for cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2010 to a range of $700 million to $725 million, up from our previous guidance of $650 million to $700 million. 
Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter was $40 million as compared to $44 million for the third quarter of 2009. Our expectation for depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 2010 continues to be in the range of $160 million $170 million. 
Capital expenditures were $94 million for the third quarter as compared to $30 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. And included the acquisition of a new 573,000-square-foot manufacturing facility near Rochester, New York, wherein four existing RF Communications manufacturing sites will be consolidated, and the purchase of a new facility in the Mid-Atlantic region for use by our Government Communications Systems business. Our guidance for fiscal year 2010 for CapEx is now $200 million to $210 million, up from our previous guidance of between $150 million and $160 million. 
During the quarter, we used $50 million to repurchase 1.1 million shares of our outstanding stock at an average price of $44.63 per share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 32.6%, and assuming the investment in research and development credit is enacted by Congress in our fourth quarter, our outlook for the full year tax rate for fiscal 2010 is now 33.3%. Our initial outlook for the 2011 full year tax rate is 34%. However, the tax rate for any given quarter could vary up or down as a result of discrete tax events. 
Other areas of guidance for fiscal 2011 are as follows: Cash flow from operations, a range of $675 million to $725 million; depreciation and amortization, from $170 million to $180 million; and capital expenditures, including capitalized software, a range of $200 million to $210 million. 
Our current priorities for cash that is expected to be generated remain the same. One, fund internal investment to drive growth and generate higher earnings; two, acquire companies that meet our strategic objectives and enhance financial returns; three, pay appropriate dividends, we're targeting a payout ratio of 20%; and four, repurchase shares. 
In summary, we expect to finish fiscal 2010 on a very strong financial foundation with expectations for another solid year in fiscal 2011. Back to you, Howard."
177934,100000416,61140,"Harris Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-28-2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","L3Harris Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. Before we open the line up for your questions, let me provide some additional perspective on the revisions and increases we've made to our earnings outlook for fiscal 2010, and a little color around our initial earnings guidance for fiscal 2",692,"Thanks, Gary. Before we open the line up for your questions, let me provide some additional perspective on the revisions and increases we've made to our earnings outlook for fiscal 2010, and a little color around our initial earnings guidance for fiscal 2011. 
First for 2010, we've once again increased our full year non-GAAP earnings guidance to a new range of $4.35 to $4.45 per share. This represents a $0.10 per share increase compared to the previous range of $4.25 to $4.35 per share. 
Revenue in fiscal 2010 is still expected to be $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion. In the RF Communications segment, fiscal 2010 revenue is now expected to be in a range of 18% to 19% higher than fiscal 2009. Now this includes the contribution, of course, of the acquired Public Safety and Professional Communications business coming in at about $500 million.
Segment operating margin for the year for the RF Communications segment is now projected to be higher in a range of 34% to 35% as compared to our previous guidance of 33%. The higher operating margin continues to be driven by more favorable Tactical Radio product mix, cost reductions and improving operational efficiencies. The acquired Public Safety and Professional Communications business is performing about as expected this year. 
For Government Communications Systems, we expect revenue for fiscal 2010 to be about flat with the prior year on a reported basis. Now after you adjusted for the impact of acquisitions and excluding the ending of the FDCA [Field Data Collection Automation] program, the guidance reflects we've been very strong organic growth for the year of about 8%. And operating margins are still expected to be about 12.5% for fiscal 2010. 
In Broadcast Communications for fiscal 2010, we've reduced expected revenue to a new range of $480 million to 490 million. We expect an operating loss of about $20 million for the year including $10 million of that related to restructuring charges. The reduction in segment income since our previous guidance is based on the lower sales volume, somewhat higher investments in international and new media markets and higher restructuring charges associated with additional cost reduction actions. So that's fiscal 2010. 
Let me move on now to fiscal 2011. Of course, we're very pleased to initiate earnings guidance in a range of $4.55 to $4.65 per share, 3% to 6% above our fiscal 2010 guidance midpoint. Revenue in fiscal 2011 is expected to be $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion, about 5% to 7% higher than fiscal 2010 guidance. Talk a little bit about the segments.
For the RF Communications segment, fiscal 2011 revenue is expected to be 6% to 8% higher than fiscal 2010. This includes the Public Safety and Professional Communications business in fiscal '11 at $540 million to $550 million, about 8% to 10% higher than fiscal 2010. 
Segment operating margin for 2011 is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33%. That's about 200 basis points lower than fiscal 2010, as the impact of more typical, Tactical Radio product mix is partially offset by higher public safety and Professional Communications business margins. We will continue to actively invest in R&D programs to further enhance the capabilities of our current products and introduce additional new products into adjacent markets. 
Moving to the Government Communications Systems segment, we expect revenue for fiscal 2011 to be 5% to 7% higher than fiscal 2010. Operating margin is expected to be 11.5%, that's about 100 basis points lower than fiscal 2010. This is due to the impact of lower pricing on the follow-on contracts for the Navy Marine Corps Intranet program and the FTI program, still very strong margins. 
For the Broadcast Communications segment, we're projecting modest revenue growth in fiscal 2011 in a range of $490 million to $510 million with break-even operating results.  Additionally for fiscal 2011, we expect net interest expense to be about flat with this year while unallocated corporate expense will be lower than this year in a range of $76 million to $78 million.

So we think it's a significant driver not just with the products we're offering now, the solution, but we're continuing to enhance that with additional products. And broadly across Harris, we think that our engagement in tactical intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, ISR, is a big growth opportunity for the company. And we see it in broadcast technology that can be applied, we see it in capabilities that we have, certainly in our RF and our tactical radios, we also see it in systems integration opportunities to support the customers in the Government Systems segment.

Revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.46 billion. That's 13% higher than the prior year. On an organic basis excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenue was 8% higher. Non-GAAP income, which excludes acquisition-related costs, was $161 million in the fourth quarter or $1.24 per diluted share. That's an increase of 38% compared with the prior-year quarter. Orders in the fourth quarter were $1.72 billion, and that's 33% higher than the prior-year quarter. We saw a continued strong performance in the quarter in the RF Communications segment, as well as strong underlying revenue growth and excellent program execution across the Government Communications Systems segment. 
Our track record of delivering consistent growth in revenue and earnings continued in fiscal 2010, with momentum building as the year progressed. Revenue for the full fiscal year was $5.21 billion, 4% higher than the prior year. Non-GAAP income was $582 million or $4.43 per diluted share, that's an increase of 15% compared with the prior year. Orders for the full year were a record $6.08 billion, 36% higher than fiscal 2009. As a result of the full year book-to-bill of 1.2, we have very strong momentum as we begin fiscal 2011. 
In RF Communications, fourth quarter revenue for the segment was $630 million, 35% higher compared to $468 million in the prior-year quarter. The results included $486 million in revenue in Tactical Communications, up 17% from $415 million in the prior year and $144 million in revenue in Public Safety and Professional Communications. Non-GAAP segment operating income was $227 million compared with $144 million in the prior year. Operating margin was a very strong 36% reflecting favorable product mix and operating efficiencies. 
Fourth quarter orders for the RF segment were $890 million. That included $711 million for Tactical Communications and $179 million for Public Safety and Professional Communications. For the full fiscal year, orders for the segment were $2.88 billion yielding a 1.4 book-to-bill. And that included $2.34 billion for Tactical Communications and $541 million for Public Safety and Professional Communications. 
As a result of the large amount of new orders, backlog increased significantly in the quarter providing the foundation for continued growth in fiscal 2011 in the RF Communications segment. As of year end, segment backlog stood at $1.76 billion, and that included $1.24 billion in Tactical Communications. Backlog is higher than previously expected due primarily to higher international Tactical Communications orders received in the fourth quarter. Tactical Communications orders continue to be driven by multiple factors including increasing customer adoption of our next-generation Falcon III radios, equipping of new MRAP and M-ATV vehicles and new wins on long-term international communications modernization programs. 
The Harris next-generation Falcon III radios offer both U.S. and international customers unprecedented situational awareness capabilities, including streaming video to the tactical edge of the battlefield for the very first time. Users are reporting that the Falcon III is changing the way they are conducting their missions, and is literally saving lives. Major Falcon III orders during the quarter in the U.S. market included $24 million from the Joint Tactical Radio System Program Executive Office for our Falcon III AN/PRC-152 multiband handheld radios for the U.S. Air Force, $20 million and $11 million of orders from the U.S. Department of Defense for Falcon III AN/PRC-117G multiband manpack radio systems, along with $17 million for Falcon III AN/PRC-152 handheld radios. We also received an $11 million order from the U.S. Marine Corps for the Falcon III AN/VRC-110 multiband vehicular radio systems. And also $13 million order and a $27 million order for the Falcon III AN/PRC-152 multiband handheld radios, as well as vehicular adapters to equip those radios into MRAP vehicles. 
Other significant U.S. DoD [Department of Defense] orders included $139 million to provide additional Falcon II high-frequency tactical radio systems and $101 million for Falcon II multiband manpack radios for MRAP vehicles. The Harris MRAP and M-ATV program wins resulted in significant orders and revenue in fiscal 2010, and this program will continue to be a revenue contributor in fiscal 2011, albeit at a lower level. What was really unusual about the M-ATV program was the condensed time frame for its deployment. What would normally have been rolled out over several years is being completed in about 12 months. That's allowed the M-ATV program to be a real showcase for Harris. 
We've demonstrated the advanced capabilities of our Falcon III radios to a large and broad user group across multiple branches of the Services, and we've also demonstrated our ability to respond quickly to the higher demand and also to new user requirements. These abilities are made possible by our unique commercial business model serving this market. Traditional programs of record are not able to respond as we can. Our strategy successfully deploys new technology at the grassroots level, fielding new radios as quick as possible across a broad spectrum of users to encourage further adoption. This strategy continues to be very successful for us. 
While the M-ATV program was certainly significant to our Tactical Radio business, [in] terms of orders and also as a means of reaching this broad user group quickly with our new Falcon III radios, it's important to note that the business also experienced strong orders growth outside of the M-ATV and MRAP programs in both the U.S. and international markets. When you exclude $35 million in M-ATV and MRAP orders in fiscal 2009, and then $1 billion in orders under these programs in fiscal 2010, the remaining tactical radio orders also grew in fiscal 2010 by 15% over the prior year. That was 10% growth in DoD and 21% growth in international. We believe this illustrates that we've clearly got strong momentum outside of just the MRAP programs alone. 
Stronger International orders in the quarter, not only reflected a strengthening global market, but also a significant uptick in customer adoption of our new Falcon III radio family. Major International orders in the quarter included $99 million from the government of Pakistan, for the next phase of comprehensive multilevel C4I system utilizing both Falcon II and Falcon III radios. Also our line of secure personal radios, multiband networking radios and high-capacity line-of-sight radios. 
We also received an $11 million order from another country in Central Asia for both Falcon II and Falcon III radios, orders from two NATO countries totaling $26 million for our Falcon III multiband handheld radios, an $8 million order from a customer in the Middle East to supply Falcon II multiband handheld radios and Falcon III radios, including our secure personal radios and high-capacity line-of-sight systems, and finally, a $33 million order from the government of Iraq for Falcon II HF radios. 
During the quarter, we also announced our new mission modules for the Falcon III AN/PRC-117G manpack multiband radio. The mission modules will provide mission-specific customization and flexibility by enabling users of the 117G to quickly and easily add advanced capabilities to the radio on an as-needed basis. Mission modules expand functionality such as adding a second wideband radio channel, an HF radio channel or an ISR module. In addition to the benefits already mentioned, the mission modules will also allow industry partners to develop new applications that can ride on the 117G through the use of an open platform standard interface architecture. 
The Harris Falcon III 117G offers advanced capabilities today to meet the war fighters' urgent needs, and our new mission modules will ensure the continuous integration of new capabilities to address future requirements. 
In summary, our Tactical Radio business had another very successful year. More importantly, the strong level of new orders that we received did not deplete our future orders opportunity pipeline. It has now been replenished and stands at $2 billion for International and $1.5 billion in the U.S. market. 
The continued investment of our funds for development of additional new products will allow us to continue to outpace the progress of our competitors who are using only government funds to try and achieve the same results. We're listening to the needs of our customers, and we’re investing to solve their problems in the most efficient way possible. We believe this business model becomes even more valuable as customer budgets come under pressure. 
In Public Safety and Professional Communications, our one-year anniversary of acquiring this business occurred in May. As already noted, we had a strong finish to the fiscal year. In spite of constrained state and local budgets, we delivered organic revenue growth in fiscal 2010 of about 7%, and we built backlog going into fiscal 2011. 
During our first year of ownership, we introduced revolutionary new products such as the Unity multiband land mobile radio. We significantly stabilized and improved the operation of a number of networks that are already deployed with our customers, and we had a number of very important long-term large program wins. We also continue to see a robust opportunity pipeline in this business, exceeding $3 billion in North America. 
Major Public Safety and Professional Communication wins in the fourth quarter included a $30 million order to deploy a P25 Trunked Communication System in Monroe County, New York. This system supports 25,000 public service, public safety users. Ultimately, the program will unite all of Monroe County's public service and public safety agencies under a single modern digital communication system that's built on our VIDA IP-based network. The system will interoperate with the legacy law enforcement system, the legacy fire services system and the legacy public service system. 
We also received a $23 million order from a major energy company in the Southwest for our Open Sky voice and data communication system, and a $9 million order from Franklin County, North Carolina, for our P25 communication system and then finally a $5 million order from the New York State Police for our Unity XG-100P multiband radios. 
Revenue in the Government Communications Systems segment was $707 million in the fourth quarter. That compares with $704 million in the prior year. Of course, as expected, revenue from the Field Data Collection Automation program, or FDCA program, for the U.S. Census Bureau's 2010 Census declined about $50 million compared with the prior-year quarter, and it declined about $240 million for the fiscal year in total as the program nears completion. Excluding the FDCA program and also adjusting out for the impact of acquisitions, revenue for fiscal 2010 was 7% higher than the prior year. We think that demonstrates continued strength in the Government Systems and Services businesses. 
Revenue growth in the quarter benefited from multiple programs included the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite Series R ground segment weather program for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. During the quarter, this program completed the System Definition Review. That's a formal technical review of the ground architecture and how it will operate within the overall GOES-R system architecture, and the program established a firm baseline for advancing to the preliminary design phase of the program. 
Other programs contributing to revenue growth included the modernization of enterprise terminals, or MET program for the U.S. Army, the Joint Strike Fighter Program for the Department of Defense and the headquarters relocation IT services program for the U.S. Southern Command. 
Non-GAAP segment operating income in the fourth quarter was $78 million, and that was about flat with the prior-year quarter. Operating margin was a solid 11% for the quarter. We achieved several significant program wins in the fourth quarter, and these included a six-year $97 million contract from the Federal Aviation Administration for its Weather and Radar Maintenance and Sustainment Services II program. The program scope includes software maintenance releases, depot support, on-site field support and engineering services for 22 operational FAA facilities across the U.S.
Harris was also awarded a five-year $140 million contract for the Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment Program for NASA. Pending the resolution of an award protest, Harris will lead the effort to replace equipment and software in the space-to-ground link for NASA's Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System, also known as TDRSS. The SGSS program builds on Harris' 30-year incumbency supporting TDRSS. Harris was a primary developer of the original TDRSS ground system for White Sands in Mexico in the early 1980s and also provided the large deployable antennas on the original TDRSS satellites. 
Harris was also awarded in the quarter a 30-month $25 million IT services contract to modernize and support high-bandwidth networks at 15 Air National Guard sites nationwide. And we also received an award of a $25 million classified program. 
We continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities in our new Healthcare Solutions business. During the quarter, Harris was awarded several new contracts by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. These included a proof of concept study to demonstrate anytime Internet access to veterans’ healthcare information using Smart phones, a development contract to create and implement a new IT project requirements process within the VA and a contract extension to evaluate how the use of emerging technologies can positively impact clinical care. These awards are a result of the company's November 2009 acquisition of Patriot Technologies, a leading provider of healthcare IT, imaging and the enterprise software solutions for the VA. 
And then following the close of the quarter, Harris was awarded a 10-year $130 million contract to supply antennas and control systems for NOAA's GOES-R program. The antennas will provide communications links for command, telemetry and sensor data as well as the communications link to direct data users. 
So we expect solid revenue growth for Government Systems in fiscal 2011 as we continue to benefit from the recent wins on GOES-R, healthcare, NASA and Classified Cyber. We also expect continued growth in our FAA programs and in IT services broadly. The pipeline of opportunities remains very large. Though like many of our peer companies, we are seeing some award dates slipping out in time. We remain confident that our backlog, along with the opportunities to be awarded in fiscal 2011, support our projected growth. 
Last Friday, we announced the closing on our acquisition of CapRock Communications. CapRock is a global provider of mission-critical managed satellite communication services for government, energy and maritime markets. Their highly reliable solutions include broadband Internet access, Voice over IP Telephony, wideband networking and real-time video, all delivered to nearly 2,000 customer sites around the world. The combination of CapRock and Harris will give customers access to a greater breadth of a shared communications capabilities, depth of expertise and unparalleled customer support while enabling us to enter new vertical markets and increase our international presence. 
The Broadcast Communications segment continued to underperform in the fourth quarter. Revenue of $128 million was in line with recent quarters, but fourth quarter orders were sequentially lower at $111 million. Segment operating income was a loss of $21 million in the quarter. This did include $7 million coming from restructuring costs and $6 million coming from inventory write-downs. Fourth quarter results reflected the continued weak U.S. market capital spending trend. 
For the full fiscal 2010, Broadcast Communications revenue declined almost $100 million or 17% from fiscal 2009. The decline was led by $60 million in lower revenue in our transmission systems product line. 
Significant cost reductions were implemented in 2010 in response to the lower revenue trends, and further actions will be completed in early fiscal 2011. But we cannot rely entirely on cost-reduction actions to deliver improved financial results. 
A new leadership team was put in place in this business in the fourth quarter. We believe that continuing to invest in the growth markets of the future is the right strategy. Although we are investing at a time when the legacy market has continued to decline, this is the means to make this business a long-term success and a positive contributor to the company's future financial results. 
Let me highlight today three growth areas. First, international markets, including the BRIC nations of Brazil, China, India and Russia along with other countries in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Africa, offer us significant growth opportunities. Their transition from analog to digital broadcasting is still just getting started. There's growing demand for both digital transmission systems and the related infrastructure that goes with it. In response, we recently launched transmitter production at new factories in Brazil and China using manufacturing partners. The regional presence will increase our market share and reduce our product cost. 
The second area is the U.S. government market for full-motion video systems continues to grow. Harris has a strong market position with unique technology capabilities in this area. Our FAME solution, short for Full Motion Video Asset Management Engine, offers unequalled performance and scalability as our government customers cope with increasing amounts of digital intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance information. Several FAME systems have been deployed, and we’re receiving positive customer feedback. 
Third, the growth of digital out-of-home advertising continues. Our solutions enable advertisers to reach consumers on the move. New systems will be increasingly deployed to deliver rich media content in live sports and entertainment venues, retail establishments and to mobile handheld devices. 
At the recent Infocom Trade Show, Harris demonstrated an array of innovative digital audio video solutions which integrate digital signage hardware and software, production play out and scheduling systems, multi-viewers and graphic engines. Harris is uniquely positioned to offer end-to-end solutions and services, which enable customers to implement efficient media workflows and create new revenue streams. These market initiatives, along with the broader end market recovery, will drive improved top line revenue and bottom line results in fiscal 2011 and beyond in this segment. Let me now ask Harris' CFO, Gary McArthur, to comment on the financial results in the fourth quarter."

We ended the year with $455 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. We generated $803 million of operating cash flow, $605 million of free cash flow, repurchased $201 million of our outstanding stock and paid $115 million in dividends. None of our outstanding long-term debt comes due prior to October 2015. And as of year-end, we had $720 million available under our $750 million revolving credit facility. Once again, as of year end, our return on invested capital was more than twice our cost of capital and improved nearly 300 basis points to 22% as compared to 19% as of the end of fiscal 2009. 
As to the fourth quarter, cash flow generated from operating activities was $167 million as compared to $262 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, and capital expenditures were $62 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $25 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The $37 million higher CapEx resulted primarily from the continuing build out of our newly acquired cyber security solutions facility, and our RF Communications manufacturing facility. Depreciation and amortization was $45 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $55 million for the fourth quarter of the prior year. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price per share of $46.53. Total shares repurchased during fiscal 2010 were 4.8 million. And as of year end, we have $450 million remaining availability under our $600 million share repurchase program. Our priorities for excess cash continue to be in the order of priority, internal investments, acquisitions that further our strategic objectives and increase shareholder value, the payment of competitive dividends and share repurchases. Our full year tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 33%, slightly lower than forecasted. 
As announced last week, we successfully completed the acquisition of CapRock Communications on July 30 which was funded by $185 million of cash on hand and $340 million of commercial paper, backed by our revolving credit facility. Revised guidance for fiscal 2011 including the impacts from the CapRock acquisition is as follows: Cash flow from operations in a range of $750 million to $800 million, depreciation and amortization of $205 million to $215 million and capital expenditures including capitalized software of $250 million to $275 million. The higher planned capital expenditures as compared to the prior year are primarily a result of the build out of our cyber security solutions facility that is planned to open early next calendar year, the new RF manufacturing facility that is planned to be fully operational in early fiscal 2012 and the additional planned CapEx resulting from the CapRock acquisition. 
Corporate expense is expected to be lower than last year at $86 million, but higher than previously forecasted due to our continued funding of growth initiatives. Interest expense will be $10 million to $15 million higher as a result of the funding for the CapRock acquisition. And finally, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for fiscal year 2011 is expected to be 34%. Back to you, Howard."
177934,109118478,71833,"Harris Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","L3Harris Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. As we indicated in our press release this afternoon, we've increased our financial guidance for fiscal 2011 to include the expected contribution from the CapRock Communications acquisition. Consolidated revenue is now expected to be in",517,"Thank you, Gary. As we indicated in our press release this afternoon, we've increased our financial guidance for fiscal 2011 to include the expected contribution from the CapRock Communications acquisition. 
Consolidated revenue is now expected to be in a range of $5.9 billion to $6 billion, about 13% to 15% higher than fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP income excluding acquisition-related costs is now expected to be in a range of $4.60 to $4.70 per share, representing a year-over-year increase of 4% to 6%. Our previous guidance was $4.55 to $4.65 per share. 
As a result of recent acquisitions and some of the facility investment Gary discussed, we’re seeing an increase in our non-cash amortization and depreciation expenses. We believe that EBITDA growth, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, has become an important metric to track cash profitability improvement alongside of net income and EPS growth. Non-GAAP EBITDA for fiscal 2011, which excludes acquisition-related costs, is expected to be in a range from $1.18 billion to $1.21 billion, and that represents an increase of 7% to 10% above fiscal 2010 EBITDA of $1.10 billion. 
For the RF Communications segment, fiscal 2011 revenue is expected to be 7% to 8% higher than fiscal 2010. Segment operating margin for the year is expected to be about 33%. 
For the Government Communications Systems segment, we expect revenue for fiscal 2011 to be 20% to 22% higher than fiscal 2010. This represents 6% to 8% growth in the existing Government Communications Systems business, and then adds CapRock Communications revenue in a range from $380 million to $390 million for 11 months of fiscal 2011. Segment operating margin is expected to be approximately 11%. 
For the Broadcast Communications segment, we continue to expect revenue in a range of $490 million to $510 million with break-even operating results. We expect to see continued operating losses in the first half of the year with profitability improving in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Finally, let me say a few words about the seasonality of expected fiscal 2011 earnings. We don't normally provide quarterly earnings guidance, but fiscal 2011 seasonality appears to be very atypical. The quarterly distribution of revenue in the RF Communications segment is expected to be heavily front-end loaded in the first fiscal quarter with shipments for the MRAP and M-ATV programs. First quarter RF segment revenue is expected to be about 30% higher than fiscal 2010 with first quarter segment margins of about 39% as a result of favorable product mix and operating efficiencies. Second quarter revenue is expected to be sequentially lower with sequential increases in the third and fourth quarter. So the combined impact of the front-end loading of the RF segment revenue and its related margins is significant on Harris' consolidated earnings. We expect earnings in the first fiscal quarter to be in a range from $1.20 to $1.25 per share. We expect earnings in the second fiscal quarter to be in a range of $0.95 to $1 per share. With that, I will ask the operator to open the line, and we'll be pleased to take your questions."

So big pipelines and our internal goal is to maintain and achieve the 1.0 book-to-bill. With regard to any specific accretion on the wireless acquisition, I don't have that number at my fingertips. Certainly, it provided accretion in fiscal '10 as a result of favorable financing rates on the acquisition, and the results we delivered for the acquisition were essentially on target for our expectations that we said at the beginning of the year. We're expecting further growth in fiscal '11, as we had previously indicated about 8% to 10% above fiscal ’10, and we're seeing consistent year-over-year margin expansion, ultimately getting up to the goals that Gary and I have talked about previously in the three- to five-year time frame of 15% kind of operating margins and 20% EBITDA margins for the segments.

When you factor in the amortization of intangibles, you'd really be at about 20% EBITDA margins. So the acquisition achieved its objectives in the first year, and we’re expecting to grow margins this year. We're losing a little bit of precise visibility on the operating income for the business, because we’re leveraging a lot of the back-office and combined systems. So we have good visibility to revenue and gross margin, but beyond that, you start to allocate cost. So that's why we're not providing any specific numbers in terms of the profitability within the segment, because it would be somewhat subject to those allocations. But certainly, our plans at the gross margin level see continued improvement in '11 over '10, and we're not up to our goal yet certainly so we think there's some continued growth beyond '11 as we talk about margins."

I think every program is up for review, but I'm not aware of any specific milestone that would drive a go or no-go decision. So nothing specific. Certainly, we're very pleased with how we’re continuing progress, and we have made a lot of strides over the last year, most recently in the deployment of the 117G across what's called capability set 9 and 10 into Afghanistan. The performance of the radios really is speaking for itself in terms of the enabling of real-time broadband communications or wideband communications across the comms networks for the first time, allowing you to have streaming video and other bandwidth-intensive data at the tactical edge in the hands of the war fighter. So I think that the radio’s capability is proving itself real-time on the battlefield, and we think, as a result, it's going to continue to get a lot of attention and the demand for the radios, we think, will continue to grow as well as a result of its performance. There's no better way to prove what it can do than in the kind of tactical battlefield operations that are going on right now."

But I certainly think that we hope to get several important program wins under our belt and start to demonstrate the value of that broadband communications capability in the 700 megahertz area. We also continue to lobby with other companies to get the FCC to designate that Block D of that spectrum for public safety. That's a little bit of a contentious area right now, because as I understand it, to really deploy the most effective LTE 700 megahertz networks, you really need the 20 megahertz band and only half of that has been allocated. The other half they're planning on auctioning, making available to public safety on a so-called emergency basis, which most of us think is a little problematic how you'd actually do that. So we continue to lobby on that basis, but we agree that we think we've got the right partner in Nokia Siemens and are certainly excited. The opportunity to bring the kind of data to the public safety situational awareness field in the way that we have in the military examples could really make a difference in terms of not only officer safety, but effectiveness.

Harris ended fiscal 2010 with a very strong quarter. Orders, revenue and income were significantly higher than the prior-year quarter, and we generated significant operating cash flow. Orders were higher than revenue, further increasing our backlog. 
Revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.46 billion. That's 13% higher than the prior year. On an organic basis excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenue was 8% higher. Non-GAAP income, which excludes acquisition-related costs, was $161 million in the fourth quarter or $1.24 per diluted share. That's an increase of 38% compared with the prior-year quarter. Orders in the fourth quarter were $1.72 billion, and that's 33% higher than the prior-year quarter. We saw a continued strong performance in the quarter in the RF Communications segment, as well as strong underlying revenue growth and excellent program execution across the Government Communications Systems segment. 
Our track record of delivering consistent growth in revenue and earnings continued in fiscal 2010, with momentum building as the year progressed. Revenue for the full fiscal year was $5.21 billion, 4% higher than the prior year. Non-GAAP income was $582 million or $4.43 per diluted share, that's an increase of 15% compared with the prior year. Orders for the full year were a record $6.08 billion, 36% higher than fiscal 2009. As a result of the full year book-to-bill of 1.2, we have very strong momentum as we begin fiscal 2011. 
In RF Communications, fourth quarter revenue for the segment was $630 million, 35% higher compared to $468 million in the prior-year quarter. The results included $486 million in revenue in Tactical Communications, up 17% from $415 million in the prior year and $144 million in revenue in Public Safety and Professional Communications. Non-GAAP segment operating income was $227 million compared with $144 million in the prior year. Operating margin was a very strong 36% reflecting favorable product mix and operating efficiencies. 
Fourth quarter orders for the RF segment were $890 million. That included $711 million for Tactical Communications and $179 million for Public Safety and Professional Communications. For the full fiscal year, orders for the segment were $2.88 billion yielding a 1.4 book-to-bill. And that included $2.34 billion for Tactical Communications and $541 million for Public Safety and Professional Communications. 
As a result of the large amount of new orders, backlog increased significantly in the quarter providing the foundation for continued growth in fiscal 2011 in the RF Communications segment. As of year end, segment backlog stood at $1.76 billion, and that included $1.24 billion in Tactical Communications. Backlog is higher than previously expected due primarily to higher international Tactical Communications orders received in the fourth quarter. Tactical Communications orders continue to be driven by multiple factors including increasing customer adoption of our next-generation Falcon III radios, equipping of new MRAP and M-ATV vehicles and new wins on long-term international communications modernization programs. 
The Harris next-generation Falcon III radios offer both U.S. and international customers unprecedented situational awareness capabilities, including streaming video to the tactical edge of the battlefield for the very first time. Users are reporting that the Falcon III is changing the way they are conducting their missions, and is literally saving lives. Major Falcon III orders during the quarter in the U.S. market included $24 million from the Joint Tactical Radio System Program Executive Office for our Falcon III AN/PRC-152 multiband handheld radios for the U.S. Air Force, $20 million and $11 million of orders from the U.S. Department of Defense for Falcon III AN/PRC-117G multiband manpack radio systems, along with $17 million for Falcon III AN/PRC-152 handheld radios. We also received an $11 million order from the U.S. Marine Corps for the Falcon III AN/VRC-110 multiband vehicular radio systems. And also $13 million order and a $27 million order for the Falcon III AN/PRC-152 multiband handheld radios, as well as vehicular adapters to equip those radios into MRAP vehicles. 
Other significant U.S. DoD [Department of Defense] orders included $139 million to provide additional Falcon II high-frequency tactical radio systems and $101 million for Falcon II multiband manpack radios for MRAP vehicles. The Harris MRAP and M-ATV program wins resulted in significant orders and revenue in fiscal 2010, and this program will continue to be a revenue contributor in fiscal 2011, albeit at a lower level. What was really unusual about the M-ATV program was the condensed time frame for its deployment. What would normally have been rolled out over several years is being completed in about 12 months. That's allowed the M-ATV program to be a real showcase for Harris. 
We've demonstrated the advanced capabilities of our Falcon III radios to a large and broad user group across multiple branches of the Services, and we've also demonstrated our ability to respond quickly to the higher demand and also to new user requirements. These abilities are made possible by our unique commercial business model serving this market. Traditional programs of record are not able to respond as we can. Our strategy successfully deploys new technology at the grassroots level, fielding new radios as quick as possible across a broad spectrum of users to encourage further adoption. This strategy continues to be very successful for us. 
While the M-ATV program was certainly significant to our Tactical Radio business, [in] terms of orders and also as a means of reaching this broad user group quickly with our new Falcon III radios, it's important to note that the business also experienced strong orders growth outside of the M-ATV and MRAP programs in both the U.S. and international markets. When you exclude $35 million in M-ATV and MRAP orders in fiscal 2009, and then $1 billion in orders under these programs in fiscal 2010, the remaining tactical radio orders also grew in fiscal 2010 by 15% over the prior year. That was 10% growth in DoD and 21% growth in international. We believe this illustrates that we've clearly got strong momentum outside of just the MRAP programs alone. 
Stronger International orders in the quarter, not only reflected a strengthening global market, but also a significant uptick in customer adoption of our new Falcon III radio family. Major International orders in the quarter included $99 million from the government of Pakistan, for the next phase of comprehensive multilevel C4I system utilizing both Falcon II and Falcon III radios. Also our line of secure personal radios, multiband networking radios and high-capacity line-of-sight radios. 
We also received an $11 million order from another country in Central Asia for both Falcon II and Falcon III radios, orders from two NATO countries totaling $26 million for our Falcon III multiband handheld radios, an $8 million order from a customer in the Middle East to supply Falcon II multiband handheld radios and Falcon III radios, including our secure personal radios and high-capacity line-of-sight systems, and finally, a $33 million order from the government of Iraq for Falcon II HF radios. 
During the quarter, we also announced our new mission modules for the Falcon III AN/PRC-117G manpack multiband radio. The mission modules will provide mission-specific customization and flexibility by enabling users of the 117G to quickly and easily add advanced capabilities to the radio on an as-needed basis. Mission modules expand functionality such as adding a second wideband radio channel, an HF radio channel or an ISR module. In addition to the benefits already mentioned, the mission modules will also allow industry partners to develop new applications that can ride on the 117G through the use of an open platform standard interface architecture. 
The Harris Falcon III 117G offers advanced capabilities today to meet the war fighters' urgent needs, and our new mission modules will ensure the continuous integration of new capabilities to address future requirements. 
In summary, our Tactical Radio business had another very successful year. More importantly, the strong level of new orders that we received did not deplete our future orders opportunity pipeline. It has now been replenished and stands at $2 billion for International and $1.5 billion in the U.S. market. 
The continued investment of our funds for development of additional new products will allow us to continue to outpace the progress of our competitors who are using only government funds to try and achieve the same results. We're listening to the needs of our customers, and we’re investing to solve their problems in the most efficient way possible. We believe this business model becomes even more valuable as customer budgets come under pressure. 
In Public Safety and Professional Communications, our one-year anniversary of acquiring this business occurred in May. As already noted, we had a strong finish to the fiscal year. In spite of constrained state and local budgets, we delivered organic revenue growth in fiscal 2010 of about 7%, and we built backlog going into fiscal 2011. 
During our first year of ownership, we introduced revolutionary new products such as the Unity multiband land mobile radio. We significantly stabilized and improved the operation of a number of networks that are already deployed with our customers, and we had a number of very important long-term large program wins. We also continue to see a robust opportunity pipeline in this business, exceeding $3 billion in North America. 
Major Public Safety and Professional Communication wins in the fourth quarter included a $30 million order to deploy a P25 Trunked Communication System in Monroe County, New York. This system supports 25,000 public service, public safety users. Ultimately, the program will unite all of Monroe County's public service and public safety agencies under a single modern digital communication system that's built on our VIDA IP-based network. The system will interoperate with the legacy law enforcement system, the legacy fire services system and the legacy public service system. 
We also received a $23 million order from a major energy company in the Southwest for our Open Sky voice and data communication system, and a $9 million order from Franklin County, North Carolina, for our P25 communication system and then finally a $5 million order from the New York State Police for our Unity XG-100P multiband radios. 
Revenue in the Government Communications Systems segment was $707 million in the fourth quarter. That compares with $704 million in the prior year. Of course, as expected, revenue from the Field Data Collection Automation program, or FDCA program, for the U.S. Census Bureau's 2010 Census declined about $50 million compared with the prior-year quarter, and it declined about $240 million for the fiscal year in total as the program nears completion. Excluding the FDCA program and also adjusting out for the impact of acquisitions, revenue for fiscal 2010 was 7% higher than the prior year. We think that demonstrates continued strength in the Government Systems and Services businesses. 
Revenue growth in the quarter benefited from multiple programs included the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite Series R ground segment weather program for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. During the quarter, this program completed the System Definition Review. That's a formal technical review of the ground architecture and how it will operate within the overall GOES-R system architecture, and the program established a firm baseline for advancing to the preliminary design phase of the program. 
Other programs contributing to revenue growth included the modernization of enterprise terminals, or MET program for the U.S. Army, the Joint Strike Fighter Program for the Department of Defense and the headquarters relocation IT services program for the U.S. Southern Command. 
Non-GAAP segment operating income in the fourth quarter was $78 million, and that was about flat with the prior-year quarter. Operating margin was a solid 11% for the quarter. We achieved several significant program wins in the fourth quarter, and these included a six-year $97 million contract from the Federal Aviation Administration for its Weather and Radar Maintenance and Sustainment Services II program. The program scope includes software maintenance releases, depot support, on-site field support and engineering services for 22 operational FAA facilities across the U.S.
Harris was also awarded a five-year $140 million contract for the Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment Program for NASA. Pending the resolution of an award protest, Harris will lead the effort to replace equipment and software in the space-to-ground link for NASA's Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System, also known as TDRSS. The SGSS program builds on Harris' 30-year incumbency supporting TDRSS. Harris was a primary developer of the original TDRSS ground system for White Sands in Mexico in the early 1980s and also provided the large deployable antennas on the original TDRSS satellites. 
Harris was also awarded in the quarter a 30-month $25 million IT services contract to modernize and support high-bandwidth networks at 15 Air National Guard sites nationwide. And we also received an award of a $25 million classified program. 
We continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities in our new Healthcare Solutions business. During the quarter, Harris was awarded several new contracts by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. These included a proof of concept study to demonstrate anytime Internet access to veterans’ healthcare information using Smart phones, a development contract to create and implement a new IT project requirements process within the VA and a contract extension to evaluate how the use of emerging technologies can positively impact clinical care. These awards are a result of the company's November 2009 acquisition of Patriot Technologies, a leading provider of healthcare IT, imaging and the enterprise software solutions for the VA. 
And then following the close of the quarter, Harris was awarded a 10-year $130 million contract to supply antennas and control systems for NOAA's GOES-R program. The antennas will provide communications links for command, telemetry and sensor data as well as the communications link to direct data users. 
So we expect solid revenue growth for Government Systems in fiscal 2011 as we continue to benefit from the recent wins on GOES-R, healthcare, NASA and Classified Cyber. We also expect continued growth in our FAA programs and in IT services broadly. The pipeline of opportunities remains very large. Though like many of our peer companies, we are seeing some award dates slipping out in time. We remain confident that our backlog, along with the opportunities to be awarded in fiscal 2011, support our projected growth. 
Last Friday, we announced the closing on our acquisition of CapRock Communications. CapRock is a global provider of mission-critical managed satellite communication services for government, energy and maritime markets. Their highly reliable solutions include broadband Internet access, Voice over IP Telephony, wideband networking and real-time video, all delivered to nearly 2,000 customer sites around the world. The combination of CapRock and Harris will give customers access to a greater breadth of a shared communications capabilities, depth of expertise and unparalleled customer support while enabling us to enter new vertical markets and increase our international presence. 
The Broadcast Communications segment continued to underperform in the fourth quarter. Revenue of $128 million was in line with recent quarters, but fourth quarter orders were sequentially lower at $111 million. Segment operating income was a loss of $21 million in the quarter. This did include $7 million coming from restructuring costs and $6 million coming from inventory write-downs. Fourth quarter results reflected the continued weak U.S. market capital spending trend. 
For the full fiscal 2010, Broadcast Communications revenue declined almost $100 million or 17% from fiscal 2009. The decline was led by $60 million in lower revenue in our transmission systems product line. 
Significant cost reductions were implemented in 2010 in response to the lower revenue trends, and further actions will be completed in early fiscal 2011. But we cannot rely entirely on cost-reduction actions to deliver improved financial results. 
A new leadership team was put in place in this business in the fourth quarter. We believe that continuing to invest in the growth markets of the future is the right strategy. Although we are investing at a time when the legacy market has continued to decline, this is the means to make this business a long-term success and a positive contributor to the company's future financial results. 
Let me highlight today three growth areas. First, international markets, including the BRIC nations of Brazil, China, India and Russia along with other countries in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Africa, offer us significant growth opportunities. Their transition from analog to digital broadcasting is still just getting started. There's growing demand for both digital transmission systems and the related infrastructure that goes with it. In response, we recently launched transmitter production at new factories in Brazil and China using manufacturing partners. The regional presence will increase our market share and reduce our product cost. 
The second area is the U.S. government market for full-motion video systems continues to grow. Harris has a strong market position with unique technology capabilities in this area. Our FAME solution, short for Full Motion Video Asset Management Engine, offers unequalled performance and scalability as our government customers cope with increasing amounts of digital intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance information. Several FAME systems have been deployed, and we’re receiving positive customer feedback. 
Third, the growth of digital out-of-home advertising continues. Our solutions enable advertisers to reach consumers on the move. New systems will be increasingly deployed to deliver rich media content in live sports and entertainment venues, retail establishments and to mobile handheld devices. 
At the recent Infocom Trade Show, Harris demonstrated an array of innovative digital audio video solutions which integrate digital signage hardware and software, production play out and scheduling systems, multi-viewers and graphic engines. Harris is uniquely positioned to offer end-to-end solutions and services, which enable customers to implement efficient media workflows and create new revenue streams. These market initiatives, along with the broader end market recovery, will drive improved top line revenue and bottom line results in fiscal 2011 and beyond in this segment. Let me now ask Harris' CFO, Gary McArthur, to comment on the financial results in the fourth quarter.

We ended the year with $455 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. We generated $803 million of operating cash flow, $605 million of free cash flow, repurchased $201 million of our outstanding stock and paid $115 million in dividends. None of our outstanding long-term debt comes due prior to October 2015. And as of year-end, we had $720 million available under our $750 million revolving credit facility. Once again, as of year end, our return on invested capital was more than twice our cost of capital and improved nearly 300 basis points to 22% as compared to 19% as of the end of fiscal 2009. 
As to the fourth quarter, cash flow generated from operating activities was $167 million as compared to $262 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, and capital expenditures were $62 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $25 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The $37 million higher CapEx resulted primarily from the continuing build out of our newly acquired cyber security solutions facility, and our RF Communications manufacturing facility. Depreciation and amortization was $45 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $55 million for the fourth quarter of the prior year. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price per share of $46.53. Total shares repurchased during fiscal 2010 were 4.8 million. And as of year end, we have $450 million remaining availability under our $600 million share repurchase program. Our priorities for excess cash continue to be in the order of priority, internal investments, acquisitions that further our strategic objectives and increase shareholder value, the payment of competitive dividends and share repurchases. Our full year tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 33%, slightly lower than forecasted. 
As announced last week, we successfully completed the acquisition of CapRock Communications on July 30 which was funded by $185 million of cash on hand and $340 million of commercial paper, backed by our revolving credit facility. Revised guidance for fiscal 2011 including the impacts from the CapRock acquisition is as follows: Cash flow from operations in a range of $750 million to $800 million, depreciation and amortization of $205 million to $215 million and capital expenditures including capitalized software of $250 million to $275 million. The higher planned capital expenditures as compared to the prior year are primarily a result of the build out of our cyber security solutions facility that is planned to open early next calendar year, the new RF manufacturing facility that is planned to be fully operational in early fiscal 2012 and the additional planned CapEx resulting from the CapRock acquisition. 
Corporate expense is expected to be lower than last year at $86 million, but higher than previously forecasted due to our continued funding of growth initiatives. Interest expense will be $10 million to $15 million higher as a result of the funding for the CapRock acquisition. And finally, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for fiscal year 2011 is expected to be 34%. Back to you, Howard.

Consolidated revenue is now expected to be in",517,"Thank you, Gary. As we indicated in our press release this afternoon, we've increased our financial guidance for fiscal 2011 to include the expected contribution from the CapRock Communications acquisition. 
Consolidated revenue is now expected to be in a range of $5.9 billion to $6 billion, about 13% to 15% higher than fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP income excluding acquisition-related costs is now expected to be in a range of $4.60 to $4.70 per share, representing a year-over-year increase of 4% to 6%. Our previous guidance was $4.55 to $4.65 per share. 
As a result of recent acquisitions and some of the facility investment Gary discussed, we’re seeing an increase in our non-cash amortization and depreciation expenses. We believe that EBITDA growth, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, has become an important metric to track cash profitability improvement alongside of net income and EPS growth. Non-GAAP EBITDA for fiscal 2011, which excludes acquisition-related costs, is expected to be in a range from $1.18 billion to $1.21 billion, and that represents an increase of 7% to 10% above fiscal 2010 EBITDA of $1.10 billion. 
For the RF Communications segment, fiscal 2011 revenue is expected to be 7% to 8% higher than fiscal 2010. Segment operating margin for the year is expected to be about 33%. 
For the Government Communications Systems segment, we expect revenue for fiscal 2011 to be 20% to 22% higher than fiscal 2010. This represents 6% to 8% growth in the existing Government Communications Systems business, and then adds CapRock Communications revenue in a range from $380 million to $390 million for 11 months of fiscal 2011. Segment operating margin is expected to be approximately 11%. 
For the Broadcast Communications segment, we continue to expect revenue in a range of $490 million to $510 million with break-even operating results. We expect to see continued operating losses in the first half of the year with profitability improving in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Finally, let me say a few words about the seasonality of expected fiscal 2011 earnings. We don't normally provide quarterly earnings guidance, but fiscal 2011 seasonality appears to be very atypical. The quarterly distribution of revenue in the RF Communications segment is expected to be heavily front-end loaded in the first fiscal quarter with shipments for the MRAP and M-ATV programs. First quarter RF segment revenue is expected to be about 30% higher than fiscal 2010 with first quarter segment margins of about 39% as a result of favorable product mix and operating efficiencies. Second quarter revenue is expected to be sequentially lower with sequential increases in the third and fourth quarter. So the combined impact of the front-end loading of the RF segment revenue and its related margins is significant on Harris' consolidated earnings. We expect earnings in the first fiscal quarter to be in a range from $1.20 to $1.25 per share. We expect earnings in the second fiscal quarter to be in a range of $0.95 to $1 per share. With that, I will ask the operator to open the line, and we'll be pleased to take your questions.

As I indicated, we have a significant pipeline of opportunities, $2 billion in International for Tactical Comms and $1.5 billion in U.S. DoD for Tactical Comms, and then we talked about a $3 billion opportunity pipeline in Public Safety and Professional Comms. So big pipelines and our internal goal is to maintain and achieve the 1.0 book-to-bill. With regard to any specific accretion on the wireless acquisition, I don't have that number at my fingertips. Certainly, it provided accretion in fiscal '10 as a result of favorable financing rates on the acquisition, and the results we delivered for the acquisition were essentially on target for our expectations that we said at the beginning of the year. We're expecting further growth in fiscal '11, as we had previously indicated about 8% to 10% above fiscal ’10, and we're seeing consistent year-over-year margin expansion, ultimately getting up to the goals that Gary and I have talked about previously in the three- to five-year time frame of 15% kind of operating margins and 20% EBITDA margins for the segments.

The performance of the radios really is speaking for itself in terms of the enabling of real-time broadband communications or wideband communications across the comms networks for the first time, allowing you to have streaming video and other bandwidth-intensive data at the tactical edge in the hands of the war fighter. So I think that the radio’s capability is proving itself real-time on the battlefield, and we think, as a result, it's going to continue to get a lot of attention and the demand for the radios, we think, will continue to grow as well as a result of its performance. There's no better way to prove what it can do than in the kind of tactical battlefield operations that are going on right now.

I'm not sure that the adoption rate will be all that material in our fiscal year '11. But I certainly think that we hope to get several important program wins under our belt and start to demonstrate the value of that broadband communications capability in the 700 megahertz area. We also continue to lobby with other companies to get the FCC to designate that Block D of that spectrum for public safety. That's a little bit of a contentious area right now, because as I understand it, to really deploy the most effective LTE 700 megahertz networks, you really need the 20 megahertz band and only half of that has been allocated. The other half they're planning on auctioning, making available to public safety on a so-called emergency basis, which most of us think is a little problematic how you'd actually do that. So we continue to lobby on that basis, but we agree that we think we've got the right partner in Nokia Siemens and are certainly excited. The opportunity to bring the kind of data to the public safety situational awareness field in the way that we have in the military examples could really make a difference in terms of not only officer safety, but effectiveness. So it's an area of real focus especially in the large metropolitan police departments.

So I think ultimately, that's the floor. Does it come in above that in '11 or '12 or '13? A lot of it has to do with our investment profile. As we've said before, we could meter less investment, deliver more short-term profits but we try and balance that investment relative to the margin and getting the top line growth that we want in terms of continuing to churn out these industry-leading products in the Tactical Comms area and now in the Public Safety area.

Harris ended fiscal 2010 with a very strong quarter. Orders, revenue and income were significantly higher than the prior-year quarter, and we generated significant operating cash flow. Orders were higher than revenue, further increasing our backlog. 
Revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.46 billion. That's 13% higher than the prior year. On an organic basis excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenue was 8% higher. Non-GAAP income, which excludes acquisition-related costs, was $161 million in the fourth quarter or $1.24 per diluted share. That's an increase of 38% compared with the prior-year quarter. Orders in the fourth quarter were $1.72 billion, and that's 33% higher than the prior-year quarter. We saw a continued strong performance in the quarter in the RF Communications segment, as well as strong underlying revenue growth and excellent program execution across the Government Communications Systems segment. 
Our track record of delivering consistent growth in revenue and earnings continued in fiscal 2010, with momentum building as the year progressed. Revenue for the full fiscal year was $5.21 billion, 4% higher than the prior year. Non-GAAP income was $582 million or $4.43 per diluted share. That's an increase of 15% compared with the prior year. Orders for the full year were a record $6.08 billion, 36% higher than fiscal 2009. As a result of the full year book-to-bill of 1.2, we have very strong momentum as we begin fiscal 2011. 
In RF Communications, fourth quarter revenue for the segment was $630 million, 35% higher compared to $468 million in the prior-year quarter. The results included $486 million in revenue in Tactical Communications, up 17% from $415 million in the prior year and $144 million in revenue in Public Safety and Professional Communications. Non-GAAP segment operating income was $227 million compared with $144 million in the prior year. Operating margin was a very strong 36% reflecting favorable product mix and operating efficiencies. 
Fourth quarter orders for the RF segment were $890 million, and that included $711 million for Tactical Communications and $179 million for Public Safety and Professional Communications. For the full fiscal year, orders for the segment were $2.88 billion yielding a 1.4 book-to-bill. And that included $2.34 billion for Tactical Communications and $541 million for Public Safety and Professional Communications. 
As a result of the large amount of new orders, backlog increased significantly in the quarter providing the foundation for continued growth in fiscal 2011 in the RF Communications segment. As of year end, segment backlog stood at $1.76 billion, and that included $1.24 billion in Tactical Communications. Backlog is higher than previously expected due primarily to higher international Tactical Communications orders received in the fourth quarter. Tactical Communications orders continue to be driven by multiple factors including increasing customer adoption of our next-generation Falcon III radios, equipping of new MRAP and M-ATV vehicles and new wins on long-term international communications modernization programs. 
The Harris next-generation Falcon III radios offer both U.S. and international customers unprecedented situational awareness capabilities, including streaming video to the tactical edge of the battlefield for the very first time. Users are reporting that the Falcon III is changing the way they are conducting their missions and is literally saving lives. Major Falcon III orders during the quarter in the U.S. market included $24 million from the Joint Tactical Radio System Program Executive Office for our Falcon III AN/PRC-152 multiband handheld radios for the U.S. Air Force, $20 million and $11 million of orders from the U.S. Department of Defense for Falcon III AN/PRC-117G multiband manpack radio systems, along with $17 million for Falcon III AN/PRC-152 handheld radios. We also received an $11 million order from the U.S. Marine Corps for the Falcon III AN/VRC-110 multiband vehicular radio systems. And also $13 million order and a $27 million order for the Falcon III AN/PRC-152 multiband handheld radios, as well as vehicular adapters to equip those radios into MRAP vehicles. 
Other significant U.S. DoD [Department of Defense] orders included $139 million to provide additional Falcon II high-frequency tactical radio systems and $101 million for Falcon II multiband manpack radios for MRAP vehicles. The Harris MRAP and M-ATV program wins resulted in significant orders and revenue in fiscal 2010, and this program will continue to be a revenue contributor in fiscal 2011, albeit at a lower level. What was really unusual about the M-ATV program was the condensed time frame for its deployment. What would normally have been rolled out over several years is being completed in about 12 months. That's allowed the M-ATV program to be a real showcase for Harris. 
We've demonstrated the advanced capabilities of our Falcon III radios to a large and broad user group across multiple branches of the Services, and we've also demonstrated our ability to respond quickly to the higher demand and also to new user requirements. These abilities are made possible by our unique commercial business model serving this market. Traditional programs of record are not able to respond as we can. Our strategy successfully deploys new technology at the grassroots level, fielding new radios as quick as possible across a broad spectrum of users to encourage further adoption. This strategy continues to be very successful for us. 
While the M-ATV program was certainly significant to our Tactical Radio business, [in] terms of orders and also as a means of reaching this broad user group quickly with our new Falcon III radios, it's important to note that the business also experienced strong orders growth outside of the M-ATV and MRAP programs in both the U.S. and international markets. When you exclude $35 million in M-ATV and MRAP orders in fiscal 2009, and then $1 billion in orders under these programs in fiscal 2010, the remaining tactical radio orders also grew in fiscal 2010 by 15% over the prior year. That was 10% growth in DoD and 21% growth in international. We believe this illustrates that we've clearly got strong momentum outside of just the MRAP programs alone. 
Stronger International orders in the quarter, not only reflected a strengthening global market, but also a significant uptick in customer adoption of our new Falcon III radio family. Major International orders in the quarter included $99 million from the government of Pakistan, for the next phase of comprehensive multilevel C4I system utilizing both Falcon II and Falcon III radios. Also our line of secure personal radios, multiband networking radios and high-capacity line-of-sight radios. 
We also received an $11 million order from another country in Central Asia for both Falcon II and Falcon III radios, orders from two NATO countries totaling $26 million for our Falcon III multiband handheld radios, an $8 million order from a customer in the Middle East to supply Falcon II multiband handheld radios and Falcon III radios, including our secure personal radios and high-capacity line-of-sight systems, and finally, a $33 million order from the government of Iraq for Falcon II HF radios. 
During the quarter, we also announced our new mission modules for the Falcon III AN/PRC-117G manpack multiband radio. The mission modules will provide mission-specific customization and flexibility by enabling users of the 117G to quickly and easily add advanced capabilities to the radio on an as-needed basis. Mission modules expand functionality such as adding a second wideband radio channel, an HF radio channel or an ISR module. In addition to the benefits already mentioned, the mission modules will also allow industry partners to develop new applications that can ride on the 117G through the use of an open platform standard interface architecture. 
The Harris Falcon III 117G offers advanced capabilities today to meet the war fighters' urgent needs, and our new mission modules will ensure the continuous integration of new capabilities to address future requirements. 
In summary, our Tactical Radio business had another very successful year. More importantly, the strong level of new orders that we received did not deplete our future orders opportunity pipeline. It has now been replenished and stands at $2 billion for International and $1.5 billion in the U.S. market. 
The continued investment of our funds for development of additional new products will allow us to continue to outpace the progress of our competitors who are using only government funds to try and achieve the same results. We're listening to the needs of our customers, and we’re investing to solve their problems in the most efficient way possible. We believe this business model becomes even more valuable as customer budgets come under pressure. 
In Public Safety and Professional Communications, our one-year anniversary of acquiring this business occurred in May. As already noted, we had a strong finish to the fiscal year. In spite of constrained state and local budgets, we delivered organic revenue growth in fiscal 2010 of about 7%, and we built backlog going into fiscal 2011. 
During our first year of ownership, we introduced revolutionary new products such as the Unity multiband land mobile radio. We significantly stabilized and improved the operation of a number of networks that are already deployed with our customers, and we had a number of very important long-term large program wins. We also continue to see a robust opportunity pipeline in this business, exceeding $3 billion in North America. 
Major Public Safety and Professional Communication wins in the fourth quarter included a $30 million order to deploy a P25 Trunked Communication System in Monroe County, New York. This system supports 25,000 public service, public safety users. Ultimately, the program will unite all of Monroe County's public service and public safety agencies under a single modern digital communication system that's built on our VIDA IP-based network. The system will interoperate with the legacy law enforcement system, the legacy fire services system and the legacy public service system. 
We also received a $23 million order from a major energy company in the Southwest for our Open Sky voice and data communication system, and a $9 million order from Franklin County, North Carolina, for our P25 communication system and then finally a $5 million order from the New York State Police for our Unity XG-100P multiband radios. 
Revenue in the Government Communications Systems segment was $707 million in the fourth quarter. That compares with $704 million in the prior year. Of course, as expected, revenue from the Field Data Collection Automation program, or FDCA program, for the U.S. Census Bureau's 2010 Census declined about $50 million compared with the prior-year quarter, and it declined about $240 million for the fiscal year in total as the program nears completion. Excluding the FDCA program and also adjusting out for the impact of acquisitions, revenue for fiscal 2010 was 7% higher than the prior year. We think that demonstrates continued strength in the Government Systems and Services businesses. 
Revenue growth in the quarter benefited from multiple programs included the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite Series R ground segment weather program for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. During the quarter, this program completed the System Definition Review. That's a formal technical review of the ground architecture and how it will operate within the overall GOES-R system architecture, and the program established a firm baseline for advancing to the preliminary design phase of the program. 
Other programs contributing to revenue growth included the modernization of enterprise terminals, or MET program for the U.S. Army, the Joint Strike Fighter Program for the Department of Defense and the headquarters relocation IT services program for the U.S. Southern Command. 
Non-GAAP segment operating income in the fourth quarter was $78 million, and that was about flat with the prior-year quarter. Operating margin was a solid 11% for the quarter. We achieved several significant program wins in the fourth quarter, and these included a six-year $97 million contract from the Federal Aviation Administration for its Weather and Radar Maintenance and Sustainment Services II program. The program scope includes software maintenance releases, depot support, on-site field support and engineering services for 22 operational FAA facilities across the U.S.
Harris was also awarded a five-year $140 million contract for the Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment Program for NASA. Pending the resolution of an award protest, Harris will lead the effort to replace equipment and software in the space-to-ground link for NASA's Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System, also known as TDRSS. The SGSS program builds on Harris' 30-year incumbency supporting TDRSS. Harris was a primary developer of the original TDRSS ground system for White Sands in Mexico in the early 1980s and also provided the large deployable antennas on the original TDRSS satellites. 
Harris was also awarded in the quarter a 30-month $25 million IT services contract to modernize and support high-bandwidth networks at 15 Air National Guard sites nationwide. And we also received an award of a $25 million classified program. 
We continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities in our new Healthcare Solutions business. During the quarter, Harris was awarded several new contracts by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. These included a proof of concept study to demonstrate anytime Internet access to veterans’ healthcare information using Smart phones, a development contract to create and implement a new IT project requirements process within the VA and a contract extension to evaluate how the use of emerging technologies can positively impact clinical care. These awards are a result of the company's November 2009 acquisition of Patriot Technologies, a leading provider of healthcare IT, imaging and the enterprise software solutions for the VA. 
And then following the close of the quarter, Harris was awarded a 10-year $130 million contract to supply antennas and control systems for NOAA's GOES-R program. The antennas will provide communications links for command, telemetry and sensor data as well as the communications link to direct data users. 
So we expect solid revenue growth for Government Systems in fiscal 2011 as we continue to benefit from the recent wins on GOES-R, healthcare, NASA and Classified Cyber. We also expect continued growth in our FAA programs and in IT services broadly. The pipeline of opportunities remains very large. Though like many of our peer companies, we are seeing some award dates slipping out in time. We remain confident that our backlog, along with the opportunities to be awarded in fiscal 2011, support our projected growth. 
Last Friday, we announced the closing on our acquisition of CapRock Communications. CapRock is a global provider of mission-critical managed satellite communication services for government, energy and maritime markets. Their highly reliable solutions include broadband Internet access, Voice over IP Telephony, wideband networking and realtime video, all delivered to nearly 2,000 customer sites around the world. The combination of CapRock and Harris will give customers access to a greater breadth of a shared communications capabilities, depth of expertise and unparalleled customer support while enabling us to enter new vertical markets and increase our international presence. 
The Broadcast Communications segment continued to underperform in the fourth quarter. Revenue of $128 million was in line with recent quarters, but fourth quarter orders were sequentially lower at $111 million. Segment operating income was a loss of $21 million in the quarter. This did include $7 million coming from restructuring costs and $6 million coming from inventory write-downs. Fourth quarter results reflected the continued weak U.S. market capital spending trend. 
For the full fiscal 2010, Broadcast Communications revenue declined almost $100 million or 17% from fiscal 2009. The decline was led by $16 million [ph] (0:32:15.9) in lower revenue in our transmission systems product line. 
Significant cost reductions were implemented in 2010 in response to the lower revenue trends, and further actions will be completed in early fiscal 2011. But we cannot rely entirely on cost-reduction actions to deliver improved financial results. 
A new leadership team was put in place in this business in the fourth quarter. We believe that continuing to invest in the growth markets of the future is the right strategy. Although we are investing at a time when the legacy market has continued to decline, this is the means to make this business a long-term success and a positive contributor to the company's future financial results. 
Let me highlight today three growth areas. First, international markets, including the BRIC nations of Brazil, China, India and Russia along with other countries in Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Africa, offer us significant growth opportunities. Their transition from analog to digital broadcasting is still just getting started. There's growing demand for both digital transmission systems and the related infrastructure that goes with it. In response, we recently launched transmitter production at new factories in Brazil and China using manufacturing partners. The regional presence will increase our market share and reduce our product cost. 
The second area is the U.S. government market for full-motion video systems continues to grow. Harris has a strong market position with unique technology capabilities in this area. Our FAME solution, short for Full Motion Video Asset Management Engine, offers unequalled performance and scalability as our government customers cope with increasing amounts of digital intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance information. Several FAME systems have been deployed, and we’re receiving positive customer feedback. 
Third, the growth of digital out-of-home advertising continues. Our solutions enable advertisers to reach consumers on the move. New systems will be increasingly deployed to deliver rich media content in live sports and entertainment venues, retail establishments and to mobile handheld devices. 
At the recent Infocom trade show, Harris demonstrated an array of innovative digital audio video solutions which integrate digital signage hardware and software, production play out and scheduling systems, multi-viewers and graphic engines. Harris is uniquely positioned to offer end-to-end solutions and services, which enable customers to implement efficient media workflows and create new revenue streams. These market initiatives, along with the broader end market recovery, will drive improved top line revenue and bottom line results in fiscal 2011 and beyond in this segment. 
Let me now ask Harris CFO, Gary McArthur, to comment on the financial results in the fourth quarter."

We ended the year with $455 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. We generated $803 million of operating cash flow, $605 million of free cash flow, repurchased $201 million of our outstanding stock and paid $115 million in dividends. None of our outstanding long-term debt comes due prior to October 2015. And as of year-end, we had $720 million available under our $750 million revolving credit facility. Once again, as of year end, our return on invested capital was more than twice our cost of capital and improved nearly 300 basis points to 22% as compared to 19% as of the end of fiscal 2009. 
As to the fourth quarter, cash flow generated from operating activities was $167 million as compared to $262 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, and capital expenditures were $62 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $25 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The $37 million higher CapEx resulted primarily from the continuing build out of our newly acquired cyber security solutions facility, and our RF Communications manufacturing facility. Depreciation and amortization was $45 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $55 million for the fourth quarter of the prior year. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price per share of $46.53. Total shares repurchased during fiscal 2010 were 4.8 million. And as of year end, we have $450 million remaining availability under our $600 million share repurchase program. Our priorities for excess cash continue to be in the order of priority, internal investments, acquisitions that further our strategic objectives and increase shareholder value, the payment of competitive dividends and share repurchases. Our full year tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 33%, slightly lower than forecasted. 
As announced last week, we successfully completed the acquisition of CapRock Communications on July 30 which was funded by $185 million of cash on hand and $340 million of commercial paper, backed by our revolving credit facility. Revised guidance for fiscal 2011 including the impacts from the CapRock acquisition is as follows: Cash flow from operations in a range of $750 million to $800 million, depreciation and amortization of $205 million to $215 million and capital expenditures including capitalized software of $250 million to $275 million. The higher planned capital expenditures as compared to the prior year are primarily a result of the build out of our cyber security solutions facility that is planned to open early next calendar year, the new RF manufacturing facility that is planned to be fully operational in early fiscal 2012 and the additional planned CapEx resulting from the CapRock acquisition. 
Corporate expense is expected to be lower than last year at $86 million, but higher than previously forecasted due to our continued funding of growth initiatives. Interest expense will be $10 million to $15 million higher as a result of the funding for the CapRock acquisition. And finally, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for fiscal year 2011 is expected to be 34%. Back to you, Howard."
177934,109118478,74762,"Harris Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","L3Harris Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. As we indicated in our press release this afternoon, we've increased our financial guidance for fiscal 2011 to include the expected contribution from the CapRock Communications acquisition. Consolidated revenue is now expected to be in",517,"Thank you, Gary. As we indicated in our press release this afternoon, we've increased our financial guidance for fiscal 2011 to include the expected contribution from the CapRock Communications acquisition. 
Consolidated revenue is now expected to be in a range of $5.9 billion to $6 billion, about 13% to 15% higher than fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP income excluding acquisition-related costs is now expected to be in a range of $4.60 to $4.70 per share, representing a year-over-year increase of 4% to 6%. Our previous guidance was $4.55 to $4.65 per share. 
As a result of recent acquisitions and some of the facility investment Gary discussed, we’re seeing an increase in our non-cash amortization and depreciation expenses. We believe that EBITDA growth, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, has become an important metric to track cash profitability improvement alongside of net income and EPS growth. Non-GAAP EBITDA for fiscal 2011, which excludes acquisition-related costs, is expected to be in a range from $1.18 billion to $1.21 billion, and that represents an increase of 7% to 10% above fiscal 2010 EBITDA of $1.10 billion. 
For the RF Communications segment, fiscal 2011 revenue is expected to be 7% to 8% higher than fiscal 2010. Segment operating margin for the year is expected to be about 33%. 
For the Government Communications Systems segment, we expect revenue for fiscal 2011 to be 20% to 22% higher than fiscal 2010. This represents 6% to 8% growth in the existing Government Communications Systems business, and then adds CapRock Communications revenue in a range from $380 million to $390 million for 11 months of fiscal 2011. Segment operating margin is expected to be approximately 11%. 
For the Broadcast Communications segment, we continue to expect revenue in a range of $490 million to $510 million with break-even operating results. We expect to see continued operating losses in the first half of the year with profitability improving in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Finally, let me say a few words about the seasonality of expected fiscal 2011 earnings. We don't normally provide quarterly earnings guidance, but fiscal 2011 seasonality appears to be very atypical. The quarterly distribution of revenue in the RF Communications segment is expected to be heavily front-end loaded in the first fiscal quarter with shipments for the MRAP and M-ATV programs. First quarter RF segment revenue is expected to be about 30% higher than fiscal 2010 with first quarter segment margins of about 39% as a result of favorable product mix and operating efficiencies. Second quarter revenue is expected to be sequentially lower with sequential increases in the third and fourth quarter. So the combined impact of the front-end loading of the RF segment revenue and its related margins is significant on Harris' consolidated earnings. We expect earnings in the first fiscal quarter to be in a range from $1.20 to $1.25 per share. We expect earnings in the second fiscal quarter to be in a range of $0.95 to $1 per share. With that, I will ask the operator to open the line, and we'll be pleased to take your questions."

So big pipelines and our internal goal is to maintain and achieve the 1.0 book-to-bill. With regard to any specific accretion on the wireless acquisition, I don't have that number at my fingertips. Certainly, it provided accretion in fiscal '10 as a result of favorable financing rates on the acquisition, and the results we delivered for the acquisition were essentially on target for our expectations that we said at the beginning of the year. We're expecting further growth in fiscal '11, as we had previously indicated about 8% to 10% above fiscal ’10, and we're seeing consistent year-over-year margin expansion, ultimately getting up to the goals that Gary and I have talked about previously in the three- to five-year time frame of 15% kind of operating margins and 20% EBITDA margins for the segments.

If we look at the seasonality for the rest of the business, it looks a lot more traditional, starting lower and then growing during the year. We had prebuilt a lot of these radios as we have been exiting the fourth quarter of fiscal '10 and so we're seeing this huge uptick in shipments in the first quarter of '11. But I think once you see that pass through as we ship those, we’d expect to get back to more traditional kinds of run rates and so on.

The performance of the radios really is speaking for itself in terms of the enabling of realtime broadband communications or wideband communications across the comms networks for the first time, allowing you to have streaming video and other bandwidth-intensive data at the tactical edge in the hands of the war fighter. So I think that the radio’s capability is proving itself realtime on the battlefield, and we think, as a result, it's going to continue to get a lot of attention and the demand for the radios, we think, will continue to grow as well as a result of its performance.

The other half they're planning on auctioning, making available to public safety on a so-called emergency basis, which most of us think is a little problematic how you'd actually do that. So we continue to lobby on that basis, but we agree that we think we've got the right partner in Nokia Siemens and are certainly excited.

So I think ultimately, that's the floor. Does it come in above that in '11 or '12 or '13? A lot of it has to do with our investment profile. As we've said before, we could meter less investment, deliver more short-term profits but we try and balance that investment relative to the margin and getting the top line growth that we want in terms of continuing to churn out these industry-leading products in the Tactical Comms area and now in the Public Safety area.

With revenue and income significantly higher than the prior year. Excellent financial performance was driven by continuing strong demand, and favorable product mix in our Tactical Radio business. Results in the Public Safety and Professional Communications business were solid. 
And following the end of the quarter, Harris was selected to negotiate a potential contract with the government of Alberta, Canada with their new province-wide radio communication system. This represents a significant multiyear program opportunity for us. In our Government Communication System segment, new program wins as well as additional program scope and follow-on business for existing programs are building a healthy backlog. Even as the government spending environment has become more challenging. And sequential improvement received in our Broadcast Communication segment, which has been negatively impacted by the global recession. 
Consolidated revenue in the first quarter was $1.41 billion, 17% higher than the prior year. On an organic basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenue increased 10%. Non-GAAP income, which excludes acquisition-related cost was $165 million in the first quarter or $1.28 per diluted share. An increase of 56% compared with the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP EBITDA in the first quarter was $318 million, compared with the prior year of $228 million. Consolidated orders in the first quarter were very strong at $1.30 billion, while somewhat lower than the $1.50 billion in the prior quarter. But it also sequentially followed a very large fourth quarter of $1.70 billion in orders. Our recent wins and strong opportunity pipeline have certainly increased our confidence for another strong performance in fiscal 2011, and we expect good momentum when we enter fiscal 2012. 
First quarter revenue for the RF Communication segment was $567 million, that's 34% higher compared to $424 million in the prior year. Operating income was $229 million and operating margin was a very strong 40% due to favorable product mix and operating efficiencies in our business. First quarter orders for the RF segment were $472 million. Tactical Radio Communications revenue was $446 million in the quarter, increased 47% compared with the $303 million in the last year first quarter. Revenue was driven by deliveries on fiscal 2010 orders for equipping MRAPs an M-ATVs. The remaining $18 million in prior-year MRAP and M-ATV orders is expected to ship in our second quarter. 
Tactical Radio Communication orders were $394 million in the quarter, representing a strong book-to-bill of 0.9%. We continue to experience solid demand in the U.S., stronger demand internationally and an uptake in customer adoption of our new Falcon III radio family. We also saw a number of orders for new products. In fact, orders outside of our core tactical radio products represented 26% of orders in the first quarter in total, and 7% of revenue. Additionally, nearly 50% of our orders in the quarter were for less than $5 million, coming from a wide array of U.S. and international customers. We believe further demonstrating the broad-based sustainable global appeal of our product offering. 
International wins in the quarter included three orders totaling $69 million from the government of Pakistan. For the next phase of our comprehensive C4I system, which utilizes Harris Falcon II and Falcon III Tactical Radios, our secure personal radios, our multiband networking radios and high-capacity line of sight radios solutions. Also included a $12 million order for Falcon III high-capacity line of sight radios, and Falcon II HF radios from a country in the Middle East and $14 million and $10 million, respectively in orders to deliver the first Falcon III Type-1 Suite B Handheld Tactical Radios supporting Coalition Forces in the Middle East and is in Central Asia. 
Wins in the U.S. market included $34 million from U.S. Navy, for Falcon III and Falcon II radios, $33 million  for KGV-72, blue force tracking COMSEC terminals, $20 million for AN/PRC 117G vehicular adapters from the U.S. Marine Corps., $15 million from U.S. Army for HF Loop antennas from proofed communications on the move capability and $5 million from the U.S. Army for our RS-7800W high-capacity line of sight radio systems. Also during the quarter, we received a $5 million order for service and support. In fielding, the 117G across all the brigade and combat teams in Afghanistan. Harris employees are working side-by-side with the Army as next-generation mobile, wideband tactical communications networks are deployed, improving situational awareness across the battlefield. 
The 117G with its software-defined architecture, permits war fighters to access the Army wideband tactical Internet. Extending that network to remote commanders and the platoon leaders on the move. This permits war fighters to view convoy reports, understand logistics needs and receive emergency metavac [ph] request and all of these simultaneously. In addition, because of the 117G interfaces to standard IP-based networks, units are able to access web mail and other mission-critical websites. We expect the fielding of the 117G with the brigade combat teams to be completed by the end of the calendar year. 
We also continue to introduce additional Falcon III innovations that add new customer-driven functionality. An example is expanding its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. ISR data and ground tactical communications have previously been handled using separate and often non-interoperable technologies. By combining the two into a single system, ISR video from UAVs can be transmitted in real time to tactical radios operated by ground troops, and the video can be viewed across the entire wideband tactical radio network. This provides troops across the battlefield with real time situational awareness, faster decision-making and more effective and safer operations. 
Our first development incorporated the ROVER waveform into the 117G. This success has led to our latest announcement, a joint development effort between Harris and Cubic Corporation to connect ISR video transmissions using the new TCDL waveform, which provides higher data rates and higher resolution video. Neither of these critical ISR capabilities is specified in the JTRS programs of record radios under development. Harris continues to prove that our commercial business model is significantly faster to market with mission-critical innovations and our pipeline of opportunities remains very strong. And approximately $2 billion in international markets and $1.3 billion in the U.S. market. 
Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue was $121 million in the first quarter and flat with the prior year. Our results certainly impacted by the constrained state and local spending environment. During the quarter, however, we continue to demonstrate strong product and technical offerings that have really positioned this business to continue to gain market share and provide us with long-term growth. 
Several key milestones in the quarter are worth noting. First, we introduced the Harris GR-100 System, a wireless solution that tracks and transmits the location of firefighters and other first responders while they are inside buildings.  Enabling on scene commanders to better coordinate firefighting efforts and monitor their personnel. We also completed the successful test of the nation's first multi-vendor radio communications network utilizing P25 gateways in Dallas-Fort Worth. This first of its kind public safety communication network will provide regional first responders with additional radio coverage and unprecedented interoperability during emergency response situations.
We also announced during the quarter, the introduction of Open Sky II, the second generation of our high performance digital voice and data communications network to be utilized in public safety, utilities, industrial and transportation applications. Open Sky II is a comprehensive enhancement of our network platform that includes improved user services, geographic coverage and audio features. Orders in Public Safety and Professional Communications in the first quarter were $78 million. This included a $14 million order for a new statewide public safety communications network, and $9 million from Ontario County, New York to upgrade its public safety radio communication system with the Harris P25 IP solution. 
And then after the close of the quarter, Harris was selected by the Alberta Canada Solicitor General and Public Security Office as a preferred vendor for design, construction, implementation and operation of the province-wide Alberta First Responders Radio Communications System. Harris is currently engaged in due diligence activities as defined in their request for proposals, or that the contract is subject to successful completion of these activities. Also finalization of the contract documentation and approval of the finalized contract by the Alberta Treasury Board. This communication system will cover 256,000 square miles and will be the critical link among Alberta's first responders.  We still see a $3 billion in Public Safety and Professional Communications pipeline of opportunities, including Alberta. And we expect to deliver our book-to-bill for this business of at least one in fiscal 2011. 
In summary, the RF Communication segment had another very successful quarter. Backlog remains strong at $1.67 billion at quarter end. Including $1.19 billion in Tactical Communications. Global demand for our products remains robust and our investments in new technologies and innovative solutions continue to distinguish us from our competition. Revenue in the Government Communications Systems segment was $736 million in the first quarter, 10% higher compared with $668 million in the prior year. Organic revenue growth was about flat in the quarter due to timing of new program awards, but we expect segment growth to return in the second quarter. We continue to see an organic growth rate for the year of 68%. 
Revenue increased in the quarter on the GOES-R satellite program ground segment and as a result of the recently awarded antenna segment program.  Revenue also benefited from the recent acquisitions of CapRock Communications. Revenue declined in the quarter on several small classified programs and as expected on the Field Data Collection Automation program for the 2010 U.S. Census. Non-GAAP segment operating income in the first quarter was $80 million. Operating margin was strong at 10.9%. This compares with non-GAAP operating income of $86 million in the prior-year quarter, which benefited from award fees related to the FAA telecommunications infrastructure program. 
We achieved several significant program wins in the quarter. This included a 10-year $130 million contract from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to supply antennas and control systems for the GOES-R program. The antennas will provide communication links for command, telemetry and sensor data, as well as a communications link to direct data users. In addition to this award, Harris also received $45 million in additional scope on the GOES-R ground segment program that was awarded to us last year. A $77 million IT services contract was awarded by the U.S. Army material command to provide IT infrastructure and follow-on operations support for the relocation of AMC headquarters to the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama. This is the second major military headquarters relocation contract for Harris. 
The award protest for the five-year $140 million Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment program for NASA that was awarded last year has been favorably result. Harris will lead the replacement of equipment and software in this space to ground link for NASA's tracking and data relay satellite system. Other significant awards in the quarter included a $55 million scope expansion on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Avionics program. A $64 option year award for the U.S. Air Force network and Space Operations and Maintenance Program and a $40 million option year order for the Department of State Consular Affairs Support Services, IT contract. 
Following the close of the quarter, Harris was awarded a nine-year potential $273 million Canadian follow-on contract from the government of Canada, for the CF 18 Optimized Weapon Systems Support program. Harris will provide engineering services to support avionic systems on Canada's fighter aircraft. 
Harris healthcare solutions continued its progress with $33 million in new awards during the quarter. The Nationwide Health Information Network-Connect project for the Department of Health and Human Services also received this prestigious Wall Street Journal, Technology Innovation for Healthcare IT Award. Connect was cited for its broad impact on the adoption of electronic, healthcare information exchanges between federal agencies and healthcare providers. Used to efficiently and securely transfer patient information, improving the quality of care, accelerating access to benefits while also reducing costs. 
We are also very excited about the formal launch of our joint venture with leading Middle East telecommunications systems security provider, Atlas Telecom. Harris Atlas based in Abu Dhabi and the United Arab Emirates will deliver innovative intelligent solutions including enhanced video management and geospatial 3D visualization. The venture will focus on delivery of large-scale, mission-critical intelligence and communications systems in the region. 
On July 30, we completed the acquisition of CapRock Communications. CapRock is a leading global provider of managed satellite communication services, serving the energy, government and maritime industries. CapRock contributed $65 million to first quarter revenue and scored significant wins. We continue to foster a new opportunities within the U.S. government and the lifting of the drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico could provide additional opportunities. 
During the quarter, Harris CapRock was awarded four contracts totaling $43 million to provide managed network services and over 400 megahertz, commercial satellite capacity to four separate U.S. government agencies. These contracts run through 2013 and include requirements for bandwidth, teleport and backhaul services on KU and expand networks. These services will be used to support a range of missions including airborne ISR, tactical field deployed communications and continuity of operations. 
In the Broadcast Communication segment, revenue in the first quarter was $122 million compared with the prior-year quarter of $119 million. The segment operating loss was $9 million included $1 million of restructuring costs. Orders were stronger and grew in the quarter to $135 million, compared with the prior year of $124 million and $111 million in the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter. Results in the segment continue to reflect market weakness in the traditional U.S. broadcast capital spending market. And also included are ongoing increased investments in sales and marketing to address new media and international growth opportunities. The 1.1 book-to-bill ratio in the quarter, along with year-over-year revenue growth are both encouraging signs for the segment. 
During the quarter, Harris was awarded $8 million from Nine Network Australia for a new play out center which includes our servers, multi-viewers, routers, digital asset management and automation software. Other major awards in the quarter included $4 million from the TPBS Thailand for Harris Integrated Broadcast Systems which encompasses the entire workflow for the customer from in just through content management and play out. A $2.5 million order from Network Seven (sic) [Seven Network] in Australia for an end-to-end file-based play out center for their Melbourne board operations. And $2.5 million order from Saudi Television for TV and radio transmission sites and HD production studios. 
Another exciting event in the quarter was the inauguration of the in-arena broadcast network at the Amway Center Orlando, home of the National Basketball Association's Orlando Magic. Harris took part in a ceremony to officially open the new facility, unveiling the most technologically advanced arena in North America. The Harris solution is a unique convergence of IP and broad-based technology that provides an entirely new streamlined workflow system. It also provides fans with an exceptional multimedia event experience, and offers access to new advertising revenue streams going forward.

Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $341 million, strong collections in the quarter drove down day sales outstanding from 54 days to 48, debt-to-total-capital remained about the same at 39% and return on invested capital as a result of the very strong operating performance increased from 18% to 22%, all as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2010. 
During the quarter, we established a $300 million 364 day revolving credit facility to replace the capacity used for the purchase of CapRock Communications, which closed on July 30. Cash flow in the quarter was excellent. Cash flow generated from operating activities was $295 million, as compared to $135 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. All three operating segments generated positive cash flow. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $254 million as compared to $114 million. Our increased guidance for cash flow from operations for fiscal 2011 is now a range of $775 million to $825 million, up from our previous guidance of $750 million to $800 million. During the quarter, we repurchased $50 million of our outstanding common stock and an average purchase price of $42.59 per share. As of quarter end, we have $400 million remaining authorization under our stock repurchase program. 
Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $47 million as compared to $42 million in the first quarter of the prior year. Our expectations for depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 2011 are unchanged at $205 million to $215 million. Capital expenditures were $41 million for the first quarter, as compared to $21 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. 
Our current guidance for fiscal year 2011 CapEx is unchanged between $250 million and $275 million. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 34.8%, our outlook for the full year tax rate for fiscal 2011 assuming the R&D tax credit is passed is now 33.5%, down from our previous guidance of 34%. Again noting, however, that the tax rate for any given quarter could vary up or down as a result of discrete tax events. In summary, we are off to a very good start and continue to operate from a very strong financial foundation. Back to you, Howard."

We have increased our financial guidance for fiscal year 2011 due to our strong first quarter operating performance, and improving second quarter outlook. Consolidated revenue for fiscal 2011 is now expected to be towards the higher end of our previous range of $5.9 billion to $6 billion, about 15% above fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP EBITDA for fiscal 2011, which excludes acquisition-related cost is expected to be in a range of $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion, representing an increase of 10% to 12% above our fiscal 2010 EBITDA of $1.10 billion. Non-GAAP income excluding acquisition-related cost is now expected to be in the range from $4.80 to $4.90 per diluted share, that's a year-over-year increase of 8% to 11%. Our previous guidance if you recall was $4.60 to $4.70 per share. 
On our last call, we provided quarterly guidance for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2011 because of the atypical seasonality caused by the MRAP and M-ATV program shipments being concentrated mostly on the first quarter. Earnings in the second quarter are now expected to be in the range of $1.8 to $1.12 per share. Slightly above last year and much higher than our previous guidance. And we expect sequential EPS growth in the back half of fiscal 2011. 
For the RF Communication segment, fiscal 2011 revenue is now expected to be 10% to 11% higher than fiscal 2010, and 16% to 17% higher in the second quarter. Segment operating margin for the year is expected to be 33% to 34%. For the Government Communications Systems segment, guidance is unchanged. We expect revenue for fiscal 2011 to be 20% to 22% higher than fiscal 2010. This represents 6% to 8% growth in the existing Government Communications Systems business and then we add 11 months of contribution of CapRock Communications acquisition revenue in the range of $380 million to $390 million. 
Total segment operating margin is expected to be approximately 11% for the fiscal year. And for the Broadcast Communication segment, we continue to expect revenue in the range of $490 million to $510 million with breakeven operating results. We still expect operating losses in the first half, but they will be followed, we believe by improving profitability in the second half. At this time, I'll ask the operator to open the line and we'll be pleased to take your questions."

In terms of specifically guiding to a specific book-to-bill by quarter, I'm not going to go there but overall, we're still feeling good for the year. It doesn't mean it's a slam dunk but what it does mean is that we have the opportunities in sight and are pursuing them. And as long as we get a good fortune and timing in Q4 this year versus Q1 next year, I think we've got a very good shot at getting there. Even if we just came close, we're talking about still a sizable backlog exiting this year into fiscal '12. So I think the good news of the first quarter and our higher guidance in the second quarter is all about the firming up of the order pipeline at RF this year and our confidence in delivering on that."

So this is certainly a significant project. Competition was certainly the Motorola, the market leader. We're very pleased our team put together a very, very good proposal and we are looking forward to completing these negotiations. How long that will take? I'm not sure that but it's not uncommon for that to run on for a quarter or two. So we could be talking about not finalizing this until the new calendar year.

That's a major achievement. We have received also, as I mentioned, a contract to put a number of our team members in country helping to deploy and set up these networks.

Harris first quarter results were very strong with revenue and income significantly higher than the prior year. Excellent financial performance was driven by continuing strong demand, and favorable product mix in our Tactical Radio business. Results in the Public Safety and Professional Communications business were solid. 
And following the end of the quarter, Harris was selected to negotiate a potential contract with the government of Alberta, Canada with their new province-wide radio communication system. This represents a significant multi-year program opportunity for us. In our Government Communication Systems segment, new program wins as well as additional program scope and follow-on business for existing programs are building a healthy backlog even as the government spending environment has become more challenging. And sequential improvement was seen in our Broadcast Communication segment, which has been negatively impacted by the global recession. 
Consolidated revenue in the first quarter was $1.41 billion, 17% higher than the prior year. On an organic basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenue increased 10%. Non-GAAP income, which excludes acquisition-related costs was $165 million in the first quarter or $1.28 per diluted share. An increase of 56% compared with the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP EBITDA in the first quarter was $318 million, compared with the prior year of $228 million. Consolidated orders in the first quarter were very strong at $1.30 billion. While somewhat lower than the $1.50 billion in the prior quarter, but it also sequentially followed a very large fourth quarter of $1.70 billion in orders. Our recent wins and strong opportunity pipeline have certainly increased our confidence for another strong performance in fiscal 2011, and we expect good momentum when we enter fiscal 2012. 
First quarter revenue for the RF Communication segment was $567 million, that's 34% higher compared to $424 million in the prior year. Operating income was $229 million and operating margin was a very strong 40% due to favorable product mix and operating efficiencies in our business. First quarter orders for the RF segment were $472 million. Tactical Radio Communications revenue was $446 million in the quarter, increased 47% compared with the $303 million in the last-year first quarter. Revenue was driven by deliveries on fiscal 2010 orders for equipping MRAPs and M-ATVs. The remaining $80 million in prior-year MRAP and M-ATV orders is expected to ship in our second quarter. 
Tactical Radio Communications orders were $394 million in the quarter, representing a strong book-to-bill of 0.9%. We continue to experience solid demand in the U.S., stronger demand internationally and an uptake in customer adoption of our new Falcon III radio family. We also saw a number of orders for new products. In fact, orders outside of our core tactical radio products represented 26% of orders in the first quarter in total, and 7% of revenue. Additionally, nearly 50% of our orders in the quarter were for less than $5 million, coming from a wide array of U.S. and international customers. We believe further demonstrating the broad-based sustainable global appeal of our product offering. 
International wins in the quarter included three orders totalling $69 million from the government of Pakistan. For the next phase of our comprehensive C4I system, which utilizes Harris Falcon II and Falcon III Tactical Radios, our secure personal radios, our multiband networking radios and high-capacity line of sight radio solutions. Also included a $12 million order for Falcon III high-capacity line of sight radios, and Falcon II HF radios from a country in the Middle East and $14 million and $10 million, respectively in orders to deliver the first Falcon III Type-1 Suite B Handheld Tactical Radios supporting Coalition Forces in the Middle East and is in Central Asia. 
Wins in the U.S. market included $34 million from the U.S. Navy, for Falcon III and Falcon II radios, $33 million  for KGV-72, blue force tracking COMSEC terminals, $20 million for AN/PRC-117G vehicular adapters from the U.S. Marine Corps., $15 million from the U.S. Army for HF Loop antennas for improved communications on the move capability and $5 million from the U.S. Army for our RF-7800W high-capacity line-of-sight radio systems. Also during the quarter, we received a $5 million order for service and support in fielding the 117G across all the brigade and combat teams in Afghanistan. Harris employees are working side-by-side with the Army as next-generation mobile, wideband tactical communications networks are deployed, improving situational awareness across the battlefield. 
The 117G with its software-defined architecture, permits war fighters to access the Army wideband tactical Internet extending that network to remote commanders and platoon leaders on the move. This permits war fighters to view convoy reports, understand logistics needs and receive emergency medevac requests and all of these simultaneously. In addition, because of the 117G interfaces to standard IP-based networks, units are able to access webmail and other mission-critical websites. We expect the fielding of the 117G with the brigade combat teams to be completed by the end of the calendar year. 
We also continue to introduce additional Falcon III innovations that add new customer-driven functionality. An example is expanding its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. ISR data and ground tactical communications have previously been handled using separate and often non-interoperable technologies. By combining the two into a single system, ISR video from UAVs can be transmitted in real time to tactical radios operated by ground troops, and the video can be viewed across the entire wideband tactical radio network. This provides troops across the battlefield with real-time situational awareness, faster decision-making and more effective and safer operations. 
Our first development incorporated the ROVER waveform into the 117G. This success has led to our latest announcement, a joint development effort between Harris and Cubic Corporation to connect ISR video transmissions using the new TCDL waveform, which provides higher data rates and higher resolution video. Neither of these critical ISR capabilities is specified in the JTRS programs of record radios under development. Harris continues to prove that our commercial business model is significantly faster to market with mission-critical innovations and our pipeline of opportunities remains very strong at approximately $2 billion in international markets and $1.3 billion in the U.S. market. 
Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue was $121 million in the first quarter and flat with the prior year. Our results certainly impacted by the constrained state and local spending environment. During the quarter, however, we continue to demonstrate strong product and technical offerings that have really positioned this business to continue to gain market share and provide us with long-term growth. 
Several key milestones in the quarter are worth noting. First, we introduced the Harris GR-100 System, a wireless solution that tracks and transmits the location of firefighters and other first responders while they are inside buildings enabling on scene commanders to better coordinate firefighting efforts and monitor their personnel. We also completed the successful test of the nation's first multi-vendor radio communications network utilizing P25 gateways in Dallas-Fort Worth. This first of its kind public safety communication network will provide regional first responders with additional radio coverage and unprecedented interoperability during emergency response situations.
We also announced during the quarter, the introduction of Open Sky II, the second generation of our high performance digital voice and data communications network to be utilized in public safety, utilities, industrial and transportation applications. Open Sky II is a comprehensive enhancement of our network platform that includes improved user services, geographic coverage and audio features. Orders in Public Safety and Professional Communications in the first quarter were $78 million. This included a $14 million order for a new state-wide public safety communications network, and $9 million from Ontario County, New York to upgrade its public safety radio communication system with the Harris P25 IP solution. 
And then after the close of the quarter, Harris was selected by the Alberta Canada Solicitor General and Public Security Office as a preferred vendor for the design, construction, implementation and operation of the province-wide Alberta First Responders Radio Communications System. Harris is currently engaged in due diligence activities as defined in their request for proposals. A word that the contract is subject to successful completion of these activities, also finalization of the contract documentation and approval of the finalized contract by the Alberta Treasury Board. This communication system will cover 256,000 square miles and will be the critical link among Alberta's first responders.  We still see a $3 billion in Public Safety and Professional Communications pipeline of opportunities, including Alberta. And we expect to deliver our book-to-bill for this business of at least one in fiscal 2011. 
In summary, the RF Communication segment had another very successful quarter. Backlog remains strong at $1.67 billion at quarter end, including $1.19 billion in Tactical Communications. Global demand for our products remains robust and our investments in new technologies and innovative solutions continue to distinguish us from our competition. 
Revenue in the Government Communications Systems segment was $736 million in the first quarter, 10% higher compared with $668 million in the prior year. Organic revenue growth was about flat in the quarter due to timing of new program awards, but we expect segment growth to return in the second quarter. We continue to see an organic growth rate for the year of 6% to 8%. 
Revenue increased in the quarter on the GOES-R satellite program ground segment and as a result of the recently awarded antenna segment program.  Revenue also benefited from the recent acquisitions of CapRock Communications. Revenue declined in the quarter on several small classified programs and as expected on the Field Data Collection Automation program for the 2010 U.S. Census. Non-GAAP segment operating income in the first quarter was $80 million. Operating margin was strong at 10.9%. This compares with non-GAAP operating income of $86 million in the prior-year quarter, which benefited from award fees related to the FAA telecommunications infrastructure program. 
We achieved several significant program wins in the quarter. These included a 10-year $130 million contract from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to supply antennas and control systems for the GOES-R program. The antennas will provide communication links for command, telemetry and sensor data, as well as a communications link to direct data users. In addition to this award, Harris also received $45 million in additional scope on the GOES-R ground segment program that was awarded to us last year. A $77 million IT services contract was awarded by the U.S. Army material command to provide IT infrastructure and follow-on operations support for the relocation of AMC headquarters to the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama. This is the second major military headquarters relocation contract for Harris. 
The award protest for the five-year $140 million Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment program for NASA that was awarded last year has been favorably resolved. Harris will lead the replacement of equipment and software in this space-to-ground link for NASA's tracking and data relay satellite system. Other significant awards in the quarter included a $55 million scope expansion on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Avionics program, a $64 million option year award for the U.S. Air Force network and Space Operations and Maintenance Program and a $40 million option year award for the Department of State Consular Affairs Support Services, IT contract. 
Following the close of the quarter, Harris was awarded a nine-year potential $273 million Canadian follow-on contract from the government of Canada, for the CF-18 Optimized Weapon Support program. Harris will provide engineering services to support avionic systems on Canada's fighter aircraft. 
Harris Healthcare Solutions continued its progress with $33 million in new awards during the quarter. The Nationwide Health Information Network-Connect project for the Department of Health and Human Services also received the prestigious Wall Street Journal, Technology Innovation for Healthcare IT Award. Connect was cited for its broad impact on the adoption of electronic healthcare information exchanges between federal agencies and healthcare providers used to efficiently and securely transfer patient information, improving the quality of care, accelerating access to benefits while also reducing costs. 
We are also very excited about the formal launch of our joint venture with leading Middle East telecommunications systems security provider, Atlas Telecom. Harris Atlas based in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates will deliver innovative intelligent solutions including enhanced video management and geospatial 3D visualization. The venture will focus on delivery of large-scale, mission-critical intelligence and communications systems in the region. 
On July 30, we completed the acquisition of CapRock Communications. CapRock is a leading global provider of managed satellite communication services, serving the energy, government and maritime industries. CapRock contributed $65 million to first quarter revenue and scored significant wins. We continue to foster new opportunities within the U.S. government and the lifting of the drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico could provide additional opportunities. 
During the quarter, Harris CapRock was awarded four contracts totalling $43 million to provide managed network services and over 400 megahertz commercial satellite capacity to four separate U.S. government agencies. These contracts run through 2013 and include requirements for bandwidth, teleport and backhaul services on KU and expand networks. These services will be used to support a range of missions including airborne ISR, tactical field deployed communications and continuity of operations. 
In the Broadcast Communication segment, revenue in the first quarter was $122 million compared with the prior-year quarter of $119 million. The segment operating loss was $9 million included $1 million of restructuring costs. Orders were stronger and grew in the quarter to $135 million, compared with the prior year of $124 million and $111 million in the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter. Results in the segment continue to reflect market weakness in the traditional U.S. broadcast capital spending market. And also included are ongoing increased investments in sales and marketing to address new media and international growth opportunities. The 1.1 book-to-bill ratio in the quarter, along with year-over-year revenue growth are both encouraging signs for the segment.  
During the quarter, Harris was awarded $8 million from Nine Network Australia for a new play out center which includes our servers, multi-viewers, routers, digital asset management and automation software. Other major awards in the quarter included $4 million from TPBS Thailand for Harris Integrated Broadcast Systems which encompasses the entire workflow for the customer from in just through content management and play out. A $2.5 million order from Network Seven (sic) [Seven Network] in Australia for an end-to-end file-based play out center for their Melbourne operations. And $2.5 million order from Saudi Television for TV and radio transmission sites and HD production studios. 
Another exciting event in the quarter was the inauguration of the in-arena broadcast network at the Amway Center in Orlando, home of the National Basketball Association's Orlando Magic. Harris took part in a ceremony to officially open the new facility, unveiling the most technologically advanced arena in North America. The Harris solution is a unique convergence of IP and broad-based technology that provides an entirely new streamlined workflow system. It also provides fans with an exceptional multimedia event experience, and offers access to new advertising revenue streams going forward. 
Let me now ask Gary McArthur, Harris' CFO to comment on our financial results in the quarter."

During the quarter, we established a $300 million 364 day revolving credit facility to replace the capacity used for the purchase of CapRock Communications, which closed on July 30. Cash flow in the quarter was excellent. Cash flow generated from operating activities was $295 million, as compared to $135 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. All three operating segments generated positive cash flow. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $254 million as compared to $114 million. Our increased guidance for cash flow from operations for fiscal 2011 is now a range of $775 million to $825 million, up from our previous guidance of $750 million to $800 million. During the quarter, we repurchased $50 million of our outstanding common stock at an average purchase price of $42.59 per share. As of quarter end, we have $400 million remaining authorization under our stock repurchase program. 
Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $47 million as compared to $42 million in the first quarter of the prior year. Our expectations for depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 2011 are unchanged at $205 million to $215 million. Capital expenditures were $41 million for the first quarter, as compared to $21 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Our current guidance for fiscal year 2011 CapEx is unchanged at between $250 million and $275 million. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 34.8%, our outlook for the full year tax rate for fiscal 2011 assuming the R&D tax credit is passed is now 33.5%, down from our previous guidance of 34%. Again noting, however, that the tax rate for any given quarter could vary up or down as a result of discrete tax events. In summary, we are off to a very good start and continue to operate from a very strong financial foundation. Back to you, Howard."

We have increased our financial guidance for fiscal year 2011 due to our strong first quarter operating performance, and improving second quarter outlook. Consolidated revenue for fiscal 2011 is now expected to be towards the higher end of our previous range of $5.9 billion to $6 billion, about 15% above fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP EBITDA for fiscal 2011, which excludes acquisition-related costs is expected to be in a range of $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion, representing an increase of 10% to 12% above our fiscal 2010 EBITDA of $1.10 billion. Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related costs, is now expected to be in the range from $4.80 to $4.90 per diluted share. That's a year-over-year increase of 8% to 11%. Our previous guidance if you recall was $4.60 to $4.70 per share. 
On our last call, we provided quarterly guidance for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2011 because of the atypical seasonality caused by the MRAP and M-ATV program shipments being concentrated mostly in the first quarter. Earnings in the second quarter are now expected to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.12 per share. Slightly above last year and much higher than our previous guidance and we expect sequential EPS growth in the back half of fiscal 2011. 
For the RF Communication segment, fiscal 2011 revenue is now expected to be 10% to 11% higher than fiscal 2010, and 16% to 17% higher in the second quarter. Segment operating margin for the year is expected to be 33% to 34%. For the Government Communications Systems segment, guidance is unchanged. We expect revenue for fiscal 2011 to be 20% to 22% higher than fiscal 2010. This represents 6% to 8% growth in the existing Government Communications Systems business and then we add 11 months of contribution of CapRock Communications acquisition revenue in the range of $380 million to $390 million. 
Total segment operating margin is expected to be approximately 11% for the fiscal year. And for the Broadcast Communication segment, we continue to expect revenue in the range of $490 million to $510 million with break-even operating results. We still expect operating losses in the first half, but they will be followed, we believe by improving profitability in the second half.

And as long as we get a little good fortune in timing in Q4 this year versus Q1 next year, I think we've got a very good shot at getting there. Even if we just came close, though, we're talking about still a sizable backlog exiting this year into fiscal '12. So I think the good news of the first quarter and our higher guidance in the second quarter is all about the firming up of the order pipeline at RF this year and our confidence in delivering on that."

So there's not a specific size, but I think you can draw a conclusion that this is a multi-year, very large program given the amount of real estate that is covered by the province of Alberta, over 250,000 square miles. So this is certainly a significant project. Competition was certainly Motorola, the market leader. We're very pleased our team put together a very, very good proposal and we are looking forward to completing these negotiations. How long that will take? I'm not sure but it's not uncommon for that to run on for a quarter or two. So we could be talking about not finalizing this until the new calendar year. But it certainly should be, we hope in this fiscal year, and help to bolster our orders and backlog and then provide a multi-year stream of revenue and profitability as we execute the program. So certainly it's a major win and we're very proud of our team for delivering that."

That's a major achievement. We have received also, as I mentioned, a contract to put a number of our team members in country helping to deploy and set up these networks. And we're convinced, like many major new innovations, as our customers start to use the radios it's going to have a follow-on compounding effect in terms of broader adoption, not just in Afghanistan but over the long-term. So from our perspective, we think it's a major milestone and we're in the process, I don't know probably, 30%, 40% of the way through getting these systems up and running.

Harris first quarter results were very strong with revenue and income significantly higher than the prior year. Excellent financial performance was driven by continuing strong demand, and favorable product mix in our Tactical Radio business. Results in the Public Safety and Professional Communications business were solid. 
And following the end of the quarter, Harris was selected to negotiate a potential contract with the government of Alberta, Canada with their new province-wide radio communication system. This represents a significant multi-year program opportunity for us. In our Government Communication Systems segment, new program wins as well as additional program scope and follow-on business for existing programs are building a healthy backlog even as the government spending environment has become more challenging. And sequential improvement was seen in our Broadcast Communication segment, which has been negatively impacted by the global recession. 
Consolidated revenue in the first quarter was $1.41 billion, 17% higher than the prior year. On an organic basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenue increased 10%. Non-GAAP income, which excludes acquisition-related costs was $165 million in the first quarter or $1.28 per diluted share. An increase of 56% compared with the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP EBITDA in the first quarter was $318 million, compared with the prior year of $228 million. Consolidated orders in the first quarter were very strong at $1.30 billion. While somewhat lower than the $1.50 billion in the prior quarter, but it also sequentially followed a very large fourth quarter of $1.70 billion in orders. Our recent wins and strong opportunity pipeline have certainly increased our confidence for another strong performance in fiscal 2011, and we expect good momentum when we enter fiscal 2012. 
First quarter revenue for the RF Communication segment was $567 million, that's 34% higher compared to $424 million in the prior year. Operating income was $229 million and operating margin was a very strong 40% due to favorable product mix and operating efficiencies in our business. First quarter orders for the RF segment were $472 million. Tactical Radio Communications revenue was $446 million in the quarter, increased 47% compared with the $303 million in the last-year first quarter. Revenue was driven by deliveries on fiscal 2010 orders for equipping MRAPs and M-ATVs. The remaining $80 million in prior-year MRAP and M-ATV orders is expected to ship in our second quarter. 
Tactical Radio Communications orders were $394 million in the quarter, representing a strong book-to-bill of 0.9%. We continue to experience solid demand in the U.S., stronger demand internationally and an uptake in customer adoption of our new Falcon III radio family. We also saw a number of orders for new products. In fact, orders outside of our core tactical radio products represented 26% of orders in the first quarter in total, and 7% of revenue. Additionally, nearly 50% of our orders in the quarter were for less than $5 million, coming from a wide array of U.S. and international customers. We believe further demonstrating the broad-based sustainable global appeal of our product offering. 
International wins in the quarter included three orders totalling $69 million from the government of Pakistan. For the next phase of our comprehensive C4I system, which utilizes Harris Falcon II and Falcon III Tactical Radios, our secure personal radios, our multiband networking radios and high-capacity line of sight radio solutions. Also included a $12 million order for Falcon III high-capacity line of sight radios, and Falcon II HF radios from a country in the Middle East and $14 million and $10 million, respectively in orders to deliver the first Falcon III Type-1 Suite B Handheld Tactical Radios supporting Coalition Forces in the Middle East and is in Central Asia. 
Wins in the U.S. market included $34 million from the U.S. Navy, for Falcon III and Falcon II radios, $33 million  for KGV-72, blue force tracking COMSEC terminals, $20 million for AN/PRC-117G vehicular adapters from the U.S. Marine Corps., $15 million from the U.S. Army for HF Loop antennas for improved communications on the move capability and $5 million from the U.S. Army for our RF-7800W high-capacity line-of-sight radio systems. Also during the quarter, we received a $5 million order for service and support in fielding the 117G across all the brigade and combat teams in Afghanistan. Harris employees are working side-by-side with the Army as next-generation mobile, wideband tactical communications networks are deployed, improving situational awareness across the battlefield. 
The 117G with its software-defined architecture, permits war fighters to access the Army wideband tactical Internet extending that network to remote commanders and platoon leaders on the move. This permits war fighters to view convoy reports, understand logistics needs and receive emergency medevac requests and all of these simultaneously. In addition, because of the 117G interfaces to standard IP-based networks, units are able to access webmail and other mission-critical websites. We expect the fielding of the 117G with the brigade combat teams to be completed by the end of the calendar year. 
We also continue to introduce additional Falcon III innovations that add new customer-driven functionality. An example is expanding its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. ISR data and ground tactical communications have previously been handled using separate and often non-interoperable technologies. By combining the two into a single system, ISR video from UAVs can be transmitted in real time to tactical radios operated by ground troops, and the video can be viewed across the entire wideband tactical radio network. This provides troops across the battlefield with real-time situational awareness, faster decision-making and more effective and safer operations. 
Our first development incorporated the ROVER waveform into the 117G. This success has led to our latest announcement, a joint development effort between Harris and Cubic Corporation to connect ISR video transmissions using the new TCDL waveform, which provides higher data rates and higher resolution video. Neither of these critical ISR capabilities is specified in the JTRS programs of record radios under development. Harris continues to prove that our commercial business model is significantly faster to market with mission-critical innovations and our pipeline of opportunities remains very strong at approximately $2 billion in international markets and $1.3 billion in the U.S. market. 
Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue was $121 million in the first quarter and flat with the prior year. Our results certainly impacted by the constrained state and local spending environment. During the quarter, however, we continue to demonstrate strong product and technical offerings that have really positioned this business to continue to gain market share and provide us with long-term growth. 
Several key milestones in the quarter are worth noting. First, we introduced the Harris GR-100 System, a wireless solution that tracks and transmits the location of firefighters and other first responders while they are inside buildings enabling on scene commanders to better coordinate firefighting efforts and monitor their personnel. We also completed the successful test of the nation's first multi-vendor radio communications network utilizing P25 gateways in Dallas-Fort Worth. This first of its kind public safety communication network will provide regional first responders with additional radio coverage and unprecedented interoperability during emergency response situations.
We also announced during the quarter, the introduction of Open Sky II, the second generation of our high performance digital voice and data communications network to be utilized in public safety, utilities, industrial and transportation applications. Open Sky II is a comprehensive enhancement of our network platform that includes improved user services, geographic coverage and audio features. Orders in Public Safety and Professional Communications in the first quarter were $78 million. This included a $14 million order for a new state-wide public safety communications network, and $9 million from Ontario County, New York to upgrade its public safety radio communication system with the Harris P25 IP solution. 
And then after the close of the quarter, Harris was selected by the Alberta Canada Solicitor General and Public Security Office as a preferred vendor for the design, construction, implementation and operation of the province-wide Alberta First Responders Radio Communications System. Harris is currently engaged in due diligence activities as defined in their request for proposals. A word that the contract is subject to successful completion of these activities, also finalization of the contract documentation and approval of the finalized contract by the Alberta Treasury Board. This communication system will cover 256,000 square miles and will be the critical link among Alberta's first responders.  We still see a $3 billion in Public Safety and Professional Communications pipeline of opportunities, including Alberta. And we expect to deliver our book-to-bill for this business of at least one in fiscal 2011. 
In summary, the RF Communication segment had another very successful quarter. Backlog remains strong at $1.67 billion at quarter end, including $1.19 billion in Tactical Communications. Global demand for our products remains robust and our investments in new technologies and innovative solutions continue to distinguish us from our competition. 
Revenue in the Government Communications Systems segment was $736 million in the first quarter, 10% higher compared with $668 million in the prior year. Organic revenue growth was about flat in the quarter due to timing of new program awards, but we expect segment growth to return in the second quarter. We continue to see an organic growth rate for the year of 6% to 8%. 
Revenue increased in the quarter on the GOES-R satellite program ground segment and as a result of the recently awarded antenna segment program.  Revenue also benefited from the recent acquisitions of CapRock Communications. Revenue declined in the quarter on several small classified programs and as expected on the Field Data Collection Automation program for the 2010 U.S. Census. Non-GAAP segment operating income in the first quarter was $80 million. Operating margin was strong at 10.9%. This compares with non-GAAP operating income of $86 million in the prior-year quarter, which benefited from award fees related to the FAA telecommunications infrastructure program. 
We achieved several significant program wins in the quarter. These included a 10-year $130 million contract from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to supply antennas and control systems for the GOES-R program. The antennas will provide communication links for command, telemetry and sensor data, as well as a communications link to direct data users. In addition to this award, Harris also received $45 million in additional scope on the GOES-R ground segment program that was awarded to us last year. A $77 million IT services contract was awarded by the U.S. Army material command to provide IT infrastructure and follow-on operations support for the relocation of AMC headquarters to the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama. This is the second major military headquarters relocation contract for Harris. 
The award protest for the five-year $140 million Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment program for NASA that was awarded last year has been favorably resolved. Harris will lead the replacement of equipment and software in this space-to-ground link for NASA's tracking and data relay satellite system. Other significant awards in the quarter included a $55 million scope expansion on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Avionics program, a $64 million option year award for the U.S. Air Force network and Space Operations and Maintenance Program and a $40 million option year award for the Department of State Consular Affairs Support Services, IT contract. 
Following the close of the quarter, Harris was awarded a nine-year potential $273 million Canadian follow-on contract from the government of Canada, for the CF-18 Optimized Weapon Support program. Harris will provide engineering services to support avionic systems on Canada's fighter aircraft. 
Harris Healthcare Solutions continued its progress with $33 million in new awards during the quarter. The Nationwide Health Information Network-Connect project for the Department of Health and Human Services also received the prestigious Wall Street Journal, Technology Innovation for Healthcare IT Award. Connect was cited for its broad impact on the adoption of electronic healthcare information exchanges between federal agencies and healthcare providers used to efficiently and securely transfer patient information, improving the quality of care, accelerating access to benefits while also reducing costs. 
We are also very excited about the formal launch of our joint venture with leading Middle East telecommunications systems security provider, Atlas Telecom. Harris Atlas based in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates will deliver innovative intelligent solutions including enhanced video management and geospatial 3D visualization. The venture will focus on delivery of large-scale, mission-critical intelligence and communications systems in the region. 
On July 30, we completed the acquisition of CapRock Communications. CapRock is a leading global provider of managed satellite communication services, serving the energy, government and maritime industries. CapRock contributed $65 million to first quarter revenue and scored significant wins. We continue to foster new opportunities within the U.S. government and the lifting of the drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico could provide additional opportunities. 
During the quarter, Harris CapRock was awarded four contracts totalling $43 million to provide managed network services and over 400 megahertz commercial satellite capacity to four separate U.S. government agencies. These contracts run through 2013 and include requirements for bandwidth, teleport and backhaul services on KU and expand networks. These services will be used to support a range of missions including airborne ISR, tactical field deployed communications and continuity of operations. 
In the Broadcast Communication segment, revenue in the first quarter was $122 million compared with the prior-year quarter of $119 million. The segment operating loss was $9 million included $1 million of restructuring costs. Orders were stronger and grew in the quarter to $135 million, compared with the prior year of $124 million and $111 million in the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter. Results in the segment continue to reflect market weakness in the traditional U.S. broadcast capital spending market. And also included are ongoing increased investments in sales and marketing to address new media and international growth opportunities. The 1.1 book-to-bill ratio in the quarter, along with year-over-year revenue growth are both encouraging signs for the segment.  
During the quarter, Harris was awarded $8 million from Nine Network Australia for a new play out center which includes our servers, multi-viewers, routers, digital asset management and automation software. Other major awards in the quarter included $4 million from TPBS Thailand for Harris Integrated Broadcast Systems which encompasses the entire workflow for the customer from in just through content management and play out. A $2.5 million order from Network Seven (sic) [Seven Network] in Australia for an end-to-end file-based play out center for their Melbourne operations. And $2.5 million order from Saudi Television for TV and radio transmission sites and HD production studios. 
Another exciting event in the quarter was the inauguration of the in-arena broadcast network at the Amway Center in Orlando, home of the National Basketball Association's Orlando Magic. Harris took part in a ceremony to officially open the new facility, unveiling the most technologically advanced arena in North America. The Harris solution is a unique convergence of IP and broad-based technology that provides an entirely new streamlined workflow system. It also provides fans with an exceptional multimedia event experience, and offers access to new advertising revenue streams going forward. 
Let me now ask Gary McArthur, Harris' CFO to comment on our financial results in the quarter.

The first quarter was an outstanding balance sheet and cash flow quarter for the company. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $341 million, strong collections in the quarter drove down days-sales-outstanding from 54 days to 48, debt-to-total-capital remained about the same at 39% and return on invested capital as a result of the very strong operating performance increased from 18% to 22%, all as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2010. 
During the quarter, we established a $300 million 364 day revolving credit facility to replace the capacity used for the purchase of CapRock Communications, which closed on July 30. Cash flow in the quarter was excellent. Cash flow generated from operating activities was $295 million, as compared to $135 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. All three operating segments generated positive cash flow. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $254 million as compared to $114 million. Our increased guidance for cash flow from operations for fiscal 2011 is now a range of $775 million to $825 million, up from our previous guidance of $750 million to $800 million. During the quarter, we repurchased $50 million of our outstanding common stock at an average purchase price of $42.59 per share. As of quarter end, we have $400 million remaining authorization under our stock repurchase program. 
Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $47 million as compared to $42 million in the first quarter of the prior year. Our expectations for depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 2011 are unchanged at $205 million to $215 million. Capital expenditures were $41 million for the first quarter, as compared to $21 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Our current guidance for fiscal year 2011 CapEx is unchanged at between $250 million and $275 million. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 34.8%, our outlook for the full year tax rate for fiscal 2011 assuming the R&D tax credit is passed is now 33.5%, down from our previous guidance of 34%. Again noting, however, that the tax rate for any given quarter could vary up or down as a result of discrete tax events. In summary, we are off to a very good start and continue to operate from a very strong financial foundation. Back to you, Howard.

We have increased our financial guidance for fiscal year 2011 due to our strong first quarter operating performance, and improving second quarter outlook. Consolidated revenue for fiscal 2011 is now expected to be towards the higher end of our previous range of $5.9 billion to $6 billion, about 15% above fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP EBITDA for fiscal 2011, which excludes acquisition-related costs is expected to be in a range of $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion, representing an increase of 10% to 12% above our fiscal 2010 EBITDA of $1.10 billion. Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related costs, is now expected to be in the range from $4.80 to $4.90 per diluted share. That's a year-over-year increase of 8% to 11%. Our previous guidance if you recall was $4.60 to $4.70 per share. 
On our last call, we provided quarterly guidance for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2011 because of the atypical seasonality caused by the MRAP and M-ATV program shipments being concentrated mostly in the first quarter. Earnings in the second quarter are now expected to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.12 per share. Slightly above last year and much higher than our previous guidance and we expect sequential EPS growth in the back half of fiscal 2011. 
For the RF Communication segment, fiscal 2011 revenue is now expected to be 10% to 11% higher than fiscal 2010, and 16% to 17% higher in the second quarter. Segment operating margin for the year is expected to be 33% to 34%. For the Government Communications Systems segment, guidance is unchanged. We expect revenue for fiscal 2011 to be 20% to 22% higher than fiscal 2010. This represents 6% to 8% growth in the existing Government Communications Systems business and then we add 11 months of contribution of CapRock Communications acquisition revenue in the range of $380 million to $390 million. 
Total segment operating margin is expected to be approximately 11% for the fiscal year. And for the Broadcast Communication segment, we continue to expect revenue in the range of $490 million to $510 million with break-even operating results. We still expect operating losses in the first half, but they will be followed, we believe by improving profitability in the second half. At this time, I'll ask the operator to open the line and we'll be pleased to take your questions.

As you say, we came very close to that at about 0.9 in the first quarter. I think what's most important is that we see the pipeline really filling up nicely as we look out at both the domestic U.S. as well as the international business. In terms of specifically guiding to a specific book-to-bill by quarter, I'm not going to go there but overall, we're still feeling good for the year. It doesn't mean it's a slam dunk but what it does mean is that we have the opportunities in sight and are pursuing them. And as long as we get a little good fortune in timing in Q4 this year versus Q1 next year, I think we've got a very good shot at getting there. Even if we just came close, though, we're talking about still a sizable backlog exiting this year into fiscal '12. So I think the good news of the first quarter and our higher guidance in the second quarter is all about the firming up of the order pipeline at RF this year and our confidence in delivering on that.

Again, I think what's encouraging to us is the support that we're getting on the ground because of what the 117G allows our customers to do, that couldn't be done before using the traditional radio systems. And the continued lagging of the JTRS programs. The record again gives us a major window of opportunity to illustrate the capabilities of utilizing our commercially developed technology, getting to market faster. So we're very encouraged. Certainly opportunity for 117G, alongside the opportunities for a number of our other new products, are what is helping to give us more confidence that we can continue to grow orders this year and maintain that very high mark of 1:1 book-to-bill.

And certainly we continue, like other companies, to look at additional acquisitions. There's a lot out there but we continue to also put a pretty fine screen on those with regard to being a fit, strategically in our business and also being at a value level that allows us through synergies, create returns above our cost of capital. So I think you'll continue to see us look. We continue as Gary indicated have a very strong balance sheet. We have well over $700 million in debt capacity available right now, just on our revolvers.

Harris first quarter results were very strong with revenue and income significantly higher than the prior year. Excellent financial performance was driven by continuing strong demand, and favorable product mix in our Tactical Radio business. Results in the Public Safety and Professional Communications business were solid. 
And following the end of the quarter, Harris was selected to negotiate a potential contract with the government of Alberta, Canada with their new province-wide radio communication system. This represents a significant multi-year program opportunity for us. In our Government Communication Systems segment, new program wins as well as additional program scope and follow-on business for existing programs are building a healthy backlog even as the government spending environment has become more challenging. And sequential improvement was seen in our Broadcast Communication segment, which has been negatively impacted by the global recession. 
Consolidated revenue in the first quarter was $1.41 billion, 17% higher than the prior year. On an organic basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenue increased 10%. Non-GAAP income, which excludes acquisition-related costs was $165 million in the first quarter or $1.28 per diluted share. An increase of 56% compared with the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP EBITDA in the first quarter was $318 million, compared with the prior year of $228 million. Consolidated orders in the first quarter were very strong at $1.30 billion. While somewhat lower than the $1.50 billion in the prior quarter, but it also sequentially followed a very large fourth quarter of $1.70 billion in orders. Our recent wins and strong opportunity pipeline have certainly increased our confidence for another strong performance in fiscal 2011, and we expect good momentum when we enter fiscal 2012. 
First quarter revenue for the RF Communication segment was $567 million, that's 34% higher compared to $424 million in the prior year. Operating income was $229 million and operating margin was a very strong 40% due to favorable product mix and operating efficiencies in our business. First quarter orders for the RF segment were $472 million. Tactical Radio Communications revenue was $446 million in the quarter, increased 47% compared with the $303 million in the last-year first quarter. Revenue was driven by deliveries on fiscal 2010 orders for equipping MRAPs and M-ATVs. The remaining $80 million in prior-year MRAP and M-ATV orders is expected to ship in our second quarter. 
Tactical Radio Communications orders were $394 million in the quarter, representing a strong book-to-bill of 0.9%. We continue to experience solid demand in the U.S., stronger demand internationally and an uptake in customer adoption of our new Falcon III radio family. We also saw a number of orders for new products. In fact, orders outside of our core tactical radio products represented 26% of orders in the first quarter in total, and 7% of revenue. Additionally, nearly 50% of our orders in the quarter were for less than $5 million, coming from a wide array of U.S. and international customers. We believe further demonstrating the broad-based sustainable global appeal of our product offering. 
International wins in the quarter included three orders totaling $69 million from the government of Pakistan. For the next phase of our comprehensive C4I system, which utilizes Harris Falcon II and Falcon III Tactical Radios, our secure personal radios, our multiband networking radios and high-capacity line of sight radio solutions. Also included a $12 million order for Falcon III high-capacity line of sight radios, and Falcon II HF radios from a country in the Middle East and $14 million and $10 million, respectively in orders to deliver the first Falcon III Type-1 Suite B Handheld Tactical Radios supporting Coalition Forces in the Middle East and is in Central Asia. 
Wins in the U.S. market included $34 million from the U.S. Navy, for Falcon III and Falcon II radios, $33 million  for KGV-72, blue force tracking COMSEC terminals, $20 million for AN/PRC-117G vehicular adapters from the U.S. Marine Corps., $15 million from the U.S. Army for HF Loop antennas for improved communications on the move capability and $5 million from the U.S. Army for our RF-7800W high-capacity line-of-sight radio systems. Also during the quarter, we received a $5 million order for service and support in fielding the 117G across all the brigade and combat teams in Afghanistan. Harris employees are working side-by-side with the Army as next-generation mobile, wideband tactical communications networks are deployed, improving situational awareness across the battlefield. 
The 117G with its software-defined architecture, permits war fighters to access the Army wideband tactical Internet extending that network to remote commanders and platoon leaders on the move. This permits war fighters to view convoy reports, understand logistics needs and receive emergency medevac requests and all of these simultaneously. In addition, because of the 117G interfaces to standard IP-based networks, units are able to access webmail and other mission-critical websites. We expect the fielding of the 117G with the brigade combat teams to be completed by the end of the calendar year. 
We also continue to introduce additional Falcon III innovations that add new customer-driven functionality. An example is expanding its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. ISR data and ground tactical communications have previously been handled using separate and often non-interoperable technologies. By combining the two into a single system, ISR video from UAVs can be transmitted in real time to tactical radios operated by ground troops, and the video can be viewed across the entire wideband tactical radio network. This provides troops across the battlefield with real-time situational awareness, faster decision-making and more effective and safer operations. 
Our first development incorporated the ROVER waveform into the 117G. This success has led to our latest announcement, a joint development effort between Harris and Cubic Corporation to connect ISR video transmissions using the new TCDL waveform, which provides higher data rates and higher resolution video. Neither of these critical ISR capabilities is specified in the JTRS programs of record radios under development. Harris continues to prove that our commercial business model is significantly faster to market with mission-critical innovations and our pipeline of opportunities remains very strong at approximately $2 billion in international markets and $1.3 billion in the U.S. market. 
Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue was $121 million in the first quarter and flat with the prior year. Our results certainly impacted by the constrained state and local spending environment. During the quarter, however, we continue to demonstrate strong product and technical offerings that have really positioned this business to continue to gain market share and provide us with long-term growth. 
Several key milestones in the quarter are worth noting. First, we introduced the Harris GR-100 System, a wireless solution that tracks and transmits the location of firefighters and other first responders while they are inside buildings enabling on scene commanders to better coordinate firefighting efforts and monitor their personnel. We also completed the successful test of the nation's first multi-vendor radio communications network utilizing P25 gateways in Dallas-Fort Worth. This first of its kind public safety communication network will provide regional first responders with additional radio coverage and unprecedented interoperability during emergency response situations.
We also announced during the quarter, the introduction of Open Sky II, the second generation of our high performance digital voice and data communications network to be utilized in public safety, utilities, industrial and transportation applications. Open Sky II is a comprehensive enhancement of our network platform that includes improved user services, geographic coverage and audio features. Orders in Public Safety and Professional Communications in the first quarter were $78 million. This included a $14 million order for a new state-wide public safety communications network, and $9 million from Ontario County, New York to upgrade its public safety radio communication system with the Harris P25 IP solution. 
And then after the close of the quarter, Harris was selected by the Alberta Canada Solicitor General and Public Security Office as a preferred vendor for the design, construction, implementation and operation of the province-wide Alberta First Responders Radio Communications System. Harris is currently engaged in due diligence activities as defined in their request for proposals. A word that the contract is subject to successful completion of these activities, also finalization of the contract documentation and approval of the finalized contract by the Alberta Treasury Board. This communication system will cover 256,000 square miles and will be the critical link among Alberta's first responders.  We still see a $3 billion in Public Safety and Professional Communications pipeline of opportunities, including Alberta. And we expect to deliver our book-to-bill for this business of at least one in fiscal 2011. 
In summary, the RF Communication segment had another very successful quarter. Backlog remains strong at $1.67 billion at quarter end, including $1.19 billion in Tactical Communications. Global demand for our products remains robust and our investments in new technologies and innovative solutions continue to distinguish us from our competition. 
Revenue in the Government Communications Systems segment was $736 million in the first quarter, 10% higher compared with $668 million in the prior year. Organic revenue growth was about flat in the quarter due to timing of new program awards, but we expect segment growth to return in the second quarter. We continue to see an organic growth rate for the year of 6% to 8%. 
Revenue increased in the quarter on the GOES-R satellite program ground segment and as a result of the recently awarded antenna segment program.  Revenue also benefited from the recent acquisitions of CapRock Communications. Revenue declined in the quarter on several small classified programs and as expected on the Field Data Collection Automation program for the 2010 U.S. Census. Non-GAAP segment operating income in the first quarter was $80 million. Operating margin was strong at 10.9%. This compares with non-GAAP operating income of $86 million in the prior-year quarter, which benefited from award fees related to the FAA telecommunications infrastructure program. 
We achieved several significant program wins in the quarter. These included a 10-year $130 million contract from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to supply antennas and control systems for the GOES-R program. The antennas will provide communication links for command, telemetry and sensor data, as well as a communications link to direct data users. In addition to this award, Harris also received $45 million in additional scope on the GOES-R ground segment program that was awarded to us last year. A $77 million IT services contract was awarded by the U.S. Army material command to provide IT infrastructure and follow-on operations support for the relocation of AMC headquarters to the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama. This is the second major military headquarters relocation contract for Harris. 
The award protest for the five-year $140 million Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment program for NASA that was awarded last year has been favorably resolved. Harris will lead the replacement of equipment and software in this space-to-ground link for NASA's tracking and data relay satellite system. Other significant awards in the quarter included a $55 million scope expansion on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Avionics program, a $64 million option year award for the U.S. Air Force network and Space Operations and Maintenance Program and a $40 million option year award for the Department of State Consular Affairs Support Services, IT contract. 
Following the close of the quarter, Harris was awarded a nine-year potential $273 million Canadian follow-on contract from the government of Canada, for the CF-18 Optimized Weapon Support program. Harris will provide engineering services to support avionic systems on Canada's fighter aircraft. 
Harris Healthcare Solutions continued its progress with $33 million in new awards during the quarter. The Nationwide Health Information Network-Connect project for the Department of Health and Human Services also received the prestigious Wall Street Journal, Technology Innovation for Healthcare IT Award. Connect was cited for its broad impact on the adoption of electronic healthcare information exchanges between federal agencies and healthcare providers used to efficiently and securely transfer patient information, improving the quality of care, accelerating access to benefits while also reducing costs. 
We are also very excited about the formal launch of our joint venture with leading Middle East telecommunications systems security provider, Atlas Telecom. Harris Atlas based in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates will deliver innovative intelligent solutions including enhanced video management and geospatial 3D visualization. The venture will focus on delivery of large-scale, mission-critical intelligence and communications systems in the region. 
On July 30, we completed the acquisition of CapRock Communications. CapRock is a leading global provider of managed satellite communication services, serving the energy, government and maritime industries. CapRock contributed $65 million to first quarter revenue and scored significant wins. We continue to foster new opportunities within the U.S. government and the lifting of the drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico could provide additional opportunities. 
During the quarter, Harris CapRock was awarded four contracts totaling $43 million to provide managed network services and over 400 megahertz commercial satellite capacity to four separate U.S. government agencies. These contracts run through 2013 and include requirements for bandwidth, teleport and backhaul services on KU and expand networks. These services will be used to support a range of missions including airborne ISR, tactical field deployed communications and continuity of operations. 
In the Broadcast Communication segment, revenue in the first quarter was $122 million compared with the prior-year quarter of $119 million. The segment operating loss was $9 million included $1 million of restructuring costs. Orders were stronger and grew in the quarter to $135 million, compared with the prior year of $124 million and $111 million in the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter. Results in the segment continue to reflect market weakness in the traditional U.S. broadcast capital spending market. And also included are ongoing increased investments in sales and marketing to address new media and international growth opportunities. The 1.1 book-to-bill ratio in the quarter, along with year-over-year revenue growth are both encouraging signs for the segment.  
During the quarter, Harris was awarded $8 million from Nine Network Australia for a new play out center which includes our servers, multi-viewers, routers, digital asset management and automation software. Other major awards in the quarter included $4 million from TPBS Thailand for Harris Integrated Broadcast Systems which encompasses the entire workflow for the customer from in just through content management and play out. A $2.5 million order from Network Seven (sic) [Seven Network] in Australia for an end-to-end file-based play out center for their Melbourne operations. And $2.5 million order from Saudi Television for TV and radio transmission sites and HD production studios. 
Another exciting event in the quarter was the inauguration of the in-arena broadcast network at the Amway Center in Orlando, home of the National Basketball Association's Orlando Magic. Harris took part in a ceremony to officially open the new facility, unveiling the most technologically advanced arena in North America. The Harris solution is a unique convergence of IP and broad-based technology that provides an entirely new streamlined workflow system. It also provides fans with an exceptional multimedia event experience, and offers access to new advertising revenue streams going forward. 
Let me now ask Gary McArthur, Harris' CFO to comment on our financial results in the quarter."

The first quarter was an outstanding balance sheet and cash flow quarter for the company. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $341 million, strong collections in the quarter drove down days-sales-outstanding from 54 days to 48, debt-to-total-capital remained about the same at 39% and return on invested capital as a result of the very strong operating performance increased from 18% to 22%, all as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2010. 
During the quarter, we established a $300 million 364 day revolving credit facility to replace the capacity used for the purchase of CapRock Communications, which closed on July 30. Cash flow in the quarter was excellent. Cash flow generated from operating activities was $295 million, as compared to $135 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. All three operating segments generated positive cash flow. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $254 million as compared to $114 million. Our increased guidance for cash flow from operations for fiscal 2011 is now a range of $775 million to $825 million, up from our previous guidance of $750 million to $800 million. During the quarter, we repurchased $50 million of our outstanding common stock at an average purchase price of $42.59 per share. As of quarter end, we have $400 million remaining authorization under our stock repurchase program. 
Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $47 million as compared to $42 million in the first quarter of the prior year. Our expectations for depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 2011 are unchanged at $205 million to $215 million. Capital expenditures were $41 million for the first quarter, as compared to $21 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Our current guidance for fiscal year 2011 CapEx is unchanged at between $250 million and $275 million. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 34.8%, our outlook for the full year tax rate for fiscal 2011 assuming the R&D tax credit is passed is now 33.5%, down from our previous guidance of 34%. Again noting, however, that the tax rate for any given quarter could vary up or down as a result of discrete tax events. In summary, we are off to a very good start and continue to operate from a very strong financial foundation. Back to you, Howard."

We have increased our financial guidance for fiscal year 2011 due to our strong first quarter operating performance, and improving second quarter outlook. Consolidated revenue for fiscal 2011 is now expected to be towards the higher end of our previous range of $5.9 billion to $6 billion, about 15% above fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP EBITDA for fiscal 2011, which excludes acquisition-related costs is expected to be in a range of $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion, representing an increase of 10% to 12% above our fiscal 2010 EBITDA of $1.10 billion. Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related costs, is now expected to be in the range from $4.80 to $4.90 per diluted share. That's a year-over-year increase of 8% to 11%. Our previous guidance if you recall was $4.60 to $4.70 per share. 
On our last call, we provided quarterly guidance for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2011 because of the atypical seasonality caused by the MRAP and M-ATV program shipments being concentrated mostly in the first quarter. Earnings in the second quarter are now expected to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.12 per share. Slightly above last year and much higher than our previous guidance and we expect sequential EPS growth in the back half of fiscal 2011. 
For the RF Communication segment, fiscal 2011 revenue is now expected to be 10% to 11% higher than fiscal 2010, and 16% to 17% higher in the second quarter. Segment operating margin for the year is expected to be 33% to 34%. For the Government Communications Systems segment, guidance is unchanged. We expect revenue for fiscal 2011 to be 20% to 22% higher than fiscal 2010. This represents 6% to 8% growth in the existing Government Communications Systems business and then we add 11 months of contribution of CapRock Communications acquisition revenue in the range of $380 million to $390 million. 
Total segment operating margin is expected to be approximately 11% for the fiscal year. And for the Broadcast Communication segment, we continue to expect revenue in the range of $490 million to $510 million with break-even operating results. We still expect operating losses in the first half, but they will be followed, we believe by improving profitability in the second half. At this time, I'll ask the operator to open the line and we'll be pleased to take your questions."

In terms of specifically guiding to a specific book-to-bill by quarter, I'm not going to go there but overall, we're still feeling good for the year. It doesn't mean it's a slam dunk but what it does mean is that we have the opportunities in sight and are pursuing them. And as long as we get a little good fortune in timing in Q4 this year versus Q1 next year, I think we've got a very good shot at getting there. Even if we just came close, though, we're talking about still a sizable backlog exiting this year into fiscal '12. So I think the good news of the first quarter and our higher guidance in the second quarter is all about the firming up of the order pipeline at RF this year and our confidence in delivering on that."

That's a major achievement. We have received also, as I mentioned, a contract to put a number of our team members in country helping to deploy and set up these networks.

Harris first quarter results were very strong with revenue and income significantly higher than the prior year. Excellent financial performance was driven by continuing strong demand, and favorable product mix in our Tactical Radio business. Results in the Public Safety and Professional Communications business were solid.
 And following the end of the quarter, Harris was selected to negotiate a potential contract with the government of Alberta, Canada with their new province-wide radio communication system. This represents a significant multi-year program opportunity for us. In our Government Communication Systems segment, new program wins as well as additional program scope and follow-on business for existing programs are building a healthy backlog even as the government spending environment has become more challenging. And sequential improvement was seen in our Broadcast Communication segment, which has been negatively impacted by the global recession.
 Consolidated revenue in the first quarter was $1.41 billion, 17% higher than the prior year. On an organic basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenue increased 10%. Non-GAAP income, which excludes acquisition-related costs was $165 million in the first quarter or $1.28 per diluted share. An increase of 56% compared with the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP EBITDA in the first quarter was $318 million, compared with the prior year of $228 million. Consolidated orders in the first quarter were very strong at $1.30 billion. While somewhat lower than the $1.50 billion in the prior quarter, but it also sequentially followed a very large fourth quarter of $1.70 billion in orders. Our recent wins and strong opportunity pipeline have certainly increased our confidence for another strong performance in fiscal 2011, and we expect good momentum when we enter fiscal 2012.
 First quarter revenue for the RF Communication segment was $567 million, that's 34% higher compared to $424 million in the prior year. Operating income was $229 million and operating margin was a very strong 40% due to favorable product mix and operating efficiencies in our business. First quarter orders for the RF segment were $472 million. Tactical Radio Communications revenue was $446 million in the quarter, increased 47% compared with the $303 million in the last-year first quarter. Revenue was driven by deliveries on fiscal 2010 orders for equipping MRAPs and M-ATVs. The remaining $80 million in prior-year MRAP and M-ATV orders is expected to ship in our second quarter.
 Tactical Radio Communications orders were $394 million in the quarter, representing a strong book-to-bill of 0.9%. We continue to experience solid demand in the U.S., stronger demand internationally and an uptake in customer adoption of our new Falcon III radio family. We also saw a number of orders for new products. In fact, orders outside of our core tactical radio products represented 26% of orders in the first quarter in total, and 7% of revenue. Additionally, nearly 50% of our orders in the quarter were for less than $5 million, coming from a wide array of U.S. and international customers. We believe further demonstrating the broad-based sustainable global appeal of our product offering.
 International wins in the quarter included three orders totalling $69 million from the government of Pakistan. For the next phase of our comprehensive C4I system, which utilizes Harris Falcon II and Falcon III Tactical Radios, our secure personal radios, our multiband networking radios and high-capacity line of sight radio solutions. Also included a $12 million order for Falcon III high-capacity line of sight radios, and Falcon II HF radios from a country in the Middle East and $14 million and $10 million, respectively in orders to deliver the first Falcon III Type-1 Suite B Handheld Tactical Radios supporting Coalition Forces in the Middle East and is in Central Asia.
 Wins in the U.S. market included $34 million from the U.S. Navy, for Falcon III and Falcon II radios, $33 million  for KGV-72, blue force tracking COMSEC terminals, $20 million for AN/PRC-117G vehicular adapters from the U.S. Marine Corps., $15 million from the U.S. Army for HF Loop antennas for improved communications on the move capability and $5 million from the U.S. Army for our RF-7800W high-capacity line-of-sight radio systems. Also during the quarter, we received a $5 million order for service and support in fielding the 117G across all the brigade and combat teams in Afghanistan. Harris employees are working side-by-side with the Army as next-generation mobile, wideband tactical communications networks are deployed, improving situational awareness across the battlefield.
 The 117G with its software-defined architecture, permits war fighters to access the Army wideband tactical Internet extending that network to remote commanders and platoon leaders on the move. This permits war fighters to view convoy reports, understand logistics needs and receive emergency medevac requests and all of these simultaneously. In addition, because of the 117G interfaces to standard IP-based networks, units are able to access webmail and other mission-critical websites. We expect the fielding of the 117G with the brigade combat teams to be completed by the end of the calendar year.
 We also continue to introduce additional Falcon III innovations that add new customer-driven functionality. An example is expanding its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. ISR data and ground tactical communications have previously been handled using separate and often non-interoperable technologies. By combining the two into a single system, ISR video from UAVs can be transmitted in real time to tactical radios operated by ground troops, and the video can be viewed across the entire wideband tactical radio network. This provides troops across the battlefield with real-time situational awareness, faster decision-making and more effective and safer operations.
 Our first development incorporated the ROVER waveform into the 117G. This success has led to our latest announcement, a joint development effort between Harris and Cubic Corporation to connect ISR video transmissions using the new TCDL waveform, which provides higher data rates and higher resolution video. Neither of these critical ISR capabilities is specified in the JTRS programs of record radios under development. Harris continues to prove that our commercial business model is significantly faster to market with mission-critical innovations and our pipeline of opportunities remains very strong at approximately $2 billion in international markets and $1.3 billion in the U.S. market.
 Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue was $121 million in the first quarter and flat with the prior year. Our results certainly impacted by the constrained state and local spending environment. During the quarter, however, we continue to demonstrate strong product and technical offerings that have really positioned this business to continue to gain market share and provide us with long-term growth.
 Several key milestones in the quarter are worth noting. First, we introduced the Harris GR-100 System, a wireless solution that tracks and transmits the location of firefighters and other first responders while they are inside buildings enabling on scene commanders to better coordinate firefighting efforts and monitor their personnel. We also completed the successful test of the nation's first multi-vendor radio communications network utilizing P25 gateways in Dallas-Fort Worth. This first of its kind public safety communication network will provide regional first responders with additional radio coverage and unprecedented interoperability during emergency response situations.
 We also announced during the quarter, the introduction of Open Sky II, the second generation of our high performance digital voice and data communications network to be utilized in public safety, utilities, industrial and transportation applications. Open Sky II is a comprehensive enhancement of our network platform that includes improved user services, geographic coverage and audio features. Orders in Public Safety and Professional Communications in the first quarter were $78 million. This included a $14 million order for a new state-wide public safety communications network, and $9 million from Ontario County, New York to upgrade its public safety radio communication system with the Harris P25 IP solution.
 And then after the close of the quarter, Harris was selected by the Alberta Canada Solicitor General and Public Security Office as a preferred vendor for the design, construction, implementation and operation of the province-wide Alberta First Responders Radio Communications System. Harris is currently engaged in due diligence activities as defined in their request for proposals. A word that the contract is subject to successful completion of these activities, also finalization of the contract documentation and approval of the finalized contract by the Alberta Treasury Board. This communication system will cover 256,000 square miles and will be the critical link among Alberta's first responders.  We still see a $3 billion in Public Safety and Professional Communications pipeline of opportunities, including Alberta. And we expect to deliver our book-to-bill for this business of at least one in fiscal 2011.
 In summary, the RF Communication segment had another very successful quarter. Backlog remains strong at $1.67 billion at quarter end, including $1.19 billion in Tactical Communications. Global demand for our products remains robust and our investments in new technologies and innovative solutions continue to distinguish us from our competition.
 Revenue in the Government Communications Systems segment was $736 million in the first quarter, 10% higher compared with $668 million in the prior year. Organic revenue growth was about flat in the quarter due to timing of new program awards, but we expect segment growth to return in the second quarter. We continue to see an organic growth rate for the year of 6% to 8%.
 Revenue increased in the quarter on the GOES-R satellite program ground segment and as a result of the recently awarded antenna segment program.  Revenue also benefited from the recent acquisitions of CapRock Communications. Revenue declined in the quarter on several small classified programs and as expected on the Field Data Collection Automation program for the 2010 U.S. Census. Non-GAAP segment operating income in the first quarter was $80 million. Operating margin was strong at 10.9%. This compares with non-GAAP operating income of $86 million in the prior-year quarter, which benefited from award fees related to the FAA telecommunications infrastructure program.
 We achieved several significant program wins in the quarter. These included a 10-year $130 million contract from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to supply antennas and control systems for the GOES-R program. The antennas will provide communication links for command, telemetry and sensor data, as well as a communications link to direct data users. In addition to this award, Harris also received $45 million in additional scope on the GOES-R ground segment program that was awarded to us last year. A $77 million IT services contract was awarded by the U.S. Army material command to provide IT infrastructure and follow-on operations support for the relocation of AMC headquarters to the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama. This is the second major military headquarters relocation contract for Harris.
 The award protest for the five-year $140 million Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment program for NASA that was awarded last year has been favorably resolved. Harris will lead the replacement of equipment and software in this space-to-ground link for NASA's tracking and data relay satellite system. Other significant awards in the quarter included a $55 million scope expansion on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Avionics program, a $64 million option year award for the U.S. Air Force network and Space Operations and Maintenance Program and a $40 million option year award for the Department of State Consular Affairs Support Services, IT contract.
 Following the close of the quarter, Harris was awarded a nine-year potential $273 million Canadian follow-on contract from the government of Canada, for the CF-18 Optimized Weapon Support program. Harris will provide engineering services to support avionic systems on Canada's fighter aircraft.
 Harris Healthcare Solutions continued its progress with $33 million in new awards during the quarter. The Nationwide Health Information Network-Connect project for the Department of Health and Human Services also received the prestigious Wall Street Journal, Technology Innovation for Healthcare IT Award. Connect was cited for its broad impact on the adoption of electronic healthcare information exchanges between federal agencies and healthcare providers used to efficiently and securely transfer patient information, improving the quality of care, accelerating access to benefits while also reducing costs.
 We are also very excited about the formal launch of our joint venture with leading Middle East telecommunications systems security provider, Atlas Telecom. Harris Atlas based in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates will deliver innovative intelligent solutions including enhanced video management and geospatial 3D visualization. The venture will focus on delivery of large-scale, mission-critical intelligence and communications systems in the region.
 On July 30, we completed the acquisition of CapRock Communications. CapRock is a leading global provider of managed satellite communication services, serving the energy, government and maritime industries. CapRock contributed $65 million to first quarter revenue and scored significant wins. We continue to foster new opportunities within the U.S. government and the lifting of the drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico could provide additional opportunities.
 During the quarter, Harris CapRock was awarded four contracts totalling $43 million to provide managed network services and over 400 megahertz commercial satellite capacity to four separate U.S. government agencies. These contracts run through 2013 and include requirements for bandwidth, teleport and backhaul services on KU and expand networks. These services will be used to support a range of missions including airborne ISR, tactical field deployed communications and continuity of operations.
 In the Broadcast Communication segment, revenue in the first quarter was $122 million compared with the prior-year quarter of $119 million. The segment operating loss was $9 million included $1 million of restructuring costs. Orders were stronger and grew in the quarter to $135 million, compared with the prior year of $124 million and $111 million in the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter. Results in the segment continue to reflect market weakness in the traditional U.S. broadcast capital spending market. And also included are ongoing increased investments in sales and marketing to address new media and international growth opportunities. The 1.1 book-to-bill ratio in the quarter, along with year-over-year revenue growth are both encouraging signs for the segment.
 During the quarter, Harris was awarded $8 million from Nine Network Australia for a new play out center which includes our servers, multi-viewers, routers, digital asset management and automation software. Other major awards in the quarter included $4 million from TPBS Thailand for Harris Integrated Broadcast Systems which encompasses the entire workflow for the customer from in just through content management and play out. A $2.5 million order from Network Seven (sic) [Seven Network] in Australia for an end-to-end file-based play out center for their Melbourne operations. And $2.5 million order from Saudi Television for TV and radio transmission sites and HD production studios.
 Another exciting event in the quarter was the inauguration of the in-arena broadcast network at the Amway Center in Orlando, home of the National Basketball Association's Orlando Magic. Harris took part in a ceremony to officially open the new facility, unveiling the most technologically advanced arena in North America. The Harris solution is a unique convergence of IP and broad-based technology that provides an entirely new streamlined workflow system. It also provides fans with an exceptional multimedia event experience, and offers access to new advertising revenue streams going forward.
 Let me now ask Gary McArthur, Harris' CFO to comment on our financial results in the quarter.

The first quarter was an outstanding balance sheet and cash flow quarter for the company. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $341 million, strong collections in the quarter drove down days-sales-outstanding from 54 days to 48,",391," Thank you, Howard. The first quarter was an outstanding balance sheet and cash flow quarter for the company. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $341 million, strong collections in the quarter drove down days-sales-outstanding from 54 days to 48, debt-to-total-capital remained about the same at 39% and return on invested capital as a result of the very strong operating performance increased from 18% to 22%, all as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
 During the quarter, we established a $300 million 364 day revolving credit facility to replace the capacity used for the purchase of CapRock Communications, which closed on July 30. Cash flow in the quarter was excellent. Cash flow generated from operating activities was $295 million, as compared to $135 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. All three operating segments generated positive cash flow. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $254 million as compared to $114 million. Our increased guidance for cash flow from operations for fiscal 2011 is now a range of $775 million to $825 million, up from our previous guidance of $750 million to $800 million. During the quarter, we repurchased $50 million of our outstanding common stock at an average purchase price of $42.59 per share. As of quarter end, we have $400 million remaining authorization under our stock repurchase program.
 Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $47 million as compared to $42 million in the first quarter of the prior year. Our expectations for depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 2011 are unchanged at $205 million to $215 million. Capital expenditures were $41 million for the first quarter, as compared to $21 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Our current guidance for fiscal year 2011 CapEx is unchanged at between $250 million and $275 million. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 34.8%, our outlook for the full year tax rate for fiscal 2011 assuming the R&D tax credit is passed is now 33.5%, down from our previous guidance of 34%. Again noting, however, that the tax rate for any given quarter could vary up or down as a result of discrete tax events. In summary, we are off to a very good start and continue to operate from a very strong financial foundation. Back to you, Howard.

We have increased our financial guidance for fiscal year 2011 due to our strong first quarter operating performance, and improving second quarter outlook. Consolidated revenue for fiscal 2011 is now expected to be towards the higher end of",392," Thanks, Gary. We have increased our financial guidance for fiscal year 2011 due to our strong first quarter operating performance, and improving second quarter outlook. Consolidated revenue for fiscal 2011 is now expected to be towards the higher end of our previous range of $5.9 billion to $6 billion, about 15% above fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP EBITDA for fiscal 2011, which excludes acquisition-related costs is expected to be in a range of $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion, representing an increase of 10% to 12% above our fiscal 2010 EBITDA of $1.10 billion. Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related costs, is now expected to be in the range from $4.80 to $4.90 per diluted share. That's a year-over-year increase of 8% to 11%. Our previous guidance if you recall was $4.60 to $4.70 per share.
 On our last call, we provided quarterly guidance for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2011 because of the atypical seasonality caused by the MRAP and M-ATV program shipments being concentrated mostly in the first quarter. Earnings in the second quarter are now expected to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.12 per share. Slightly above last year and much higher than our previous guidance and we expect sequential EPS growth in the back half of fiscal 2011.
 For the RF Communication segment, fiscal 2011 revenue is now expected to be 10% to 11% higher than fiscal 2010, and 16% to 17% higher in the second quarter. Segment operating margin for the year is expected to be 33% to 34%. For the Government Communications Systems segment, guidance is unchanged. We expect revenue for fiscal 2011 to be 20% to 22% higher than fiscal 2010. This represents 6% to 8% growth in the existing Government Communications Systems business and then we add 11 months of contribution of CapRock Communications acquisition revenue in the range of $380 million to $390 million.
 Total segment operating margin is expected to be approximately 11% for the fiscal year. And for the Broadcast Communication segment, we continue to expect revenue in the range of $490 million to $510 million with break-even operating results. We still expect operating losses in the first half, but they will be followed, we believe by improving profitability in the second half. At this time, I'll ask the operator to open the line and we'll be pleased to take your questions.

We still expect to be able to achieve our target of 1 book-to-bill for the year for the Tactical business, as well as to meet or exceed that for the public safety part of the segment. As you say, we came very close to that at about 0.9 in the first quarter. I think what's most important is that we see the pipeline really filling up nicely as we look out at both the domestic U.S. as well as the international business. In terms of specifically guiding to a specific book-to-bill by quarter, I'm not going to go there but overall, we're still feeling good for the year. It doesn't mean it's a slam dunk but what it does mean is that we have the opportunities in sight and are pursuing them. And as long as we get a little good fortune in timing in Q4 this year versus Q1 next year, I think we've got a very good shot at getting there. Even if we just came close, though, we're talking about still a sizable backlog exiting this year into fiscal '12. So I think the good news of the first quarter and our higher guidance in the second quarter is all about the firming up of the order pipeline at RF this year and our confidence in delivering on that.

So this is certainly a significant project. Competition was certainly Motorola, the market leader. We're very pleased our team put together a very, very good proposal and we are looking forward to completing these negotiations. How long that will take? I'm not sure but it's not uncommon for that to run on for a quarter or two. So we could be talking about not finalizing this until the new calendar year. But it certainly should be, we hope in this fiscal year, and help to bolster our orders and backlog and then provide a multi-year stream of revenue and profitability as we execute the program. So certainly it's a major win and we're very proud of our team for delivering that.

Certainly the opportunity for continued adoption of the 117G, we think is truly enabled by this major milestone that we've broken through, which is the approval to deploy what's called capabilities set nine and 10 by the Army to deploy that capability to all of the BCTs in theater. That's a major achievement. We have received also, as I mentioned, a contract to put a number of our team members in country helping to deploy and set up these networks. And we're convinced, like many major new innovations, as our customers start to use the radios it's going to have a follow-on compounding effect in terms of broader adoption, not just in Afghanistan but over the long-term. So from our perspective, we think it's a major milestone and we're in the process, I don't know probably, 30%, 40% of the way through getting these systems up and running.

And the continued lagging of the JTRS programs.

But it certainly has -- it's not 80%-20%. It certainly has a significant component of both. And yes, generally, you should think about orders that we get from U.S. Government would be shipped within 12 months and some portion of the international orders would go out beyond 12 months because they might be a multi-year program. The same is true in the Public Safety business when we talk about backlog. Some of that is shipping directly in the current fiscal year against the program. Some of it is going out into a multiple year program such as we've been discussing with the opportunity in Alberta.

But it is our sense that the programs are slipping and likely to announce delays. But I don't have anything specific off of any published document that I can reference. Nor do I have anything regarding pricing. The only thing we've ever seen on pricing are target prices at very high volumes. Those are certainly not likely to be achieved during the first limited-rate initial production of any program. So I'm presuming that prices will be higher than whatever the prices in the long run that were quoted. So those are just our assumptions. I don't have any specific document to point to, Mark.

We have more broadly in the Government Systems segment, seen some program awards get delayed as a result of the continuing resolution. So we have seen a little bit of that but it hasn't had a major impact on our view of the year as you heard me indicate, we continue to think 6% to 8% year-over-year revenue growth organically is achievable. And we think that will be largely ahead of our peer group. So we're still feeling pretty positive. We've had a number of program wins in the first quarter as I rattle off that list of different programs. So we're feeling pretty positive but we've certainly have seen a few program awards slip to the right.
