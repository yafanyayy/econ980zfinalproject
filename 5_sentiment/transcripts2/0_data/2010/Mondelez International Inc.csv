With us here today are Chairman and CEO, Irene Rosenfeld; and CFO Tim McLevish; as well as Chris Jakubik, who all of you know well. Now as analysts and a generally very curious bunch of people, we, of course, want all the answers yesterday. But given Kraft is still in the midst of closing on the Cadbury acquisition, company is still subject to some extraordinary disclosure rules that, among other things, limit their ability to provide earnings guidance. Today, we are specifically more about Q4 results, which can provide us a bit more perspective on the progress of the core Kraft business; certainly very important going into a sizable integration process for Cadbury. Irene, Tim and Chris, thanks very much for joining us. And then following what was obviously a most interesting and, I'm sure, draining few months, I'll hand it over to Chris for a few additional comments. Thank you."

How's your New Year been? You've been a little busy? I thought I must say it's especially nice to see so many familiar faces in the audience today. There are three things that we want to address today. First,",4029,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning to all of you. How's your New Year been? You've been a little busy? I thought I must say it's especially nice to see so many familiar faces in the audience today. There are three things that we want to address today. First, we're exiting the turnaround that I laid out three years ago on this very stage, with strong operating and financial momentum. I'd like to take a few minutes to review the progress we made in 2009, including some highlights from our fourth quarter results announced earlier this morning. Second, I'll review our combination with Cadbury, and underscore again why we believe the combination of Kraft Foods and Cadbury has created a global powerhouse; one that can deliver top-tier margins and growth on a sustainable basis. And third, Tim will provide an update on the transaction, where we are on the process, including our early thoughts on integration. So let's begin. Three years ago, we laid out our plan to return Kraft Foods to long-term sustainable growth. In the first year, we said we would rejuvenate top line growth. And we did. In the second year, we said we would grow both the top and the bottom lines. And we did. In the third year, we said we would focus on building our profit margins and market share. And as we've done this, we have a strong foundation underlying our long-term model, targeting EPS growth of 7% to 9%. Three years ago, no one could've predicted the environment we'd face in the ensuing years, from record high-input costs to global recession. But despite it all, we did what we said we would do, and we've emerged a much stronger company. We began our turnaround by decentralizing and aligning our businesses and functions with common incentives. Our business unit leaders have been focused on three simple metrics: Revenue growth, income growth and cash flow. And they've been the key drivers of our turnaround. Over the past three years, we've made tremendous progress on each measure. Since 2006, on average we've driven 4.5% organic revenue growth per year. We've made significant investments in product quality, marketing and innovation; while growing operating income 10% per year on average, and raising our operating income margin to 13.7% in 2009. That's up from 12.6% in 2008. We've put a greater focus on cash flow, and it paid off. In 2009, we generated cash flow equal to 124% of our net earnings. That's up from 83% in 2006. But the true measure of success for any turnaround is how well we've staged our business for future growth on that criteria. And I'm pleased to report that we exited 2009 with strong operating and financial momentum. Since 2007, we've invested more than $500 million to improve our product quality, as our products have gone from good enough to truly delicious. Consumers have noticed. Today, about a 2/3 of our products are preferred to the competition versus only 44% in 2006. Putting quality back into our products and differentiating ourselves from the competition has enabled us to re-establish our pricing power. And as a result of stronger brand equities, we've been able to manage higher input costs and improve the alignment of our prices and our cost structure, while still investing in our franchises. This was a necessary step to restoring profit margins, and it's been a key contributor of our results to date. As a consequence, going forward, the ability to manage changes in input costs through pricing will allow more of our productivity gains to flow to the bottom line. Another example of our operating momentum has been our improvement in volume and product mix, despite significant headwinds. The challenging economic environment has led to weakening consumption trends around the world. In North America, unemployment is higher than it's been in 18 years, and many of those who hold a job don't feel secure. In Europe, unemployment continues to rise, both in Western and Eastern Europe. And in Asia and Latin America, while consumption is still growing, it's well below historical levels. From a planning perspective, we're expecting a continuation of these trends until at least the back half of 2010. But we're certainly not sitting still in the face of these macroeconomic factors. We've taken some strategic actions over the past several quarters to discontinue less profitable product lines and to forego unprofitable volume, thereby, resetting our revenue base. While this has reduced near-term volume, it's clearly been the right long-term decision and enables us to grow off of a much stronger base. Despite these headwinds, you can see that we delivered sequential improvement in vol/mix in every quarter of 2009. Having said that, I do want to acknowledge that our fourth quarter came in somewhat lighter than our forecast of approximately 3% growth. Why is that? Two reasons: One is lower than anticipated consumer offtake for the macroeconomic reasons I just cited, particularly in North America and Europe; the other is that we made the decision to avoid chasing certain U.S. competitors, particularly in mainstream coffee and snack nuts, competitors that were chasing unprofitable, unsustainable volume. Instead, we chose to invest in more sustainable long-term brand building by significantly increasing our fourth quarter advertising and consumer spending. This will clearly pay dividends in 2010. Nonetheless, in contrast to many of our peers, we continued to drive sequentially better volume/mix in the fourth quarter, delivering more than 1.5 points of growth. Looking at another measure of our momentum, we're expanding both gross and operating margins, while continuing to invest in future growth. In 2009, we increased our advertising and consumer spending to 7.2% of net revenues. That's up from 6.7% in 2008. What's more, A&C [advertising and consumer] spending increased even though advertising rates have come down considerably year-over-year. Take a look at three of our newest spots from the U.S. [Video Presentation]These spots have been extremely well received, and are doing a great job of building our brand franchises. In addition to increasing our marketing investments, we were able to accelerate a number of cost savings programs, primarily related to our reorganization in Europe and our broader overhead initiatives. We spent more than $300 million in 2009, considerably higher than the more than $200 million we had identified in early November. As this chart shows, we've improved our operating margin year-over-year in every quarter of 2009. Vol/mix continued to be a key driver of margin upside. In the fourth quarter, vol/mix drove 70 basis points of margin improvement. And for the full year, operating margin rose to 13.7%, with vol/mix driving 50 basis points of the increase. As you can see, we've made good progress toward our goal of restoring our profit margins to industry benchmarks, while still investing significantly in productivity and brand building. Finally, our momentum is broad-based. To be fair, we're not pitching a perfect game. As you know, that's difficult when you're managing a broad portfolio. But our businesses in each region are making good progress against their objectives in a very difficult environment. Let's take a closer look at each regions starting with North America. In the fourth quarter, organic net revenue declined 2.7%. This was due entirely to a pricing decline of almost four percentage points. Lower dairy costs and the related adjustments under our adaptive pricing model represented about 2.5 percentage points of the decline. Vol/mix rose more than one percentage point, fueled by growth in priority categories. This gross was tempered by three factors. First, we continue to optimize the size of our Natural Cheese business. This more than offset the vol/mix gains in our more profitable priority brands,  Kraft Singles, PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese and Velveeta. Second, we made the conscious decision not to chase on sustainable promotional activity in both mainstream coffee and snack nuts. And third, we saw declines in a number of our non-core biscuit brands. This was the result of weaker trends in the biscuit category in the second half of the year, due to reduced merchandising at a key customer. Operating income margin in North America rose to 16.6% in the fourth quarter, as we improved the alignment between input cost and pricing. It's also important to note that margins rose, even as we made significant investments in cost savings and marketing initiatives. In fact, we increased our investments in A&C at a double-digit rate versus the prior year. For the full year, organic net revenue in North America declined slightly. During the year, we effectively managed the transition to vol/mix driven growth from price-based growth. In the end, the contribution from pricing was a negative 50 basis points, due to entirely to a 160-basis-point impact from lower dairy costs. Priority categories fueled the gains in vol/mix. However, these gains were offset by a 70-basis-point impact from discontinuing less profitable product lines. The good news is that as we exited the fourth quarter, we've now fully lapped the major product line discontinuations, and will be on an apples-to-apples basis going forward. Segment operating income rose to 17.3%, again, better alignment of input costs and pricing drove the improvement, despite incremental investments in cost savings and marketing. In terms of U.S. market share, as we lacked the significant pricing actions of 2008, we're making slow but steady progress in regaining U.S. market share. Our 52-week trends are improving, with 45% of our retail revenue gaining or holding share. We're not yet where we want to be, but we expect this positive trend to continue in 2010. In fact, according to the data we've just received, we are gaining or holding share in well over 50% of our U.S. retail revenue for the 52 weeks ending January. Turning now to Europe, organic net revenues were down slightly, as we continued to take the necessary actions to improve margins. The discontinuation of product lines and our decision to forego unprofitable volume resulted in a two-percentage-point headwind to vol/mix. In addition, the economic slowdown has continued to negatively impact consumption, with particular weakness in Spain, Portugal and France. And given the strong position of the LU Biscuit brands in these markets, it caused a modest revenue decline on our overall European Biscuit business as well. Despite the difficult economic conditions, we posted solid market share in most categories due to continued investments in our focus brands. At the profit line, fourth quarter operating margins were 8.2%. Improved product mix contributed 90 basis points of the margin improvement. But this was offset by significant investments in cost savings initiatives and a strong increase in marketing investments to support our priority brands. For the full year, our European business posted solid results in a very eventful year. We shifted to a category-led operating structure and integrated the LU Biscuit business, all while managing through a very tough recession. On the top line, organic revenue in Europe declined by 1%, as vol/mix was negatively affected by the discontinuation of product lines and our decision to forego unprofitable volume. At the same time, market share performance was good, particularly in chocolate, coffee and cheese. On the bottom line, our operating income margin rose to 9%. Vol/mix improved margins by 90 basis points, while we continued to make major investments and cost savings initiatives and marketing. Turning to developing markets, organic revenues grew by more than 10% in the fourth quarter. Our priority brands drove strong revenue gains across the board. In Asia, priority brands grew about 30%. In Latin America, up 25%. And in CEEMA [Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa], up double digits. What's more, we grew market share in almost every one of our key country category combinations. Operating margin was 8.1%. This reflects improved vol/mix and cost-price alignment, offset by strong double-digit increases in A&C spending versus the prior year. Our full year developing market results showed that our 5-10-10 focus continues to pay off. We posted strong revenue and share growth despite softening category trends. Overall, organic revenues grew nearly 10%. And our priority brands grew even faster, up 18%. Operating income margins were 11.8%. And as in every region, we continued to invest in additional cost savings initiatives and incremental A&C to fuel future growth. As a result of the improved regional operating performance, we've got strong underlying financial momentum. In 2009, we earned $2.03 per diluted share. That represents 7% EPS growth over 2008 on a GAAP basis and 14% growth on a constant currency basis. I'd also note that our 2009 EPS includes a negative impact of $0.04 from expenses related to the Cadbury transaction. I know that breaking the $2 barrier may seem like the end of an era for many of you. But rest assured, it's just the beginning from our perspective. In fact, let's take a closer look at the drivers of EPS growth. As you can see on this chart, operating gains were a key driver, delivering $0.15 of improvement over prior year. We've also made exceptional progress in terms of cash flow. In no small measure, this reflects the fact that cash flow is now a key compensation metric for our managers. We generated significant gains in 2009 from intense focus on working capital efficiency and improved earnings, while ensuring we're supporting our growth with sufficient CapEx. Looking at the numbers, free cash flow for 2009 increased 35% to $3.8 billion. I would note that we got a working capital benefit due to timing of some payables at the end of the year. But even excluding this impact, our free cash flow still rose considerably in 2009. So to recap the progress we've made, we're exiting our turnaround with our base operations in great shape in every region around the world, and their solid momentum behind each line of our P&L. The four turnaround strategies I laid out three years ago have positioned us well to deliver sustainable profitable growth. And as promised, the flywheel is now turning. I firmly believe that going forward, we can benefit now from a virtuous cycle. We're setting growth objectives off a solid base. We're managing input costs by maintaining strong brand equities and pricing accordingly. We're driving vol/mix gains through focused, prioritized investments. We're leveraging our scale, while driving down overhead costs. And we're meeting or exceeding our earnings commitments, while reinvesting in future growth. We've made good progress, but we're certainly not satisfied that our base business has reached its full potential. We remain focused on driving further improvements in our vol/mix growth and in strengthening U.S. market shares. We've essentially completed our product line discontinuations, and we have now a solid base from which to grow. We'll continue to further optimize trade spending, while increasing A&C. And as the economic environment stabilizes and consumer sentiment improves, we'll be shifting the balance of efforts back toward new product development from value-based marketing. On the cost side, we're continuing to execute significant programs to improve productivity and reduce overhead. We're well into the execution phase of our end-to-end productivity programs and the overhead cost-reset initiatives we outlined in September. These initiatives will enable us to continue to fuel our investments in quality, marketing and innovation, while delivering on our targets of reaching mid-teens margins on our base business by 2011. So as I've said before, we didn't need to acquire Cadbury to deliver our existing growth targets. In fact, when we first announced our intention to acquire Cadbury, many of you have asked, ""Why now?"" And the answer is that having successfully reinvigorated our base business, we're now ready to write the next chapter in our transformation. The time is right for us to accelerate our transformation from a position of strength. We can leverage our strong financial momentum to accelerate our progress. And we've prepared our organization to execute with excellence in a number of important ways. We've strengthened our leadership team. We've streamlined our organizational structure. And our global organization has the skills and appetite to integrate a large-scale combination. Now we're ready to take both Kraft Foods and Cadbury to a level neither could reach on its own. And create a combined growth company with unmatched talent, brands, capabilities and resources. Let's take a brief look at the newest member of our family. [Video Presentation]As I've said over the past several months, this combination is all about growth. The new Kraft Foods will deliver top-tier organic revenue growth through a focus on higher growth, higher margin categories and expanding footprint in developing markets and a greater presence in growing trade channels. And we'll target industry-leading margins through improved product mix and leveraging our global scale. Cadbury and Kraft each had strong plans to get to mid-tiered margins prior to our combination. And the synergies inherent in combining the two companies will enable us to take things to a whole new level of long-term growth and margin potential. Let's start with our category mix. The fast-growing Confectionery and Snacks segments will now make up the majority of our portfolio. In fact, almost 70% of our revenue outside North America now comes from Snacks and Confectionery, two rapidly growing, highly expandable categories. We go to market with a portfolio of iconic brands that consumers around the world love and trust. In fact, we now have 11 brands with annual revenues of more than $1 billion. Six of them are Confectionery and Snacks brands. And we have at least $1 billion brand in every consumer segment in which we compete. On a local basis, we're even stronger. 80% of our worldwide revenues are derived from brands where we hold the number one market position. This is driven by more than 70 brands, including more than 40 confectionery brands with revenues in excess of $100 million. These brands are icons in their respective markets. We take enormous pride in our stewardship of these brands and the legacies entrusted to our care. And I'm confident that these beloved brands will thrive with focused incremental marketing and merchandising investments that we can now provide. From a geographic perspective, more than half of our business is now outside North America. More than a quarter of our revenue comes from fast-growing developing markets, up from 20% before. Our developing markets scale is now greater than any of our North American food tiers. And this scale, this presence is the cornerstone on which we will grow our strong brands even faster. For instance, as we've said before, the geographic footprint of Kraft and Cadbury is highly complementary. We now have considerably greater scale in key developing markets that will benefit all of our categories. As of this chart shows, combined net revenues will be approximately $1.5 billion in Brazil, $1 billion in Russia, about $400 million in India, $500 million in China and about $800 million in Mexico. This will lead to significant revenue synergies, as we expand the distribution of each of our respective brands into new markets. For example, products under the Cadbury and Trident brands will benefit from a substantially strengthened presence in countries like Brazil, Russia and China. For Kraft brands, such as Oreo and Tang, Cadbury gives us a meaningful entry into India, and fundamentally transforms the reach of our brands in Mexico and South Africa. But that's only half the story. We now go to market from an even stronger position. Together, we possess exceptional and complementary sales and distribution capabilities. Kraft Foods is strong in modern retail channels that is traditional grocery stores. Indeed, our scale is unmatched in North America, where we have unique capabilities to drive performance. And as large retail formats grow globally, we're in a strong position to capitalize on that. At the same time, Cadbury is very strong in instant consumption channels. This is an important class of trade in both developed and developing markets, in part because instant consumption channels provide incremental reach to large retail formats. What's more, these channels typically carry opportunities for higher margins and higher growth. And nowhere is this more important than in the Confectionery and Snacks segments. From a distribution perspective, our leadership in Confectionery is highly complementary to our Biscuit business. And being a global leader in both Confectionery and Biscuits will not only provide our combined business with significant scale, but also with exciting innovation platforms. Together, we will be the global leader in sweet snacks, with leading market shares in every major region in the world. This scale will be an increasing source of competitive advantage in both the Confectionery and Snacks segments, and the food industry as a whole. For these reasons, I'm highly confident that we are well-positioned to drive top-tier organic revenue growth for the foreseeable future. Our portfolio is now more heavily weighted toward faster growing categories and geographies. And on top of that, we have a long runway of meaningful revenue synergies ahead of us with every geography benefiting.  In the end, I firmly believe that this portfolio, with its unique profile, can deliver at least 5% organic revenue growth on a consistent basis over the long term. This assumes highly achievable growth objectives for every geography, 3% to 5% in North America, 2% to 3% in Europe and 10% plus in developing markets. On the cost side, we will access the benefits of our significant global scale. With about $50 billion in revenue, we're the world's second largest food company and number one in North America. But I'm not talking about big for bigness sake. In an ever consolidating marketplace, scale is a source of great competitive advantage. Our size and presence in more than 160 countries gives us that scale. Greater scale should lead to meaningful cost savings. As you know, both Kraft and Cadbury each had strong cost savings pipelines. But we're targeting cost synergies of at least $675 million on top of each company's base plans, including Cadbury's vision Into Action program.  Thus far, we've identified potential annual pretax cost savings in three areas: Operational synergies of $300 million; the result of efficiencies and economies of scale in procurement, manufacturing, customer service, logistics and R&D; general and administrative synergies of approximately $250 million; and marketing and selling synergies of $125 million from efficiencies and economies of scale in marketing, media and selling expense. We expect to achieve the run rate on those savings by the end of the third year. And we estimate one-off implementation cash cost of about $1.3 billion. We believe these targets are highly achievable. We'll provide more detail on the flow of both the cost and the benefits in the coming months. This strong pipeline of cost-savings initiatives is designed to accelerate our margin expansion. Productivity savings will better leverage our scale in manufacturing and operations. We'll leverage our overhead costs to fuel further margin expansion. We'll use a portion of these savings to fund higher A&C as a percent of net revenue. And we'll increase investments in sales, R&D and marketing to support future growth. As a result, I firmly believe we can simultaneously fuel investments in quality, marketing and innovation for top line growth, while still delivering healthy, sustainable margin expansion. In fact, we've set our sights on a long-term operating profit margin in the mid to high teens, up from 13.7% in 2009. This combination improves our overall growth profile and positions us for sustainable, profitable growth in the top tier of our industry. We'll be driving high quality organic revenue growth, executing a strong pipeline of cost-savings initiatives, while still increasing investments in marketing, sales and R&D. As we do this, we're targeting long-term organic revenue growth to accelerate from 4% or more, to 5% or more. We'll drive our margins, as I said, to the mid to high teens. And we'll enhance our long-term EPS growth rate from 7% to 9%, to 9% to 11%.  We know that these are aggressive financial targets. But we also know that we have a very unique portfolio and a unique set of opportunities in front of us. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the months ahead. Now, let me turn it over to Tim McLevish."

As of February 4, 75% of Cadbury share",1483,"Thanks, Irene, and good morning. At this point, I'd like to update you on the status of our transaction and discuss what you're going to expect from us going forward. First, here's where we stand in the tender offer. As of February 4, 75% of Cadbury shares have been tendered, which enabled us to initiate the delisting process. So Cadbury will be delisted from the London Stock Exchange as early as March 8. In terms of tenders received to date, as of late last week, over 90% had been tendered. And yesterday, we initiated the process for a compulsory acquisition, also known as a squeeze-out. So within six to seven weeks, we expect to own 100% of Cadbury. And finally, through yesterday, we've completed settlements of all shares accepted through February 2, or about 72%. We've also completed the financing for the transaction. On this chart, you can see a profile of our current debt including Cadbury's outstanding debentures. Earlier this month, we successfully raised $9.5 billion in the U.S. in a four-tranche bond offering. As we committed at the outset of this process, we've maintained our investment grade credit rating. Importantly, while maintaining good access to Tier 2 commercial paper. We expect to reduce our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to around 3x over the next 18 to 24 months. We'll deliver through a combination of debt reduction and EBITDA growth. We'll apply proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion from the sale of our Pizza business. Also, under the terms of our agreement with European Commission, we're required to divest certain Cadbury operations in Romania and Poland. The combined revenue of these businesses is approximately $200 million. So these divestitures will provide additional funds, albeit at modest, to further delevering.  As we've stated throughout the transaction, we'll maintain our dividend. However, until our debt leverage targets are achieved, we have no plans to increase it, nor will we be repurchasing any shares. We also expect to draw on our bridge facility in the near term. But we'll quickly take out the balance through a combination of proceeds from the pizza divestiture and cash generated from our operations. From the very beginning of this process, we've set out four key criteria to maintain financial discipline. First, accretive to cash EPS in the second year. This transaction is expected to add approximately $0.05 to earnings in 2011, the first full year of our combined companies. Second, a return on investment well in excess of our cost of capital. And we expect to deliver mid-teens internal rate of return. Third, maintain our investment grade credit rating. This has been confirmed by the rating agencies. And fourth, maintain our dividend per share. With our strong cash flows and the capital structure we put in place, we expect to work down our leverage while still maintaining our dividend. Throughout the process, there were some doubters and much talk about the ultimate size of our checkbook. But as you can see, the final terms of the deal fell well within the balance of our original criteria. So not only is this deal a strategic home run, we've touched all the bases on the financial front as well. Let me now turn to integration. At this point, we've been working with the Cadbury team for less than two weeks. While we don't have all the answers yet, I can share some early thoughts about how we will proceed. Let's start with backroom systems and processes. It would generally be more cost effective and efficient to adopt the Kraft platform. On the other hand with front-room activities, we'll go with the best practice from whichever company has it. And when it comes to people decisions, we choose the best person for the right role. And how will we make those decisions? We have a global team of executives from both companies in charge of bringing our companies together. Tim Cofer is leading from Kraft and he's paired with Mark Reckitt from Cadbury. Tim is ideally suited for his role. He's an 18-year veteran of Kraft, he most recently led our Pizza business. Perhaps even more important, he managed our 26-country European Chocolate business from 2003 through 2006. He's a proven leader who is familiar with growth business and has a relentless focus on cost and quality. Working hand in hand with Tim will be Mark Reckitt. Mark is a 20-year Cadbury veteran. He knows the company through and through, from structure to financials to people. Indeed, he's been a chief architect of the strategies that have made Cadbury so successful. We're delighted that Mark has accepted our offer to partner with Tim in helping us combine our two great companies. Mark embodies the heart and soul of Cadbury. We know he'll be a great partner in helping us truly capture the best of both, and capitalize on the growth opportunities created by this combination. As we work our way through this, Tim, Mark and the rest of the team will be guided by six practical principles. First and foremost, we'll maintain business momentum. Many integrations fail, not because the cost synergies have not been captured, but rather because the Base business has not been properly looked after. We'll minimize the disruption to our day-to-day business so as to keep building and growing our brands. Second principle, we'll follow the money using the 80/20 rule. By that, we mean spending time on those things that will bring the greatest benefit to the organization. Third, capture best of both. Fourth, treat people fairly and with respect. Fifth, move quickly. And sixth, communicate, communicate and communicate. The process will be as fair and as transparent as possible. And we're going to move quickly but prudently. The reality is, we all have a lot of homework to do because of the way this transaction came together. We're just starting some critical conversations. So when can you expect some more answers? Let me share a timeline.  Within the first 45 days, we intend to name the executive team, the leaders of the regions, areas and countries and direct reports to the functional leaders. Once those are completed and within the first 90 days, we intend to announce the next level of management for each region, country and category. We'll also determine whether and how we'll consolidate any region, area and country office locations or our various research and development facilities.  Within six months, we'll finalize the blueprint for our combined manufacturing network. I hope now you can appreciate all that's going on to ensure both the smooth integration and to validate our original assumptions on the deal, which brings me to earnings guidance. At present, our ability to issue earnings guidance remains limited for two important reasons. First, U.K. Listing Authority rules require any earnings forecast to be reported upon by an independent third party. And I can tell you from recent experience, its a time consuming and expensive process. Second, and even more important, is the fact that it's still very early in the integration process.  As I mentioned, we've had less than two weeks to evaluate Cadbury's existing operating plans and financial statements and to begin verifying our initial assumptions regarding synergies. We won't make you wait six months. We expect to issue 2010 earnings guidance and an outlook for 2011 when we announce our first quarter results in May. In the meantime, this is what I can offer to help you build your models. We delivered $2.03 per diluted share in 2009, in line with our recent guidance. We continue to target EPS growth for the Kraft Foods Base business at the high-end of our 7% to 9% long-term growth objective in the near term. We'll be consolidating Cadbury results from February 2 onwards. We're targeting about $0.05 cash accretion to our 2011 Base business from the Cadbury acquisition. That excludes one-time implementation costs of about $1.3 billion which will be incurred over the next three years. It also excludes expenses related to the transaction and incremental non-cash items such as the amortization of the intangibles related to the acquisition.  The divestiture of our Pizza business is expected to lower earnings by about $0.05 per share on an annual basis. And that transaction is expected to close in mid-2010. Overall the combination of Kraft Foods and Cadbury promises to deliver substantial value for our shareholders. This combination will increase our long-term growth targets, while still generating significant near-term benefits. It will accelerate our long-term growth targets to five-plus percent on the top line. And our long term EPS growth target to 9% to 11%. At the same time, we expect the transaction will be accretive to cash EPS and have a mid-teens internal rate of return. Together, these benefits result in a transformational combination that will create a top-tier performer in the global food industry. Thank you, and now we'd be happy to take your questions."

We still have a ways to go in lowering our overall inventory levels and our working capital levels. We have engaged this year in our project saber, which is a sourcing initiative to generate a fair amount of reduced cost, but also to extend the terms and get all of our terms right and our payables.

We'd like to cover three things today. First, I'll provide a progress report for our integration with Cadbury, which is off to an excellent start. Then Tim will provide highlights from our first quarter results released",1404,"Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon. We'd like to cover three things today. First, I'll provide a progress report for our integration with Cadbury, which is off to an excellent start. Then Tim will provide highlights from our first quarter results released earlier today. And finally, we'll discuss our earnings guidance for 2010. So let's begin. 
As I discussed in February at CAGNY, our turnaround over the past three years revitalized our base business and positioned us for future growth, with a more effective organizational structure, with stronger brand equities and with a streamlined cost base. Having positioned our base business to deliver consistent growth in line with peer averages, we then set our sights on top-tier performance on both the top and bottom lines. 
Combining with Cadbury was one of the best ways for us to get there. The new Kraft Foods will drive accelerated organic revenue growth through focused investments and higher growth, higher margin categories, higher growth developing markets and higher growth trade channels. We'll not only fund these investments but we'll also expand our profit margins. We'll accomplish this by reducing costs as we leverage our scale: our global scale in areas like procurement and overheads and our local scale in every major geography, as we take advantage of existing infrastructures to drive profitable volume growth. And by focusing our investments, we'll further enhance our margins by improving our portfolio mix. That's our formula for delivering sustainable top-tier growth. 
So how’s it going so far? As you know, it's been about 90 days since we came together with Cadbury. I'm delighted to report that our integration plans are progressing well. In terms of people, we quickly named the executive leadership team within our original 45-day target. I'm especially pleased that among these leaders, all 10 of Cadbury's top line managers and both of their global category managers are part of our new organization. In fact, about a third of our top 50 leaders are from Cadbury. At this point, almost all business unit, country and functional leaders have been named, literally hundreds of positions. In addition, we're making good progress in determining the right mix of office locations and R&D centers around the world. 
On the business front, we've confirmed our synergy targets. And we're consolidating both companies' legacy cost-saving plans with the synergy programs. Based on these consolidated plans, we're developing new annual targets and three-year strategic plans for each business unit and each corporate function. In these initial days, we've done a lot of work getting the right people in the right jobs and aligning our cost-savings targets. 
But I want to emphasize cost savings are not the big story here. This combination is about growth. And over the next few weeks and months, you'll begin to see more evidence of how our integration plans are laying a solid foundation for the future. Most important while all this work is going on, our businesses have continued to perform well. You've seen our press release and you'll hear more from Tim shortly. But we're quite pleased with our first quarter results, both for the Kraft Foods base business and for the Cadbury business. Everything we've seen so far has only reinforced our decision to acquire Cadbury. 
On the top line, our portfolio is now more heavily weighted towards faster-growing categories, geographies and trade channels. And we're developing a full pipeline of revenue synergies around the world. As a result, I remain confident that over the long term, this portfolio can deliver at least 5% organic revenue growth with about 2/3 of this growth coming from volume/mix. We expect organic revenue growth to accelerate over the next few years. In 2010, we’re targeting our combined organic net revenue growth to be at least 4%, as we integrate Cadbury, set a solid revenue base and begin to plant seeds for future growth. This will consist of approximately 4% organic net revenue growth for Kraft Foods base business and about 5% from Cadbury. 
In 2011 as the integration progresses and we begin to benefit from revenue synergies, we expect combined organic growth of at least 5%, in line with our long-term target. In fact, we've already begun to make investments to realize that growth. As a first step, we're restoring and in some cases accelerating advertising and consumer investments in Cadbury's businesses, particularly gum. And worldwide, we're ramping up our management of global categories beginning with chocolate, biscuits and gum, taking the best practices for both companies. 
Turning now to the bottom line, we have a strong pipeline of cost-savings initiatives to fund our investments and accelerate margin expansion. We're continuing to execute our existing programs, including Cadbury's Vision into Action and initiatives on the Kraft Foods base business in procurement, manufacturing and overhead that we shared with you last September. In fact, we've discovered that the focus areas and programs of the two companies are highly complementary. For instance, from an end-to-end productivity perspective in procurement, both companies expect to deliver savings by trimming their supplier lists and developing strategic partnerships. In manufacturing at our legacy Kraft plants, we're making good progress in using lean manufacturing and Six Sigma Tools to remove bottlenecks, reduce waste, optimize labor and streamline inventories. We'll soon begin rolling out these programs to Cadbury plants as well. 
In terms of overhead, both companies were already targeting zero overhead growth. Together, we'll continue to pursue those aggressive goals in each region. In North America, we're planning zero overhead growth before integration synergies. In Europe where we still have a high absolute level of overheads, we'll continue to target negative overhead growth. And in developing markets where we foresee a double-digit increase in revenue, we're targeting overhead growth at half that rate. We'll spend between $200 million and $250 million to capture these savings. But as we've committed, these expenses will be considered an ongoing cost of doing business and will be included in operating earnings. 
In addition to our base programs, we continue to target pretax cost savings of at least $675 million from integration. The savings will come from three areas: operational synergies of $300 million, as a result of further efficiencies and economies of scale in procurement, manufacturing, supply-chain and R&D; general and administrative synergies of $250 million; and marketing, media and selling synergies of $125 million. 
In terms of the flow of costs and benefits, we expect to spend approximately $1.3 billion to deliver the savings, with about half the spending occurring in 2010. We expect the savings to ramp up beginning next year with more than 90% benefiting our 2012 earnings. In fact, we expect to exit 2012 with a run rate of at least $675 million in savings. 
Each of these targets has a detailed plan behind it and a member of our Executive team responsible for delivering it. At the same time, as I said earlier, we're consolidating our legacy cost-saving plans with the synergy programs. And so the best way to track our progress in the integration will be by monitoring the operating margin of the combined company. 
Going forward, the formula is simple. We're focusing on brand investments to drive volume growth and improve our portfolio mix. We're driving productivity savings by taking advantage of our scale in procurement and manufacturing. We'll leverage our overhead costs to fuel further margin expansion. And we'll reinvest a portion of these savings to drive future growth. It’s a virtuous cycle. We'll simultaneously fund investments in quality, marketing and innovation for top line growth, while delivering healthy, sustainable bottom line margins. We’ve set our sights for mid-teens margins by 2011 and a long-term operating profit margin in the mid- to high teens as the integration is completed. 
In sum, our combination with Cadbury greatly improves our overall profile and positions us for sustainable profitable growth in the top tier of our industry. We'll drive high quality organic revenue growth and execute a strong pipeline of cost savings initiatives. At the same time, we'll increase investments in our brands, in our sales capabilities and in R&D. This will enable us to deliver the long-term targets we laid out several months ago: organic revenue growth of at least 5%, profit margins in the mid- to high teens and EPS growth of 9% to 11%. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Tim, who will take you through our first quarter results and earnings guidance."
739693,100555049,60092,"Kraft Foods Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 06, 2010",2010-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. As Irene indicated earlier, our first quarter showed continued improvement both sequentially and compared with last year. And we're encouraged by the solid performance posted by the Cadbury business in February and March",2085,"Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. As Irene indicated earlier, our first quarter showed continued improvement both sequentially and compared with last year. And we're encouraged by the solid performance posted by the Cadbury business in February and March. On the top line, organic net revenue growth of the combined business was 3.9%. We grew 3.3% in our base business behind focused investments in our priority brands, categories and markets. This reflected the flow-through of the stepped-up advertising investment we made in the fourth quarter of last year. Our Cadbury business reported strong organic growth of 8.2% in the February/March period. New product introductions drove strong gum performance in the Americas. And we realized solid chocolate gains in the U.K. and in Asia. 
Overall, a solid contribution from both the existing and new parts of our portfolio. In fact, our vol/mix performance was up sharply from a year ago and has improved sequentially over the last several quarters. More important, our momentum is broad-based, with each region making good progress in what remains a difficult environment. 
In addition, our key consumer sectors are performing well on a global basis. As you can see, confectionery, snacks and beverages are driving our growth around the world. We are getting great traction in the priority brands that will drive our future top line growth. For example, we're seeing 30% growth from Tang in developing markets, strong performance of Milka and Cadbury in Europe and ongoing success of Oreo in North America and the rest of the world. 
Moving to the profit line, operating income margin for the combined company excluding acquisition integration costs, rose 13.3% in the first quarter. Vol/mix and productivity improvement drove the upside. For our base business, OI margin rose by 40 basis points to 13.5%. This reflected a 170 basis points of upside from operations, driven by vol/mix gains and productivity improvements. But this is partially offset by a negative impact of 130 basis points, due to a change in unrealized gains and losses from hedging activity versus the prior year. Much of this change in unrealized gains and losses reflects the approximately $87 million benefit that we recorded in the first quarter of 2009. 
Our Cadbury business also made a solid profit contribution in February and March. It was driven by good revenue growth and also benefited from the timing of advertising and new product launches. Let me also point out that we continue to expand our OI margin, even while we're integrating the Cadbury business. 
Turning to the EPS line, our first quarter earnings per share demonstrated that our financial momentum has continued during the integration. Starting at the top, we earned $0.45 in Q1 of 2009. $0.04 of that was attributable to the operating income of the pizza business. From a base of $0.41 in earnings from continuing operations, our operating EPS was up nearly 20% to $0.49 a share. This is primarily driven by $0.08 of operating gains from the Kraft Foods base business and $0.07 of additional operating earnings from Cadbury. 
The key offsets to this growth came from the change in unrealized hedging gains and losses, which had a negative impact of $0.05, as well as the additional interest from debt and dilution from shares issued for the Cadbury acquisition. Below the operating EPS line, we incurred about $0.02 of initial integration costs and about $0.24 in acquisition-related costs and financing fees. We also recognized a onetime adjustment to our deferred taxes related to the recently enacted U.S. health care legislation. 
In addition, the combination of a onetime gain on the sale and two months of earnings from the pizza business mounted to $1.01 in EPS in the quarter. As a result, our reported EPS was $1.16. 
Before we get into our earnings guidance, I'll take a few minutes to share some highlights of our business results by geography. North America organic net revenues grew by 1.3%. Our base business organic growth was 1.1%, driven by vol/mix growth of 1.5%. That's lower than our long-term targets. Consumer weakness remains a factor, as you have no doubt heard from other companies. Our growth was also tempered by weakness in natural cheese and a significant decline in merchandising at a key customer that impacted us disproportionately. This was most pronounced in our Snacks and Grocery businesses. 
Despite that, we're driving strong growth in several priority brands such as Oreo, Philadelphia and Oscar Mayer, with focused investments in marketing and innovation. In fact, we drove consumption growth in approximately 80% of our base business in the U.S. Our Cadbury business, we posted growth of 6.4% in February/March reflecting successful new gum products. 
Going forward, we expect the second quarter will continue to be challenging. But the second half will be better, as we lap the merchandising change and continue to benefit from further investments and brand equity. While this means North America will likely be below trend for the full year, this has been built into our guidance. 
In terms of profitability, our operating income margin in North America grew to 17.4%. In our base business, OI margin improved by 180 basis points, reflecting productivity savings and vol/mix gains, partially offset by incremental investments in A&C. Our Cadbury business also posted solid profit performance due to favorable product costs, overhead cost savings and a benefit from the timing of marketing spend. 
In Europe, combined organic net revenues increased 3.1%. In our base business, organic revenues grew by 2.5%. Vol/mix contributed 4.8 points of growth, with gains across all categories, aided in part by earlier shipments of Easter products. 
Pricing was down 2.3 points, as we better aligned pricing with product costs. It's important to note that in 2009, we were diligent in our efforts to price the higher input costs, increase our brand building activities and prune less profitable business. Today, we're seeing the benefits to our top line growth. For instance, in the face of a difficult economic environment, revenues rose in chocolate, coffee and cheese due to new products and increased brand support. And despite some supply problems related to a collapsed roof at a warehouse in France, our performance in biscuits was solid. 
Organic net revenues from our Cadbury business grew 5.3%. This reflected double-digit growth of Dairy Milk in Britain and Ireland, as well as a favorable impact from the Easter shift. Operating income margin in Europe rose to 11.6% on a combined basis. Our base business, OI margin improved by 300 basis points, reflecting strong vol/mix gains and increasing investment in advertising. Our Cadbury business also made a solid contribution in the February/March period, reflecting strong vol/mix. 
Turning now to developing markets, combined organic net revenue increased 10.8%. On our base business, organic revenues rose 10.7%, driven by 5.9 percentage points from vol/mix gains and 4.8 points from pricing. Collectively, our priority brands grew approximately 19%, as investments made in the fourth quarter of last year paid dividends. 
In Asia-Pacific, priority brands grew 30%, led by Oreo and Tang. In Latin America, priority brands grew 22%, led also by Tang. However in CEEMA [Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East And Africa] weak economic conditions and poor category trends tempered growth. But we did gain share in most key markets and priority brands also grew double-digits led by Jacobs. Organic revenues in our Cadbury business grew over 11%, reflecting strength in Latin America and Asia. 
New products and improved distribution of gum led to double-digit growth in Latin America. And gains in India and Australia drove growth in chocolate. Our OM margin in developing markets was 13.2%. Strong net revenue growth drove a 120-basis-point improvement in the profit margin of our base business. However, this margin upside was tempered by investments in marketing. Profit performance in our Cadbury business in February/March reflected better alignment of pricing and costs, as well as improved product mix in Latin America and Asia. Overall, the collective performance of our base business in the first quarter was strong and demonstrated solid momentum in every geography as we began the process of integrating Cadbury. 
Now I'll turn to our earnings guidance. But before we get into the numbers, I think it's instructive to review the key elements of our 2010 earnings profile: First, for our base business, we are targeting the high-end of our 7% to 9% EPS growth objective. And we expect to deliver against this target. Second, we began consolidating Cadbury's results on February 2. So our full year results will reflect 11 months of earnings, as well as all of the related transaction costs and impacts of asset step-ups. 
And the sale of our pizza business closed on March 1. As we’ve stated before, this will reduce our operating earnings this year. But as you saw in our first quarter results, we recognized a onetime gain on the sale as well as some earnings for the months of January and February. 
With those facts as a foundation, let me walk you through the buildup of our 2010 EPS guidance. We start with the fact that 2009 diluted EPS was $2.03. Base Kraft growth should deliver at least $0.18 of additional EPS. We then adjust for the $0.05 impact of the pizza divestiture. This reflects $0.14 of lost operating earnings, including the impact of retained allocated overheads plus a $0.09 benefit to reflect the use of the proceeds. This gets us to EPS from Kraft Foods base business of at least $2.16 for the year, consistent with our previous target. 
Next, let's look at the impact of the Cadbury acquisition. Obviously, our P&L will benefit from the additional income generated by the Cadbury business. But in 2010, this will be offset by three things: cost of financing; incremental amortization and depreciation from asset write-ups; and investments in marketing, as we restore our brand support to appropriate levels. All in, the impact of the Cadbury acquisition will reduce our earnings by about $0.16 this year. As a result, we're targeting operating EPS of at least $2. Of course, we'll work hard to deliver additional upside to these numbers, but given the broad range of growth opportunities, our preference would be to spend back any upside this year to stage the business for faster growth in the future. 
Below the operating EPS line will be several onetime costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Cadbury, as well as a deferred tax charge related to the recent changes in U.S. health care legislation. In total, we expect those to be around $0.60 per share. Finally, discontinued operations reflects the earnings of the pizza business through March 1 as well as a onetime gain on the sale. Combined, this will result in about $0.95 of additional EPS in 2010. 
I would point out that the $1.01 reported in disc ops in Q1 will amount to approximately $0.95 for the full year, due to a difference in average shares outstanding for the respective periods. This gets us to at least $2.35 per diluted share on a reported GAAP basis. 
That's the complete picture for our 2010 earnings guidance. There are a lot of moving parts, but our underlying plans have not changed. And we're even more confident today about our ability to deliver them. While 2010 is an unusual year, 2011 will better reflect the benefits of our transformation and our true earnings power. Our 2011 profile is consistent with the target we've given over the past several months: EPS growth is 7% to 9% for the base business and approximately $0.05 accretion from the Cadbury acquisition on a cash EPS basis. 
So in light of all the moving pieces in 2010 base, we've set a target of mid-teens growth of operating EPS for 2011. That's mid-teens growth of at least $2 of operating EPS we expect this year. Keep in mind, that's higher than our long-term target of 9% to 11%. This reflects the step-up in savings from integration synergies. 
The next slide puts our prospects into a broader perspective. While our base business was poised to deliver sustainable growth in the 7% to 9% range, the acquisition of Cadbury significantly improves our earnings trajectory. As we integrate Cadbury and drive the substantial synergies and growth opportunities now available to us, our combined operating EPS in 2012 will be greater than we could have achieved on our own. Our long-term earnings trajectory is significantly better. Bottom line, the addition of Cadbury will accelerate our long-term earnings growth. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Irene."

Before taking your questions, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on our first three months together with Cadbury, as we proceed on our journey to build a global powerhouse. As I said at the outset today, our integration is progressing extremely well. Inevitably though, this process leads to some redundancies. But running an efficient enterprise is necessary to remain competitive for the long term. That philosophy has been part of both companies' cultures. In fact, a long-term leader of Cadbury once put it this way, “What destroys jobs certainly and permanently is the failure to remain competitive. The company's prime responsibility to everyone who has a stake in it is to retain its competitive edge, even if this means a reduction in jobs in the short run.” That statement is as true today as it was when it was written. We're making the tough choices now that are necessary for long-term success. 
I know that there are some concerns about our ability to maintain base business momentum while integrating Cadbury. But I suggest that our strong first quarter results clearly demonstrate that we can, in fact, walk and chew Trident at the same time. That's a real testament to the commitment and capabilities of our people. And I thank them for all they're doing to lay the foundation for top-tier performance. 
Now, we'd be happy to take your questions."

Increasingly as our portfolio is more global and very much outside the U.S., we're doing very well there, and we need to figure out a shorthand way to give you some better visibility there. And even within the U.S., things have changed quite a bit. If you look at the portfolio, we've exited pizza. We've added gum and candy. We've got much more business in non-measured channels. And also as we look at the number of our franchises, take Mac & Cheese, for example. Whereas once upon a time, we were focused on growing share, we're now bumping up to some high 70s and 80s shares. And so our focus in that category, for example, is category growth. So all in all, we continue to perform directionally well on the metric.

And Tim, really, I guess it was you who said this, but you had the additional marketing spending as a key point as to what constrains the number and puts us at that at least $2 point.

We'd like to cover three things today. First, I'll provide a progress report for our integration with Cadbury, which is off to an excellent start.

First, I'll provide a progress report for our integration with Cadbury, which is off to an excellent start. Then Tim will provide highlights from our first quarter results released earlier today. And finally, we'll discuss our earnings guidance for 2010. So let's begin. 
As I discussed in February at CAGNY, our turnaround over the past three years revitalized our base business and positioned us for future growth, with a more effective organizational structure, with stronger brand equities and with a streamlined cost base. Having positioned our base business to deliver consistent growth in line with peer averages, we then set our sights on top-tier performance on both the top and bottom lines. 
Combining with Cadbury was one of the best ways for us to get there. The new Kraft Foods will drive accelerated organic revenue growth through focused investments and higher growth, higher margin categories, higher growth developing markets and higher growth trade channels. We'll not only fund these investments but we'll also expand our profit margins. We'll accomplish this by reducing costs as we leverage our scale, our global scale in areas like procurement and overheads, and our local scale in every major geography, as we take advantage of existing infrastructures to drive profitable volume growth. And by focusing our investments, we'll further enhance our margins by improving our portfolio mix. That's our formula for delivering sustainable top-tier growth. 
So how’s it going so far? As you know, it's been about 90 days since we came together with Cadbury. I'm delighted to report that our integration plans are progressing well. In terms of people, we quickly named the executive leadership team within our original 45-day target. I'm especially pleased that among these leaders, all 10 of Cadbury's top line managers and both of their global category managers are part of our new organization. In fact, about a third of our top 50 leaders are from Cadbury. At this point, almost all business unit, country and functional leaders have been named, literally hundreds of positions. In addition, we're making good progress in determining the right mix of office locations and R&D centers around the world. 
On the business front, we've confirmed our synergy targets. And we're consolidating both companies' legacy cost-saving plans with the synergy programs. Based on these consolidated plans, we're developing new annual targets and three-year strategic plans for each business unit and each corporate function. In these initial days, we've done a lot of work getting the right people in the right jobs and aligning our cost-savings targets. 
But I want to emphasize cost savings are not the big story here. This combination is about growth. And over the next few weeks and months, you'll begin to see more evidence of how our integration plans are laying a solid foundation for the future. Most important while all this work is going on, our businesses have continued to perform well. You've seen our press release and you'll hear more from Tim shortly. But we're quite pleased with our first quarter results, both for the Kraft Foods base business and for the Cadbury business. Everything we've seen so far has only reinforced our decision to acquire Cadbury. 
On the top line, our portfolio is now more heavily weighted towards faster-growing categories, geographies and trade channels. And we're developing a full pipeline of revenue synergies around the world. As a result, I remain confident that over the long term, this portfolio can deliver at least 5% organic revenue growth with about 2/3 of this growth coming from volume mix. We expect organic revenue growth to accelerate over the next few years. In 2010, we’re targeting our combined organic net revenue growth to be at least 4%, as we integrate Cadbury, set a solid revenue base and begin to plant seeds for future growth. This will consist of approximately 4% organic net revenue growth for Kraft Foods base business and about 5% from Cadbury. 
In 2011 as the integration progresses and we begin to benefit from revenue synergies, we expect combined organic growth of at least 5%, in line with our long-term target. In fact, we've already begun to make investments to realize that growth. As a first step, we're restoring and in some cases accelerating advertising and consumer investments in Cadbury's businesses, particularly gum. And worldwide, we're ramping up our management of global categories beginning with chocolate, biscuits and gum, taking the best practices for both companies. 
Turning now to the bottom line, we have a strong pipeline of cost-savings initiatives to fund our investments and accelerate margin expansion. We're continuing to execute our existing programs, including Cadbury's Vision into Action and initiatives on the Kraft Foods base business in procurement, manufacturing and overhead that we shared with you last September. In fact, we've discovered that the focus areas and programs of the two companies are highly complementary. For instance, from an end-to-end productivity perspective in procurement, both companies expect to deliver savings by trimming their supplier lists and developing strategic partnerships. In manufacturing at our legacy Kraft plants, we're making good progress in using lean manufacturing and Six Sigma Tools to remove bottlenecks, reduce waste, optimize labor and streamline inventories. We'll soon begin rolling out these programs to Cadbury plants as well. 
In terms of overhead, both companies were already targeting zero overhead growth. Together, we'll continue to pursue those aggressive goals in each region. In North America, we're planning zero overhead growth before integration synergies. In Europe where we still have a high absolute level of overheads, we'll continue to target negative overhead growth. And in developing markets where we foresee a double-digit increase in revenue, we're targeting overhead growth at half that rate. We'll spend between $200 million and $250 million to capture these savings. But as we've committed, these expenses will be considered an ongoing cost of doing business and will be included in operating earnings. 
In addition to our base programs, we continue to target pretax cost savings of at least $675 million from integration. The savings will come from three areas: operational synergies of $300 million, as a result of further efficiencies and economies of scale in procurement, manufacturing, supply-chain and R&D; general and administrative synergies of $250 million; and marketing, media and selling synergies of $125 million. 
In terms of the flow of costs and benefits, we expect to spend approximately $1.3 billion to deliver the savings, with about half the spending occurring in 2010. We expect the savings to ramp up beginning next year with more than 90% benefiting our 2012 earnings. In fact, we expect to exit 2012 with a run rate of at least $675 million in savings. 
Each of these targets has a detailed plan behind it and a member of our Executive team responsible for delivering it. At the same time, as I said earlier, we're consolidating our legacy cost-saving plans with the synergy programs. And so the best way to track our progress in the integration will be by monitoring the operating margin of the combined company. 
Going forward, the formula is simple. We're focusing on brand investments to drive volume growth and improve our portfolio mix. We're driving productivity savings by taking advantage of our scale in procurement and manufacturing. We'll leverage our overhead costs to fuel further margin expansion. And we'll reinvest a portion of these savings to drive future growth. It’s a virtuous cycle. We'll simultaneously fund investments in quality, marketing and innovation for top line growth, while delivering healthy, sustainable bottom line margins. We’ve set our sights for mid-teens margins by 2011 and a long-term operating profit margin in the mid- to high teens as the integration is completed. 
In sum, our combination with Cadbury greatly improves our overall profile and positions us for sustainable profitable growth in the top tier of our industry. We'll drive high quality organic revenue growth and execute a strong pipeline of cost savings initiatives. At the same time, we'll increase investments in our brands, in our sales capabilities and in R&D. This will enable us to deliver the long-term targets we laid out several months ago: organic revenue growth of at least 5%, profit margins in the mid- to high teens and EPS growth of 9% to 11%. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Tim, who will take you through our first quarter results and earnings guidance."
739693,100555049,61730,"Kraft Foods Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 06, 2010",2010-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. As Irene indicated earlier, our first quarter showed continued improvement both sequentially and compared with last year. And we're encouraged by the solid performance posted by the Cadbury business in February and March",2086,"Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. As Irene indicated earlier, our first quarter showed continued improvement both sequentially and compared with last year. And we're encouraged by the solid performance posted by the Cadbury business in February and March. On the top line, organic net revenue growth of the combined business was 3.9%. We grew 3.3% in our base business behind focused investments in our priority brands, categories and markets. This reflected the flow-through of the stepped-up advertising investment we made in the fourth quarter of last year. Our Cadbury business reported strong organic growth of 8.2% in the February/March period. New product introductions drove strong gum performance in the Americas. And we realized solid chocolate gains in the U.K. and in Asia. 
Overall, a solid contribution from both the existing and new parts of our portfolio. In fact, our vol/mix performance was up sharply from a year ago and has improved sequentially over the last several quarters. More important, our momentum is broad-based, with each region making good progress in what remains a difficult environment. 
In addition, our key consumer sectors are performing well on a global basis. As you can see, confectionery, snacks and beverages are driving our growth around the world. We are getting great traction in the priority brands that will drive our future top line growth. For example, we're seeing 30% growth from Tang in developing markets, strong performance of Milka and Cadbury in Europe and ongoing success of Oreo in North America and the rest of the world. 
Moving to the profit line, operating income margin for the combined company excluding acquisition integration costs, rose 13.3% in the first quarter. Vol/mix and productivity improvement drove the upside. For our base business, OI margin rose by 40 basis points to 13.5%. This reflected a 170 basis points of upside from operations, driven by vol/mix gains and productivity improvements. But this is partially offset by a negative impact of 130 basis points, due to a change in unrealized gains and losses from hedging activity versus the prior year. Much of this change in unrealized gains and losses reflects the approximately $87 million benefit that we recorded in the first quarter of 2009. 
Our Cadbury business also made a solid profit contribution in February and March. It was driven by good revenue growth and also benefited from the timing of advertising and new product launches. Let me also point out that we continue to expand our OI margin, even while we're integrating the Cadbury business. 
Turning to the EPS line, our first quarter earnings per share demonstrated that our financial momentum has continued during the integration. Starting at the top, we earned $0.45 in Q1 of 2009. $0.04 of that was attributable to the operating income of the pizza business. From a base of $0.41 in earnings from continuing operations, our operating EPS was up nearly 20% to $0.49 a share. This is primarily driven by $0.08 of operating gains from the Kraft Foods base business and $0.07 of additional operating earnings from Cadbury. 
The key offsets to this growth came from the change in unrealized hedging gains and losses, which had a negative impact of $0.05, as well as the additional interest from debt and dilution from shares issued for the Cadbury acquisition. Below the operating EPS line, we incurred about $0.02 of initial integration costs and about $0.24 in acquisition-related costs and financing fees. We also recognized a onetime adjustment to our deferred taxes related to the recently enacted U.S. health care legislation. 
In addition, the combination of a onetime gain on the sale and two months of earnings from the pizza business mounted to $1.01 in EPS in the quarter. As a result, our reported EPS was $1.16. 
Before we get into our earnings guidance, I'll take a few minutes to share some highlights of our business results by geography. North America organic net revenues grew by 1.3%. Our base business organic growth was 1.1%, driven by vol/mix growth of 1.5%. That's lower than our long-term targets. Consumer weakness remains a factor, as you have no doubt heard from other companies. Our growth was also tempered by weakness in natural cheese and a significant decline in merchandising at a key customer that impacted us disproportionately. This was most pronounced in our Snacks and Grocery businesses. 
Despite that, we're driving strong growth in several priority brands such as Oreo, Philadelphia and Oscar Mayer, with focused investments in marketing and innovation. In fact, we drove consumption growth in approximately 80% of our base business in the U.S. Our Cadbury business, we posted growth of 6.4% in February/March reflecting successful new gum products. 
Going forward, we expect the second quarter will continue to be challenging. But the second half will be better, as we lap the merchandising change and continue to benefit from further investments and brand equity. While this means North America will likely be below trend for the full year, this has been built into our guidance. 
In terms of profitability, our operating income margin in North America grew to 17.4%. In our base business, OI margin improved by 180 basis points, reflecting productivity savings and vol/mix gains, partially offset by incremental investments in A&C. Our Cadbury business also posted solid profit performance due to favorable product costs, overhead cost savings and a benefit from the timing of marketing spend. 
In Europe, combined organic net revenues increased 3.1%. In our base business, organic revenues grew by 2.5%. Vol/mix contributed 4.8 points of growth, with gains across all categories, aided in part by earlier shipments of Easter products. 
Pricing was down 2.3 points, as we better aligned pricing with product costs. It's important to note that in 2009, we were diligent in our efforts to price the higher input costs, increase our brand building activities and prune less profitable business. Today, we're seeing the benefits to our top line growth. For instance, in the face of a difficult economic environment, revenues rose in chocolate, coffee and cheese due to new products and increased brand support. And despite some supply problems related to a collapsed roof at a warehouse in France, our performance in biscuits was solid. 
Organic net revenues from our Cadbury business grew 5.3%. This reflected double-digit growth of Dairy Milk in Britain and Ireland, as well as a favorable impact from the Easter shift. Operating income margin in Europe rose to 11.6% on a combined basis. Our base business, OI margin improved by 300 basis points, reflecting strong vol/mix gains and increasing investment in advertising. Our Cadbury business also made a solid contribution in the February/March period, reflecting strong vol/mix. 
Turning now to developing markets, combined organic net revenue increased 10.8%. On our base business, organic revenues rose 10.7%, driven by 5.9 percentage points from vol/mix gains and 4.8 points from pricing. Collectively, our priority brands grew approximately 19%, as investments made in the fourth quarter of last year paid dividends. 
In Asia-Pacific, priority brands grew 30%, led by Oreo and Tang. In Latin America, priority brands grew 22%, led also by Tang. However in CEEMA [Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East And Africa] weak economic conditions and poor category trends tempered growth. But we did gain share in most key markets and priority brands also grew double-digits led by Jacobs. Organic revenues in our Cadbury business grew over 11%, reflecting strength in Latin America and Asia. 
New products and improved distribution of gum led to double-digit growth in Latin America. And gains in India and Australia drove growth in chocolate. Our OM margin in developing markets was 13.2%. Strong net revenue growth drove a 120-basis-point improvement in the profit margin of our base business. However, this margin upside was tempered by investments in marketing. Profit performance in our Cadbury business in February/March reflected better alignment of pricing and costs, as well as improved product mix in Latin America and Asia. Overall, the collective performance of our base business in the first quarter was strong and demonstrated solid momentum in every geography as we began the process of integrating Cadbury. 
Now I'll turn to our earnings guidance. But before we get into the numbers, I think it's instructive to review the key elements of our 2010 earnings profile: First, for our base business, we are targeting the high-end of our 7% to 9% EPS growth objective. And we expect to deliver against this target. Second, we began consolidating Cadbury's results on February 2. So our full year results will reflect 11 months of earnings, as well as all of the related transaction costs and impacts of asset step-ups. 
And the sale of our pizza business closed on March 1. As we’ve stated before, this will reduce our operating earnings this year. But as you saw in our first quarter results, we recognized a onetime gain on the sale as well as some earnings for the months of January and February. 
With those facts as a foundation, let me walk you through the buildup of our 2010 EPS guidance. We start with the fact that 2009 diluted EPS was $2.03. Base Kraft growth should deliver at least $0.18 of additional EPS. We then adjust for the $0.05 impact of the pizza divestiture. This reflects $0.14 of lost operating earnings, including the impact of retained allocated overheads plus a $0.09 benefit to reflect the use of the proceeds. This gets us to EPS from Kraft Foods base business of at least $2.16 for the year, consistent with our previous target. 
Next, let's look at the impact of the Cadbury acquisition. Obviously, our P&L will benefit from the additional income generated by the Cadbury business. But in 2010, this will be offset by three things: cost of financing; incremental amortization and depreciation from asset write-ups; and investments in marketing, as we restore our brand support to appropriate levels. All in, the impact of the Cadbury acquisition will reduce our earnings by about $0.16 this year. As a result, we're targeting operating EPS of at least $2. Of course, we'll work hard to deliver additional upside to these numbers, but given the broad range of growth opportunities, our preference would be to spend back any upside this year to stage the business for faster growth in the future. 
Below the operating EPS line will be several one-time costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Cadbury, as well as a deferred tax charge related to the recent changes in U.S. health care legislation. In total, we expect those to be around $0.60 per share. Finally, discontinued operations reflects the earnings of the pizza business through March 1 as well as a one-time gain on the sale. Combined, this will result in about $0.95 of additional EPS in 2010. 
I would point out that the $1.01 reported in disc ops in Q1 will amount to approximately $0.95 for the full year, due to a difference in average shares outstanding for the respective periods. This gets us to at least $2.35 per diluted share on a reported GAAP basis. 
That's the complete picture for our 2010 earnings guidance. There are a lot of moving parts, but our underlying plans have not changed. And we're even more confident today about our ability to deliver them. While 2010 is an unusual year, 2011 will better reflect the benefits of our transformation and our true earnings power. Our 2011 profile is consistent with the target we've given over the past several months: EPS growth is 7% to 9% for the base business; and approximately $0.05 accretion from the Cadbury acquisition on a cash EPS basis. 
So in light of all the moving pieces in 2010 base, we've set a target of mid-teens growth of operating EPS for 2011. That's mid-teens growth of at least $2 of operating EPS we expect this year. Keep in mind, that's higher than our long-term target of 9% to 11%. This reflects the step-up in savings from integration synergies. 
The next slide puts our prospects into a broader perspective. While our base business was poised to deliver sustainable growth in the 7% to 9% range, the acquisition of Cadbury significantly improves our earnings trajectory. As we integrate Cadbury and drive the substantial synergies and growth opportunities now available to us, our combined operating EPS in 2012 will be greater than we could have achieved on our own. And our long-term earnings trajectory is significantly better. Bottom line, the addition of Cadbury will accelerate our long-term earnings growth. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Irene."

Before taking your questions, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on our first three months together with Cadbury, as we proceed on our journey to build a global powerhouse. As I said at the outset today, our integration is progressing extremely well. Inevitably though, this process leads to some redundancies. But running an efficient enterprise is necessary to remain competitive for the long term. That philosophy has been part of both companies' cultures. In fact, a long-term leader of Cadbury once put it this way, “What destroys jobs certainly and permanently is the failure to remain competitive. The company's prime responsibility to everyone who has a stake in it is to retain its competitive edge, even if this means a reduction in jobs in the short run.” That statement is as true today as it was when it was written. We're making the tough choices now that are necessary for long-term success. 
I know that there are some concerns about our ability to maintain base business momentum while integrating Cadbury. But I suggest that our strong first quarter results clearly demonstrate that we can, in fact, walk and chew Trident at the same time. That's a real testament to the commitment and capabilities of our people. And I thank them for all they're doing to lay the foundation for top-tier performance.

The reality is as you said -- and we'll talk more about this as we present our strategic plan in the fall -- it's a less relevant metric today given the portfolio. Three years ago, when we laid this out as a metric, North America was 60% of our revenue, and we had a lot of things that needed to be fixed, particularly in the United States. And so using an aggregate metric like that was a good surrogate for the overall health of the business. Increasingly as our portfolio is more global and very much outside the U.S., we're doing very well there, and we need to figure out a shorthand way to give you some better visibility there. And even within the U.S., things have changed quite a bit. If you look at the portfolio, we've exited pizza. We've added gum and candy. We've got much more business in non-measured channels. And also as we look at the number of our franchises, take Mac & Cheese, for example. Whereas once upon a time, we were focused on growing share, we're now bumping up to some high 70s and 80s shares. And so our focus in that category, for example, is category growth. So all in all, we continue to perform directionally well on the metric. We do think though that as we start to look now at this combined portfolio and its overall profile, that we will want to talk to you about some perhaps better and more useful performance metrics."

And the consumer environment continues to be weak in many markets. Nonetheless, we reported strong second quarter earnings. Our bottom line was high quality, driven by gross margin expansion from volume/mix and productivity as well as overhead savings. Our top line performance, however, was mixed, primarily due to softness in the United States. Our U.S. top line continued to be affected by two things: greatly reduced merchandising support from a key customer, which we foreshadowed in the first quarter; and a significant step-up in promotional activity in a few categories. 
We have solid plans in place to address these issues. And that will result in sequential improvement in top line results in the second half. However, I'm very pleased with the ongoing strength in Europe and developing markets. We expect our earnings momentum to continue in the second half. This momentum will enable us to invest in the business, while still delivering at least $2 in operating EPS. These incremental investments will restore growth in North America and fuel top line momentum internationally. 
Let me now turn it over to Tim to discuss the second quarter results in more detail."
739693,109140167,72585,"Kraft Foods Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. Let me start by discussing our top line, which as Irene mentioned, was a somewhat mixed performance from our perspective. Organic net revenue growth of the combined business was 2.2%. The Kraft Foods base business grew 2",1694,"Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. Let me start by discussing our top line, which as Irene mentioned, was a somewhat mixed performance from our perspective. Organic net revenue growth of the combined business was 2.2%. The Kraft Foods base business grew 2%. Continued focus on investments in priority brands, categories and markets drove 2.2 points of all mixed gains, while pricing was slightly negative. 
In Europe and developing markets, we delivered strong volume/mix, but in the U.S, we continue to have headwinds, including a weak consumer environment, significantly lower merchandising levels and aggressive promotional activity in a few categories, mainly within our Cheese, Grocery and Snacks businesses. There were some bright spots, however. Investments in priority brands drove solid growth in our Beverage, Convenient Meals and Canadian businesses. 
Our growth model leverages volume/mix as a key driver in expanding margins over time. This next slide shows the increased contribution of volume/mix to the Kraft Foods base business over the past five quarters. Our Q2 vol/mix was somewhat below Q1, but we're not satisfied with that performance. But at the same time, I'd make three observations that make us optimistic about the future: First, our brand equity investments in quality, marketing and innovation continued to drive meaningful gains versus last year. This came despite a very difficult environment in many markets. Second, we feel good about the expanding geographic footprint of our portfolio over the past several years even before the Cadbury acquisition. In fact, through the first six months of the year, the strength of our international operations drove overall vol/mix gain of 2.6 points, despite a vol/mix decline of 30 basis points in North America. And third, the majority of our key North American programs are back half-weighted. So even though we expect economic conditions to remain challenging, we're confident in our ability to continue to drive vol/mix gains for the remainder of the year. 
Picking back up on Q2 revenue growth. Our Cadbury business reported organic growth of 3.3%. It was driven by very strong Gum performance in the Americas, fueled by the success of new products. Chocolate gains in the U.K. and India also contributed to the growth. Top line growth was tempered two factors: a negative impact of about 0.5 percentage point from the shift of Easter-related shipments into the first quarter, and weak economic conditions affecting the Gum category in several markets including southern Europe, Japan and South Africa. 
Turning to profit. On a combined basis, our operating income margin, excluding acquisition integration costs, was 15.2%. In our Kraft Foods base business, volume growth and improved product mix contributed 70 basis points of margin improvement. In addition, our productivity- and overhead cost savings initiatives are starting to contribute in a more significant way. Despite rising costs, we delivered gross margin gains in all geographic regions. This enabled a double-digit increase in A&C. And as a result of this virtuous circle, our base Kraft operating income margin rose by 110 basis points to 16%. Our Cadbury business also made a solid contribution to profit in the quarter. Product mix, productivity gains and the timing of marketing spending drove the improvement. 
Turning to EPS, our second quarter earnings reflect continued financial momentum as we integrate Cadbury. Starting at the top, we earned $0.56 in Q2 of 2009 with $0.03 of that coming from the divested Pizza business. So from a year ago base of $0.53, our operating EPS was up more than 13% to $0.60. This was primarily driven by $0.08 of operating gains from the Kraft base business. The $0.11 of operating earnings from Cadbury were offset by $0.14 of higher interest expense and the change in shares outstanding primarily related to the acquisition. 
I'd also note that certain discrete tax items, including the settlement of audits, benefited operating EPS this quarter by $0.03 on a year-over-year basis. Below the operating EPS line, we incurred $0.06 of integration costs and $0.01 in acquisition-related costs, resulting in our reported EPS of $0.53. 
On a year-to-date basis, earnings are also running ahead of expectations. For the first half, we generated $0.16 of operating gains from the Kraft Foods base business. That's roughly 17 percentage points of EPS growth from base operations. So we've had a very strong start to the year on the earnings front. Given that strength, we've made the strategic decision to reinvest the upside this year. This will ensure that we're doing the right things to strengthen our business in this difficult market and to stage the business for faster growth in the future. As a result, even though the first half came in stronger than expected, we're holding our full-year operating EPS guidance to at least $2. 
I'll take a few minutes now to share highlights of our business results by geography. At Kraft Foods North America, organic net revenues on a combined basis fell by 1.3%. Our base business results came in weaker than expected, declining by 1.9%. So what happened? Our performance was driven by four factors: a continued weak consumer environment; lower sales growth at a key U.S. customer due to changes in their merchandising that affected us disproportionately; aggressive promotional activity in a few U.S. categories, especially Biscuits, Cheese and Salad Dressings; and about a 50 basis point impact from the Easter shift. 
Despite these headwinds, we've continued to invest in brand-building activities. In fact, several of our key brands posted revenue growth behind great new advertising. For sample, Capri Sun and Kool-Aid ready to drink beverages and Maxwell House coffee were up double digit. And Oscar Mayer Bacon and Hotdogs, Kraft Mac and Cheese and Planters Nuts posted strong growth. And as we look ahead, we expect solid growth behind key programming initiatives and improved merchandising support in the second half of the year. 
In our Cadbury business, we produced strong growth of 7.5%. This was a driven by the success of several Gum products including Trident Layers, Stride Shift and Dentyne Pure. Now in light of that excellent performance, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that we will lap the highly successful launch of Trident Layers beginning in Q3. 
Now let's look at profitability. In our base business, OI margin improved by 70 basis points to 19.1%. This reflected strong productivity gains, but they were partially offset by incremental investments at A&C and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower volume. Our Cadbury business also posted solid profit performance. It delivered productivity gains and improved product mix that was partially offset by higher spending behind new products. As a result, our operating income margin for the combined company in North America grew to 19.4%. 
In Europe, combined organic net revenues increased 3.9%. In our base business, organic revenues grew 5.2%. Included in this number was a 2.5 point benefit from harmonizing the accounting calendar in some of our European Biscuit operations as we completed the integration of the LU Biscuit business. This is partially offset by 70 basis points from the Easter shift. Adjusting for these small impacts, the revenue in our base business was still strong and exceeded expectations. Our priority brands collectively grew 8% as increased focus and marketing support drove volume and mix gains. 
What's more? The strong performance was broad-based with growth in every category. Chocolate grew behind strength in Milka, Toblerone, Freia and Marabou, and we also posted share gains in several key markets including Germany and France. Coffee grew behind the Jacobs in Germany and a double-digit increase in Tassimo. 
Cheese grew behind the continuing success of new packaging and marketing of Philadelphia. It was up strongly in key markets such as the U.K. and Italy. And Biscuits grew double digits behind the successful launch of Cote d'Or in Belgium and Oreo in France. In fact, Oreo grew 45% overall across Europe. 
In our Cadbury business, organic net revenues were flat. Modest base growth was offset by a negative impact of about one percentage point due to the Easter shift. We generated solid growth in core markets such as the U.K. and France, but this was offset by a soft consumer environment in southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Greece. 
Operating income margin in Europe rose to 13.2% on a combined basis. In our base business, OI margin improved by 220 basis points to 12.2%. This reflected strong volume/mix gains and overhead leverage that was partially offset by the effect of lower price levels and an increase in advertising.  Our Cadbury business also made a solid profit contribution in the quarter. Product mix improved and we began to realize the benefits of supply chain efficiencies. 
Turning now to developing markets, where combined organic net revenue increased 8.1%. In our base business, organic revenues grew again at a double-digit rate of 10.4%. The driver was volume/mix gains as we continued to invest in priority brands across the region. Plus a roughly one half point benefit from an accounting calendar change for certain operations in Asia-Pacific. Collectively, our priority brands grew more than 17%. Specifically, in Asia-Pacific priority brands grew nearly 30%, lead by Tang powdered beverages and Oreo cookies.  In China, for example, Oreo grew by more than 70%. In Latin America, priority brands grew nearly 20%. They were again led by Oreo and Tang, plus strong gains from Lacta chocolate. And in CEEMA, despite a very weak consumer environment, priority brands grew 9% led by Jacobs coffee. 
Organic revenues in our Cadbury business grew 4% in developing markets. New products and improved distribution drove high single-digit growth in Latin America. We also generated double-digit chocolate gains in India. Growth was tempered, however, by weak Gum category trends in Mexico, Japan and South Africa. Our operating income margin in developing markets was about 14%. Our base business profit margins improved by 50 basis points. This was driven primarily by strong gains in vol/mix and overhead leverage. 
Margin upside was dampened somewhat by higher input costs and a double-digit increase in A&C. Profit performance in our Cadbury business was also solid. It reflected a better alignment of pricing and costs, as well as improved product mix. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Irene."

As we look back over a very eventful first half of 2010, we're beginning to realize the benefits of several things. Our improved portfolio mix, our broader geographic footprint, our significant brand investments and our cost savings initiatives. This is creating a virtuous circle that will enable us to accelerate volume and mix gains, leverage our scale and drive down overhead costs, and generate additional earnings that can be reinvested in the business. 
Our businesses in Europe and developing markets delivered exceptional performance through the first six months of the year. We posted both strong vol/mix and market share gains. In North America, despite some headwinds, our investments generated solid base consumption growth for a number of our priority brands. And across the portfolio, volume/mix gains and cost savings expanded both gross- and operating margins. This in turn is enabling incremental investments behind our priority brands around the world. 
On the bottom-line, operating EPS rose 18%, driven by strong operating gains in the Kraft Foods base business. 
Turning to Cadbury, the integration continues to progress extremely well. The acquisition has provided a great infusion of new talent. In fact as we've named the business unit-, country- and functional leaders around the world, about a third of our four hundred most senior leaders come from Cadbury. We've also made excellent progress in identifying synergies. We now expect to deliver greater cost savings and to do so even faster than we had originally planned. Specifically, we expect to generate at least $750 million in annual savings. And we'll deliver about 15% of the savings in 2010 versus a prior estimate of 10%.  The total cost to generate these savings will be slightly higher, about $1.5 billion versus our prior estimate of $1.3 billion. But the pacing of costs should be about the same. Although there have been very few surprises during the integration, there are two areas worth mentioning. 
First, we've seen some baseline weakness in a few core markets as the businesses were pushed hard in the heat of battle last year. We anticipated this and had begun to reinvest in these markets. We expect they will begin to recover as we exit the year.
Second, we discovered that Cadbury distributors carried fairly high trade inventories in a few markets. We intend to normalize those levels. This will result in lower revenue growth in the second half of the year, but it will provide us with a more efficient supply chain going forward and stage the business for future growth. 
Turning now to our 2010 outlook. In terms of organic revenue growth, we've adjusted our target to 3% to 4% growth from at least 4%. This reflects the slower than anticipated start in the first half, the impact of aggressive promotional activity and the normalizing of Cadbury trade inventory in select markets. 
Where we ultimately fall within that range will depend on the consumer environment globally, as well as whether or not merchandising changes are implemented by a key U.S. customer. If these mutually beneficial merchandising opportunities occur, we'll be higher in the range. If not, we'll be lower. Regardless, our objective is to build a solid revenue base from which we will generate profitable top-tier growth. On the bottom line, as we've said, we expect to deliver operating EPS of at least $2.00, while funding the initiatives we've mentioned. This will enable us to build an even stronger foundation for 2011. 
So to sum up, we've continued to make progress toward our goal of building a global powerhouse. Our integration is on track and we 're delivering greater synergies faster than expected. We're beginning to reap the benefits of a more diverse global portfolio. We're delivering strong, high-quality base business earnings growth, and most importantly, we're reinvesting our upside this year to further strengthen our brands and lay the foundation for top-tier performance in 2011. We'd now be happy to take your questions."

We'll remain disciplined as we move forward here, but I will say that as category leader, we will not continue to tolerate share gains being driven by aggressive promotional pricing. So you will see some increase in our promotional spending in select U.S. categories in the second half. But that is reflected in our guidance, and as I said, we expect that our second half revenue will be primarily driven by vol/mix. With respect to the question about the contribution, as you saw, pricing contributed very little to our overall performance in aggregate or in North America.

We continue to move our business toward our ultimate endpoint of 8% to 9% of revenue in A&C. We're making very good progress there and as you heard, we made significant investments in the first half of the year, we're up double digits, which takes us to about 7.5% or so of revenue on a base Kraft; the total company's actually closer to 8% because Cadbury comes in at a somewhat higher spending level. And we expect to continue to see that relationship continue in the back half. As we mentioned, we had fairly significant back half loading in our base Kraft programming, or actually in our planned programming, and now that we are now anticipating spending some additional monies in the back half, you will see even more of a contribution on the marketing side. That is what gives us great confidence that we will be able to see sequential improvement in our top line. With respect to the questions as to how our merchandising plan's progressing, we obviously have seen this. Our major U.S. customer has been quite public in suggesting that perhaps they went a little bit too far in a changing their merchandising philosophy. We have a very strong set of consumer programs, plans for the back half of the year, and we will work together to realize those opportunities.

Obviously, the larger overhead you're looking at right now for the combined company has a lot of Cadbury overhead in it and of course, that's a big part of our synergy.

I think Mike Clark shared with you and others last Fall, the plan that we've laid out. It's a combination of continuing to push more profitable volume, continuing to make some significant reductions in overhead and we have the benefit of integration both of the LU business, as well as now the Cadbury business as a further opportunity, as well as the broader opportunities that we have across the company in procurement and conversion.

In the first half, we also stage over the first quarter the share issuance for their business and also the interest on the bonds. So we don't have the full effect from the share dilution in the first half, the second half it about doubles. Interest almost doubles and we did have some additional back-end weighting of A&C investment based in their base plan. So that $0.16 still holds, it was about $0.03 in the first half, about $0.13 in the second half as a result of those factors."

The bigger issue is just that in the heat of battle, we knew that Cadbury has perhaps pushed some of their businesses. We also understood that we've got a challenging first half-second half comparison when we put the plans together. So we expected to reinvest in those businesses. We already have made a number of investments in Europe, in the U.S. and elsewhere.

And the consumer environment continues to be weak in many markets. Nonetheless, we reported strong second quarter earnings. Our bottom line was high quality, driven by gross margin expansion from volume/mix and productivity as well as overhead savings. Our top line performance, however, was mixed, primarily due to softness in the United States. Our U.S. top line continued to be affected by two things: greatly reduced merchandising support from a key customer, which we foreshadowed in the first quarter; and a significant step-up in promotional activity in a few categories. 
We have solid plans in place to address these issues. And that will result in sequential improvement in top line results in the second half. However, I'm very pleased with the ongoing strength in Europe and developing markets. We expect our earnings momentum to continue in the second half. This momentum will enable us to invest in the business, while still delivering at least $2 in operating EPS. These incremental investments will restore growth in North America and fuel top line momentum internationally. 
Let me now turn it over to Tim to discuss the second quarter results in more detail."
739693,109140167,74734,"Kraft Foods Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. Let me start by discussing our top line, which as Irene mentioned, was a somewhat mixed performance from our perspective. Organic net revenue growth of the combined business was 2.2%. The Kraft Foods base business grew 2",1693,"Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. Let me start by discussing our top line, which as Irene mentioned, was a somewhat mixed performance from our perspective. Organic net revenue growth of the combined business was 2.2%. The Kraft Foods base business grew 2%. Continued focus on investments in priority brands, categories and markets drove 2.2 points of all mixed gains, while pricing was slightly negative. 
In Europe and developing markets, we delivered strong volume/mix, but in the U.S., we continue to have headwinds, including a weak consumer environment, significantly lower merchandising levels and aggressive promotional activity in a few categories, mainly within our Cheese, Grocery and Snacks businesses. There were some bright spots, however. Investments in priority brands drove solid growth in our Beverage, Convenient Meals and Canadian businesses. 
Our growth model leverages volume/mix as a key driver in expanding margins over time. This next slide shows the increased contribution of volume/mix to the Kraft Foods base business over the past five quarters. Our Q2 vol/mix was somewhat below Q1, but we're not satisfied with that performance. But at the same time, I'd make three observations that make us optimistic about the future: First, our brand equity investments in quality, marketing and innovation continued to drive meaningful gains versus last year. This came despite a very difficult environment in many markets. Second, we feel good about the expanding geographic footprint of our portfolio over the past several years even before the Cadbury acquisition. In fact, through the first six months of the year, the strength of our international operations drove overall vol/mix gain of 2.6 points, despite a vol/mix decline of 30 basis points in North America. And third, the majority of our key North American programs are back half-weighted. So even though we expect economic conditions to remain challenging, we're confident in our ability to continue to drive vol/mix gains for the remainder of the year. 
Picking back up on Q2 revenue growth. Our Cadbury business reported organic growth of 3.3%. It was driven by very strong Gum performance in the Americas, fueled by the success of new products. Chocolate gains in the U.K. and India also contributed to the growth. Top line growth was tempered two factors: a negative impact of about 0.5 percentage point from the shift of Easter-related shipments into the first quarter, and weak economic conditions affecting the Gum category in several markets including southern Europe, Japan and South Africa. 
Turning to profit. On a combined basis, our operating income margin, excluding acquisition integration costs, was 15.2%. In our Kraft Foods base business, volume growth and improved product mix contributed 70 basis points of margin improvement. In addition, our productivity- and overhead cost savings initiatives are starting to contribute in a more significant way. Despite rising costs, we delivered gross margin gains in all geographic regions. This enabled a double-digit increase in A&C. And as a result of this virtuous circle, our base Kraft operating income margin rose by 110 basis points to 16%. Our Cadbury business also made a solid contribution to profit in the quarter. Product mix, productivity gains and the timing of marketing spending drove the improvement. 
Turning to EPS. Our second quarter earnings reflect continued financial momentum as we integrate Cadbury. Starting at the top, we earned $0.56 in Q2 of 2009 with $0.03 of that coming from the divested Pizza business. So from a year ago base of $0.53, our operating EPS was up more than 13% to $0.60. This was primarily driven by $0.08 of operating gains from the Kraft base business. The $0.11 of operating earnings from Cadbury were offset by $0.14 of higher interest expense and the change in shares outstanding primarily related to the acquisition. 
I'd also note that certain discrete tax items, including the settlement of audits, benefited operating EPS this quarter by $0.03 on a year-over-year basis. Below the operating EPS line, we incurred $0.06 of integration costs and $0.01 in acquisition-related costs, resulting in our reported EPS of $0.53. 
On a year-to-date basis, earnings are also running ahead of expectations. For the first half, we generated $0.16 of operating gains from the Kraft Foods base business. That's roughly 17 percentage points of EPS growth from base operations. So we've had a very strong start to the year on the earnings front. 
Given that strength, we've made the strategic decision to reinvest the upside this year. This will ensure that we're doing the right things to strengthen our business in this difficult market and to stage the business for faster growth in the future. As a result, even though the first half came in stronger than expected, we're holding our full year operating EPS guidance to at least $2. 
I'll take a few minutes now to share highlights of our business results by geography. At Kraft Foods North America, organic net revenues on a combined basis fell by 1.3%. Our base business results came in weaker than expected, declining by 1.9%. So what happened? Our performance was driven by four factors: a continued weak consumer environment; lower sales growth at a key U.S. customer due to changes in their merchandising that affected us disproportionately; aggressive promotional activity in a few U.S. categories, especially Biscuits, Cheese and Salad Dressings; and about a 50 basis point impact from the Easter shift. 
Despite these headwinds, we've continued to invest in brand-building activities. In fact, several of our key brands posted revenue growth behind great new advertising. For sample, Capri Sun and Kool-Aid ready to drink beverages and Maxwell House coffee were up double digit. And Oscar Mayer Bacon and Hotdogs, Kraft Mac and Cheese and Planters Nuts posted strong growth. And as we look ahead, we expect solid growth behind key programming initiatives and improved merchandising support in the second half of the year. 
In our Cadbury business, we produced strong growth of 7½%. This was driven by the success of several Gum products including Trident Layers, Stride Shift and Dentyne Pure. Now in light of that excellent performance, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that we will lap the highly successful launch of Trident Layers beginning in Q3. 
Now let's look at profitability. In our base business, OI margin improved by 70 basis points to 19.1%. This reflected strong productivity gains, but they were partially offset by incremental investments at A&C and to a lesser extent, the impact of lower volume. Our Cadbury business also posted solid profit performance. It delivered productivity gains and improved product mix that was partially offset by higher spending behind new products. As a result, our operating income margin for the combined company in North America grew to 19.4%. 
In Europe, combined organic net revenues increased 3.9%. In our base business, organic revenues grew 5.2%. Included in this number was a 2.5 point benefit from harmonizing the accounting calendar in some of our European Biscuit operations as we completed the integration of the LU Biscuit business. This is partially offset by 70 basis points from the Easter shift. Adjusting for these small impacts, the revenue in our base business was still strong and exceeded expectations. Our priority brands collectively grew 8% as increased focus and marketing support drove volume and mix gains. 
What's more? The strong performance was broad-based with growth in every category. Chocolate grew behind strength in Milka, Toblerone, Freia and Marabou, and we also posted share gains in several key markets including Germany and France. Coffee grew behind the Jacobs in Germany and a double-digit increase in Tassimo. 
Cheese grew behind the continuing success of new packaging and marketing of Philadelphia. It was up strongly in key markets such as the U.K. and Italy. And Biscuits grew double digits behind the successful launch of Cote d'Or in Belgium and Oreo in France. In fact, Oreo grew 45% overall across Europe. 
In our Cadbury business, organic net revenues were flat. Modest base growth was offset by a negative impact of about one percentage point due to the Easter shift. We generated solid growth in core markets such as the U.K. and France, but this was offset by a soft consumer environment in southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Greece. 
Operating income margin in Europe rose to 13.2% on a combined basis. In our base business, OI margin improved by 220 basis points to 12.2%. This reflected strong volume/mix gains and overhead leverage that was partially offset by the effect of lower price levels and an increase in advertising.  Our Cadbury business also made a solid profit contribution in the quarter. Product mix improved and we began to realize the benefits of supply chain efficiencies. 
Turning now to developing markets, where combined organic net revenue increased 8.1%. In our base business, organic revenues grew again at a double-digit rate of 10.4%. The driver was volume/mix gains as we continued to invest in priority brands across the region. Plus a roughly ½ point benefit from an accounting calendar change for certain operations in Asia-Pacific. Collectively, our priority brands grew more than 17%. Specifically, in Asia-Pacific priority brands grew nearly 30%, lead by Tang powdered beverages and Oreo cookies. In China, for example, Oreo grew by more than 70%. In Latin America, priority brands grew nearly 20%. They were again led by Oreo and Tang, plus strong gains from Lacta chocolate. And in CEEMA, despite a very weak consumer environment, priority brands grew 9% led by Jacobs coffee. 
Organic revenues in our Cadbury business grew 4% in developing markets. New products and improved distribution drove high single-digit growth in Latin America. We also generated double-digit chocolate gains in India. Growth was tempered, however, by weak Gum category trends in Mexico, Japan and South Africa. Our operating income margin in developing markets was about 14%. Our base business profit margins improved by 50 basis points. This was driven primarily by strong gains in vol/mix and overhead leverage. 
Margin upside was dampened somewhat by higher input costs and a double-digit increase in A&C. Profit performance in our Cadbury business was also solid. It reflected a better alignment of pricing and costs, as well as improved product mix. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Irene."

As we look back over a very eventful first half of 2010, we're beginning to realize the benefits of several things. Our improved portfolio mix, our broader geographic footprint, our significant brand investments and our cost savings initiatives. This is creating a virtuous circle that will enable us to accelerate volume and mix gains, leverage our scale and drive down overhead costs, and generate additional earnings that can be reinvested in the business. 
Our businesses in Europe and developing markets delivered exceptional performance through the first six months of the year. We posted both strong vol/mix and market share gains. In North America, despite some headwinds, our investments generated solid base consumption growth for a number of our priority brands. And across the portfolio, volume/mix gains and cost savings expanded both gross- and operating margins. This in turn is enabling incremental investments behind our priority brands around the world. 
On the bottom-line, operating EPS rose 18%, driven by strong operating gains in the Kraft Foods base business. 
Turning to Cadbury, the integration continues to progress extremely well. The acquisition has provided a great infusion of new talent. In fact as we've named the business unit-, country- and functional leaders around the world, about a third of our four hundred most senior leaders come from Cadbury. We've also made excellent progress in identifying synergies. We now expect to deliver greater cost savings and to do so even faster than we had originally planned. Specifically, we expect to generate at least $750 million in annual savings. And we'll deliver about 15% of the savings in 2010 versus a prior estimate of 10%.  The total cost to generate these savings will be slightly higher, about $1.5 billion versus our prior estimate of $1.3 billion. But the pacing of costs should be about the same. Although there have been very few surprises during the integration, there are two areas worth mentioning. 
First, we've seen some baseline weakness in a few core markets as the businesses were pushed hard in the heat of battle last year. We anticipated this and had begun to reinvest in these markets. We expect they will begin to recover as we exit the year.
Second, we discovered that Cadbury distributors carried fairly high trade inventories in a few markets. We intend to normalize those levels. This will result in lower revenue growth in the second half of the year, but it will provide us with a more efficient supply chain going forward and stage the business for future growth. 
Turning now to our 2010 outlook. In terms of organic revenue growth, we've adjusted our target to 3% to 4% growth from at least 4%. This reflects the slower than anticipated start in the first half, the impact of aggressive promotional activity and the normalizing of Cadbury trade inventory in select markets. 
Where we ultimately fall within that range will depend on the consumer environment globally, as well as whether or not merchandising changes are implemented by a key U.S. customer. If these mutually beneficial merchandising opportunities occur, we'll be higher in the range. If not, we'll be lower. Regardless, our objective is to build a solid revenue base from which we will generate profitable top-tier growth. On the bottom line, as we've said, we expect to deliver operating EPS of at least $2.00, while funding the initiatives we've mentioned. This will enable us to build an even stronger foundation for 2011. 
So to sum up, we've continued to make progress toward our goal of building a global powerhouse. Our integration is on track and we 're delivering greater synergies faster than expected. We're beginning to reap the benefits of a more diverse global portfolio. We're delivering strong, high-quality base business earnings growth, and most importantly, we're reinvesting our upside this year to further strengthen our brands and lay the foundation for top-tier performance in 2011. We'd now be happy to take your questions."

We'll remain disciplined as we move forward here, but I will say that as category leader, we will not continue to tolerate share gains being driven by aggressive promotional pricing. So you will see some increase in our promotional spending in select U.S. categories in the second half. But that is reflected in our guidance, and as I said, we expect that our second half revenue will be primarily driven by vol/mix.

We continue to move our business toward our ultimate endpoint of 8% to 9% of revenue in A&C. We're making very good progress there and as you heard, we made significant investments in the first half of the year, we're up double digits, which takes us to about 7.5% or so of revenue on a base Kraft; the total company's actually closer to 8% because Cadbury comes in at a somewhat higher spending level. And we expect to continue to see that relationship continue in the back half. As we mentioned, we had fairly significant back half loading in our base Kraft programming, or actually in our planned programming, and now that we are now anticipating spending some additional monies in the back half, you will see even more of a contribution on the marketing side. That is what gives us great confidence that we will be able to see sequential improvement in our top line. With respect to the questions as to how our merchandising plan's progressing, we obviously have seen this. Our major U.S. customer has been quite public in suggesting that perhaps they went a little bit too far in a changing their merchandising philosophy. We have a very strong set of consumer programs, plans for the back half of the year, and we will work together to realize those opportunities. And as I said, that in some respects accounts for the range that we've given in our top line guidance."

We got a fairly robust innovation pipeline that was always back half-loaded. Again, we were concerned about the consumer environment and we chose to keep our powder a little bit dry there and so we have a pretty good roster of new products as we look into the back half and we can talk a little bit about that. And then the third piece is simply that we will lack the merchandising change in the back half of the year as well as, as we've seen, there's been some rethinking of that merchandising strategy. So all of that together is what, first of all, makes our programming back half-weighted, and what gives us great confidence that we will see sequential improvement in the back half of the year."

First off, we had another good quarter in a challenging environment. Every geography delivered solid results. In North America, we posted sequential improvement in top line performance despite weak consumer demand and less merchandising activity than the prior year. In Europe, we delivered another quarter of solid revenue growth despite soft categories. We also continued to grow our margins and have sustained them in the low teens. In Developing Markets, further investment in our Power Brands and in priority markets again drove strong revenue growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America. 
Second, as we told you in August, we plan to reinvest our first half earnings upside to build a stronger foundation for future growth. And that's exactly what we did. We continued to increase our investments in advertising, including a double-digit increase in North America. This ensures that our brands are as strong as possible as the economy improves. We also normalized Cadbury's trade inventories in certain developing markets. And as expected, this tempered our top line growth. So overall, the third quarter played out essentially as we planned. A notable exception was at input costs, including dairy, coffee and cocoa, rose much more than we had expected. To offset these higher costs, we began to price in several categories and in several markets. This affected our results in two ways: Our top line growth was driven more by price and by vol/mix and there was some pressure on gross margins because price realization trailed the increase in input costs. 
The gross margin pressure we experienced in Q3 should ease, as price levels better align with input costs. The key take away is that the underlying momentum of our business remains strong. We're taking the necessary pricing actions despite a difficult consumer environment, as a testament to our strength in brand equities. And we continued to increase our advertising investments. This will further build our brands, stimulate our categories and position us well as the economy recovers.
Let me now turn it over to Tim to discuss our third quarter results in more detail."
739693,114464162,85579,"Kraft Foods Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene, and Good afternoon. As Irene just mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter results. They came in largely in line with our expectations. Now, let me provide some details.I'll start by discussing our top line, where pricing was the p",1454,"Thanks, Irene, and Good afternoon. As Irene just mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter results. They came in largely in line with our expectations. Now, let me provide some details.
I'll start by discussing our top line, where pricing was the primary driver of organic revenue growth as we move quickly to offset higher input costs. Organic net revenues for the combined business grew 2.1% as focused investments drove continued growth in our Power Brands. In the Kraft base business, organic revenues increased 2.5%, including 2.3 points from pricing. In fact, net pricing was up in every one of our business units. 
In the Cadbury business, organic revenue growth was essentially flat, but in line with our expectations. This is due in part to our decision to normalize trade inventories in certain markets. Doing so reduced Cadbury's top line growth by about two points and reduced our combined revenue growth by approximately 1/2 of a percentage point. As you know, we're also comparing against the hard push by Cadbury in the second half of last year.
Now turning to profit, on a combined basis, our operating income margin, excluding acquisition and integration costs, was 13.6%. In our Kraft base business, operating income margin fell by 50 basis points to 13.9%. This was entirely due to our stepped up advertising investment, which lowered margins by about 100 basis points. At the same time, we continue to make excellent progress in productivity and in reducing overhead costs. For the Cadbury business, margins were 12.4% in the quarter. This reflected stepped-up marketing investment and the impact of the trade inventory reductions we've already mentioned. Overall, we continue to demonstrate strong underlying momentum but clearly, there's more opportunity ahead.
Turning to EPS, two key drivers affected the comparison of third quarter earnings year-on-year: A lower tax rate in 2009; and as we pointed out in August, we began to reinvest the $0.10 of earnings upside from the first half. Let me walk you through the bridge. Starting with Q3 of 2009, we earned $0.55, with $0.03 of that coming from the divested Pizza business. We also spent $0.01 on acquisition-related costs last year. So from a year ago base of $0.53, our operating EPS declined to $0.47. Our Kraft base business delivered $0.01 of operating gains, while covering approximately $0.05 from significantly increased advertising investments. 
Cadbury contributed $0.12 of operating earnings in the quarter and higher interest expense and the change in shares outstanding lowered EPS by $0.11. So as you can see, the decline in operating EPS can be accounted for by $0.06 of higher year-on-year taxes. This year-on-year increase in taxes was a function of timing, with greater benefits from discreet items in the prior year quarter. Below the operating EPS line, we incurred a net impact of $0.04 from integration program and acquisition-related costs, resulting in our reported EPS of $0.43. 
On a year-to-date basis, improved vol/mix, productivity and overhead cost savings have resulted in strong gains in operating earnings. We've done this while continuing to invest in our brands. And through the first nine months, we've earned $1.56, leaving us well-positioned to deliver our target of at least $2 for the year. 
I'll take a few minutes now to share highlights of our business results by geography. In North America, we continued to make progress in a very difficult environment. We delivered sequential improvement in top line growth. On a combined basis, organic net revenues were up 1% compared with a decline of 1.3% in the second quarter of this year. We continued to invest more behind our Power Brands and they responded by growing 3% in the quarter. Chips Ahoy!, Belvita and Kraft's Mac and Cheese, for example, grew double digits; while Ritz, Starbucks and Oscar Mayer Deli Fresh grew high single digits. 
This solid progress, however, was partially offset by three things: First, soft categories and less merchandising especially in our Snacks business; second, tough comps, particularly in our Cadbury business. While Stride and Dentyne Gum delivered strong growth, we were up against last year's highly successful launch of Trident Layers, as well as strong shipments of Halls, as customers stocked up in anticipation of an H1N1 flu season. 
And third, while pricing in response to higher input cost was a key driver of our top line growth, we did see some pressure in vol/mix. However, as we looked forward, we have solid programming in place and we anticipate more merchandising activity. Therefore, we expect further sequential improvement in organic growth across our North American portfolio in the fourth quarter. Now let's look at profitability.
On a combined basis, our operating income margin in North America was 17.3%. In our Kraft base business, OI margin declined to 16.9%. This is due primarily to a double-digit increase in advertising. These brand building investments were funded by continuing benefits from productivity and overhead cost reductions. While input costs spiked in the quarter, we moved quickly to price accordingly. In fact, we've implemented or announced price increases in about 40% of our North American portfolio. However, price realization will lag higher input costs at least in the short term. Our Cadbury business posted strong operating income margins of 22.9%. Productivity gains and improved product mix were partially offset by higher spending behind new products.
In Europe, combined organic revenues increased 1.1%, fueled by our Power Brands, which collectively grew 3%. Across our Kraft base business, organic revenues grew 1.7% as vol/mix gains resulted from increased focus and marketing support. The results were mixed across categories. Coffee and Cheese both grew mid-single digits. Jacobs, Hardwire, Kenco and Tassimo drove solid vol/mix gains in coffee and new product launches and a successful marketing campaign produced continued growth in PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese. 
Chocolate revenues were flat. Continued strength of Freia and Marabou in Scandinavia was offset by weak category performance in other parts of Europe. In biscuits, revenues declined slightly. Strong growth in Power Brands, including Oreo and Belvita was offset by the timing of promotional activity and weak category performance. In our Cadbury business, organic net revenues declined by 0.4%. Soft markets in Continental Europe, especially in gum, offset solid growth in Britain and Ireland. Despite this, Cadbury brands are holding or gaining share across Europe. 
Operating income margins in Europe rose to 12.4% on a combined basis. In our Kraft base business, OI margins improved by 140 basis points to 11.6%. This reflected continued productivity gains and lower overheads. Advertising spending for the quarter was down in this region due to the timing of programming. I would note, however, that it's up on a year-to-date basis. In addition, we shifted some A&C spending from the base Kraft business to Cadbury. 
Our Cadbury business also made a solid profit contribution in the quarter. Product mix improved and we continued to realize the benefits of supply chain efficiencies. As in North America, input costs are rising significantly and we're pricing accordingly. In fact, we've taken pricing or announced price increases on more than half of our European portfolio.
Turning now to Developing Markets, combined organic net revenue increased 4.8%. This was fueled by the continuing strength of our Power Brands, which were up 12%. This drove double-digit growth in both Asia Pacific and Latin America. In contrast to North America and Europe, however, we're seeing a sequentially smaller contribution from pricing in this region because inflation is now lower in many countries. 
In our Kraft base business, organic revenues grew 7.4%. Specifically, in Asia Pacific, China and Indonesia led the way. And Power Brands grew more than 30% propelled by Tang powdered beverage and Oreo cookies. And in Latin America, Power Brands grew 18% led by Oreo and Club Social biscuits and Lacta chocolate. These gains were partially offset by weak economic conditions and category trends in CEEMA. Despite this, we improved market shares in most markets. 
In our Cadbury business, organic revenues rose just 0.7%. This was expected as our actions to normalize trade inventories reduced Cadbury's growth by about four percentage points. Cadbury growth was also tempered by weakness in the gum category due to weak economic conditions. Our operating income margin in developing markets was 12.7%. Our base business profit margins declined to 13.1% as we stepped up advertising investments across the region. These investments more than offset gains in vol/mix and overhead leverage. Profit performance in our Cadbury business also reflected incremental advertising, as well as the impact of normalizing trade inventories. 
So in sum, we delivered solid top and bottom line performance in every geography behind our Power Brands. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Irene, who will discuss our outlook and provide an update on the Cadbury operation."

As we move to the fourth quarter, despite the economic challenges, we anticipate a sequential increase in top line growth and we're well-positioned to deliver combined organic revenue growth of 3% to 4% for the full year. This is a solid base",339,"Thanks, Tim. As we move to the fourth quarter, despite the economic challenges, we anticipate a sequential increase in top line growth and we're well-positioned to deliver combined organic revenue growth of 3% to 4% for the full year. This is a solid base from which we'll generate top-tier growth in 2011 and beyond. As we've said, pricing will contribute more to our revenue growth than we anticipated at the start of the year. To backstop the pricing, we have solid Q4 programming in place, particularly in North America and Europe, which will accelerate growth and deliver our revenue guidance for the year. On the bottom line, as Tim said, we expect to deliver operating EPS of at least $2. At the same time, we'll fund increased A&C from about 7.5% last year to about 8% of net revenues in 2010.
Turning to the Cadbury integration, it continues to proceed smoothly. We are on track to generate cost synergies of at least $750 million in annual savings, about 15% of which will come this year. We're also on track to greatly improve our earnings growth trajectory. We're integrating Cadbury and driving the substantial savings and growth opportunities now available to us. As a result, our combined operating EPS by 2012 will surpass considerably what we could have achieved on our own. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver significantly higher long-term earnings growth of 9% to 11%. 
So to sum up, our fly wheel is turning and we're benefiting from a virtuous cycle of growth and focused reinvestment. We're setting growth objectives off a solid base. We're managing input costs by maintaining strong brand equities and pricing accordingly. We're driving gains in volume and mix through focused investments in Power Brands and key markets. We're driving productivity and reducing overhead cost to expand margins. And we're reinvesting a portion of our earnings upside to further strengthen our brands and lay an even stronger foundation for top-tier performance in 2011. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions."

And so our expectation is with continued investment, the continued strength in brand equities, that we'll be able to price to offset any future changes in input costs."

First of all, what we've laid out there was about $1 billion of revenue synergies that we think about half of that would come from route to market putting, legacy Kraft products to the Cadbury infrastructure and vice versa. About a third of it comes from brand extension, simply taking some of the ideas on Cadbury, bringing it to Kraft products and vice versa. And the rest of it comes from bringing products like dairy milk to new markets that they are distributed in today. The opportunity though -- first of all, the profit benefit of that will come a little bit later because most of those opportunities will require some investment. So when we talk about the $750 million of synergy, that is in cost synergy. We've not made a lot of assumptions in the near term of profit coming off of the revenue. But the top line benefit will come, at the very least, in late 2011 into 2012 and beyond. So it's going to take us a while to get some of those opportunities jump started to complete our integration et cetera."

First off, we had another good quarter in a challenging environment. Every geography delivered solid results. In North America, we posted sequential improvement in top line performance despite weak consumer demand and less merchandising activity than the prior year. In Europe, we delivered another quarter of solid revenue growth despite soft categories. We also continued to grow our margins and have sustained them in the low teens. In Developing Markets, further investment in our Power Brands and in priority markets again drove strong revenue growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America. 
Second, as we told you in August, we plan to reinvest our first half earnings upside to build a stronger foundation for future growth. And that's exactly what we did. We continued to increase our investments in advertising, including a double-digit increase in North America. This ensures that our brands are as strong as possible as the economy improves. We also normalized Cadbury's trade inventories in certain developing markets. And as expected, this tempered our top line growth. So overall, the third quarter played out essentially as we planned. A notable exception was at input costs, including dairy, coffee and cocoa, rose much more than we had expected. To offset these higher costs, we began to price in several categories and in several markets. This affected our results in two ways: Our top line growth was driven more by price and by vol/mix and there was some pressure on gross margins because price realization trailed the increase in input costs. 
The gross margin pressure we experienced in Q3 should ease, as price levels better align with input costs. The key take away is that the underlying momentum of our business remains strong. We're taking the necessary pricing actions despite a difficult consumer environment, as a testament to our strength in brand equities. And we continued to increase our advertising investments. This will further build our brands, stimulate our categories and position us well as the economy recovers.
Let me now turn it over to Tim to discuss our third quarter results in more detail."
739693,114464162,85580,"Kraft Foods Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene, and Good afternoon. As Irene just mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter results. They came in largely in line with our expectations. Now, let me provide some details.I'll start by discussing our top line, where pricing was the p",1454,"Thanks, Irene, and Good afternoon. As Irene just mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter results. They came in largely in line with our expectations. Now, let me provide some details.
I'll start by discussing our top line, where pricing was the primary driver of organic revenue growth as we move quickly to offset higher input costs. Organic net revenues for the combined business grew 2.1% as focused investments drove continued growth in our Power Brands. In the Kraft base business, organic revenues increased 2.5%, including 2.3 points from pricing. In fact, net pricing was up in every one of our business units. 
In the Cadbury business, organic revenue growth was essentially flat, but in line with our expectations. This is due in part to our decision to normalize trade inventories in certain markets. Doing so reduced Cadbury's top line growth by about two points and reduced our combined revenue growth by approximately 1/2 of a percentage point. As you know, we're also comparing against the hard push by Cadbury in the second half of last year.
Now turning to profit, on a combined basis, our operating income margin, excluding acquisition and integration costs, was 13.6%. In our Kraft base business, operating income margin fell by 50 basis points to 13.9%. This was entirely due to our stepped up advertising investment, which lowered margins by about 100 basis points. At the same time, we continue to make excellent progress in productivity and in reducing overhead costs. For the Cadbury business, margins were 12.4% in the quarter. This reflected stepped-up marketing investment and the impact of the trade inventory reductions we've already mentioned. Overall, we continue to demonstrate strong underlying momentum but clearly, there's more opportunity ahead.
Turning to EPS, two key drivers affected the comparison of third quarter earnings year-on-year: A lower tax rate in 2009; and as we pointed out in August, we began to reinvest the $0.10 of earnings upside from the first half. Let me walk you through the bridge. Starting with Q3 of 2009, we earned $0.55, with $0.03 of that coming from the divested Pizza business. We also spent $0.01 on acquisition-related costs last year. So from a year ago base of $0.53, our operating EPS declined to $0.47. Our Kraft base business delivered $0.01 of operating gains, while covering approximately $0.05 from significantly increased advertising investments. 
Cadbury contributed $0.12 of operating earnings in the quarter and higher interest expense and the change in shares outstanding lowered EPS by $0.11. So as you can see, the decline in operating EPS can be accounted for by $0.06 of higher year-on-year taxes. This year-on-year increase in taxes was a function of timing, with greater benefits from discreet items in the prior year quarter. Below the operating EPS line, we incurred a net impact of $0.04 from integration program and acquisition-related costs, resulting in our reported EPS of $0.43. 
On a year-to-date basis, improved vol/mix, productivity and overhead cost savings have resulted in strong gains in operating earnings. We've done this while continuing to invest in our brands. And through the first nine months, we've earned $1.56, leaving us well-positioned to deliver our target of at least $2 for the year. 
I'll take a few minutes now to share highlights of our business results by geography. In North America, we continued to make progress in a very difficult environment. We delivered sequential improvement in top line growth. On a combined basis, organic net revenues were up 1% compared with a decline of 1.3% in the second quarter of this year. We continued to invest more behind our Power Brands and they responded by growing 3% in the quarter. Chips Ahoy!, Belvita and Kraft's Mac and Cheese, for example, grew double digits; while Ritz, Starbucks and Oscar Mayer Deli Fresh grew high single digits. 
This solid progress, however, was partially offset by three things: First, soft categories and less merchandising especially in our Snacks business; second, tough comps, particularly in our Cadbury business. While Stride and Dentyne Gum delivered strong growth, we were up against last year's highly successful launch of Trident Layers, as well as strong shipments of Halls, as customers stocked up in anticipation of an H1N1 flu season. 
And third, while pricing in response to higher input cost was a key driver of our top line growth, we did see some pressure in vol/mix. However, as we looked forward, we have solid programming in place and we anticipate more merchandising activity. Therefore, we expect further sequential improvement in organic growth across our North American portfolio in the fourth quarter. Now let's look at profitability.
On a combined basis, our operating income margin in North America was 17.3%. In our Kraft base business, OI margin declined to 16.9%. This is due primarily to a double-digit increase in advertising. These brand building investments were funded by continuing benefits from productivity and overhead cost reductions. While input costs spiked in the quarter, we moved quickly to price accordingly. In fact, we've implemented or announced price increases in about 40% of our North American portfolio. However, price realization will lag higher input costs at least in the short term. Our Cadbury business posted strong operating income margins of 22.9%. Productivity gains and improved product mix were partially offset by higher spending behind new products.
In Europe, combined organic revenues increased 1.1%, fueled by our Power Brands, which collectively grew 3%. Across our Kraft base business, organic revenues grew 1.7% as vol/mix gains resulted from increased focus and marketing support. The results were mixed across categories. Coffee and Cheese both grew mid-single digits. Jacobs, Hardwire, Kenco and Tassimo drove solid vol/mix gains in coffee and new product launches and a successful marketing campaign produced continued growth in PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese. 
Chocolate revenues were flat. Continued strength of Freia and Marabou in Scandinavia was offset by weak category performance in other parts of Europe. In biscuits, revenues declined slightly. Strong growth in Power Brands, including Oreo and Belvita was offset by the timing of promotional activity and weak category performance. In our Cadbury business, organic net revenues declined by 0.4%. Soft markets in Continental Europe, especially in gum, offset solid growth in Britain and Ireland. Despite this, Cadbury brands are holding or gaining share across Europe. 
Operating income margins in Europe rose to 12.4% on a combined basis. In our Kraft base business, OI margins improved by 140 basis points to 11.6%. This reflected continued productivity gains and lower overheads. Advertising spending for the quarter was down in this region due to the timing of programming. I would note, however, that it's up on a year-to-date basis. In addition, we shifted some A&C spending from the base Kraft business to Cadbury. 
Our Cadbury business also made a solid profit contribution in the quarter. Product mix improved and we continued to realize the benefits of supply chain efficiencies. As in North America, input costs are rising significantly and we're pricing accordingly. In fact, we've taken pricing or announced price increases on more than half of our European portfolio.
Turning now to Developing Markets, combined organic net revenue increased 4.8%. This was fueled by the continuing strength of our Power Brands, which were up 12%. This drove double-digit growth in both Asia Pacific and Latin America. In contrast to North America and Europe, however, we're seeing a sequentially smaller contribution from pricing in this region because inflation is now lower in many countries. 
In our Kraft base business, organic revenues grew 7.4%. Specifically, in Asia Pacific, China and Indonesia led the way. And Power Brands grew more than 30% propelled by Tang powdered beverage and Oreo cookies. And in Latin America, Power Brands grew 18% led by Oreo and Club Social biscuits and Lacta chocolate. These gains were partially offset by weak economic conditions and category trends in CEEMA. Despite this, we improved market shares in most markets. 
In our Cadbury business, organic revenues rose just 0.7%. This was expected as our actions to normalize trade inventories reduced Cadbury's growth by about four percentage points. Cadbury growth was also tempered by weakness in the gum category due to weak economic conditions. Our operating income margin in developing markets was 12.7%. Our base business profit margins declined to 13.1% as we stepped up advertising investments across the region. These investments more than offset gains in vol/mix and overhead leverage. Profit performance in our Cadbury business also reflected incremental advertising, as well as the impact of normalizing trade inventories. 
So in sum, we delivered solid top and bottom line performance in every geography behind our Power Brands. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Irene, who will discuss our outlook and provide an update on the Cadbury operation."

As we move to the fourth quarter, despite the economic challenges, we anticipate a sequential increase in top line growth and we're well-positioned to deliver combined organic revenue growth of 3% to 4% for the full year. This is a solid base",339,"Thanks, Tim. As we move to the fourth quarter, despite the economic challenges, we anticipate a sequential increase in top line growth and we're well-positioned to deliver combined organic revenue growth of 3% to 4% for the full year. This is a solid base from which we'll generate top-tier growth in 2011 and beyond. As we've said, pricing will contribute more to our revenue growth than we anticipated at the start of the year. To backstop the pricing, we have solid Q4 programming in place, particularly in North America and Europe, which will accelerate growth and deliver our revenue guidance for the year. On the bottom line, as Tim said, we expect to deliver operating EPS of at least $2. At the same time, we'll fund increased A&C from about 7.5% last year to about 8% of net revenues in 2010.
Turning to the Cadbury integration, it continues to proceed smoothly. We are on track to generate cost synergies of at least $750 million in annual savings, about 15% of which will come this year. We're also on track to greatly improve our earnings growth trajectory. We're integrating Cadbury and driving the substantial savings and growth opportunities now available to us. As a result, our combined operating EPS by 2012 will surpass considerably what we could have achieved on our own. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver significantly higher long-term earnings growth of 9% to 11%. 
So to sum up, our fly wheel is turning and we're benefiting from a virtuous cycle of growth and focused reinvestment. We're setting growth objectives off a solid base. We're managing input costs by maintaining strong brand equities and pricing accordingly. We're driving gains in volume and mix through focused investments in Power Brands and key markets. We're driving productivity and reducing overhead cost to expand margins. And we're reinvesting a portion of our earnings upside to further strengthen our brands and lay an even stronger foundation for top-tier performance in 2011. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions."

And there was a fairly significant push that they made in the second half of 2009. So we had expected to see a stronger performance from the business front half versus back half. And then on top of it, we have to choose to normalize some of the inventories as we've described. The business is delivering exactly as we had expected. We've got some issues here and there.

First off, we had another good quarter in a challenging environment. Every geography delivered solid results. In North America, we posted sequential improvement in top line performance despite weak consumer demand and less merchandising activity than the prior year. In Europe, we delivered another quarter of solid revenue growth despite soft categories. We also continued to grow our margins and have sustained them in the low teens. In Developing Markets, further investment in our Power Brands and in priority markets again drove strong revenue growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America. 
Second, as we told you in August, we plan to reinvest our first half earnings upside to build a stronger foundation for future growth. And that's exactly what we did. We continued to increase our investments in advertising, including a double-digit increase in North America. This ensures that our brands are as strong as possible as the economy improves. We also normalized Cadbury's trade inventories in certain developing markets. And as expected, this tempered our top line growth. So overall, the third quarter played out essentially as we planned. A notable exception was at input costs, including dairy, coffee and cocoa, rose much more than we had expected. To offset these higher costs, we began to price in several categories and in several markets. This affected our results in two ways: Our top line growth was driven more by price and by vol/mix and there was some pressure on gross margins because price realization trailed the increase in input costs. 
The gross margin pressure we experienced in Q3 should ease, as price levels better align with input costs. The key take away is that the underlying momentum of our business remains strong. We're taking the necessary pricing actions despite a difficult consumer environment, as a testament to our strength in brand equities. And we continued to increase our advertising investments. This will further build our brands, stimulate our categories and position us well as the economy recovers.
Let me now turn it over to Tim to discuss our third quarter results in more detail."

As Irene just mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter results. They came in largely in line with our expectations.

As Irene just mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter results. They came in largely in line with our expectations. Now, let me provide some details.
I'll start by discussing our top line, where pricing was the primary driver of organic revenue growth as we move quickly to offset higher input costs. Organic net revenues for the combined business grew 2.1% as focused investments drove continued growth in our Power Brands. In the Kraft base business, organic revenues increased 2.5%, including 2.3 points from pricing. In fact, net pricing was up in every one of our business units. 
In the Cadbury business, organic revenue growth was essentially flat, but in line with our expectations. This is due in part to our decision to normalize trade inventories in certain markets. Doing so reduced Cadbury's top line growth by about two points and reduced our combined revenue growth by approximately 1/2 of a percentage point. As you know, we're also comparing against the hard push by Cadbury in the second half of last year.
Now turning to profit, on a combined basis, our operating income margin, excluding acquisition and integration costs, was 13.6%. In our Kraft base business, operating income margin fell by 50 basis points to 13.9%. This was entirely due to our stepped up advertising investment, which lowered margins by about 100 basis points. At the same time, we continue to make excellent progress in productivity and in reducing overhead costs. For the Cadbury business, margins were 12.4% in the quarter. This reflected stepped-up marketing investment and the impact of the trade inventory reductions we've already mentioned. Overall, we continue to demonstrate strong underlying momentum but clearly, there's more opportunity ahead.
Turning to EPS, two key drivers affected the comparison of third quarter earnings year-on-year: A lower tax rate in 2009; and as we pointed out in August, we began to reinvest the $0.10 of earnings upside from the first half. Let me walk you through the bridge. Starting with Q3 of 2009, we earned $0.55, with $0.03 of that coming from the divested Pizza business. We also spent $0.01 on acquisition-related costs last year. So from a year ago base of $0.53, our operating EPS declined to $0.47. Our Kraft base business delivered $0.01 of operating gains, while covering approximately $0.05 from significantly increased advertising investments. 
Cadbury contributed $0.12 of operating earnings in the quarter and higher interest expense and the change in shares outstanding lowered EPS by $0.11. So as you can see, the decline in operating EPS can be accounted for by $0.06 of higher year-on-year taxes. This year-on-year increase in taxes was a function of timing, with greater benefits from discreet items in the prior year quarter. Below the operating EPS line, we incurred a net impact of $0.04 from integration program and acquisition-related costs, resulting in our reported EPS of $0.43. 
On a year-to-date basis, improved vol/mix, productivity and overhead cost savings have resulted in strong gains in operating earnings. We've done this while continuing to invest in our brands. And through the first nine months, we've earned $1.56, leaving us well-positioned to deliver our target of at least $2 for the year. 
I'll take a few minutes now to share highlights of our business results by geography. In North America, we continued to make progress in a very difficult environment. We delivered sequential improvement in top line growth. On a combined basis, organic net revenues were up 1% compared with a decline of 1.3% in the second quarter of this year. We continued to invest more behind our Power Brands and they responded by growing 3% in the quarter. Chips Ahoy!, Belvita and Kraft's Mac and Cheese, for example, grew double digits; while Ritz, Starbucks and Oscar Mayer Deli Fresh grew high single digits. 
This solid progress, however, was partially offset by three things: First, soft categories and less merchandising especially in our Snacks business; second, tough comps, particularly in our Cadbury business. While Stride and Dentyne Gum delivered strong growth, we were up against last year's highly successful launch of Trident Layers, as well as strong shipments of Halls, as customers stocked up in anticipation of an H1N1 flu season. 
And third, while pricing in response to higher input cost was a key driver of our top line growth, we did see some pressure in vol/mix. However, as we looked forward, we have solid programming in place and we anticipate more merchandising activity. Therefore, we expect further sequential improvement in organic growth across our North American portfolio in the fourth quarter. Now let's look at profitability.
On a combined basis, our operating income margin in North America was 17.3%. In our Kraft base business, OI margin declined to 16.9%. This is due primarily to a double-digit increase in advertising. These brand building investments were funded by continuing benefits from productivity and overhead cost reductions. While input costs spiked in the quarter, we moved quickly to price accordingly. In fact, we've implemented or announced price increases in about 40% of our North American portfolio. However, price realization will lag higher input costs at least in the short term. Our Cadbury business posted strong operating income margins of 22.9%. Productivity gains and improved product mix were partially offset by higher spending behind new products.
In Europe, combined organic revenues increased 1.1%, fueled by our Power Brands, which collectively grew 3%. Across our Kraft base business, organic revenues grew 1.7% as vol/mix gains resulted from increased focus and marketing support. The results were mixed across categories. Coffee and Cheese both grew mid-single digits. Jacobs, Hardwire, Kenco and Tassimo drove solid vol/mix gains in coffee and new product launches and a successful marketing campaign produced continued growth in PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese. 
Chocolate revenues were flat. Continued strength of Freia and Marabou in Scandinavia was offset by weak category performance in other parts of Europe. In biscuits, revenues declined slightly. Strong growth in Power Brands, including Oreo and Belvita was offset by the timing of promotional activity and weak category performance. In our Cadbury business, organic net revenues declined by 0.4%. Soft markets in Continental Europe, especially in gum, offset solid growth in Britain and Ireland. Despite this, Cadbury brands are holding or gaining share across Europe. 
Operating income margins in Europe rose to 12.4% on a combined basis. In our Kraft base business, OI margins improved by 140 basis points to 11.6%. This reflected continued productivity gains and lower overheads. Advertising spending for the quarter was down in this region due to the timing of programming. I would note, however, that it's up on a year-to-date basis. In addition, we shifted some A&C spending from the base Kraft business to Cadbury. 
Our Cadbury business also made a solid profit contribution in the quarter. Product mix improved and we continued to realize the benefits of supply chain efficiencies. As in North America, input costs are rising significantly and we're pricing accordingly. In fact, we've taken pricing or announced price increases on more than half of our European portfolio.
Turning now to Developing Markets, combined organic net revenue increased 4.8%. This was fueled by the continuing strength of our Power Brands, which were up 12%. This drove double-digit growth in both Asia Pacific and Latin America. In contrast to North America and Europe, however, we're seeing a sequentially smaller contribution from pricing in this region because inflation is now lower in many countries. 
In our Kraft base business, organic revenues grew 7.4%. Specifically, in Asia Pacific, China and Indonesia led the way. And Power Brands grew more than 30% propelled by Tang powdered beverage and Oreo cookies. And in Latin America, Power Brands grew 18% led by Oreo and Club Social biscuits and Lacta chocolate. These gains were partially offset by weak economic conditions and category trends in CEEMA. Despite this, we improved market shares in most markets. 
In our Cadbury business, organic revenues rose just 0.7%. This was expected as our actions to normalize trade inventories reduced Cadbury's growth by about four percentage points. Cadbury growth was also tempered by weakness in the gum category due to weak economic conditions. Our operating income margin in developing markets was 12.7%. Our base business profit margins declined to 13.1% as we stepped up advertising investments across the region. These investments more than offset gains in vol/mix and overhead leverage. Profit performance in our Cadbury business also reflected incremental advertising, as well as the impact of normalizing trade inventories. 
So in sum, we delivered solid top and bottom line performance in every geography behind our Power Brands. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Irene, who will discuss our outlook and provide an update on the Cadbury operation."

This is a solid base",339,"Thanks, Tim. As we move to the fourth quarter, despite the economic challenges, we anticipate a sequential increase in top line growth and we're well-positioned to deliver combined organic revenue growth of 3% to 4% for the full year. This is a solid base from which we'll generate top-tier growth in 2011 and beyond. As we've said, pricing will contribute more to our revenue growth than we anticipated at the start of the year. To backstop the pricing, we have solid Q4 programming in place, particularly in North America and Europe, which will accelerate growth and deliver our revenue guidance for the year. On the bottom line, as Tim said, we expect to deliver operating EPS of at least $2. At the same time, we'll fund increased A&C from about 7.5% last year to about 8% of net revenues in 2010.
Turning to the Cadbury integration, it continues to proceed smoothly. We are on track to generate cost synergies of at least $750 million in annual savings, about 15% of which will come this year. We're also on track to greatly improve our earnings growth trajectory. We're integrating Cadbury and driving the substantial savings and growth opportunities now available to us. As a result, our combined operating EPS by 2012 will surpass considerably what we could have achieved on our own. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver significantly higher long-term earnings growth of 9% to 11%. 
So to sum up, our fly wheel is turning and we're benefiting from a virtuous cycle of growth and focused reinvestment. We're setting growth objectives off a solid base. We're managing input costs by maintaining strong brand equities and pricing accordingly. We're driving gains in volume and mix through focused investments in Power Brands and key markets. We're driving productivity and reducing overhead cost to expand margins. And we're reinvesting a portion of our earnings upside to further strengthen our brands and lay an even stronger foundation for top-tier performance in 2011. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions."

One fundamental difference between last time that's happened and this time is that our brands are much stronger than they were last time. At last time, we were a bit reluctant because of the relatively weak brand equities to price aggressively. We've come out of the chute and quickly responded with pricing. We're entering that into a generally weak consumer environment but so far, we're quite pleased with the reaction from our customers, direct customers, retail partners and the consumer responses has been okay as well."

We haven't, generally speaking, we have not yet seen much from our competition and I think that's one of the reasons that our volume mix in the quarter was a little bit softer.

The first is as Tim referenced, a number of the new product launches, Trident Layers, the reality of having a very strong set of shipments in advance of the flu season. And there was a fairly significant push that they made in the second half of 2009. So we had expected to see a stronger performance from the business front half versus back half. And then on top of it, we have to choose to normalize some of the inventories as we've described. The business is delivering exactly as we had expected. We've got some issues here and there. Gum is a little bit weaker in a number of markets in the world, but that is being offset by some chocolate strength in a number of markets in the world.

First off, we had another good quarter in a challenging environment. Every geography delivered solid results. In North America, we posted sequential improvement in top line performance despite weak consumer demand and less merchandising activity than the prior year. In Europe, we delivered another quarter of solid revenue growth despite soft categories. We also continued to grow our margins and have sustained them in the low teens. In Developing Markets, further investment in our Power Brand and in priority markets again drove strong revenue growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America.
Second, as we told you in August, we plan to reinvest our first half earnings upside to build a stronger foundation for future growth. And that's exactly what we did. We continued to increase our investments in advertising, including a double-digit increase in North America. This ensures that our brands are as strong as possible as the economy improves. We also normalized Cadbury's trade inventories in certain developing markets. And as expected, this tempered our top line growth. So overall, the third quarter played out essentially as we planned. A notable exception was at input costs, including dairy, coffee and cocoa, rose much more than we had expected. To offset these higher costs, we began to price in several categories and in several markets. This affected our results in two ways: Our top line growth was driven more by price and by vol/mix and there was some pressure on gross margins because price realization trailed the increase in input costs.
The gross margin pressure we experienced in Q3 should ease, as price levels better align with input costs. The key take away is that the underlying momentum of our business remains strong. We're taking the necessary pricing actions despite a difficult consumer environment, as a testament to our strength in brand equities. And we continued to increase our advertising investments. This will further build our brands, stimulate our categories and position us well as the economy recovers.
Let me now turn it over to Tim to discuss our third quarter results in more detail."

As Irene just mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter results. They came in largely in line with our expectations.

As Irene just mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter results. They came in largely in line with our expectations. Now, let me provide some details.
I'll start by discussing our top line, where pricing was the primary driver of organic revenue growth as we move quickly to offset higher input costs. Organic net revenues for the combined business grew 2.1% as focused investments drove continued growth in our Power Brands. In the Kraft base business, organic revenues increased 2.5%, including 2.3 points from pricing. In fact, net pricing was up in every one of our business units.
In the Cadbury business, organic revenue growth was essentially flat, but in line with our expectations. This is due in part to our decision to normalize trade inventories in certain markets. Doing so reduced Cadbury's top line growth by about two points and reduced our combined revenue growth by approximately 1/2 of a percentage point. As you know, we're also comparing against the hard push by Cadbury in the second half of last year.
Now turning to profit, on a combined basis, our operating income margin, excluding acquisition and integration costs, was 13.6%. In our Kraft base business, operating income margin fell by 50 basis points to 13.9%. This was entirely due to our stepped up advertising investment, which lowered margins by about 100 basis points. At the same time, we continue to make excellent progress in productivity and in reducing overhead costs. For the Cadbury business, margins were 12.4% in the quarter. This reflected stepped-up marketing investment and the impact of the trade inventory reductions we've already mentioned. Overall, we continue to demonstrate strong underlying momentum but clearly, there's more opportunity ahead.
Turning to EPS, two key drivers affected the comparison of third quarter earnings year-on-year: A lower tax rate in 2009; and as we pointed out in August, we began to reinvest the $0.10 of earnings upside from the first half. Let me walk you through the bridge. Starting with Q3 of 2009, we earned $0.55, with $0.03 of that coming from the divested Pizza business. We also spent $0.01 on acquisition-related costs last year. So from a year ago base of $0.53, our operating EPS declined to $0.47. Our Kraft base business delivered $0.01 of operating gains, while covering approximately $0.05 from significantly increased advertising investments.
Cadbury contributed $0.12 of operating earnings in the quarter and higher interest expense and the change in shares outstanding lowered EPS by $0.11. So as you can see, the decline in operating EPS can be accounted for by $0.06 of higher year-on-year taxes. This year-on-year increase in taxes was a function of timing, with greater benefits from discreet items in the prior year quarter. Below the operating EPS line, we incurred a net impact of $0.04 from integration program and acquisition-related costs, resulting in our reported EPS of $0.43.
On a year-to-date basis, improved vol/mix, productivity and overhead cost savings have resulted in strong gains in operating earnings. We've done this while continuing to invest in our brands. And through the first nine months, we've earned $1.56, leaving us well-positioned to deliver our target of at least $2 for the year.
I'll take a few minutes now to share highlights of our business results by geography. In North America, we continued to make progress in a very difficult environment. We delivered sequential improvement in top line growth. On a combined basis, organic net revenues were up 1% compared with a decline of 1.3% in the second quarter of this year. We continued to invest more behind our Power Brands and they responded by growing 3% in the quarter. Chips Ahoy!, Velveeta and Kraft's Mac and Cheese, for example, grew double digits; while Ritz, Starbucks and Oscar Mayer Deli Fresh grew high single digits.
This solid progress, however, was partially offset by three things. First, soft categories and less merchandising especially in our Snacks business. Second, tough comps, particularly in our Cadbury business. While Stride and Dentyne Gum delivered strong growth, we were up against last year's highly successful launch of Trident Layers, as well as strong shipments of Halls, as customers stocked up in anticipation of an H1N1 flu season. And third, while pricing in response to higher input cost was a key driver of our top line growth, we did see some pressure in vol/mix. However, as we looked forward, we have solid programming in place and we anticipate more merchandising activity. Therefore, we expect further sequential improvement in organic growth across our North American portfolio in the fourth quarter.
Now let's look at profitability.
On a combined basis, our operating income margin in North America was 17.3%. In our Kraft base business, OI margin declined to 16.9%. This is due primarily to a double-digit increase in advertising. These brand building investments were funded by continuing benefits from productivity and overhead cost reductions. While input costs spiked in the quarter, we moved quickly to price accordingly. In fact, we've implemented or announced price increases in about 40% of our North American portfolio. However, price realization will lag higher input costs at least in the short term. Our Cadbury business posted strong operating income margins of 22.9%. Productivity gains and improved product mix were partially offset by higher spending behind new products.
In Europe, combined organic revenues increased 1.1%, fueled by our Power Brands, which collectively grew 3%. Across our Kraft base business, organic revenues grew 1.7% as vol/mix gains resulted from increased focus and marketing support. The results were mixed across categories. Coffee and Cheese both grew mid-single digits. Jacobs, Hardwire, Kenco and Tassimo drove solid vol/mix gains in coffee and new product launches and a successful marketing campaign produced continued growth in PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese.
Chocolate revenues were flat. Continued strength of Freia and Marabou in Scandinavia was offset by weak category performance in other parts of Europe. In biscuits, revenues declined slightly. Strong growth in Power Brands, including Oreo and Velveeta was offset by the timing of promotional activity and weak category performance. In our Cadbury business, organic net revenues declined by 0.4%. Soft markets in Continental Europe, especially in gum, offset solid growth in Britain and Ireland. Despite this, Cadbury brands are holding or gaining share across Europe.
Operating income margins in Europe rose to 12.4% on a combined basis. In our Kraft base business, OI margins improved by 140 basis points to 11.6%. This reflected continued productivity gains and lower overheads. Advertising spending for the quarter was down in this region due to the timing of programming. I would note, however, that it's up on a year-to-date basis. In addition, we shifted some A&C spending from the base Kraft business to Cadbury.
Our Cadbury business also made a solid profit contribution in the quarter. Product mix improved and we continued to realize the benefits of supply chain efficiencies. As in North America, input costs are rising significantly and we're pricing accordingly. In fact, we've taken pricing or announced price increases on more than half of our European portfolio.
Turning now to Developing Markets, combined organic net revenue increased 4.8%. This was fueled by the continuing strength of our Power Brands, which were up 12%. This drove double-digit growth in both Asia Pacific and Latin America. In contrast to North America and Europe, however, we're seeing a sequentially smaller contribution from pricing in this region because inflation is now lower in many countries.
In our Kraft base business, organic revenues grew 7.4%. Specifically, in Asia Pacific, China and Indonesia led the way. And Power Brands grew more than 30% propelled by Tang powdered beverage and Oreo cookies. And in Latin America, Power Brands grew 18% led by Oreo and Club Social biscuits and Lacta chocolate. These gains were partially offset by weak economic conditions and category trends in CEEMA. Despite this, we improved market shares in most markets.
In our Cadbury business, organic revenues rose just 0.7%. This is expected as our actions to normalize trade inventories reduced Cadbury's growth by about four percentage points. Cadbury growth was also tempered by weakness in the gum category due to weak economic conditions. Our operating income margin in developing markets was 12.7%. Our base business profit margins declined to 13.1% as we stepped up advertising investments across the region. These investments more than offset gains in vol/mix and overhead leverage. Profit performance in our Cadbury business also reflected incremental advertising, as well as the impact of normalizing trade inventories.
So in sum, we delivered solid top and bottom line performance in every geography behind our Power Brands. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Irene, who will discuss our outlook and provide an update on the Cadbury operation."

As we move to the fourth quarter, despite the economic challenges, we anticipate a sequential increase in top line growth and we're well-positioned to deliver combined organic revenue growth of 3% to 4% for the full year. This is a solid base from which we'll generate top-tier growth in 2011 and beyond. As we've said, pricing will contribute more to our revenue growth than we anticipated at the start of the year. To backstop the pricing, we have solid Q4 programming in place, particularly in North America and Europe, which will accelerate growth and deliver our revenue guidance for the year. On the bottom line, as Tim said, we expect to deliver operating EPS of at least $2. At the same time, we'll fund increased A&C from about 7.5% last year to about 8% of net revenues in 2010.
Turning to the Cadbury integration, it continues to proceed smoothly. We are on track to generate cost synergies of at least $750 million in annual savings, about 15% of which will come this year. We're also on track to greatly improve our earnings growth trajectory. We're integrating Cadbury and driving the substantial savings and growth opportunities now available to us. As a result, our combined operating EPS by 2012 will surpass considerably what we could have achieved on our own. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver significantly higher long-term earnings growth of 9% to 11%.
So to sum up, our fly wheel is turning and we're benefiting from a virtuous cycle of growth and focused reinvestment. We're setting growth objectives off a solid base. We're managing input costs by maintaining strong brand equities and pricing accordingly. We're driving gains in volume and mix through focused investments in Power Brands and key markets. We're driving productivity and reducing overhead cost to expand margins. And we're reinvesting a portion of our earnings upside to further strengthen our brands and lay an even stronger foundation for top-tier performance in 2011.
Now, we'd be happy to take your questions."

And so consequently, you have to offset that element of it on the -- when you take your $0.12 and your $0.06 and your $0.05, you have to reflect that the shares would be the better part of $0.09 impact that. Actually on a year-to-date basis, Cadbury is $0.10 or $0.11 dilutive on the way to the $0.16 as we originally laid out."

First off, we had another good quarter in a challenging environment. Every geography delivered solid results. In North America, we posted sequential improvement in top line performance despite weak consumer demand and less merchandising activity than the prior year. In Europe, we delivered another quarter of solid revenue growth despite soft categories. We also continued to grow our margins and have sustained them in the low teens. In Developing Markets, further investment in our Power Brands and in priority markets again drove strong revenue growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America.
 Second, as we told you in August, we plan to reinvest our first half earnings upside to build a stronger foundation for future growth. And that's exactly what we did. We continued to increase our investments in advertising, including a double-digit increase in North America. This ensures that our brands are as strong as possible as the economy improves. We also normalized Cadbury's trade inventories in certain developing markets. And as expected, this tempered our top line growth. So overall, the third quarter played out essentially as we planned. A notable exception was at input costs, including dairy, coffee and cocoa, rose much more than we had expected. To offset these higher costs, we began to price in several categories and in several markets. This affected our results in two ways: Our top line growth was driven more by price and by vol/mix and there was some pressure on gross margins because price realization trailed the increase in input costs.
 The gross margin pressure we experienced in Q3 should ease, as price levels better align with input costs. The key take away is that the underlying momentum of our business remains strong. We're taking the necessary pricing actions despite a difficult consumer environment, as a testament to our strength in brand equities. And we continued to increase our advertising investments. This will further build our brands, stimulate our categories and position us well as the economy recovers.
 Let me now turn it over to Tim to discuss our third quarter results in more detail.

As Irene just mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter results. They came in largely in line with our expectations. Now, let me provide some details. I'll start by discussing our top line, where pricing was the",1454," Thanks, Irene, and Good afternoon. As Irene just mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter results. They came in largely in line with our expectations. Now, let me provide some details.
 I'll start by discussing our top line, where pricing was the primary driver of organic revenue growth as we move quickly to offset higher input costs. Organic net revenues for the combined business grew 2.1% as focused investments drove continued growth in our Power Brands. In the Kraft base business, organic revenues increased 2.5%, including 2.3 points from pricing. In fact, net pricing was up in every one of our business units.
 In the Cadbury business, organic revenue growth was essentially flat, but in line with our expectations. This is due in part to our decision to normalize trade inventories in certain markets. Doing so reduced Cadbury's top line growth by about two points and reduced our combined revenue growth by approximately 1/2 of a percentage point. As you know, we're also comparing against the hard push by Cadbury in the second half of last year.
 Now turning to profit, on a combined basis, our operating income margin, excluding acquisition and integration costs, was 13.6%. In our Kraft base business, operating income margin fell by 50 basis points to 13.9%. This was entirely due to our stepped up advertising investment, which lowered margins by about 100 basis points. At the same time, we continue to make excellent progress in productivity and in reducing overhead costs. For the Cadbury business, margins were 12.4% in the quarter. This reflected stepped-up marketing investment and the impact of the trade inventory reductions we've already mentioned. Overall, we continue to demonstrate strong underlying momentum but clearly, there's more opportunity ahead.
 Turning to EPS, two key drivers affected the comparison of third quarter earnings year-on-year: A lower tax rate in 2009; and as we pointed out in August, we began to reinvest the $0.10 of earnings upside from the first half. Let me walk you through the bridge. Starting with Q3 of 2009, we earned $0.55, with $0.03 of that coming from the divested Pizza business. We also spent $0.01 on acquisition-related costs last year. So from a year ago base of $0.53, our operating EPS declined to $0.47. Our Kraft base business delivered $0.01 of operating gains, while covering approximately $0.05 from significantly increased advertising investments.
 Cadbury contributed $0.12 of operating earnings in the quarter and higher interest expense and the change in shares outstanding lowered EPS by $0.11. So as you can see, the decline in operating EPS can be accounted for by $0.06 of higher year-on-year taxes. This year-on-year increase in taxes was a function of timing, with greater benefits from discreet items in the prior year quarter. Below the operating EPS line, we incurred a net impact of $0.04 from integration program and acquisition-related costs, resulting in our reported EPS of $0.43.
 On a year-to-date basis, improved vol/mix, productivity and overhead cost savings have resulted in strong gains in operating earnings. We've done this while continuing to invest in our brands. And through the first nine months, we've earned $1.56, leaving us well-positioned to deliver our target of at least $2 for the year.
 I'll take a few minutes now to share highlights of our business results by geography. In North America, we continued to make progress in a very difficult environment. We delivered sequential improvement in top line growth. On a combined basis, organic net revenues were up 1% compared with a decline of 1.3% in the second quarter of this year. We continued to invest more behind our Power Brands and they responded by growing 3% in the quarter. Chips Ahoy!, Belvita and Kraft's Mac and Cheese, for example, grew double digits; while Ritz, Starbucks and Oscar Mayer Deli Fresh grew high single digits.
 This solid progress, however, was partially offset by three things: First, soft categories and less merchandising especially in our Snacks business; second, tough comps, particularly in our Cadbury business. While Stride and Dentyne Gum delivered strong growth, we were up against last year's highly successful launch of Trident Layers, as well as strong shipments of Halls, as customers stocked up in anticipation of an H1N1 flu season.
 And third, while pricing in response to higher input cost was a key driver of our top line growth, we did see some pressure in vol/mix. However, as we looked forward, we have solid programming in place and we anticipate more merchandising activity. Therefore, we expect further sequential improvement in organic growth across our North American portfolio in the fourth quarter. Now let's look at profitability.
 On a combined basis, our operating income margin in North America was 17.3%. In our Kraft base business, OI margin declined to 16.9%. This is due primarily to a double-digit increase in advertising. These brand building investments were funded by continuing benefits from productivity and overhead cost reductions. While input costs spiked in the quarter, we moved quickly to price accordingly. In fact, we've implemented or announced price increases in about 40% of our North American portfolio. However, price realization will lag higher input costs at least in the short term. Our Cadbury business posted strong operating income margins of 22.9%. Productivity gains and improved product mix were partially offset by higher spending behind new products.
 In Europe, combined organic revenues increased 1.1%, fueled by our Power Brands, which collectively grew 3%. Across our Kraft base business, organic revenues grew 1.7% as vol/mix gains resulted from increased focus and marketing support. The results were mixed across categories. Coffee and Cheese both grew mid-single digits. Jacobs, Hardwire, Kenco and Tassimo drove solid vol/mix gains in coffee and new product launches and a successful marketing campaign produced continued growth in PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese.
 Chocolate revenues were flat. Continued strength of Freia and Marabou in Scandinavia was offset by weak category performance in other parts of Europe. In biscuits, revenues declined slightly. Strong growth in Power Brands, including Oreo and Belvita was offset by the timing of promotional activity and weak category performance. In our Cadbury business, organic net revenues declined by 0.4%. Soft markets in Continental Europe, especially in gum, offset solid growth in Britain and Ireland. Despite this, Cadbury brands are holding or gaining share across Europe.
 Operating income margins in Europe rose to 12.4% on a combined basis. In our Kraft base business, OI margins improved by 140 basis points to 11.6%. This reflected continued productivity gains and lower overheads. Advertising spending for the quarter was down in this region due to the timing of programming. I would note, however, that it's up on a year-to-date basis. In addition, we shifted some A&C spending from the base Kraft business to Cadbury.
 Our Cadbury business also made a solid profit contribution in the quarter. Product mix improved and we continued to realize the benefits of supply chain efficiencies. As in North America, input costs are rising significantly and we're pricing accordingly. In fact, we've taken pricing or announced price increases on more than half of our European portfolio.
 Turning now to Developing Markets, combined organic net revenue increased 4.8%. This was fueled by the continuing strength of our Power Brands, which were up 12%. This drove double-digit growth in both Asia Pacific and Latin America. In contrast to North America and Europe, however, we're seeing a sequentially smaller contribution from pricing in this region because inflation is now lower in many countries.
 In our Kraft base business, organic revenues grew 7.4%. Specifically, in Asia Pacific, China and Indonesia led the way. And Power Brands grew more than 30% propelled by Tang powdered beverage and Oreo cookies. And in Latin America, Power Brands grew 18% led by Oreo and Club Social biscuits and Lacta chocolate. These gains were partially offset by weak economic conditions and category trends in CEEMA. Despite this, we improved market shares in most markets.
 In our Cadbury business, organic revenues rose just 0.7%. This was expected as our actions to normalize trade inventories reduced Cadbury's growth by about four percentage points. Cadbury growth was also tempered by weakness in the gum category due to weak economic conditions. Our operating income margin in developing markets was 12.7%. Our base business profit margins declined to 13.1% as we stepped up advertising investments across the region. These investments more than offset gains in vol/mix and overhead leverage. Profit performance in our Cadbury business also reflected incremental advertising, as well as the impact of normalizing trade inventories.
 So in sum, we delivered solid top and bottom line performance in every geography behind our Power Brands. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Irene, who will discuss our outlook and provide an update on the Cadbury operation.

As we move to the fourth quarter, despite the economic challenges, we anticipate a sequential increase in top line growth and we're well-positioned to deliver combined organic revenue growth of 3% to 4% for the full year. This is a solid base from which we'll generate top-tier growth in 2011 and beyond. As we've said, pricing will contribute more to our revenue growth than we anticipated at the start of the year. To backstop the pricing, we have solid Q4 programming in place, particularly in North America and Europe, which will accelerate growth and deliver our revenue guidance for the year. On the bottom line, as Tim said, we expect to deliver operating EPS of at least $2. At the same time, we'll fund increased A&C from about 7.5% last year to about 8% of net revenues in 2010.
 Turning to the Cadbury integration, it continues to proceed smoothly. We are on track to generate cost synergies of at least $750 million in annual savings, about 15% of which will come this year. We're also on track to greatly improve our earnings growth trajectory. We're integrating Cadbury and driving the substantial savings and growth opportunities now available to us. As a result, our combined operating EPS by 2012 will surpass considerably what we could have achieved on our own. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver significantly higher long-term earnings growth of 9% to 11%.
 So to sum up, our fly wheel is turning and we're benefiting from a virtuous cycle of growth and focused reinvestment. We're setting growth objectives off a solid base. We're managing input costs by maintaining strong brand equities and pricing accordingly. We're driving gains in volume and mix through focused investments in Power Brands and key markets. We're driving productivity and reducing overhead cost to expand margins. And we're reinvesting a portion of our earnings upside to further strengthen our brands and lay an even stronger foundation for top-tier performance in 2011. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions.

One fundamental difference between last time that's happened and this time is that our brands are much stronger than they were last time. At last time, we were a bit reluctant because of the relatively weak brand equities to price aggressively. We've come out of the chute and quickly responded with pricing. We're entering that into a generally weak consumer environment but so far, we're quite pleased with the reaction from our customers, direct customers, retail partners and the consumer responses has been okay as well.

Generally speaking, we have price, as Tim said, we moved rather quickly to be able to address the escalating input costs. We haven't, generally speaking, we have not yet seen much from our competition and I think that's one of the reasons that our volume mix in the quarter was a little bit softer. But the reality is, costs are going up for everyone and we would expect that price gaps will narrow as the quarter progresses, as the fourth quarter progresses.

The opportunity though -- first of all, the profit benefit of that will come a little bit later because most of those opportunities will require some investment.

It will have and is already having the transformational impact on our portfolio that we had hoped it would have. If you recall, their plan was front half loaded, reflecting a number of factors. The first is as Tim referenced, a number of the new product launches, Trident Layers, the reality of having a very strong set of shipments in advance of the flu season. And there was a fairly significant push that they made in the second half of 2009. So we had expected to see a stronger performance from the business front half versus back half. And then on top of it, we have to choose to normalize some of the inventories as we've described. The business is delivering exactly as we had expected. We've got some issues here and there. Gum is a little bit weaker in a number of markets in the world, but that is being offset by some chocolate strength in a number of markets in the world.

There are three things that we want to address today. First,",4029,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning to all of you. How's your New Year been? You've been a little busy? I thought I must say it's especially nice to see so many familiar faces in the audience today. There are three things that we want to address today. First, we're exiting the turnaround that I laid out three years ago on this very stage, with strong operating and financial momentum. I'd like to take a few minutes to review the progress we made in 2009, including some highlights from our fourth quarter results announced earlier this morning. Second, I'll review our combination with Cadbury, and underscore again why we believe the combination of Kraft Foods and Cadbury has created a global powerhouse; one that can deliver top-tier margins and growth on a sustainable basis. And third, Tim will provide an update on the transaction, where we are on the process, including our early thoughts on integration. So let's begin.
Three years ago, we laid out our plan to return Kraft Foods to long-term sustainable growth. In the first year, we said we would rejuvenate top line growth. And we did. In the second year, we said we would grow both the top and the bottom lines. And we did. In the third year, we said we would focus on building our profit margins and market share. And as we've done this, we have a strong foundation underlying our long-term model, targeting EPS growth of 7% to 9%.
Three years ago, no one could've predicted the environment we'd face in the ensuing years, from record high-input costs to global recession. But despite it all, we did what we said we would do, and we've emerged a much stronger company. We began our turnaround by decentralizing and aligning our businesses and functions with common incentives. Our business unit leaders have been focused on three simple metrics: Revenue growth, income growth and cash flow. And they've been the key drivers of our turnaround.
Over the past three years, we've made tremendous progress on each measure. Since 2006, on average we've driven 4.5% organic revenue growth per year. We've made significant investments in product quality, marketing and innovation; while growing operating income 10% per year on average, and raising our operating income margin to 13.7% in 2009. That's up from 12.6% in 2008.
We've put a greater focus on cash flow, and it paid off. In 2009, we generated cash flow equal to 124% of our net earnings. That's up from 83% in 2006. But the true measure of success for any turnaround is how well we've staged our business for future growth on that criteria. And I'm pleased to report that we exited 2009 with strong operating and financial momentum.
Since 2007, we've invested more than $500 million to improve our product quality, as our products have gone from good enough to truly delicious. Consumers have noticed. Today, about a 2/3 of our products are preferred to the competition versus only 44% in 2006. Putting quality back into our products and differentiating ourselves from the competition has enabled us to re-establish our pricing power. And as a result of stronger brand equities, we've been able to manage higher input costs and improve the alignment of our prices and our cost structure, while still investing in our franchises. This was a necessary step to restoring profit margins, and it's been a key contributor of our results to date.
As a consequence, going forward, the ability to manage changes in input costs through pricing will allow more of our productivity gains to flow to the bottom line. Another example of our operating momentum has been our improvement in volume and product mix, despite significant headwinds. The challenging economic environment has led to weakening consumption trends around the world.
In North America, unemployment is higher than it's been in 18 years, and many of those who hold a job don't feel secure. In Europe, unemployment continues to rise, both in Western and Eastern Europe. And in Asia and Latin America, while consumption is still growing, it's well below historical levels.
From a planning perspective, we're expecting a continuation of these trends until at least the back half of 2010. But we're certainly not sitting still in the face of these macroeconomic factors. We've taken some strategic actions over the past several quarters to discontinue less profitable product lines and to forego unprofitable volume, thereby, resetting our revenue base. While this has reduced near-term volume, it's clearly been the right long-term decision and enables us to grow off of a much stronger base.
Despite these headwinds, you can see that we delivered sequential improvement in vol/mix in every quarter of 2009. Having said that, I do want to acknowledge that our fourth quarter came in somewhat lighter than our forecast of approximately 3% growth. Why is that? Two reasons: One is lower than anticipated consumer offtake for the macroeconomic reasons I just cited, particularly in North America and Europe; the other is that we made the decision to avoid chasing certain U.S. competitors, particularly in mainstream coffee and snack nuts, competitors that were chasing unprofitable, unsustainable volume. Instead, we chose to invest in more sustainable long-term brand building by significantly increasing our fourth quarter advertising and consumer spending. This will clearly pay dividends in 2010. Nonetheless, in contrast to many of our peers, we continued to drive sequentially better volume/mix in the fourth quarter, delivering more than 1.5 points of growth.
Looking at another measure of our momentum, we're expanding both gross and operating margins, while continuing to invest in future growth. In 2009, we increased our advertising and consumer spending to 7.2% of net revenues. That's up from 6.7% in 2008. What's more, A&C [advertising and consumer] spending increased even though advertising rates have come down considerably year-over-year.
Take a look at three of our newest spots from the U.S.
[Presentation]
These spots have been extremely well received, and are doing a great job of building our brand franchises. In addition to increasing our marketing investments, we were able to accelerate a number of cost savings programs, primarily related to our reorganization in Europe and our broader overhead initiatives. We spent more than $300 million in 2009, considerably higher than the more than $200 million we had identified in early November.
As this chart shows, we've improved our operating margin year-over-year in every quarter of 2009. Vol/mix continued to be a key driver of margin upside. In the fourth quarter, vol/mix drove 70 basis points of margin improvement. And for the full year, operating margin rose to 13.7%, with vol/mix driving 50 basis points of the increase. As you can see, we've made good progress toward our goal of restoring our profit margins to industry benchmarks, while still investing significantly in productivity and brand building.
Finally, our momentum is broad-based. To be fair, we're not pitching a perfect game. As you know, that's difficult when you're managing a broad portfolio. But our businesses in each region are making good progress against their objectives in a very difficult environment.
Let's take a closer look at each regions starting with North America. In the fourth quarter, organic net revenue declined 2.7%. This was due entirely to a pricing decline of almost four percentage points. Lower dairy costs and the related adjustments under our adaptive pricing model represented about 2.5 percentage points of the decline. Vol/mix rose more than one percentage point, fueled by growth in priority categories.
This gross was tempered by three factors. First, we continue to optimize the size of our Natural Cheese business. This more than offset the vol/mix gains in our more profitable priority brands, Kraft Singles, PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese and Velveeta. Second, we made the conscious decision not to chase on sustainable promotional activity in both mainstream coffee and snack nuts. And third, we saw declines in a number of our non-core biscuit brands. This was the result of weaker trends in the biscuit category in the second half of the year, due to reduced merchandising at a key customer.
Operating income margin in North America rose to 16.6% in the fourth quarter, as we improved the alignment between input cost and pricing. It's also important to note that margins rose, even as we made significant investments in cost savings and marketing initiatives. In fact, we increased our investments in A&C at a double-digit rate versus the prior year.
For the full year, organic net revenue in North America declined slightly. During the year, we effectively managed the transition to vol/mix driven growth from price-based growth. In the end, the contribution from pricing was a negative 50 basis points, due to entirely to a 160-basis-point impact from lower dairy costs.
Priority categories fueled the gains in vol/mix. However, these gains were offset by a 70-basis-point impact from discontinuing less profitable product lines. The good news is that as we exited the fourth quarter, we've now fully lapped the major product line discontinuations, and will be on an apples-to-apples basis going forward.
Segment operating income rose to 17.3%, again, better alignment of input costs and pricing drove the improvement, despite incremental investments in cost savings and marketing. In terms of U.S. market share, as we lacked the significant pricing actions of 2008, we're making slow but steady progress in regaining U.S. market share. Our 52-week trends are improving, with 45% of our retail revenue gaining or holding share. We're not yet where we want to be, but we expect this positive trend to continue in 2010. In fact, according to the data we've just received, we are gaining or holding share in well over 50% of our U.S. retail revenue for the 52 weeks ending January.
Turning now to Europe, organic net revenues were down slightly, as we continued to take the necessary actions to improve margins. The discontinuation of product lines and our decision to forego unprofitable volume resulted in a two-percentage-point headwind to vol/mix. In addition, the economic slowdown has continued to negatively impact consumption, with particular weakness in Spain, Portugal and France. And given the strong position of the LU Biscuit brands in these markets, it caused a modest revenue decline on our overall European Biscuit business as well.
Despite the difficult economic conditions, we posted solid market share in most categories due to continued investments in our focus brands. At the profit line, fourth quarter operating margins were 8.2%. Improved product mix contributed 90 basis points of the margin improvement. But this was offset by significant investments in cost savings initiatives and a strong increase in marketing investments to support our priority brands.
For the full year, our European business posted solid results in a very eventful year. We shifted to a category-led operating structure and integrated the LU Biscuit business, all while managing through a very tough recession. On the top line, organic revenue in Europe declined by 1%, as vol/mix was negatively affected by the discontinuation of product lines and our decision to forego unprofitable volume. At the same time, market share performance was good, particularly in chocolate, coffee and cheese.
On the bottom line, our operating income margin rose to 9%. Vol/mix improved margins by 90 basis points, while we continued to make major investments and cost savings initiatives and marketing.
Turning to developing markets, organic revenues grew by more than 10% in the fourth quarter. Our priority brands drove strong revenue gains across the board. In Asia, priority brands grew about 30%. In Latin America, up 25%. And in CEEMA [Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa], up double digits.
What's more, we grew market share in almost every one of our key country category combinations. Operating margin was 8.1%. This reflects improved vol/mix and cost-price alignment, offset by strong double-digit increases in A&C spending versus the prior year. Our full year developing market results showed that our 5-10-10 focus continues to pay off. We posted strong revenue and share growth despite softening category trends.
Overall, organic revenues grew nearly 10%. And our priority brands grew even faster, up 18%. Operating income margins were 11.8%. And as in every region, we continued to invest in additional cost savings initiatives and incremental A&C to fuel future growth.
As a result of the improved regional operating performance, we've got strong underlying financial momentum. In 2009, we earned $2.03 per diluted share. That represents 7% EPS growth over 2008 on a GAAP basis and 14% growth on a constant currency basis. I'd also note that our 2009 EPS includes a negative impact of $0.04 from expenses related to the Cadbury transaction. I know that breaking the $2 barrier may seem like the end of an era for many of you. But rest assured, it's just the beginning from our perspective.
In fact, let's take a closer look at the drivers of EPS growth. As you can see on this chart, operating gains were a key driver, delivering $0.15 of improvement over prior year. We've also made exceptional progress in terms of cash flow. In no small measure, this reflects the fact that cash flow is now a key compensation metric for our managers. We generated significant gains in 2009 from intense focus on working capital efficiency and improved earnings, while ensuring we're supporting our growth with sufficient CapEx.
Looking at the numbers, free cash flow for 2009 increased 35% to $3.8 billion. I would note that we got a working capital benefit due to timing of some payables at the end of the year. But even excluding this impact, our free cash flow still rose considerably in 2009.
So to recap the progress we've made, we're exiting our turnaround with our base operations in great shape in every region around the world, and their solid momentum behind each line of our P&L. The four turnaround strategies I laid out three years ago have positioned us well to deliver sustainable profitable growth.
And as promised, the flywheel is now turning. I firmly believe that going forward, we can benefit now from a virtuous cycle. We're setting growth objectives off a solid base. We're managing input costs by maintaining strong brand equities and pricing accordingly. We're driving vol/mix gains through focused, prioritized investments. We're leveraging our scale, while driving down overhead costs. And we're meeting or exceeding our earnings commitments, while reinvesting in future growth.
We've made good progress, but we're certainly not satisfied that our base business has reached its full potential. We remain focused on driving further improvements in our vol/mix growth and in strengthening U.S. market shares. We've essentially completed our product line discontinuations, and we have now a solid base from which to grow. We'll continue to further optimize trade spending, while increasing A&C. And as the economic environment stabilizes and consumer sentiment improves, we'll be shifting the balance of efforts back toward new product development from value-based marketing.
On the cost side, we're continuing to execute significant programs to improve productivity and reduce overhead. We're well into the execution phase of our end-to-end productivity programs and the overhead cost-reset initiatives we outlined in September. These initiatives will enable us to continue to fuel our investments in quality, marketing and innovation, while delivering on our targets of reaching mid-teens margins on our base business by 2011.
So as I've said before, we didn't need to acquire Cadbury to deliver our existing growth targets. In fact, when we first announced our intention to acquire Cadbury, many of you have asked, ""Why now?"" And the answer is that having successfully reinvigorated our base business, we're now ready to write the next chapter in our transformation.
The time is right for us to accelerate our transformation from a position of strength. We can leverage our strong financial momentum to accelerate our progress. And we've prepared our organization to execute with excellence in a number of important ways. We've strengthened our leadership team. We've streamlined our organizational structure. And our global organization has the skills and appetite to integrate a large-scale combination. Now we're ready to take both Kraft Foods and Cadbury to a level neither could reach on its own. And create a combined growth company with unmatched talent, brands, capabilities and resources.
Let's take a brief look at the newest member of our family.
[Presentation]
As I've said over the past several months, this combination is all about growth. The new Kraft Foods will deliver top-tier organic revenue growth through a focus on higher growth, higher margin categories and expanding footprint in developing markets and a greater presence in growing trade channels. And we'll target industry-leading margins through improved product mix and leveraging our global scale.
Cadbury and Kraft each had strong plans to get to mid-tiered margins prior to our combination. And the synergies inherent in combining the two companies will enable us to take things to a whole new level of long-term growth and margin potential.
Let's start with our category mix. The fast-growing Confectionery and Snacks segments will now make up the majority of our portfolio. In fact, almost 70% of our revenue outside North America now comes from Snacks and Confectionery, two rapidly growing, highly expandable categories.
We go to market with a portfolio of iconic brands that consumers around the world love and trust. In fact, we now have 11 brands with annual revenues of more than $1 billion. Six of them are Confectionery and Snacks brands. And we have at least $1 billion brand in every consumer segment in which we compete.
On a local basis, we're even stronger. 80% of our worldwide revenues are derived from brands where we hold the number one market position. This is driven by more than 70 brands, including more than 40 confectionery brands with revenues in excess of $100 million. These brands are icons in their respective markets. We take enormous pride in our stewardship of these brands and the legacies entrusted to our care. And I'm confident that these beloved brands will thrive with focused incremental marketing and merchandising investments that we can now provide.
From a geographic perspective, more than half of our business is now outside North America. More than a quarter of our revenue comes from fast-growing developing markets, up from 20% before. Our developing markets scale is now greater than any of our North American food tiers. And this scale, this presence is the cornerstone on which we will grow our strong brands even faster. For instance, as we've said before, the geographic footprint of Kraft and Cadbury is highly complementary. We now have considerably greater scale in key developing markets that will benefit all of our categories.
As of this chart shows, combined net revenues will be approximately $1.5 billion in Brazil, $1 billion in Russia, about $400 million in India, $500 million in China and about $800 million in Mexico. This will lead to significant revenue synergies, as we expand the distribution of each of our respective brands into new markets.
For example, products under the Cadbury and Trident brands will benefit from a substantially strengthened presence in countries like Brazil, Russia and China. For Kraft brands, such as Oreo and Tang, Cadbury gives us a meaningful entry into India, and fundamentally transforms the reach of our brands in Mexico and South Africa.
But that's only half the story. We now go to market from an even stronger position. Together, we possess exceptional and complementary sales and distribution capabilities. Kraft Foods is strong in modern retail channels that is traditional grocery stores. Indeed, our scale is unmatched in North America, where we have unique capabilities to drive performance. And as large retail formats grow globally, we're in a strong position to capitalize on that.
At the same time, Cadbury is very strong in instant consumption channels. This is an important class of trade in both developed and developing markets, in part because instant consumption channels provide incremental reach to large retail formats. What's more, these channels typically carry opportunities for higher margins and higher growth. And nowhere is this more important than in the Confectionery and Snacks segments.
From a distribution perspective, our leadership in Confectionery is highly complementary to our Biscuit business. And being a global leader in both Confectionery and Biscuits will not only provide our combined business with significant scale, but also with exciting innovation platforms. Together, we will be the global leader in sweet snacks, with leading market shares in every major region in the world. This scale will be an increasing source of competitive advantage in both the Confectionery and Snacks segments, and the food industry as a whole.
For these reasons, I'm highly confident that we are well-positioned to drive top-tier organic revenue growth for the foreseeable future. Our portfolio is now more heavily weighted toward faster growing categories and geographies. And on top of that, we have a long runway of meaningful revenue synergies ahead of us with every geography benefiting. In the end, I firmly believe that this portfolio, with its unique profile, can deliver at least 5% organic revenue growth on a consistent basis over the long term. This assumes highly achievable growth objectives for every geography, 3% to 5% in North America, 2% to 3% in Europe and 10% plus in developing markets.
On the cost side, we will access the benefits of our significant global scale. With about $50 billion in revenue, we're the world's second largest food company and number one in North America. But I'm not talking about big for bigness sake. In an ever consolidating marketplace, scale is a source of great competitive advantage. Our size and presence in more than 160 countries gives us that scale. Greater scale should lead to meaningful cost savings. As you know, both Kraft and Cadbury each had strong cost savings pipelines. But we're targeting cost synergies of at least $675 million on top of each company's base plans, including Cadbury's vision Into Action program. Thus far, we've identified potential annual pretax cost savings in three areas: Operational synergies of $300 million; the result of efficiencies and economies of scale in procurement, manufacturing, customer service, logistics and R&D; general and administrative synergies of approximately $250 million; and marketing and selling synergies of $125 million from efficiencies and economies of scale in marketing, media and selling expense.
We expect to achieve the run rate on those savings by the end of the third year. And we estimate one-off implementation cash cost of about $1.3 billion. We believe these targets are highly achievable. We'll provide more detail on the flow of both the cost and the benefits in the coming months. This strong pipeline of cost-savings initiatives is designed to accelerate our margin expansion. Productivity savings will better leverage our scale in manufacturing and operations. We'll leverage our overhead costs to fuel further margin expansion. We'll use a portion of these savings to fund higher A&C as a percent of net revenue. And we'll increase investments in sales, R&D and marketing to support future growth.
As a result, I firmly believe we can simultaneously fuel investments in quality, marketing and innovation for top line growth, while still delivering healthy, sustainable margin expansion. In fact, we've set our sights on a long-term operating profit margin in the mid to high teens, up from 13.7% in 2009. This combination improves our overall growth profile and positions us for sustainable, profitable growth in the top tier of our industry. We'll be driving high quality organic revenue growth, executing a strong pipeline of cost-savings initiatives, while still increasing investments in marketing, sales and R&D. As we do this, we're targeting long-term organic revenue growth to accelerate from 4% or more, to 5% or more. We'll drive our margins, as I said, to the mid to high teens. And we'll enhance our long-term EPS growth rate from 7% to 9%, to 9% to 11%. We know that these are aggressive financial targets. But we also know that we have a very unique portfolio and a unique set of opportunities in front of us. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the months ahead. Now, let me turn it over to Tim McLevish."

As of February 4, 75% of Cadbury share",1483,"Thanks, Irene, and good morning. At this point, I'd like to update you on the status of our transaction and discuss what you're going to expect from us going forward. First, here's where we stand in the tender offer. As of February 4, 75% of Cadbury shares have been tendered, which enabled us to initiate the delisting process. So Cadbury will be delisted from the London Stock Exchange as early as March 8. In terms of tenders received to date, as of late last week, over 90% had been tendered. And yesterday, we initiated the process for a compulsory acquisition, also known as a squeeze-out. So within six to seven weeks, we expect to own 100% of Cadbury. And finally, through yesterday, we've completed settlements of all shares accepted through February 2, or about 72%.
We've also completed the financing for the transaction. On this chart, you can see a profile of our current debt including Cadbury's outstanding debentures. Earlier this month, we successfully raised $9.5 billion in the U.S. in a four-tranche bond offering. As we committed at the outset of this process, we've maintained our investment grade credit rating. Importantly, while maintaining good access to Tier 2 commercial paper.
We expect to reduce our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to around 3x over the next 18 to 24 months. We'll deliver through a combination of debt reduction and EBITDA growth. We'll apply proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion from the sale of our Pizza business. Also, under the terms of our agreement with European Commission, we're required to divest certain Cadbury operations in Romania and Poland. The combined revenue of these businesses is approximately $200 million. So these divestitures will provide additional funds, albeit at modest, to further delevering. As we've stated throughout the transaction, we'll maintain our dividend. However, until our debt leverage targets are achieved, we have no plans to increase it, nor will we be repurchasing any shares. We also expect to draw on our bridge facility in the near term. But we'll quickly take out the balance through a combination of proceeds from the pizza divestiture and cash generated from our operations.
From the very beginning of this process, we've set out four key criteria to maintain financial discipline. First, accretive to cash EPS in the second year. This transaction is expected to add approximately $0.05 to earnings in 2011, the first full year of our combined companies. Second, a return on investment well in excess of our cost of capital. And we expect to deliver mid-teens internal rate of return. Third, maintain our investment grade credit rating. This has been confirmed by the rating agencies. And fourth, maintain our dividend per share. With our strong cash flows and the capital structure we put in place, we expect to work down our leverage while still maintaining our dividend.
Throughout the process, there were some doubters and much talk about the ultimate size of our checkbook. But as you can see, the final terms of the deal fell well within the balance of our original criteria. So not only is this deal a strategic home run, we've touched all the bases on the financial front as well.
Let me now turn to integration. At this point, we've been working with the Cadbury team for less than two weeks. While we don't have all the answers yet, I can share some early thoughts about how we will proceed. Let's start with backroom systems and processes. It would generally be more cost effective and efficient to adopt the Kraft platform. On the other hand with front-room activities, we'll go with the best practice from whichever company has it. And when it comes to people decisions, we choose the best person for the right role. And how will we make those decisions? We have a global team of executives from both companies in charge of bringing our companies together.
Tim Cofer is leading from Kraft and he's paired with Mark Reckitt from Cadbury. Tim is ideally suited for his role. He's an 18-year veteran of Kraft, he most recently led our Pizza business. Perhaps even more important, he managed our 26-country European Chocolate business from 2003 through 2006. He's a proven leader who is familiar with growth business and has a relentless focus on cost and quality. Working hand in hand with Tim will be Mark Reckitt. Mark is a 20-year Cadbury veteran. He knows the company through and through, from structure to financials to people. Indeed, he's been a chief architect of the strategies that have made Cadbury so successful. We're delighted that Mark has accepted our offer to partner with Tim in helping us combine our two great companies. Mark embodies the heart and soul of Cadbury. We know he'll be a great partner in helping us truly capture the best of both, and capitalize on the growth opportunities created by this combination.
As we work our way through this, Tim, Mark and the rest of the team will be guided by six practical principles. First and foremost, we'll maintain business momentum. Many integrations fail, not because the cost synergies have not been captured, but rather because the Base business has not been properly looked after. We'll minimize the disruption to our day-to-day business so as to keep building and growing our brands. Second principle, we'll follow the money using the 80/20 rule. By that, we mean spending time on those things that will bring the greatest benefit to the organization. Third, capture best of both. Fourth, treat people fairly and with respect. Fifth, move quickly. And sixth, communicate, communicate and communicate. The process will be as fair and as transparent as possible. And we're going to move quickly but prudently. The reality is, we all have a lot of homework to do because of the way this transaction came together. We're just starting some critical conversations.
So when can you expect some more answers? Let me share a timeline. Within the first 45 days, we intend to name the executive team, the leaders of the regions, areas and countries and direct reports to the functional leaders. Once those are completed and within the first 90 days, we intend to announce the next level of management for each region, country and category. We'll also determine whether and how we'll consolidate any region, area and country office locations or our various research and development facilities. Within six months, we'll finalize the blueprint for our combined manufacturing network. I hope now you can appreciate all that's going on to ensure both the smooth integration and to validate our original assumptions on the deal, which brings me to earnings guidance.
At present, our ability to issue earnings guidance remains limited for two important reasons. First, U.K. Listing Authority rules require any earnings forecast to be reported upon by an independent third party. And I can tell you from recent experience, its a time consuming and expensive process. Second, and even more important, is the fact that it's still very early in the integration process. As I mentioned, we've had less than two weeks to evaluate Cadbury's existing operating plans and financial statements and to begin verifying our initial assumptions regarding synergies.
We won't make you wait six months. We expect to issue 2010 earnings guidance and an outlook for 2011 when we announce our first quarter results in May. In the meantime, this is what I can offer to help you build your models. We delivered $2.03 per diluted share in 2009, in line with our recent guidance. We continue to target EPS growth for the Kraft Foods Base business at the high-end of our 7% to 9% long-term growth objective in the near term. We'll be consolidating Cadbury results from February 2 onwards. We're targeting about $0.05 cash accretion to our 2011 Base business from the Cadbury acquisition. That excludes one-time implementation costs of about $1.3 billion which will be incurred over the next three years. It also excludes expenses related to the transaction and incremental non-cash items such as the amortization of the intangibles related to the acquisition. The divestiture of our Pizza business is expected to lower earnings by about $0.05 per share on an annual basis. And that transaction is expected to close in mid-2010.
Overall the combination of Kraft Foods and Cadbury promises to deliver substantial value for our shareholders. This combination will increase our long-term growth targets, while still generating significant near-term benefits. It will accelerate our long-term growth targets to five-plus percent on the top line. And our long term EPS growth target to 9% to 11%. At the same time, we expect the transaction will be accretive to cash EPS and have a mid-teens internal rate of return. Together, these benefits result in a transformational combination that will create a top-tier performer in the global food industry. Thank you, and now we'd be happy to take your questions."

And then the overlay of synergy on top gives us some added opportunity. So I think net-net, we are not going back to 20. I've been quite clear about that.

We still have a ways to go in lowering our overall inventory levels and our working capital levels. We have engaged this year in our project saber, which is a sourcing initiative to generate a fair amount of reduced cost, but also to extend the terms and get all of our terms right and our payables.
