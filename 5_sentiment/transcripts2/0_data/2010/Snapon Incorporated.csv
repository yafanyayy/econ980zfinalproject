While 2009 is in the books, and we finished the year with another quarter of progress, the Tools Group and the Commercial Industrial Group both ended with sequential improvements. So while we were challenged through",1844,"Thanks, Leslie. Good morning everybody. While 2009 is in the books, and we finished the year with another quarter of progress, the Tools Group and the Commercial Industrial Group both ended with sequential improvements. So while we were challenged throughout the year, we were encouraged again by the fourth quarter results. We believe that it's fair to say that the Snap-on team extended its ongoing trend of operating improvement and of strategic progress. In the fourth quarter, our overall operating margin of 11.5% before Financial Services was our highest of the year. And it was more than 200 basis points, up from where we were at the end of the third quarter. And while the earnings are below the 2008 record-fourth quarter levels, we did finish 2009 with a relatively strong performance, and we're well positioned for the opportunities as they unfold going forward. Marty will take you through the financials in a minute. But first, I'll provide some perspective on the market environment, cover some of the operating highlights and discuss just how we're managing through the uncertain times. For the overall corporation, excluding currency, which now has turned positive for us, fourth quarter sales were down 11.1% from 2008. There was an overall 5% sequential increase from the third quarter. But that's about in line with normal seasonality. I think it's fair to say that on balance, we believe the markets have stabilized. But overall, they're not yet clearly rebounding. In that, however, there's some mild good news. We believe that distributor destocking is behind us, and we did see some modest strength with stronger-than-seasonally-normal sequential sales increases from our Industrial division. However, Europe, in general, continues to lag. Not showing any significant signs of recovery. And the distributors there appear to be reluctant to begin restocking.I believe you know by now that we closely monitor big-ticket sales, big-ticket items, diagnostic products and tool storage units sold through our van channel, and undercar equipment sold through the C&I Group. These are high-value products purchases that are either more discretionary or have a longer payback. And we believe they can be a reasonable barometer of the overall market environment. And by extension, they can be a gauge of the general confidence level for our various customers. Customers like garage owners, who are, in themselves, small businessmen trying to forecast the future before making investments in longer-term items. Here again, the signs for us are mixed. Equipment continued mildly favorable trends, but tools storage and diagnostics were down slightly, showing no recovery. So while, as I said, mild favorability, but no broad upswing.So in this uncertain environment, we'll continue to balance the need for operating improvement, balance that need with the investment in growth areas of strategic importance. We remained focused on the elements of our Snap-on value creation. Areas like Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI as we call it, innovation, customer connection, safety and quality. Those are the processes that have been sold transformative in helping us weather this difficult environment, and weather it with encouraging results.Speaking of results, our full year organic sales were down 14% in 2008. But we're reasonably encouraged that we're able to limit the impact of that downturn. On a sales decrease of about $390 million, the operating income change was contained to $118 million, and that included an additional $7 million of restructuring spend. We believe that's a strong testament to the improvements we've continued to make even in the turbulent times. Throughout the past year, we also continue to focus on those areas we believe will be strategically decisive for Snap-on for our operations going forward. Maintaining the health of our franchise network, expanding our presence in Vehicle Repair Infrastructure segments, rolling the Snap-on brand out of the garage in these other mission-critical arenas and strengthening our physical capability in emerging markets. During the quarter, and throughout the year, we continue to invest and advance, along each of those crucial dimensions. So now, let's move on to a discussion of the operating groups and of their progress in those strategic areas.The C&I Group posted its strongest quarter of the year with operating income of $21.7 million. As expected, we spent $5.7 million in the quarter on restructuring in that segment, primarily in Europe. SNA Europe, our European-based Tools business, that operation continues to experience some of the largest sales declines in the segment. And that reflects the market the operation serves, and its strong concentration in the south of Europe, which has been particularly hard-hit by the recession. I think Spain still have the 17% or 18% unemployment rate, so it's understandable. Appropriately therefore, that business incurred the majority of the restructuring expense in the quarter.For at SNA Europe, we're taking aggressive actions. We're acting to contain costs and to permanently reduce fixed expense, while not taking out capacity, because we believe the capacity will be needed when the markets recover. With the volume decline, inventory-reduction efforts and restructuring costs, SNA Europe accounted for a major slice of C&I's fourth quarter income decline from 2008. On the other hand, the results from the other C&I business in the fourth quarter were fairly positive, despite the market decline environment and a volume decline, despite that volume decline. Through RCI and reaping the benefits of past restructuring actions, the remaining C&I business have essentially offset the impact of the decline. An encouraging performance given the times, we believe. For example, the Industrial division. Now before the downturn, this is a business that was expanding nicely, and had achieved record sales in the fourth quarter of 2008. Sales were down in 2009 versus that record. There remains, however, continuing opportunity in Industrial that we believe will accelerate in a sustained recovery. Mission-critical industries like railroad, aerospace, educational institutions, the military, emerging industries like wind power; these customers value the Snap-on brand reputation for productivity, reliability and repeatability, and they're embracing Snap-on innovations.Our Industrial division registered significant wins in the past quarter in all of the industries I mentioned, and its sales showed double-digit sequential increase ahead of normal seasonality. We also saw some positive trends in Equipment division, especially in North America. A strong seasonal increase versus the third quarter.As I said in the past, when it comes to innovation in RCI, equipment is one of our great success stories. In the fourth quarter, sales of alignment equipment were a real bright spot for us. Our imaging alignment technology is second to none, and we believe that advantage is helping us gain share in the strategically-important garage infrastructure space. The Equipment business also made some fine improvements in the quarter in RCI. Process cost reduction, design cost improvements and purchasing savings; they all combined to make Equipment one of the big drivers of C&I profitability in the period. Moving on to the Tools Group, where the fourth quarter was also the strongest of 2009. Earnings increased both sequentially and from the prior year. In fact, the fourth quarter operating income margin of 13.2% is the second highest recorded for any quarter by the Tools Group in over five years, encouraging given the sales levels. Sales we're up about 2% from the third quarter. That's about in line with normal seasonality. And while we're not seeing recovery on big-ticket items, our hand tools continue to perform solidly.Of course, I think, I'm sure I've said this in the past, that hand tools are the products where users can see the most immediate productivity increase and the quickest payback. So it stands to reason that Snap-on would perform well in that product line, even in these times. Repair work, after all is reasonably strong. The mechanics have cash. They may not have great visibility to the days ahead, but they're willing to spend in making today's job easier and more productive. And they're doing just that with Snap-on hand tools.In the past, I mentioned the importance of supporting our franchisee network and ensuring it remains strong. This was a strategic focus for us as we entered the downturn, as we manage through it. And we've had success in that global, both in the fourth quarter and throughout 2009. A number of actions we call Snap-on's franchisee stimulus program seems to be working. Van count has held firm now for several quarters and our van turnover, our franchisee turnover, continues at historical all-time lows. I'll let Marty cover the finance company in detail. But I'll just say that the integration of Snap-on Credit is moving forward, on plan, without disruption to our customers and our franchisees. The credit company is a powerful asset to supporting our franchisees, and maintaining that advantage was a key win for us in 2009.Now a word about Diagnostics and Information or D&I. That group had another relatively solid quarter. Organic sales were down from 2008 by 16.6% or $25.7 million. And as in past quarters, the declines were focused primarily at Equipment Solutions or EQS and Snap-on Business Solutions, SBS. Those are the businesses most directly impacted by the turmoil in the OEM dealerships space in North America. Having said that though, RCI and other cost-reduction activities have limited the damage, and kept operating income levels strong at $30 million for the period, representing 23.2% of sales for the group.Beyond that, we're starting to see some glimmer of positive activity from the OEMs. They do seem to be moving forward with selected essential tool programs that have upside for EQS. And SBS, though challenged by dealership consolidation, is having some success in offsetting the declines with sales outside North America and in near-adjacent markets, places like commercial vehicles and construction equipment. And through our Hand-Held Diagnostics business, and Mitchell 1, Snap-on is expanding its presence in the Garage Infrastructure segment, providing integrated solutions, offering productivity enhancement to the growing Independent Shop segment throughout North America.I think it's important to remember again, that Snap-on is tied to auto repair rather than to the overall auto manufacturing industry. And we believe that the fundamental drivers of that repair segment remained positive. Miles driven are rising again, and household spending on automotive repair is increasing. The indicators remain favorable for the future for that sector. I'll wrap up with emerging markets. We've been committed to moving forward with our initiatives in the Asian and Eastern Europe. We've been committed throughout the year. We've added distribution capabilities and launched new products, specifically designed for those new markets from van source to power tools to undercar equipment. And in the third quarter, we opened a new tool storage manufacturing facility in China, and we launched our new plant in Belarus in the fourth quarter.With that Minsk plant, we not only added capabilities, but we also created advantage in our cost structure. So those ongoing investments, amidst this uncertain environment, we believe demonstrate our commitment to emerging markets. It also speaks to our balanced approach in managing through the turbulence; pursuing cost reduction, while investing for strategic advantage. Now I'll turn the call over to Marty to cover the financials in more detail. Marty?"
303646,84945159,50982,"Snap-on Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2010",2010-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Snap-on Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Nick. I will begin with our consolidated operating results, which are shown on Slide 6. Sales in the fourth quarter of $618 million increased 6.2% sequentially from the third quarter. Without currency, sales were up sequentially 5%. As compared to",2121,"Thanks, Nick. I will begin with our consolidated operating results, which are shown on Slide 6. Sales in the fourth quarter of $618 million increased 6.2% sequentially from the third quarter. Without currency, sales were up sequentially 5%. As compared to last year, reported sales in the quarter were down 7.4%. And absent foreign currency effects, organic sales declined 11.1% year-over-year. As Nick said, we were encouraged by the sequential sales increase in the quarter in light of the continued headwinds, particularly affecting certain markets in Europe.Consolidated gross profit margin of 46% in the quarter increased 110 basis points from last year. Because of lower production volumes, primarily in Europe, excess capacity costs continued to pose a challenge. However, we were more than able to offset those with material cost reductions, savings from our RCI initiatives, benefits of past restructurings and other cost reductions. The net effect was a 200 basis point gross margin improvement in the quarter. Gross margin was further aided by better sales mix, particularly in the Diagnostics and Information segment, which improved consolidated gross margin by another 110 basis points. On the downside, restructuring costs included in gross profit reduced the gross margin by 85 basis points, and currency, when measured on a year-over-year basis, reduced gross margin by another 90 basis points. LIFO gains in the quarter from our continued inventory-reduction efforts were offset by certain higher inventory provisions and the liquidation of slower-moving items. Operating expenses in the quarter of $213 million were up $1.8 million from prior year. We achieved $19.2 million from cost reduction and cost-containment actions. We also benefited from $4.7 million of lower restructuring cost that are recorded in operating expenses. These improvements allowed us to more than offset higher pension expense, higher mark-to-market incentive compensation expense, unfavorable currency of $7.4 million and certain other expense increases. Also last year's expenses did benefit by $5.4 million from a favorable pre-acquisition contingency adjustment at Snap-on Business Solutions.Total restructuring cost in both the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008 were $6.7 million, with the majority of this year's related to the Commercial and Industrial or C&I segment. For the full year, restructuring charges of $22 million were up $7.3 million from 2008. Of this $22 million, $18.2 million was in the C&I segment, primarily to improve the segment's cost structure in Europe. As communicated during the third quarter call, we expected that Financial Services would again incur an operating losses this quarter, following the July 16, termination of the joint venture with CIT. The  operating loss in the fourth quarter for Financial Services was $3.8 million, which was within the range previously communicated to you. We'll cover Financial Services in more detail later, included the dispute with CIT that was disclosed in today's press release. Again with this quarter's press release, we have included supplemental earnings and balance sheet schedules, which separate our Financial Services segment from the other operations of Snap-on. This will now be our standard practice. Interest expense in the quarter increased $6 million year-over-year as a result of higher debt levels. In 2009, we issued $550 million of fixed rate, long-term notes. The proceeds from these notes are being used for general corporate purposes and most importantly, for the funding of Snap-on Credit's on balance sheet portfolio. After year end, we did repay $150 million of floating rate notes that matured in January.Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 31.4% compares favorably to 32.6% in the fourth quarter of last year. And finally, net earnings of $36.6 million or $0.63 per diluted share increased 44.1% sequentially from the third quarter of 2009. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, net earnings declined $22 million or 37.5%. Of this decline, $13.5 million resulted from the after-tax impact of lower Financial Services earnings, as well as higher interest expense.With that, I will now turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7, segment sales of $302 million improved 13.9% sequentially from third quarter levels. Compared to last year, organic sales in the quarter declined 12.2%, primarily due to the continued economic downturn that is particularly affecting certain European markets, most notably Spain. On a year-over-year basis, equipment sales in North America were up mid-single digits, and sales in Asia were up mid-double digits.Gross margin in the C&I segment was 33.6%. Before $4.7 million of restructuring charges, gross margin was 35.2%, down 230 basis points on a comparable basis with last year. The effects of sales mix and excess capacity costs created by lower production volumes, including our inventory reduction efforts, were partially offset by material and other cost reductions, resulting in a net reduction in gross margin of 155 basis points. Since year-end 2008, inventories in the C&I segment, excluding currency, were reduced by $76 million.Operating expenses in the quarter declined $4.6 million from prior year. This improvement is principally due to savings from ongoing restructuring and other cost-reduction initiatives of $6.5 million, as well as lower sales volume-related expenses. Currency translation increased operating expenses by $4.2 million. Operating earnings for the quarter of $21.7 million include $5.7 million of restructuring charges. Before restructuring, the operating margin was 9.1% compared to 12.4% on a comparable basis in last year's fourth quarter, and improved from 5.3% on a comparable basis with the third quarter of 2009.Turning now to Slide 8. On a worldwide basis, organic sales in the Snap-on Tools Group declined 3.7% year-over-year. Van count in the U.S. at year end was comparable to both the third quarter 2009, as well as year-end 2008. In our international franchise operations, organic sales in the quarter were down 3.5%. Gross margin in the Snap-on Tools Group increased to 45.4% in the quarter compared to 41.6% last year. Without restructuring costs in both years, the gross margin improvement was about 340 basis points.Currency reduced gross margin by about 100 basis points. Material cost reductions and favorable factory utilization rates against last year, significantly improved gross margin by about 385 basis points. Fourth quarter inventory reductions result in a LIFO gains of about $6.7 million, but this was offset by increased inventory provisions and the liquidation of slower-moving items. Operating expenses in the quarter were down $4.4 million from 2008, not withstanding currency headwinds of $2.5 million.Expenses declined due to lower volume and from savings of $8.5 million, due to RCI initiatives, benefits from prior restructuring actions and other cost-containment initiatives. Also the restructuring cost recorded in operating expenses were lower by $2.9 million. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 13.2% in the quarter improved significantly from both 7.8% last year, and 11.9% in the third quarter. Before restructuring costs, operating earnings improved 39.2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year on a comparable basis.Turning to the Diagnostics and Information or D&I Group, which is shown on Slide 9, fourth quarter sales of $129 million declined 15.6%. Before currency, the decline was 16.6%. The segment sales decline was primarily due to lower sales to OEM dealerships. Gross profit margin of 53.2% in the quarter improved considerably over 46.7% a year ago, benefiting from an improved sales mix of higher margin, diagnostics and software products. RCI and other cost improvements more or less offset $2 million of higher amortized product development costs. Operating earnings of $30 million in the quarter for the D&I Group declined $4.3 million from prior year.Last year's operating income included a $5.4 million reduction of a pre-acquisition contingent liability associated with Snap-on Business Solutions. Cost savings from RCI and other cost-reduction initiatives more than offset the income decline from the lower sales.Now turning to Slide 10, the comparisons for Financial Services reflect the July 16, termination of the Snap-on Credit joint venture with CIT. Since that date, we no longer sell contracts of CIT and record gains on sale. Rather, we are building over time a non-balance sheet interest-yielding portfolio. The fourth quarter loss of $3.8 million was within the range we communicated last quarter. In the fourth quarter, Snap-on Credit was on book portfolio by $137 million.Moving to Slide 11. At 2009 year-end, our balance sheet includes gross Financial Services receivables of $398 million, including $267 million at Snap-on Credit. Of this amount, $227 million are extended credit loans to technicians. As you know, Snap-on Credit continues to manage the run-off portfolio of contracts owned by CIT, which totaled $590 million at year-end. We presently expect the portfolio on our books to grow by about $80 million in the first quarter, and by about $300 million for all of next year. The net cash requirements over international finance portfolios are substantially self-funding. Portfolio loss and delinquency trends continue to be in line with our expectations.Now turning to Slide 12. Consolidated operating cash flow was $96.7 million for the quarter and $347 million for the year, both substantially ahead of the year-ago amounts. As disclosed in our earnings release this morning, we filed a notice of arbitration on January 8 regarding a dispute with CIT relating to various underpayments made during the course of the joint venture. As a result of this dispute, we withheld $81.5 million against our claim, which seeks approximately $115 million. On January 29, CIT filed its response denying our claim and asserting certain claims against Snap-on for other matters relating to the joint venture. CIT's claim alleges damages in excess of $110 million, which does include the return of the $81.5 million retained by Snap-on as of year-end.This amount is included in other accrued liabilities on our year-end balance sheet. At this early stage, no determination can be made as a likely outcome of this dispute. With respect to this matter, cash provided by operating activities includes only $10 million in the fourth quarter, and only $20 million for the full year. Free cash flow from operations, exclusive of Financial Services, was $110 million for the quarter compared to only $14 million last year. For the year, free cash flow from operations, excluding Financial Services, was $290 million compared to $125 million last year. Free cash flow from financial services was, as expected, an outflow in the quarter of about $100 million and $191 million for the full year. In the quarter, capital spending of $16.1 million included investments and our plant in Minsk and continued expansion of our facilities in China. In the quarter, we also completed the headquarters and R&D facility for our automotive parts and service information business in Richfield, Ohio.As seen on Slide 13, trade and other receivables decreased $48 million from 2008 year-end, primarily due to lower sales. Days sales outstanding for trade and other receivables was 63 days at 2009 year-end, as compared to 58 days last year. However, adjusting for currency, last year's DSO would have been 62 days. Inventories at the end of the quarter were down $12 million from last quarter, and down $85 million for the year. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns were 4.1x, but on a trailing three-month basis improved to 4.8x.Net debt at the end of the quarter was $367 million. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 22.2% compares to 25.2% a year-end and 21.5% last quarter. If we exclude the $81.5 million of cash withheld for the CIT dispute, our year-end net debt-to-capital ratio would have been 25.8%.Cash at year-end was nearly $700 million. As I already mentioned, we repaid $150 million of long-term notes in January. In addition to our cash and cash flows from operations, we continued to maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility, which does not expire until August 2012. We also have another $20 million of committed bank lines. At year-end, the full $520 million of borrowing capacity was available. In addition to these facilities, our current A2P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper market should we choose to do so. At quarter-end, no commercial paper was outstanding. Our liquidity position and access to credit continues to remain strong.This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. Before turning the call back to Nick to provide his final thoughts, I'd like to mention some considerations for our 2010 outlook as covered in our press release. Next year, we expect to realize approximately $25 million of year-over-year savings from our 2009 restructuring activities. We also currently expect to incur approximately $18 million to $22 million of restructuring costs. We also expect next year to incur approximately $20 million of higher year-over-year pension expense.  Finally, capital expenditures in 2010 are anticipated to be in a range of $55 million to $60 million. And we anticipate an effective income tax rate next year of approximately 33.5%. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Nick. Nick?"

In terms of that business, that seems to be selling pretty fairly well around the world, in places like Mexico and even in Europe. So we have some reasonably good wins in that area. Actually, aerospace, we had some good wins in the past quarter with Gulfstream and some other people. We saw some wins in the government and education, while down quarter-to-quarter, because third quarter is always big one in education, it was still pretty strong. Suffice it to say that the industrial business, which is driven by those mission-critical industries these days, is up quarter-to-quarter sequentially. So we're pretty encouraged by that. I think what we've seen, Jim, is that the industrial business entered the recession late. It had a gangbuster's quarter last year in the fourth quarter. The first part of the first quarter of '09, it was still reasonably strong, and then it dropped off some and then recover. I'm mildly encouraged by what I saw in the results. I also met with several hundred of the salesmen. We had them in for their annual conference, and whether you talked about people from Louisiana in oil and gas, or people from Washington, balance of the government, or people from the West Coast in aerospace, they seem optimistic. So we're looking for some mild optimism in that area."

I guess it's not a big buy compared to some people but -- and it's a mixed view. Steel rod, for example, which is hand tools, went down then went up slightly in the summertime. Now, it seems to be going down again. Steel plate, the equipment, which equipment uses, that's been flat. And Tool Storage, which use cold-rolled, cold-rolled is creeping up. I don't worry about this too much as long as the gains aren't tremendously precipitous, because we've had a history in Snap-on because we're a premium product of being able to price. So generally, if material cost eke up, we can get it back in price. So I'm not too worried about that being an impact for us."

But looking out in the future, I am confident that of our strategic investments -- and we did say in prior calls, before the downturn hit, that we expect to grow at mid-single digits, 5% to 6%, organically. And I am pleased with the progress we made in the strategic areas, that is maintaining our network, penetrating critical industries, which I just talked about. We were gaining share in garage infrastructure in the emerging markets. So I think as the markets rebound, whenever that is, I think it's going to happen for us just like everybody else, I think we're going to see that mid-single digit sales growth. On the other hand, on the other side of this is, absent that growth, we still feel pretty good, as we did the prior quarter in prior calls, about our Snap-on value creation processes and their ability to wring improvement out of the same levels of volume.

Arithmetically of course, if destocking ends, and end markets stay at the same level, we will see an uptick. The caveat I would give you there is there can be some minor destocking at end customers where you're selling through a factory and they have a tool crib, and that factory's limit passed capacity for a long time and they come back, and so they have a little bit. That's a minor effect, but it is an effect. And then the other effect for us is the mix among markets. We look at this carefully. We're seeing some unfreezing in Europe, in the U.K., in Sweden, in Germany, but Spain is still very weak. So it's possible for those markets to be going in different directions in terms of demand, and I'm not sure where the balance will be. But arithmetically, you're correct. If distributors stop restocking, and all things remain equal and the markets remain equal, then we'll see an uptick."

We may be $1 million or so under that number, but the trajectory from there that I've talked about in terms of essentially taking the growth in the portfolio and looking at the interest yield on that, given, more or less most other expenses being fixed, should give you the sort of trajectory. So if you think about Q3 to Q4, and I'll remind everybody that the earnings we had in Q3 included some gains in the first part of July up until the termination, if you strip those gains out, you saw more or less about a $5 million improvement sequentially. And if you sort of do the math on the portfolio growth at roughly 15% or 16% yield, you pretty much get there. But you have to remember, too, going forward, Gary, that sort of $4 million to $5 million can't -- it's not linear, sort of, indefinitely, there's going to be, at some point here, an increase and a little bit of a decreasing rate. There are some longer-term contracts beyond the term of the extended credit contracts that will take a longer time to roll from their portfolio, our portfolio. But at least for the next few quarters, I would tell you maybe we'll be off $1 million or so in Q1 from breakeven.

We continue to make operational gains and to strengthen our strategic position. Both have helped us to deliver the results that are improving and I say are reasonable given the extended economic challenges.
Our first quarter operating margin before financial services was 11.6%, 210 basis points higher than the first quarter of last year. In fact, I think it's noteworthy that this 11.6% exceeds the first quarter record of 11.1% registered in 2008 and that was before the economic crisis. And the profits in that period were achieved at significantly higher sales levels.
This shows our commitment to the Snap-on value creations processes is driving strong improvement. The financial results are testimony to power that effort. With our focus on Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, rapid continuous improvement or RCI as you call it, we’re becoming a stronger company and one that's well positioned to take advantage of any recovery. And we are seeing some positive signs, some good signs in certain market. Those opportunities added momentum to the operating progress we've been achieving over the past several quarters.
Aldo will take you through the financial but first, I’ll provide you with a perspective on the results, my own perspective. Regarding growth, our overall sales were up 8.6% from last year, over 4% organically excluding currency. As in the recent past, our results are mixed by geographies and by market segment. So I would say the quarter provides evidence that overall market have stabilized and are showing some signs of upward potential but because of the varying nature of the results, they’re not yet clearly rebounding.
In the past, I’ve mentioned the trends in big ticket items, products with relatively higher sales value, tool storage unit, diagnostic products as well as under car equipment, items which have longer paybacks. We believe sales in that arena are barometer of both our customer’s financial outlook and if they’re confident in their future.
Ending last year, the signs here were mixed. While in the first quarter, sales were mildly positive in all three of those big ticket categories. So we have some good news but its one quarter. Going forward, we are going to, we’re striving to create a reliable positive trend in those product line. It's important to us.
We’re also all aware that Europe was particularly hard hit last year at the downturn. And here again, we saw positive signs, following on with the big ticket discussion, our sales of under-car equipment in Europe posted gain encouraging given the overall struggle of Europe and give the capital nature of those purchases. We also saw increase however in our European based hand-tool business, both sequentially and year-over-year.
Encouraging here too was the fact that we saw some mild momentum in each month throughout the quarter. However, the mix nature of the results are also evidence in Europe. While we are encouraged by the overall gains South of Europe or existing Europe has a particularly strong position and Spain especially continuous to lag. Unemployment in that country is still very high and the drag is evident in a day-to-day commerce. 
Another market segment that provides some gauge to the economy and one that get a real lot of national attention is the automotive OEMs and their dealers. To put this market in perspective for Snap-on, we have limited direct exposure. Our Equipment Solution Division or EQS and Snap-on business solutions SBS are where we do sell primarily OEM dealerships. 
Those businesses combined make up only about 11% of our total sales. That being said, this is an area that has obviously suffered during the current downturn. But on the positive side, we are seeing some forward momentum with some new essential EQS tool program and we expect ongoing upside in that regard. SBS however continues to be impacted by the dealer consolidation.
Now, both SBS and EQS have in fact achieved some progress by capturing adjacent business, serving commercial construction and agriculture market as well as supplying products to truck fleet, all which represents expended opportunity. So there are off sets to the challenge the OEM dealer shrink and as further opportunity in those adjacent spaces. 
To summarize our view on the sales and market environment, I would say we’re encouraged but cautiously. Signs are still a bit mixed. The market seemed to have stabilized but are not yet strongly rebounding, gains are being made but those increases are coming a lot comparison that were weakened by the overall downturn in 2009.
Now such on the first quarter highlight and each of our reporting segment. In the Commercial and Industrial Group, our C&I organic sales were up over 9% from last year. We saw across the board increases in nearly all the businesses. The biggest contributors here were the equipment division including Europe as I previously mentioned and in Asia Pacific where our expended product lines are starting to take hold. 
From a profit increase perspective, C&I was a big contributor with operating earning of over $30 million, up $13 million from last year, the OI margin of 10.2 puts reasonably rapid recovery, reflecting the hires, I think we believe, a reasonable recovery. And that reflected the higher sales as well as the benefits from RCI and past restructuring actions. 
Aside from the financial performance in the group, progress continues to be made in areas of strategic importance. The equipment division registered wins and agreements with more vehicle OEM’s as preferred suppliers. This further Snap-on presence in the garage and gives us a heightened advantage with access to quite a few additional locations. Our C&I presence in critical industries is also expanding. We introduced over 300 SKUs for a large applications and natural resource and power generation and there’s more in the pipeline. We’re working with customers in aerospace and government, launching special tools and kits that incorporate rigorous and innovative safety features specially designed for those mission critical applications. 
And again in C&I, as I said earlier, we had good gains in emerging markets. It really is where the outside portions of automotive growth will take place and we continue to advance building the necessary physical and creating a broad Asian product line. Just this past month we introduced a new handheld diagnostic product in China, our first such offering for the region and our new Asian band saw our product line continue on a strong upward sales trajectory. 
Moving to the tools group, overall sales were up 4.3% organically, 4.4% in United States. I mentioned the positive results for big ticket items, tool storage and high value diagnostics and we are working to make those gains a trend. The sales increase for the group vigilance and operating efficiency and favorable currency result in a $7.5 million increase in OI and an OI margin of 10.7%, up 220 basis points versus last year. Now, I’ve spoken often in the past regarding the importance of keeping our franchise system healthy. We continue working hard toward that end and it seems to be succeeding. The network’s stable, there’s evidence and there’s evidence of improving franchisee health.
Terminations are at a lower level and van sales are moving in the right direction. Now, major element of support for the franchisee is the credit company. Aldo will speak about Snap-on Credit but I’ll just mention that its transition to a wholly on subsidiary continues as planned and without interruptions to our customers. The credit business provides us with the strategic advantage. I’m pleased the integration is going well.
Now to the Diagnostics & Information Group or the D&I Group. I’ve also, I’ve already mentioned some of the challenges faced by EQS and SBS with the ties to OEM dealership. In spite of those impact however, D&I sales of a $135 million were up from last year, up slightly from last year. That’s because gains were recorded in the independent shop segment with diagnostic hardware and software and our mature one information products, all showing strength throughout the period.
D&I earnings of about $31 million were up $5.6 million. And that reflects the higher sales both in handheld units and information products as well as some solid gains and efficiencies due to Snap-on value creation. Related to the D&I market expansion or adding fleet customers in the U.S. for a heavy duty Diagnostic’s products. If a target rich environment, our existing capabilities extend nicely into that area and I believe we’re using that to our advantage.
We’re also leveraging D&I products and capabilities internationally. When you get outside in the United States, the dealership space hasn’t experienced quite so much disruption. In the first quarter, we again saw a success in capturing new international customers for the SBS Electronics Parts catalog line and we expect that trend to continue.
Well that’s the segment round up. Regarding Snap-on’s overall strategic position we’ve characterized our current challenge, our challenge in the downturn as balancing cost reduction efforts limiting the impact of the downturn with the need to invest in those strategic areas which we believe will be decisive for supporting growth going forward. 
Now I believe there is abundant evidence in our results that the impact has been limited and breakeven levels have been reduced. It’s also clear to me; we’re better positioned in each of our core strategic areas of strategic importance. The franchise network remains strong, terminations are at the lower levels and sales are moving favorably, regarding the primary customer basin area, the automotive technicians our position remains preeminent with Snap-on still the preferred brand across the board by a wide margin.
We also target expanded penetration of automotive repair garage infrastructure as a strategic initiative and we’ve made progress with the shop owners and the managers, the principle customers in that segment. Our repair system is from electronic parts catalogs to imaging aligners have increased their customer base both in the U.S. and internationally. And indication of that progress was a strong growth achieved by the equipment division in the first quarter. We’ve also spoken often about the extraordinary opportunity for Snap-on to extend our position in mission critical industries, aerospace, power generation, natural resources to name a few. And in the quarter the industrial vision where we pursue those critical customers showed year-over-year growth against some reasonably tough comparison. They entered the recession late. Finally we continue to build our position in emerging market, growing distribution and expanding our local product line and we are seeing continued gain.
Our sales in Asia-Pacific were up substantially in the quarter well ahead of any economic growth in the region. So we are encouraged by the first quarter. We've limited the impact of the downturn, improved our profitability and positioned our operations strategically for growth.
Since this is Aldo's first call with us, I will provide you with the brief introduction. Aldo brings over 30 years of experience in finance and operations, corporate strategy and business development to his new role as Snap-on CFO.

Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Sales in the first quarter of $621 million increased 8.6% from first quarter 2009 levels. Without currency organic sales were up 4.1%. As N",1859,"Thanks Nick and good morning to everyone on the call. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Sales in the first quarter of $621 million increased 8.6% from first quarter 2009 levels. Without currency organic sales were up 4.1%. As Nick mentioned we are encouraged by these results and by some of the business trends experienced in the quarter.
Consolidated gross profit margin of 46.3% in the quarter increased 110 basis points from last year. Savings from previous restructuring initiatives and other cost containment actions contributed about $7 million or 115 basis points in gross margin improvement. Gross margin was further aided by better sales mix particularly diagnostic and information segments which improved consolidated gross margin by another 50 basis points.
Restructuring cost reduced 2010 gross margin by 40 basis points. Operating expenses of $216 million in the quarter while up $11.5 million from the prior year were favorable as a percent of sales by 100 basis points. Unfavorable currency translation as a result of the weaker dollar contributed about $7 million of the increase. In addition higher pension expense due to lower the projected asset returns in previous years related to the U.S. pension plan accounted for $5 million of the increase.
First quarter 2010 results were also impacted by higher volume related expenses as well as by $3.5 million of higher mark-to-market incentive in other compensation. These year-over-year increases and operating expenses were partially offset by about $6 million in benefits from ongoing RCI restructuring and other cost reduction and cost containment actions. Restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2010 totaled $3.2 million as compared to $2 million last year. The significant portion of this quarter’s restructuring costs again occurred in the commercial and industrial or C&I segment.
Financial services incurred a $1.7 million operating loss in the quarter as previously disclosed Snap-on ended the joint venture with CIT in July 2009. The $1.7 million loss compares favorably with a $3.8 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the $5.3 million loss recorded in third quarter 2009. Consistent with our issuance of $550 million of fixed rate long term notes in 2009, interest expense increased $5.4 million year-over-year.
The proceeds from these notes are being used for general corporate purposes including the January 12 repayments of $150 million of floating rate debt the part of maturity as well as funding the growth to the Snap-on credit on balance sheet portfolio. Effective income tax rate in both the first quarter of 2009 and 2010 was 34.5%. As Nick mentioned, operating earnings was $71.7 million before financial services, improved 32% over prior year on an 8.6% sales increase.
Finally, net earnings of $36.8 million or $0.63 per diluted share increased from $34.8 million or $0.60 per share last year, despite the $8.6 million or $0.15 per share of lower year-over-year net earnings associated with financial services.
With that I will now turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on slide 7, segment sales of $297 million improved 14.5% from prior year levels. Excluding $12 million of favorable currency translation, organic sales increased nearly $26 million or 9.4%. This year-over-year in increase was driven by a mid-teens increase in sales of equipment worldwide; particularly higher sales of alignment machines in the Americas and Europe.
Sales increases were also realized in our European-based tools business. We still faced headwinds in this region but these higher first quarter sales may be evident of some early stabilization of the European markets. The year-over-year sales increase in the C&I also reflects, continued higher sales in emerging growth markets and increased sales of tools, kits and tool storage products to industrial customers.
Gross profit in this C&I segment of $105 million increased to $13 million from $92 million last year. This increase reflects contributions from higher sales, $4.3 million of savings from restructuring and other cost reduction and cost containment actions and $2.3 million of favorable currency advice. Operating expenses in the quarter of $74 million were essentially flat year-over-year; savings from restructuring and other cost reduction and cost containment initiatives of 3.2 million as well as some lower bad debt expense were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of $3.5 million along with higher sales of volume related expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the C&I segment improved 350 basis points year-over-year from 6.7% to 10.2%.
Now turning to slide 8, on a worldwide basis, year-over-year sales in the Snap-on tools group increased 8.9% or 4.3% excluding currency. Land count in the U.S. at the end of the first quarter was stable compared to first quarter of 2009 and year-end 2009 levels. Sales in the U.S. were up 4.4% from the prior year. Gross profit in the Snap-on tools group $113 million increased $10.7 million over prior year representing a 60 basis point improvement in gross margin. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects contributions from higher sales and favorable currency effects, partially offset by inventory related another expenses. Operating expenses of $85 million in the quarter increased $3.2 million from prior year levels, primarily due to unfavorable currency translation and higher volume related expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 10.7% in the quarter for the Snap-on tools group improved 220 basis points from 8.5% last year.
Turning to the Diagnostics and Information or D&I group on slide 9, first quarter 2010 sales of $135 million were up 2% from prior year levels, mostly due to currency. Excluding currency organic sales were essentially flat with prior year levels, as higher sales of diagnostics and information products, and increased facilitation program sales were partially offset by anticipated lower electronic parts catalog sales, the OEM dealerships which are continued to be impacted by the challenges in the automotive industry.
Gross profit margin of 51.4% in the quarter for D&I Group improved 320 basis points over 48.2% a year ago benefiting from an improved sales mix of higher margin diagnostics and software products. Savings from prior restructuring actions and $1.2 million of favorable currency effects also contributed to the $5.5 million year-over-year increase in gross profit. Operating expenses for the group were relatively flat with 2009 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of D&I Group improved 380 basis points from 19% last year to 22.8% this year. Contributions from the improved sales mix and $3 million of savings from RCI, restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by $1.3 million of higher restructuring cost.
Turning now to slide 10, the year-over-year comparisons for financial services reflect the termination in 2009 of the Snap-on credit joint venture with CIT. As you know since July 16 of last year, we are no longer selling loan contracts to CIT in reporting the gain on sales. Rather we are building overtime and on balance sheet interest yielding portfolio. As the on-balance sheet portfolio grows, so will our financial services earnings.
The first quarter loss of $1.7 million for financial services was improved from the $3.8 million loss reported in the fourth quarter of 2009. Moving to slide 11, as in the first quarter end, our balance sheet includes $365 million in gross financing receivables from our Snap-on U.S. credit operations and $129 million in gross financing receivables from our international finance subsidiaries, for a total financing receivables portfolio of $494 million. Within the U.S. Snap-on credit portfolio, $313 million relates to extended credit loans to technicians. As you know, Snap-on credit continues to manage the run off portfolio of contracts owned by CIT which totals $483 million at first quarter end. Snap-on credit’s on book portfolio grew by about $98 million in the first quarter of 2010. 
For the full year 2010, we presently expect that the on book portfolio will grow by and therefore require net cash of approximately $300 million. The net cash requirements of our international finance portfolios are substantially self funding. Portfolio loss and delinquency trends continue to be in line with our expectations. Turning to slide 12, consolidated operating cash flow for the quarter was $10.4 million. At the end of the quarter, our cash position of $472 million was down from approximately $700 million at 2009 year end. This decrease primarily reflects the $150 million debt repayment in January and the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on credit. 
In the quarter, capital spending of $5.7 million was down from $14.1 million spent last year. The higher level of capital expenditures in 2009 including spending to support the accelerated expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in Minsk, Belarus and the further expansion of our plant in Foshan, China. Capital spending last year also included the construction of the new R&D facility and headquarters for our automotive parts and service information business in Richfield, Ohio. As seen on slide 13, trade and other receivables increased to $8.4 million from 2009 year end, primarily due to higher sales. Day sales outstanding for trade and other receivables of 63 days was flat with 2009 year end.
Inventories at the end of the quarter increased $16.3 million from 2009 year end, primarily due to seasonal inventory build and increasing production levels. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns were 4.2 times, slightly up from year end. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $444 million. Our net debt to capital ratio of 25.9% compares to 22.2% in 2009 year end. If we exclude approximately $108 million of cash, currently withheld related to the dispute with CIT, our net debt to capital ratio as of the end of the first quarter would have been 30.3%.
In addition to our quarter-end cash of $472 million, we continue to maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility which does not expire until August 2012. We also have another $20 million of committed bank lines. At quarter-end, the full $520 million of borrowing capacity was available. In addition to these facilities, our current A2/P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper market should we choose to do so. At quarter-end, no commercial paper was outstanding. Our liquidity position and access to credit continues to remain strong.
This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. Before turning the call back to Nick, I’d like to review our outlook for the balance of 2010. For the full year, we continue to expect to incur restructuring cost of approximately $18 million to $22 million. At the same time, we believe we will continue to realize further benefits in 2010 from our RCI sourcing annual cost reduction initiatives. We also anticipate continuing with our planned strategic investment including expansion in emerging markets.
We continue to anticipate capital expenditures in 2010 that will be in the range of $55 to 60 million. We also will continue to incur $5 million per quarter of expected higher year-over-year pension expense. For full year 2010, we now anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 34.5% which is slightly higher than the 33.5% estimate communicated at year end, primarily due to a higher mix of U.S. earnings.
Before opening the call for questions, Nick would like to provide some final thoughts. Nick?

I think people are snake bitten over the past recession. So we are not seeing any evidence in the United States where we sell through another level whether you are talking about our dealers, our franchisees or you are talking about distributors outside the United States. We are not seeing evidence of restocking. So none of that we believe is in our number. A quite a few of our businesses, for example, the industrial business is direct. So restocking would be a factor in that situation. The big question for us has always been Europe about re-stocking and de-stocking and we certainly haven’t seen any restocking in Europe. The de-stocking seems to have ended in certain parts particularly in terms of the North. The South continues to be sliding. Spain, the markets in Spain and if you look at the GDP in Spain it's still going South. 
So what we see is no restocking, an ending of de-stocking in the North of Europe, some minor I guess continuing weakness in the South. We just haven’t seen the markets snapped back to the point that we expect people to restock. I’m not sure when that will happen Jim. When we talk to distributors or I talk to franchisees, they all have their, to use an American expression, their Missouri head on, they’re in show me territory. So they’re going to have to see quite a bit of time go by before they’re going to enter restocking.

Terminations are at an all-time low but you could say we’re not capturing any. We’re not increasing on that because we’re not gaining even though the termination is at an all-time low. I would add quickly though we’re being very selective of our people at the van because we had difficult experiences when we put people in vans that might have been not appropriate or not as I guess born to do that kind of business, and so we had some difficulty when they ended up having, not being successful. So we’ve been stable there. Our plans are still to expand that business and we are still continuing to working to refine our recruiting models to make sure we can move forward and build that van count.
In terms of mix, our hand tools were up slightly in the quarter. Remember that hand tools never really went down very much. It was all tool storage and big ticket items. So, the mix of tool storage and diagnostic, you can pretty much say that the increases for year-over-year are rooted in tool storage and high value diagnostic units. Power tools was down slightly but that has to do more or less with the timing of model introductions.

So we knew we had top comparisons if you are going to go sequentially. We had our volume rise up. So we got some pop out of volume and a little bit of absorption. Much of that business was as I said before big ticket items which tend to be ironically a little lower in absorptions because there are components purchased more than a hand tool. A hand tool tends to be a big labor, big machine, high fixed cost equipment. 
Diagnostic tend to be component purchased and assembled. So we could get a volume push but the absorption might not be as much as you might expect if you are modeling this. We had favorable LIFO in the fourth quarter which I think we called out in our release which basically accrues to the tools group. In first quarter in a tools group, you do have a launch; we have kick off around the country. So there is a little more expense there and I think I would say that if we wanted to get jump started into the year with those big ticket items because we thought that would lead the way. So we promoted them relatively aggressively. So when you put all that together that ended up blunting some of the drop through you might expect off the volume increase.

But you don't get that kind of popping, I think we went from 6.7% OI margin to 10.2%. I think the numbers are something like that. You don't get that just from volume. So there was good drop through because we had some nice sales and alignment and so which are high profitability product, high margin product but we also had some great RCI benefits. So I’d say both were big factors.

Looking out for the future, I think I stand on what I said in my remarks. We think the markets are leaning positively but it was one quarter and in those numbers are some expansion to new adjacent segments like capturing customers in Europe for the EPC and reaching out to new OEMs and equipment sold. There is probably some market shares in our gain, in our growth number and that 4% growth number as well. So I’ve learned in the recession not to make any future calls. All I can say is the market seems to be leaning positively but I am still from Missouri that is show me. I’m looking forward for any kind of recovery.

I think it's fair to say that the second quarter results provide some significant evidence that our strategies are working.

I think it's fair to say that the second quarter results provide some significant evidence that our strategies are working. We continue to make tangible gains in markets that are mixed, still tough, but improving.
In this environment we remain committed to the Snap-on value creation process. They form a powerful framework for both capturing those opportunities and for achieving cost and flexibility improvement and we continued to make progress in the four and key strategic initiatives that we believe would be decisive for us going forward; enhancing the franchise network, expanding our presence in vehicle repair facilities, extending out of the garage and into critical industries, and building and emerging markets.
In each of those areas we are encouraged by the progress that's evident in our second quarter. The organic sales in the quarter were up nearly 10%, about $57 million from last year and operating earnings before financial services were up more than $25 million or 47% over last year's level. The resulting operating margin was 12.2%, that's up 310 basis points from 2009.
Encouraging progress was the Snap-on value creation processes, processes like safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement have driven to reality. As usual, Aldo will take you through the financials in detail but first I will give you our perspective on the markets and cover some of the operating highlights.
Last quarter, I characterized the markets as, I think I said stabilized, favorably inclined but not rebounding. Since then, we haven't seen any exceptional economic acceleration. However, I will say that overall nothing has led us to be less positive.
So certainly, we now have one more quarter of stability and we actually see some pockets are further strengthening. So we are a bit more encouraged, but we remain cautious. It's clear that the recovery is fragile.
Let me provide you a little bit more color on the sales front. In addition to the 9.6% of year-over-year organic sales increase, volume was also up about 6% sequentially from the first quarter. For us overall, there is not much seasonality except in the third quarter when summer vacations and shutdowns primarily in Europe can make volume hard to predict.
So the 6% sequential increase in the second quarter was fairly strong compared to what normally is relatively flat for a second quarter progression. In fact, it was the strongest second quarter uptick we've seen in at least seven years. This strength was reasonably widespread with all the operating group, Commercial and Industrial tools and RS&I were up all stronger than the normal increase.
In addition to those overall volumes, we've also been watching the trends and what we've been calling big ticket items, large dollar products like diagnostics and under-car equipment that have longer payback, and tool storage units, which are more discretionary purchases.
Given the capital nature, we believe activities in those products are a window on our customer's financial position and the overall confidence and we are encouraged by what we saw.
Under-car equipment sales showed favorable trends in the quarter and that was true in both North America and Europe. Diagnostics and Tool storage units, which are generally sold through the van channel also showed positive sign. So, now we recorded two quarters of big ticket progress and that is a fairly strong positive because we seen quite a bit variation in these products during the downturn over the last 18 months.
If we dissect the sales by geography, we see an uneven landscape. In Europe sales are up from last year about in line with what see for the overall company increase. Remember however, though that Europe was hard hit, very hard hit last year. So I think we need to see a bit stronger gain in order to start feeling clearly positive about that situation.
Within Europe the regional variances of the last quarter continued modest recovery in the north and central areas, weakness in the south. Spain in particular where we have fairly large position is not recovering. I think everybody is aware that Spain been among the hardest hit in the downturn, and we seen this reflected in our Spanish business. A couple of bright spots though, I'll say even better elsewhere have been under-car in Europe, under-car equipment in Europe and a even bit more rapid recovery in the East and places like Russia and Turkey, all of those were up strongly.
Also in U.K., we are seeing some strength, especially in the Tools group where actually we are coming of a fairly solid 2009. That is the comparisons aren't that easy. So the gains in the U.K. are significant, a real positive. So, I'd say then that Europe is mixed. We are seeing some positive signs, but we are still some distance from a clear trend.
Asia, no surprise it's outpacing the rest of the world. We are seeing solid increases there, both in emerging markets like India and even in the more established markets like Korea, building our presence in the region with both physicals and product is paying off.
So, with another quarter of favorability behind us we are optimistic. However, we also still believe the recovery is gradual. It seems everyday we see and we hear mixed signals and for us, for our customers it does impact their confidence. I said frequently last year that people were eating bad news for breakfast, everybody from the paper and from the TV and I think we still have a bit of the same thing going on now only with mixed signals.
So, the uncertainty remains but we would say we are moving in a positive direction. So, we will stay focused on the approach that's been successful for us; vigilance on cost, flexibility and reaching for opportunities, Snap-on value creation driving improvement, and investment in the size of initiatives for growth.
Now for some highlights on each of the operating groups, Commercial and Industrial or C&I. Sales were up 22% from last year with double digit increases in all of the units. The operating margin was 9.9% also up substantially. Volume and ongoing operational improvement did the trick in that area.
The industrial division especially in the US showed the strongest gain, making advances in critical industries, taking the Snap-on brand out of the garage like we said before. For example, our position in the Aerospace segment, it continues to strengthen. We are partnering with OEM aircraft manufacturers as well as Tech schools to develop and support Snap-on specific aviation certification programs. It's a great way to establish an early relationship with students who are future technicians. For us, it's an effective path in creating a lifelong professional customer and we continue to move forward with that type of partnership approach in a number of industries like wind, oil and gas, and in fact auto repair.
Let's go back to the Aerospace segment. This is an area where Snap-on is uniquely positioned. The mission critical nature of the work is obvious. The quality of the Snap-on brand is required and valued and the potential for growth is abundant for us.
While the industry has been depressed, there are some signs of recovery. At the Farmborough International Air Show, there has been a lot of confidence in aircraft orders were surprisingly strong. Snap-on's at that show displaying a revolutionary tool control innovations and they've been a big hit. So we like our position as the aerospace sector recovers.
We are also reaching new critical industries and tailoring our lineup to support that effort. I spoke to you last quarter of the broadened product line we've been introducing for large tool application in areas and segments like mining and natural resources. In the second quarter, we saw more progress with those customers due to that expanded offering and a significant industrial sales growth is evidence of that success.
We talk about innovation often at Snap-on. Our leadership in innovation and design, our focus on safety is also evident with the BAHCO brand. Last year, the BAHCO Handsaw System won the prestigious Red Dot award for European design excellence and this year the recognition continued with the product being named the winner of the Design IF award for ergonomics.
That system provides ergonomically superior handles, in different sizes for left and handed users with 10 different interchangeable blades for cutting a variety of materials and it offers a patented locking system. Innovation driven by customer connection is helping SNA Europe sell even in the downturn, helping BAHCO maintain a world class brand.
Asia-Pacific, as I said is continuing its upward trend. Sales were again up strongly with gains in India, China, Philippines and Korea leading the way. We've been working hard over several years in that region to establish our physical capability, more salesmen, more factory capability and capacity, more Asianized product and its being paying off. You can see it in our numbers. You can see it in the success of our new products.
A great example is the new BAHCO Asianized bandsaw, a runaway seller. So much so, that we outstripped our recently established capacity and we are acting right now to double down on Kenosha's saw capacity. So Asia is a success.
Moving to the Tools group, volumes increased to 7.8% in the quarter, about $19 million from last year. With the US posting a 9% gain, operating income was up $7.5 million to $33 million or 12.5% of sales. For sometime, one of our key initiatives has been to strengthen the franchisee network. I think we have clear evidence that those efforts continue to pay off.
In the second quarter, our sales in the US returned to 2008 pre-recession level. Now I think it's widely agreed that the overall economy hasn't returned to same levels two years ago. So reaching that benchmark is encouraging for us.
I spoken in the past about our franchisee stimulus program, aimed at supporting the network. It's been a key to our sales return and we believe that right now our franchisees are in better shape, sales strong, profits robust, cash improved. So the stimulus is working and the network is stronger.
I already mentioned big ticket items and the favorable results. Those are the products that are often require finance and in that space Snap-on credit is a huge advantage. It's core contributor to the power of our franchise network. The credit company's transition into a wholly owned subsidiary of Snap-on started about a year ago and it's progressing well.
In the second quarter it's now turned profitable as we said it would in several prior calls. At the end of the day though, in our business, you have to have great products to sell and we use our frequent touches with the end customer to create just that.
Innovation and new products are born out of technology advantages, or often born out of technology advances, but some times it's less complicated. It comes from just knowing your customers' problems.
For example, in using the 3600 franchisees and talking and visiting with customers, with automotive technicians, we found that all-in-one wire stripper, crimper and cutter pliers were designed primarily for electricians. They tend to spend more time stripping wires and you can imagine, they don't have the same space challenges as an autotech. So with that insight our engineers went to work and developed a new compact cutter and stripper tool, designed specifically for tight auto applications,
It has been huge hit, not a big ticket breakthrough product that transforms a company but thousands were sold and it's great example of using customer connection to our advantage, extending Snap-on's traditional innovation. That tradition echoes favorably up and down the product line and in and out of garages all over this country and all over the world.
Now, to Repair Systems and Information or the RS&I group. This was the group that was formed out of our recent reorganization, lining each new segment up with a primary customer base. The Tools group focused on auto technicians. C&I focused on professionals in critical industries and emerging markets, and RS&I, serving vehicle repair shop owners and managers. We've now organized a capture growth in each of these broad and important customer segments.
Back to RS&I. Overall volumes increased 4.7% driven by the equipment division activity, driven by the equipment division's increases that I'd mentioned before. It also had some solid improvements at EQS, our facilitation and essential tools business. Those gains in those areas helped to offset Snap-on business solutions or SBS where activity continues to be down, related to consolidation in the overall OEM dealer space.
Now, SBS is working to help itself. It's working to create some offsets of it's own by expanding with existing customers including internationally and with [batches] that haven't been impacted by the dealership disruption. They are also working hard to grow near adjacent market such as power sports, agricultural and construction.
Speaking of OEMs and the dealers, we are seeing some improvement in that area and the OEM manufacturers' willingness to commit to essential tools and the dealers themselves are starting to make purchases. So all of this certainly drove some of RS&I's improvement and the RS&I group is growing elsewhere.
We saw some solid sales increases related to our expansion in the heavy truck and fleet market. To think about it, that's a natural fit for us and we've been making investments in product both diagnostics and repair information and we are starting to get traction.
So that summarizes the market and I think it provides you some perspective on our advances in the quarter. So now I'll turn from an operating perspective. So now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a review of the financial results in detail. Aldo?

Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Sales in the second quarter of $648 million increased 9.8% from second quarter 2009 levels. The primary drivers behind are the $8 million year-over-year sales increase, include tir",2178,"Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Sales in the second quarter of $648 million increased 9.8% from second quarter 2009 levels. The primary drivers behind are the $8 million year-over-year sales increase, include tire sales in critical industries, increased sales in emerging markets, higher equipment sales and increased sales by franchisees in the US and U.K.
The company also saw many improvement in its European based businesses. Consolidated gross profit of $303.8 million in the quarter increased $49.8 million year-over-year, while the gross margin improved by 380 basis points.
These increases were largely due to the higher sales volumes and favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of the increasing levels of production. Savings from rapid continuous, RCI initiatives and benefits from previous restructuring actions contributed about $7 million of gross profit improvement.
Foreign currency primarily transaction FX, contributed $5 million and lower year-over-year restructuring cost contributed an additional $3 million of gross profit improvement. As a result of these factors consolidated gross margin improved to 46.9% in the quarter as compared to 43.1% last year.
Operating expenses in the quarter increased to $25 million from 2009 level. This was primarily due to higher volume related expenses and $14.9 million of increased performance based incentive compensation expense as a result of improved year-over-year operating performance and increased participation in the company's stock purchase programs.
In addition, we incurred $3.1 million of higher pension expense, largely due to lower than projected asset return in previous years, related to the US Pension Plan. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by $2.5 million of benefits from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction initiatives and $2.5 million of lower restructuring cost.
As a percent of sales, operating expenses were 34.7% in the second quarter of 2010 as compared to 34% last year. Restructuring cost in the second quarter totaled $3.1 million as compared to $8.6 million last year.
Operating earnings of $79 million before financial services improved 47% over prior year and 9.8% sales increase. Financial services' operating earnings of $1.7 million in the quarter improved sequentially from a $1.7 million loss of the first quarter of 2010 and also compares favorably with a $3.8 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $5.3 million loss in the third quarter of 2009.
As previously discussed and as expected operating income from financial services, which is before interest expense is consistently improving as the on-book finance portfolio grows. Since the termination of the financial services joint venture with CIT in July of last year, our gross on-book finance portfolio has grown over $450 million to $577 million. Year-to-date this portfolio has grown about a $180 million.
Turning to interest expense, higher average debt levels primarily related to the growth in our on-book finance portfolio, increased interest expense by $1.6 million year-over-year.
The second quarter effective income tax rates for 31.2% in 2010 and 31.9% in 2009. The improved and lower than previously communicated effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2010 primarily benefitted from the favorable settlement of a tax audit. The second quarter 2009 rates benefitted primarily from the realization of a tax benefit in a foreign jurisdiction.
Finally, net earnings of $45.3 million or $0.78 per diluted share increased from $37.4 million or $0.65 per share last year, despite $11 million or $0.19 per share of lower year-over-year net earnings from financial services.
Lets now turn to our segment results, beginning with the C&I group on slide 7, segment sales of $259 million improved 22% from prior year levels. The year-over-year sales increased was driven by a higher sales across all operating units with particularly strong increases in those businesses serving customers in critical industries and emerging markets.
Again this quarter, sales increases were realized in our European base tools businesses. While we still face headwinds in this region, we are encouraged that the higher year-over-year sales in the first half of the year may be evidence of some continuing stabilization in the European markets, despite the headlines of late, regarding financial market volatility in that region.
Gross profit in the C&I segments of $93 million increased $27 million or $41.6%, from 2009 levels, reflecting the 22% sales increase and $5.2 million of savings from RCI, restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives.
The year-over-gross profit comparison also benefitted from favorable manufacturing utilization, as a result in increasing production levels. You may recall that last year we incurred substantial cost to carry excess manufacturing capacity primarily in Europe, as a result of lower production levels and inventory reduction efforts.
For the current quarter, gross margin of 35.8%, improved 500 basis points from 30.8% last year. Operating expenses in the quarter of $67 million were up slightly year-over-year as higher volume related and other expenses were partially offset [Author ID1: at Fri Jul 23 21:45:00 2010
]by $1.4 million of more restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the C&I segment improved from 1.1% in the second quarter of last year to 9.9% this year.
Turning now to slide 8; on a worldwide basis, second quarter sales in the Snap-on tools group increased 9% from 2009 levels. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 7.8% including a 9.3% increase in the United States. Man-count in the U.S. at the end of the second quarter increased slightly compared to prior year levels. Gross profit in the Snap-on tools group of $116 million increased $14.4 million over the prior year.
This increase primarily reflects contributions from higher sales and benefits from favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increasing US production levels and $4.9 million of favorable currency effects.
In the quarter, gross margin improved to 43.7%, an increase of 200 basis points over 41.7% last year. Operating expenses of $83 million in the quarter increased $6.9 million from 2009 levels primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 12.5% in the quarter for the Snap-on tools group improved 200 basis points from 10.5% last year.
Let's now turn slide 9, and the segment we now refer to as Repair Systems and Information or RS&I. As previously communicated the RS&I segment and its operations are aligned and focused on better serving customers in the worldwide vehicle service and repair marketplace, including all orders of managers of independent and OEM dealership service and repair shops. In addition to equipment products and equipment repair services, the RS&I segment included the business operations of the former Diagnostic and Information group.
Second quarter sales of $206 million in the RS&I segment were up 4% from prior year levels. Excluding currency, organic sales were up 4.7%, primarily due to higher sales of equipment and increased essential tool and facilitation program sales, partially offset by anticipated lower electronic parts catalogues sales in North America, the latter a result of OEM dealership consolidations.
Gross profit of $96 million in the quarter increased $8.2 million from 2009 level, primarily due to contributions from the higher sales $1.6 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives and $1.1 million of lower restructuring cost. Gross margin in the quarter improved to 46.5%, an increase of 230 basis points over 44.2% last year.
Operating expenses of $56 million were up 1.1 million from 2009 level, improved 50 basis point as a percent of sales. Higher compensation, volume related and product development expenses were partially offset by $1.7 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives, as well as $1 million of lower bad debt expense.
Operating earnings of $40 million in the RS&I group for the quarter increased $7.1 million or 21.6% on a $7.9 million or 4% sales increase. The favorable incremental operating margin is primarily due to $3.3 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives and $1.8 million of lower year-over-year restructuring cost. As a percentage of sales, operating margins in the RS&I group of 19.4% improved 280 basis points from 16.6% last year.
Turning to slide ten. The $1.7 million of Financial Services earnings in the second quarter compares favorably to a loss of $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2010 and loss of $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Financial Services earnings in the second quarter of 2009 prior to the determination of the joint venture with CIT were $16.6 million. As you know since July 16 of last year we are no longer selling loan contracts to CIT and recording gains on sales. Rather we are building overtime an on-balance sheet interest yielding portfolio. As this portfolio grows so will our Financial Services operating earnings.
Moving to slide eleven. As of the second quarter end, our balance sheet includes $451 million in gross financing receivables from our US Snap-on Credit operations and $126 million in gross financing receivables from our international finance subsidiaries for a total financing portfolio of $577 million.
In the United States, $384 million of the portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since the termination of the joint venture, Snap-on Credit continues to manage the run-off portfolio of contracts owned by CIT, which totaled $384 million at quarter end, which is down approximately $100 million from first quarter end.
For the full year 2010, we continue to expect that the on-booked financing portfolio will grow by approximately $300 million. This suggests that additional growth in the Snap-on Credit US portfolio of about a $110 to $120 million over the remaining six months of this year.
The net cash requirements of our international finance portfolios are substantially self funding. Portfolio loss and delinquency trends continue to be in line with our expectations, and have improved sequentially compared to Q1.
Turning to slide 12, consolidated operating cash flow for the quarter was $55.5 million. At the end of the quarter our cash position of $431 million was down from approximately $472 million at first quarter end. This is driven by the net increase in finance receivables of $73 million primarily due to the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit.
In the quarter capital spending of $6.6 million was down from $19.5 since last year, primarily due to last year's construction of a new R&D facility and headquarters for our automotive parts and service information business in Richfield, Ohio. For the full year 2010, we expect capital expenditures will be approximately $50 million.
As seen on slide 13, trade and other receivables, increased $6.9 million from 2009 year end, excluding $18.6 million of currency translation impacts, trade and other receivables increased to $11.7 million, primarily due to higher sales. Days sales outstanding for trade and other receivables of 59 days, improved from 63 days at 2009 year end.
Inventories at the end of the quarter increased $21.8 million from 2009 year-end. Excluding $14.4 million of currency translation impacts, inventories increased $36.2 million primarily due to higher production levels as a result of increased customer demand. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns increased to 4.4 turns as compared to 4.1 turns in 2009 year-end.
Net debt at the end of the quarter was $493 million. Our net debt to capital ratio of 28.3% compares to 22.2% in 2009 year-end. If we exclude approximately $108 million of cash, currently withheld related to the previously disclosed dispute with CIT, our net debt to capital ratio as of the end of the second quarter would have been 32.5%.
In addition to $431 million of cash, we continue to maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility that does not expire until August 2012. We also have another $20 million of committed bank lines. At quarter-end, the full $520 million of borrowing capacity was available.
In addition to these facilities, our current A2/P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper market should we choose to do so. At quarter-end, no commercial paper was outstanding. Our liquidity position and access to credit continues to remain strong.
This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance, but before turning the call back to Nick, I'd like to review our outlook for the balance of 2010. For the full year, we presently expect to incur approximately $15 million of restructuring cost, somewhat less than the previously communicated $18 million to $22 million. This reflects the more likely calendarization of program actions to improve the company's fixed cost structure.
We also anticipate continuing our planned strategic investments, including expansion in emerging markets and as I mentioned earlier, for the full year 2010 we presently expect that capital expenditures will be approximately $50 million.
With respect to pension, our current expectation is that 2010 full year pension expense will be $16 million higher than last year. This is down from the previously communicated estimate of $20 million due to changes in actuarial assumptions.
Finally, as a result of the favorable settlement of certain tax audit in the quarter, the anticipated effective income tax rate for full year 2010 is now expected to approximate 33.7%.
Before opening the call for questions, Nick will like provide some final thoughts. Nick?

We are encouraged by the quarter's results, the second straight upward movement and perhaps the beginning of another trend. Sales up almost 10%; profits up 47% versus last year; good sequential progression versus the first quarter. The OI margin at 12. 2% is fairly robust. Our Snap-on value creation process just keep generating gains. In the quarter we saw all the elements of that play book work; safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and RCI, and you can see it in the numbers.
We've said consistently that throughout the downturn we would keep investing in the key areas, which we believed will be decisive in capturing growth going forward and we said as a result we would take advantage of the recovery as it occurs. The second quarter is testimony to the success of that approach,
The van network is robust and back to 2008 levels. Share is growing is the garage. Our presence in critical industries is expanding and we are building a significant position in emerging markets.
So looking forward we are optimistic, although cautiously so. We see the world leaning favorably in North America, mixed but positive in Europe and clearly growing in Asia. To be sure, the recovery is fragile and we are going into the third quarter, which is always difficult to predict because of the vacation period, but now we have two positive periods, so we are optimistic.
We are not certain what the immediate macroeconomics will hold but we believe in the special strength of our markets. Making work easier for serious professionals performing critical tasks is valued in any situation and with Snap-on value creation and our strategic investments we continue to believe that we are very well positioned, well positioned to take advantage of any recovery, in whatever shape, over what ever timetable it occurs.
I want to finish just by recognizing our franchisees and our associates. I know many of you are on the call. The successes in the quarter were only possible because of your efforts, your capability and your commitment. You have my congratulations and you have my thanks.

That business, like I said is up to 2008 levels and people talk about the restocking.
We haven't seen any restocking there at all. So, in fact we like the cash position of our vans in that business. So I think we are very encouraged by the 9% to 10% growth in that channel itself.
Now, the equipment, the big ticket items in there, it's kind of bifurcated. The smaller big ticket items, that is diagnostics and tool storage are starting to get back to 2008 levels, which we like. This is was we said all along and if you look at, I think we had the best quarters since 2008 in that business this quarter.
If you look at the equipment, the other piece of the big ticket items, we are encouraged because that was in North America but we are still below 2008 levels, in low double-digits. Europe, though in equipments was a big strength for us. Europe has gotten back close to 2008 levels in the big ticket items and that was driven, I didn't talk about this in my remarks but by an extraordinary new product, which we launched in Europe the Prism aligner, this is an aligner, which allows you to package alignment into a smaller base, and as you probably can figure that the base, the garages in Europe are somewhat more compact, so the value of that aligner breaking on that market has given us some pretty good tractions., So we feel pretty good about that situations.
So, I think those are couple of places, the other place in the industrial group, the businesses in critical industries like natural resources and aerospace are up in some pretty, I don't want to give you any numbers in this because we don't give numbers out, but they are up very strong and much, much higher than our average. We feel pretty good about that and as you know industrial is not a restocking situation. That's a direct sales model so restocking doesn't have much to do with that.
Now we do have in our industrial business a smaller group, a smaller piece of the business, which we sell through distributors. You may remember this in United States it's a very small piece of the business and there could be restocking there, but that business was up over 50% in the quarter. So, we feel pretty robust about that situation, the whole idea of recognizing that when we roll the Snap-on brand out of the garage, the customers are open to that idea, they are open to that idea. So it seems to be working.

We launched the mid-tier brand to sell to them also, as much as we work to make customers for life, with educational institutions and we sell Snap-on brand to them. Some new technicians simply don't think they can afford Snap-on, they buy an alternate brand. So they can afford Snap-on, we sell a Blue-Point to them. So there is opportunity to grow in that mid-tier here.
Secondly we go on about 800,000 technicians. In the United States there are 1.3 million. Fully enabled our vans call on about a 850,000 technicians. There are 1.3 million. The reason why we don't call on those others, 400,000 to 500,000 is because they are lower volume and our technicians drive by them because they don't want to spend time with them and that is a productivity issue, none of the technicians are vans driven, but that's a productivity issue.
So productivity on the van will allow us to take our existing framework, our existing network and reach out to a big portion of that 1.3 million. Now it's not a one for one replacement but it's a real opportunity for us. That's why we are launching rapid continuous improvement in the vans. That's what we are doing this year. It's one of our big initiatives and I see those two things as ways to grow.

So we had a gangbuster this quarter in terms of big ticket items and actually if you remember we said this is exactly how we understood the business. We said that people who were in garages, they were buying wrenches and they kept buying wrenches through the downturn and that was it. It was big ticket that was off, because people thought that they charged, the uncertainty, the idea of not wanting to invest in those big ticket item took them away.
Well, we are back to 2008, and lo and behold the vehicle of restoration has been the rise in the big ticket items. That's exactly what we been I think thinking about and trying to conjure in these calls for a long time and so that's really what happened. So we did have a good quarter in the first quarter, it was a good quarter, but this quarter was up double digits.
Then in terms of equipment we are still not as I said we are still not back to 2008, we are still coming off the floor and that makes sense. So Gary as you think about it, diagnostics is the best. So the most expensive its like an [$8000] purchase, tool storage can be $5,000 to $10,000 but when you are talking about some of that equipment that under-car equipment it can be up $20,000, and it's much more of a capital type equipment.
So therefore the whole idea of the uncertainty around the recession becomes more dampening in that area and that's what we are seeing.
So we are seeing progress, but it just isn't as fast and it hasn't snapped back to before 2008 levels. In fact it went deeper than diagnostics and tool storage. The one thing I did say though was that, what we are really pleased with is the effect of that new Prism product in Europe, which really gave us some boost in equipment.

So you got to kind of remember though is that, I think everybody should remember is, you have a couple of good quarters, we are going into the third quarter. I think that the third quarter for us is highly unpredictable, more difficult to predict because we have European vacations, the franchisees tend to relax a little bit, they go to the Merlin show or something like that, whatever they do.

We anticipate that our future statement that would be about $750 million because we are probably going to do little bit less badly seeing that things of that nature that might be better suited for Banks than do directly with franchisees.
It will take a little bit of time for some of the tail of the old CIT portfolio when it comes across. So I have been saying as I meet with people, that I think we will see our future staying at about like a $750 million US portfolio in and around somewhere around 2012. Ramps somewhere in that time frame, but you know our future state that we envisioned for this, is tending to follow the model, we have a portfolio that is yielding at expected rates, we are fortunate in that the bad debt performance and delinquencies are still on plan and on target and actually have slightly improved. We are very pleased with that.
The originations which underlie the volume tend to track more or less with the Tools group. I think it the reflects the actions in the Tools group. That's what it's there for. So pretty much as the Tools group volume rose, we expect that this renewal of contracts and add-ons as we call them will continue to prosper.
So at the endgame, we expect that this has the capability even after interest expense is allocated to create a portfolio that will generate about a 25% return on financial income and that financial income would be, the portfolio yield times the overall finance receivables, that are there within it.

303646,109140466,69078,"Snap-on Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-23-2010",2010-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Snap-on Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone.

You know, I think it's fair to say that the second quarter results provide some significant evidence that our strategies are working. We continue to make tangible gains in markets that are mixed, still tough, but are improving. And in this environment, we remain committed to the Snap-on value creation processes. They form a powerful framework for both capturing growth opportunities and for achieving cost and flexibility improvement, and we continue to make progress in the four key strategic initiatives that we believe will be decisive for us going forward: Enhancing the franchise network, expanding our presence in vehicle repair facilities, extending out of the garage and into critical industries and building an emerging market. In each of those areas, we're encouraged by the progress that's evident in our second quarter. The organic sales in the quarter were up nearly 10%, about $57 million from last year and operating earnings before Financial Services were up more than $25 million or 47% over last year's level. The resulting operating margin was 12.2%, that's up 310 basis points from 2009, encouraging progress that the Snap-on value creation processes, processes like safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement have driven to reality. 
As usual, Aldo will take you through the financials in detail, but first, I'll give you our perspective on the markets and cover some of the operating highlights. Last quarter, I characterized the markets as -- I think I said stabilized, favorably inclined, but not rebounding. Since then, we haven't seen any exceptional economic acceleration. However, I will say that overall, nothing has led us to be less positive, and certainly, we now have one more quarter of stability, and we actually see some pockets of further strengthening. So we're a bit more encouraged, but we remain cautious. It's clear that the recovery is fragile. 
Let me provide you a little bit more color on the sales front. In addition to the 9.6% of year-over-year organic sales increase, volume was also up about 6% sequentially from the first quarter. Overall, for us, overall, there's not much seasonality except in the third quarter when summer vacations and shutdowns, primarily in Europe, can make volume hard to predict. So the 6% sequential increase in the second quarter was fairly strong compared to what normally is a relatively flat first to second quarter progression. In fact, it was the strongest second quarter uptick we've seen in at least seven years. And this strength was reasonably widespread with all the operating groups, Commercial & Industrial, Tools and RS&I were all up stronger than the normal increase. 
In addition to those overall volumes, we've also been watching the trends and what we've been calling big-ticket items, large dollar products like diagnostics and undercar equipment that have longer paybacks and tool storage units, which are more discretionary purchases. Given their capital nature, we believe activity in those products is a window on our customers' financial position and under overall confidence, and we're encouraged by what we saw. Undercar equipment sales showed favorable trends in the quarter, and that was true in both North America and Europe. Diagnostics and tool storage units which are generally sold through the van channel also showed positive signs. So now we recorded two quarters of big-ticket progress, and that is a fairly strong positive because we've seen quite a bit of variation in these products during the downturn over the last 18 months. 
If we dissect the sales by geography, we see an uneven landscape. In Europe, sales are up from last year about in line with what we see for the overall company increase. Remember, however though, that Europe was hard hit, very hard hit last year, so I think we need to see a bit stronger gain in order to start feeling clearly positive about that situation. And within Europe, the regional variance as of the last quarter continued. Modest recovery in the North and Central areas, weakness in the South. Spain, in particular, where we have a fairly large position, is not recovering. I think everybody's aware that Spain has been among the hardest hit in the downturn, and we've seen this reflected in our Spanish business. A couple of bright spots though, I'll say even better than elsewhere have been undercar equipment in Europe and even a bit more rapid recovery in the East in places like Russia and Turkey. All of those were up strongly. Also in the U.K., we're seeing some strength, especially in the Tools Group where actually, we're coming off a fairly solid 2009. The comparisons aren't that easy. So the gains in the U.K. are significant, a real positive. So I'd say then that Europe is mixed. We're seeing some positive signs, but we're still some distance from a clear trend. Asia, no surprise, is outpacing the rest of the world. We're seeing solid increases there both in emerging markets like India and even in the more established markets like Korea. Building our presence in the region with both physicals in the product is paying off. So with another quarter of favorability behind us, we are optimistic. However, we also still believe the recovery is fragile. It seems everyday, we see and we hear mixed signals. And for us, for our customers it does impact their confidence. I said frequently last year that people were eating bad news for breakfast, everyday from the paper and from the TV. And I think we still have a bit of the same thing going on now, only with mixed signals. So the uncertainty remains, but we would say we're moving in a positive direction. So we'll stay focused on the approach that's been successful for us: Vigilance on costs, flexibility in reaching for opportunities, Snap-on value creation driving improvement and investment in the decisive initiatives for growth. 
Now for some highlights in each of the operating groups. Commercial Industrial or C&I. Sales were up 22% from last year with double-digit increases in all of the units. The operating margin was 9.9%, also up substantially. Volume and ongoing operational improvements did the trick in that area. The Industrial division, especially in the U.S. showed the strongest gains, making advances in critical industries, taking the Snap-on brand out of the garage, like we said before. For example, our position in the Aerospace segment, it continues to strengthen. We're partnering with OEM aircraft manufacturers as well as tech schools to develop and support Snap-on specific aviation certification programs. It's a great way to establish an early relationship with students who are future technicians, and for us, it's an effective path in creating a lifelong professional customer. And we continue to move forward with that type of partnership approach in a number of industries like wind, oil and gas, and in fact, auto repair. 
Let's go back to the Aerospace segment. This is an area where Snap-on is uniquely positioned. The mission-critical nature of the work is obvious. The quality that Snap-on brand is required and valued and the potential for growth is abundant for us. While the industry has been depressed, there are some signs of recovery. Just this week, at the Farnborough International Airshow, there's been a lot of confidence, and aircraft orders were surprisingly strong. Snap-on's asset show, displaying a revolutionary tool control innovations, and they've been a big hit. So we like our position as the aerospace sector recovers. 
We're also reaching new critical industries and tailoring our lineup to support that effort. I spoke to you last quarter of the broadened product line we've been introducing for large tool application in areas and segments like mining and natural resources. In the second quarter, we saw more progress with those customers due to that expanded offering and a significant industrial sales growth is evidence of that success. Talk about innovation, often at Snap-on.
Our leadership in innovation and design, our focus on safety is also evident with the Bahco brand. Last year, the Bahco handsaw system won the prestigious red dot award for European design excellence, and this year, the recognition continued with the product being named the winner of the Design S award for ergonomics. That system provides ergonomically superior handles in different sizes for left- and right-handed users with 10 different interchangeable blades for cutting a variety of materials, and it offers a patented locking system. 
Innovation driven by customer connection helping SNA Europe sell even in a downturn, helping Bahco maintain a world-class brand. And Asia-Pacific, as I said, is continuing its upward trends. Sales were again up strongly, with gains in India, China, Philippines and Korea leading the way. We've been working hard over several years in that region to establish our physical capabilities. More salesmen more factory capacity, more Asianized product, and it's been paying a lot. You can see it in our numbers. You can see it in the success of our new products. A great example is the new Bahco Asianized band saw. It's been a runaway seller. So much so that we outstripped our recently established capacity, and we're acting right now to double down on Kunshan saw capacity. So Asia's a success.
Moving to the Tools Group. Volumes increased 7.8% in the quarter, about $19 million from last year with the U.S. posting a 9% gain. Operating income was up $7.5 million to $33 million or 12.5% of sales. For some time, one of our key initiatives has been to strengthen the franchisee network. I think we have clear evidence that those efforts continue to pay off. In the second quarter, our sales in the U.S. returned to 2008 pre-recession levels. Now I think it's widely agreed that the overall economy hasn't returned to the same level as two years ago, so reaching that benchmark is encouraging for us. 
I've spoken in the past about our franchisee stimulus programs, aimed at supporting the network. It's been a key to our sales return, and we believe that right now, our franchisees are in better shape. Sales strong, profits robust, cash improved, so the stimulus is working and the network is stronger. I already mentioned big-ticket items in the favorable results. Well those are the products that often require financing, and in that space, Snap-on Credit is a huge advantage. It's a core contributor to the power of our franchise network. The credit company's transition into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Snap-on started about a  year ago, and it's progressing well. And in the second quarter, it's now turned profitable, as we said it would in several prior calls. At the end of the day though, in our business, you have to have great products to sell, and we use our frequent touches with the end customer to create just that. Innovation and new products are often born out of technology advances. But sometimes, it's less complicated. It comes from just knowing your customers' problems. For example, in using the 3,600 franchisees in talking and visiting with customers with automotive technicians, we found that all-in-one wire stripper, crimper and cutter pliers were designed primarily for electricians. They tend to spend more time stripping wires, and you can imagine, they don't have the same space challenges as an auto tech. So with that insight, our engineers went to work and developed a new compact cutter and stripper tool, designed specifically for tight auto application. It's been a huge hit. Not a big-ticket breakthrough product that transforms a company, but thousands were sold. And it's a great example of using customer connection to our advantage, extending Snap-on's tradition of innovation, and that tradition echoes favorably up and down the product line and in and out of garages all over this country and all over the world. 
Now, to Repair Systems & Information or the RS&I Group. This was the group that was formed out of our recent reorganization, lining each new segment up with the primary customer base: The Tools Group, focused on auto technician; C&I, focused on professionals and critical industries in emerging markets; and RS&I, serving vehicle repair shop owners and managers. We're now organized to capture growth in each of these broad and important customer segments. Back to RS&I, overall volumes increased 4.7%, driven by the Equipment division activity, driven by the Equipment division's increases that I mentioned before. It also had some solid improvements at EQS, our Facilitation and Essential Tools business. Those gains in those areas helped to offset Snap-on Business Solutions or SBS, where activity continues to be down related to consolidation in the overall OEM dealer space. Now SBS is working to help itself. It's working to create some offsets of its own by expanding with existing customers, including internationally and with badges that haven't been impacted by the dealership disruption. They're also working hard to grow at near-adjacent markets such as power sport, agricultural and construction. 
Speaking of OEMs and their dealers, we're seeing some improvement in that area in the OEM manufacturers' willingness to commit to Essential Tools, and the dealers themselves are starting to make purchases. So all of this certainly drove some of RS&I's improvement, and the RS&I Group is growing elsewhere. We saw some solid sales increases related to our expansion in heavy truck and fleet markets. If you think about it, that's a natural fit for us. And we've been making investments in product, both diagnostics and repair information, and we're starting to get traction. So that summarizes the markets. And I think it provides you some perspective on our advances in the quarter. So now I'll turn from an operating perspective. So now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a review of the financial results in detail. Aldo?"

Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Sales in the second quarter of $648 million increased to 9.8% from second quarter 2009 levels. The primary drivers behind the $58 million year-over-year sales increase includes hi",2161,"Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Sales in the second quarter of $648 million increased to 9.8% from second quarter 2009 levels. The primary drivers behind the $58 million year-over-year sales increase includes higher sales in critical industries, increased sales in emerging markets, higher equipment sales and increased sales to franchisees in the U.S. and the U.K. Company also saw steady improvement in its European-based businesses. 
Consolidated gross profit of $303.8 million in the quarter increased $49.8 million year-over-year, while the gross margin improved by 380 basis points. These increases were largely due to the higher sales volumes and favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of the increasing levels of production. Savings from rapid continuous improvement or RCI, initiatives and benefits from previous restructuring actions contributed about $7 million of gross profit improvement. Foreign currency, primarily transaction effects, contributed $5 million and lower year-over-year restructuring costs contributed an additional $3 million of gross profit improvement. 
As a result of these factors, consolidated gross margin improved to 46.9% in the quarter, as compared to 43.1% last year. Operating expenses in the quarter increased $25 million from 2009 levels. This was primarily due to higher volume-related expenses and $14.9 million of increased performance-based incentive compensation expense as a result of improved year-over-year operating performance and increased participation in the company's stock purchase programs. 
In addition, we incurred $3.1 million of higher pension expense, largely due to lower-than-projected asset returns in previous years related to the U.S. pension plan. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by $2.5 million of benefits from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction initiatives and $2.5 million of lower restructuring costs. 
As a percent of sales, operating expenses were 34.7% in the second quarter of 2010 as compared to 34% last year. Restructuring costs in the second quarter totaled $3.1 million as compared to $8.6 million last year. Operating earnings of $79 million before Financial Services improved 47% over prior year and a 9.8% sales increase. Financial Services operating earnings of $1.7 million in the quarter improved sequentially from a $1.7 million loss in the first quarter of 2010 and also compares favorably with the $3.8 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2009 and a $5.3 million loss in the third quarter of 2009. 
As previously discussed, and as expected, operating income from Financial Services, which is before interest expense, is consistently improving as the unbooked finance portfolio grows. Since the termination of the Financial Services joint venture with CIT in July of last year, our gross unbooked  finance portfolio has grown over $450 million to $577 million. Year-to-date, this portfolio has grown about $180 million. 
Turning to interest expense, higher average debt levels, primarily related to the growth in our unbooked finance portfolio increased interest expense by $1.6 million year-over-year. The second quarter effective income tax rates were 31.2% in 2010 and 31.9% in 2009. The improved and lower-than-previously-communicated effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2010 primarily benefited from the favorable settlement of the tax audit. The second quarter 2009 rate benefited primarily from the realization of a tax benefit in a foreign jurisdiction. 
Finally, net earnings of $45.3 million or $0.78 per diluted share increased from $37.4 million or $0.65 per share last year, despite $11 million or $0.19 per share of lower year-over-year net earnings from Financial Services. 
Let's now turn to our segment results. Beginning with the C&I group on Slide 7, segment sales of $259 million improved 22% from prior-year levels. The year-over-year sales increase was driven by higher sales across all operating units, with particularly strong increases in those businesses serving customers in critical industries and emerging markets. Again this quarter, sales increases were realized in our European-based Tools business. While we still face headwinds in this region, we are encouraged that the higher year-over-year sales in the first half of the year may be evidence of some continuing stabilization in the European markets, despite the headlines have laid regarding financial market volatility in that region. 
Gross profit in the C&I segment of $93 million increased $27 million or 41.6% from 2009 levels, reflecting the 22% sales increase and $5.2 million of savings from RCI, restructuring and other cost-reduction initiatives. The year-over-year gross profit comparison also benefited from favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increasing production levels. You may recall that last year, we incurred substantial costs to carry excess manufacturing capacity, primarily in Europe, as a result of lower production levels and inventory reduction efforts. 
For the current quarter, gross margin of 35.8% improved 500 basis points from 30.8% last year. Operating expenses in the quarter of $67 million were up slightly year-over-year as higher volume-related and other expenses were partially offset by $1.4 million of lower restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the C&I segment improved from 1.1% in the second quarter of last year to 9.9% this year.
Turning now to Slide 8. On a worldwide basis, second quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group increased 9% from 2009 levels. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 7.8%, including a 9.3% increase in the United States. Van count in the U.S. at end of the second quarter increased slightly compared to prior-year levels. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $116 million increased $14.4 million over the prior year. This increase primarily reflects contributions from higher sales and benefits from favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increasing U.S. production levels and $4.9 million of favorable currency effects. In the quarter, gross margin improved to 43.7%, an increase of 200 basis points over 41.7% last year. Operating expenses of $83 million in the quarter increased $6.9 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 12.5% in the quarter for the Snap-on Tools Group improved 200 basis points from 10.5% last year.
Let's now turn to Slide 9, and the segment we now refer to as Repair Systems & Information or RS&I. As previously communicated, the RS&I segment and its operations are aligned and focused on better serving customers in the worldwide vehicle service and repair marketplace, including owners and managers of independent and OEM dealership service and repair shops. In addition to equipment products and equipment repair services, the RS&I segment includes the business operations as a former Diagnostics & Information Group. Second quarter sales of $206 million in the RS&I segment were up 4% from prior year levels. Excluding currency, organic sales were up 4.7%, primarily due to higher sales of equipment and increased essential tool and facilitation program sales, partially offset by anticipated lower electronic parts catalog sales in North America, the latter a result of OEM dealership consolidations. Gross profit of $96 million in the quarter increased $8.2 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to contributions from the higher sales, $1.6 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives and $1.1 million of lower restructuring costs. Gross margin in the quarter improved to 46.5%, an increase of 230 basis points over 44.2% last year. Operating expenses of $56 million, while up $1.1 million from 2009 levels, improved 50 basis points as a percent of sales. Higher compensation, volume-related and product development expenses were partially offset by $1.7 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives as well as $1 million of lower bad debt expense. Operating earnings of $40 million in the RS&I group for the quarter increased $7.1 million or 21.6% on a $7.9 million or 4% sales increase. The favorable incremental operating margin is primarily due to $3.3 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives and $1.8 million of lower year-over-year restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the RS&I group of 19.4% improved 280 basis points from 16.6% last year. 
Turning to Slide 10. The $1.7 million of Financial Services earnings in the second quarter compares favorably to a loss of $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2010 and a loss of $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Financial Services earnings in the second quarter of 2009 prior to the termination of the joint venture with CIT were $16.6 million. As you know, since July 16 of last year, we are no longer selling loan contracts to CIT and recording gains on sale. Rather, we are building overtime and on-balance sheet interest yielding portfolio. As this portfolio grows, so will our Financial Services operating earnings. 
Moving to Slide 11, as of the second quarter end, our balance sheet includes $451 million in gross financing receivables from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation and $126 million in gross financing receivables from our international finance subsidiaries, for a total financing portfolio of $577 million. In the United States, $384 million of the portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since the termination of the joint venture, Snap-on Credit continues to manage the run-off portfolio of contracts owned by CIT, which totaled $384 million at quarter end, which is down approximately $100 million from first quarter end. 
For the full year 2010, we continue to expect that the unbooked financing portfolio will grow by approximately $300 million. This suggests additional growth in the Snap-on Credit U.S. portfolio of about $110 million to $120 million over the remaining six months of this year. The net cash requirements of our international finance portfolios are substantially self-funding. Portfolio loss and delinquency trends continue to be in line with our expectations and have improved sequentially compared to Q1.
Turning to Slide 12. Consolidated operating cash flow for the quarter was $55.5 million. At the end of the quarter, our cash position of $431 million was down from approximately $472 million at first quarter end. This is driven by the net increase in finance receivables of $73 million, primarily due to the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit. In the quarter, capital spending of $6.6 million was down from $19.5 million spent last year, primarily due to last year's construction of a new R&D facility and headquarters for our Automotive Parts and Service Information business in Richfield, Ohio. 
For the full year 2010, we expect capital expenditures will be approximately $50 million. As seen on Slide 13, trade and other receivables decreased $6.9 million from 2009 year end. Excluding $18.6 million of currency translation impacts, trade and other receivables increased $11.7 million, primarily due to higher sales. Day sales outstanding for trade and other receivables of 59 days improved from 63 days at 2009 year end. Inventories at the end of the quarter increased $21.8 million from 2009 year end. Excluding $14.4 million of currency translation impacts, inventories increased $36.2 million, primarily due to higher production levels as a result of increased customer demand. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns increased to 4.4 turns as compared to 4.1 turns in 2009 year end. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $493 million. Our net debt to capital ratio of 28.3% compares to 22.2% at 2009 year end. We exclude approximately $108 million of cash currently withheld related to the previously disclosed dispute with CIT. Our net debt to capital ratio as of the end of the second quarter would have been 32.5%. 
In addition to $431 million of cash, we continue to maintain a $500-million revolving credit facility that does not expire until August 2012. We also have another $20 million of committed bank lines, and at quarter end, the full $520 million of borrowing capacity was available. In addition to these facilities, our current A2/P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper market should we choose to do so. At quarter end, no commercial paper was outstanding. Our liquidity position and access to credit continues to remain strong. This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. But before turning the call back to Nick, I'd like to review our outlook for the balance of 2010.
For the full year, we presently expect to incur approximately $15 million of restructuring cost, somewhat less than the previously communicated $18 million to $22 million. This reflects the more likely calendarization of program actions to improve the company's fixed cost structure. We also anticipate continuing our planned strategic investments, including expansion in emerging markets. And as I've mentioned earlier, for the full year 2010, we presently expect that capital expenditures will be approximately $50 million. 
With respect to pension, our current expectation is that 2010 full year pension expense will be $16 million higher than last year. This is down from the previously communicated estimate of $20 million due to changes in actuarial assumptions. Finally, as a result of the favorable settlement of certain tax audit in the quarter, the anticipated effective income tax rate for full year 2010 is now expected to approximate 33.7%. 
Before opening the call for questions, Nick would like to provide some final thoughts. Nick?"

So to wrap up, we're encouraged by the quarter's results; the second straight upward movement and perhaps the beginning of another trend, sales up almost 10%, profits up 47% versus last year, good sequential progression versus the first quarter. The OI margin at 12.2% is fairly robust. Our Snap-on value creation processes keep generating gain. In the quarter, we saw all the elements of that playbook work; safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and RCI. And you can see it in the numbers. 
We've said consistently that throughout the downturn, we would keep investing in the key areas, which we believe would be decisive in capturing growth going forward. And we said, as a result, we would take advantage of the recovery as it occurs. Well, the second quarter is a testimony to the success of that approach. The van network is robust and back to 2008 levels. Share is growing in the garage. Our presence in critical industries is expanding and we are building a significant position in emerging markets. 
So looking forward, we're optimistic, although, cautiously so. We see the world leaning favorably in North America, mixed but positive in Europe and clearly growing in Asia. To be sure, the recovery is fragile, and we are going into the third quarter, which is always difficult to predict because of the vacation period. But we now have two positive periods. So we're optimistic. We're not certain what the immediate macroeconomics will hold, but we believe in the special strength of our markets, making work easier for serious professionals performing critical tasks is valued in any situation. And with Snap-on value creation in our strategic investments, we continue to believe that we're very well positioned, well positioned to take advantage of any recovery in whatever shape over whatever timetable it occurs. 
I want to finish just by recognizing our franchisees and our associates. I know many of you are on the call. The successes in the quarter were only possible because of your efforts, your capability and your commitment. You have my congratulations, and you have my thanks.

And that business is, like I said, it's up to 2008 levels and people talk about restocking. We haven't seen any restocking there at all. So in fact, we like the cash position of our vans in that business. So I think we are very encouraged by the 9%, 10% growth in that channel itself. Now the equipment, the big ticket items in there, it's kind of bifurcated. The smaller big ticket items, that is diagnostics and tool storage, are starting to get back to 2008 levels, which we like because this is what we said all along. And if you look at -- I think we had the best quarter since 2008 in that business this quarter. If you look at the equipment, the other piece of the big ticket items, we are encouraged in North America. But we're still below 2008 levels, about low double digits. Europe, though, in equipment, was a big, big strength for us. Europe has gotten back close to 2008 levels in the big ticket items. And that was driven, I didn't talk about this in my remark, by an extraordinary new product, which we launched in Europe, the PRISM aligner. This is an aligner which allows you to package alignment into smaller base. And as you probably configure that the base, the garages in Europe are somewhat more compact, so the value of that aligner breaking on that market has given us some pretty good traction. So we feel pretty good about that situation. So I think those are a couple of places. The other places in the Industrial group, the businesses in critical industries like natural resources and aerospace are up in some pretty -- I don't want to give you any numbers on this because we don't give the numbers out, but they're up very strong and much, much higher than our average. We feel pretty good about that. And as you know, Industrial is not a restocking situation. That's a direct sales model, so restocking doesn't have much to do with that. Now we do have in our Industrial business a smaller group, a smaller piece of the business, which is we sell through distributors. You may remember this in the United States. It's a very small piece of the business. And there could be restocking there, but that business was up over 50% in the quarter. So we feel pretty robust about that situation. The whole idea of recognizing that when we roll the Snap-on brand out of the garage, the customers are open to that idea. They're open in that idea. So it seems to be working."

One is the fact that we know that there are a number of customers who buy Snap-on tools for their workplace. And then at home, they use another brand, let's say, a mid-tier brand. So we can sell Blue-Point. We've launched the mid-tier brand to sell to them. Also, as much as we work to make customers for life with educational institutions and we sell Snap-on brand to them, some new technicians simply don't think they can afford Snap-on. They buy an alternate brand, so they can afford Snap-on. We sell a Blue-Point to them. So there's opportunity to grow in that mid-tier. Secondly, we call on about 800,000 technicians. In the United States, there are 1.3 million. Fully-enabled, our vans call on about 800,000, 850,000 technicians. There are 1.3 million. The reason why we don't call on those others 400,000, 500,000 is because they're lower volume, and our technicians drive by them because they don't want to spend time with them. And that's a productivity issue, and none of our technicians are vans driven, but that's a productivity issue. So productivity on the van will allow us to take our existing framework, our existing network and reach out to a big portion of that $1.3 million. Now it's not a one-for-one replacement, but it's a real opportunity for us. That's why we're launching rapid continuous improvement in the vans. That's what we're doing this year. It's one of our big initiatives, and I see those two things as ways to grow."

And that was the best quarter in 2008. So we had a gangbuster this quarter in terms of big ticket items. And actually, if you remember, we said this is exactly how we understood the business. We said that people are in garages. They were buying wrenches, and they kept buying wrenches due to downturn. And that was it. It was big ticket that was off because people thought that they charged, their uncertainty, the idea of not wanting to invest in those big ticket items took them away. Well, we're back to 2008. And lo and behold, the vehicle of restoration has been the rise in the big ticket items. That's exactly what we have been, I think, thinking about and trying to conjure in these calls for a long time. And so that's really what happened. And we did have a good quarter in the first quarter. It was a good quarter, but this quarter was up double digits. And then in terms of equipment, as I said, we're still not back to 2008. We're still coming off the floor and that makes sense, though, Gary, if you think about it. Diagnostics is the best. The most expensive is like an $8,000 purchase. Tool storage can be $5,000 to $10,000. But when you're talking about some of that under-car equipment, it can be up $20,000, and it's much more of a capital type equipment. And so, therefore, the whole idea of the uncertainty around the recession becomes more dampening in that area, and that's what we're seeing. So we are seeing progress, but it just isn't as fast. It hasn't snapped back to the full 2008 levels. In fact, it went deeper than diagnostics and tool storage. The one thing I did say, though, is that what we are really pleased with is the effect of that new PRISM product in Europe, which really gave us some boost in equipment."

I think we obviously -- like any company, you can have a mix issue. And if we have higher sales in Asia and so on, that's a little less profitable and the drop through is somewhat but we feel pretty good about maintaining that gross margin number. I mean, we had some absorption in this period, and we had some cost savings. But still, I feel pretty good about maintaining the gross margin. What you got to remember, though, is is that, I think every body should remember is, we've had a couple of good quarters. We're going into the third quarter, and I think that the third quarter for us is highly unpredictable, more difficult to predict because we have European vacations, the franchisees tend to relax a little bit, they go to the Maryland shore, something like that, whatever they do. And so historically, our third quarter has had more variance than other quarters. So we think of our year as one, two, three and four in terms of trying to model it out. I think the third quarter, it's hard to make a lot of judgments on."

And we say, ""What do you need?"" And we're not sure. Sometimes we provide them things we never thought was part of our org because we put it in a kit like a flashlight or something or generators and things like that. We sell it, we provide it in package with Snap-on tools. So that's an example of us struggling. We try to identify that. Equally, we find customers that are added, I would say, three years ago. I wouldn't have said wind would've been a customer for us, and now there is some customer there. So it's very difficult to define that. I can just say that, boy, it seems to us based on the growth up to -- we were getting good growth, if you remember, all the way through the first quarter of 2009 in this business. We were expanding. Then we took downtick, growth faster than anybody else was talking about. And we should because we're rolling a Snap-on brand out of the garage. It was a new thing. We're providing something new, capture, share takers. And now, this quarter, it started back up again. So I believe we're taking share. I can't define it, though, sorry."

So I've been saying as I meet with people that I think we'll see our future state of like a $750-million U.S. portfolio in and around, somewhere around 2012, perhaps somewhere in that time frame. But our future state that we envision for this it's tending to follow the model. We have a portfolio that's yielding at expected rates. We're fortunate in that. The bad debt performance and delinquencies are still on plan and on target and actually have slightly improved. We're very pleased with that. And the originations, which underlie the volume, tend to track more or less with the Tools Group. I think it reflects the actions in the Tools Group. That's what it's there for. So pretty much as the Tools Group volume grows, we expect that this renewal of contracts and add-ons, as we call them, will continue to prosper. So at the endgame, we expect that this has the capability, even after interest expense is allocated, to create a portfolio that will generate about a 25% return on financial income. And that financial income would be the portfolio yield times the overall finance receivables that are there within it."

303646,109140466,69079,"Snap-on Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-23-2010",2010-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Snap-on Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone.

You know, I think it's fair to say that the second quarter results provide some significant evidence that our strategies are working. We continue to make tangible gains in markets that are mixed, still tough, but are improving. And in this environment, we remain committed to the Snap-on value creation processes. They form a powerful framework for both capturing growth opportunities and for achieving cost and flexibility improvement, and we continue to make progress in the four key strategic initiatives that we believe will be decisive for us going forward: Enhancing the franchise network, expanding our presence in vehicle repair facilities, extending out of the garage and into critical industries and building an emerging market. In each of those areas, we're encouraged by the progress that's evident in our second quarter. The organic sales in the quarter were up nearly 10%, about $57 million from last year and operating earnings before Financial Services were up more than $25 million or 47% over last year's level. The resulting operating margin was 12.2%, that's up 310 basis points from 2009, encouraging progress that the Snap-on value creation processes, processes like safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement have driven to reality. 
As usual, Aldo will take you through the financials in detail, but first, I'll give you our perspective on the markets and cover some of the operating highlights. Last quarter, I characterized the markets as -- I think I said stabilized, favorably inclined, but not rebounding. Since then, we haven't seen any exceptional economic acceleration. However, I will say that overall, nothing has led us to be less positive, and certainly, we now have one more quarter of stability, and we actually see some pockets of further strengthening. So we're a bit more encouraged, but we remain cautious. It's clear that the recovery is fragile. 
Let me provide you a little bit more color on the sales front. In addition to the 9.6% of year-over-year organic sales increase, volume was also up about 6% sequentially from the first quarter. Overall, for us, overall, there's not much seasonality except in the third quarter when summer vacations and shutdowns, primarily in Europe, can make volume hard to predict. So the 6% sequential increase in the second quarter was fairly strong compared to what normally is a relatively flat first to second quarter progression. In fact, it was the strongest second quarter uptick we've seen in at least seven years. And this strength was reasonably widespread with all the operating groups, Commercial & Industrial, Tools and RS&I were all up stronger than the normal increase. 
In addition to those overall volumes, we've also been watching the trends and what we've been calling big-ticket items, large dollar products like diagnostics and undercar equipment that have longer paybacks and tool storage units, which are more discretionary purchases. Given their capital nature, we believe activity in those products is a window on our customers' financial position and under overall confidence, and we're encouraged by what we saw. Undercar equipment sales showed favorable trends in the quarter, and that was true in both North America and Europe. Diagnostics and tool storage units which are generally sold through the van channel also showed positive signs. So now we recorded two quarters of big-ticket progress, and that is a fairly strong positive because we've seen quite a bit of variation in these products during the downturn over the last 18 months. 
If we dissect the sales by geography, we see an uneven landscape. In Europe, sales are up from last year about in line with what we see for the overall company increase. Remember, however though, that Europe was hard hit, very hard hit last year, so I think we need to see a bit stronger gain in order to start feeling clearly positive about that situation. And within Europe, the regional variance as of the last quarter continued. Modest recovery in the North and Central areas, weakness in the South. Spain, in particular, where we have a fairly large position, is not recovering. I think everybody's aware that Spain has been among the hardest hit in the downturn, and we've seen this reflected in our Spanish business. A couple of bright spots though, I'll say even better than elsewhere have been undercar equipment in Europe and even a bit more rapid recovery in the East in places like Russia and Turkey. All of those were up strongly. Also in the U.K., we're seeing some strength, especially in the Tools Group where actually, we're coming off a fairly solid 2009. The comparisons aren't that easy. So the gains in the U.K. are significant, a real positive. So I'd say then that Europe is mixed. We're seeing some positive signs, but we're still some distance from a clear trend. Asia, no surprise, is outpacing the rest of the world. We're seeing solid increases there both in emerging markets like India and even in the more established markets like Korea. Building our presence in the region with both physicals in the product is paying off. So with another quarter of favorability behind us, we are optimistic. However, we also still believe the recovery is fragile. It seems everyday, we see and we hear mixed signals. And for us, for our customers it does impact their confidence. I said frequently last year that people were eating bad news for breakfast, everyday from the paper and from the TV. And I think we still have a bit of the same thing going on now, only with mixed signals. So the uncertainty remains, but we would say we're moving in a positive direction. So we'll stay focused on the approach that's been successful for us: Vigilance on costs, flexibility in reaching for opportunities, Snap-on value creation driving improvement and investment in the decisive initiatives for growth. 
Now for some highlights in each of the operating groups. Commercial Industrial or C&I. Sales were up 22% from last year with double-digit increases in all of the units. The operating margin was 9.9%, also up substantially. Volume and ongoing operational improvements did the trick in that area. The Industrial division, especially in the U.S. showed the strongest gains, making advances in critical industries, taking the Snap-on brand out of the garage, like we said before. For example, our position in the Aerospace segment, it continues to strengthen. We're partnering with OEM aircraft manufacturers as well as tech schools to develop and support Snap-on specific aviation certification programs. It's a great way to establish an early relationship with students who are future technicians, and for us, it's an effective path in creating a lifelong professional customer. And we continue to move forward with that type of partnership approach in a number of industries like wind, oil and gas, and in fact, auto repair. 
Let's go back to the Aerospace segment. This is an area where Snap-on is uniquely positioned. The mission-critical nature of the work is obvious. The quality that Snap-on brand is required and valued and the potential for growth is abundant for us. While the industry has been depressed, there are some signs of recovery. Just this week, at the Farnborough International Airshow, there's been a lot of confidence, and aircraft orders were surprisingly strong. Snap-on's asset show, displaying a revolutionary tool control innovations, and they've been a big hit. So we like our position as the aerospace sector recovers. 
We're also reaching new critical industries and tailoring our lineup to support that effort. I spoke to you last quarter of the broadened product line we've been introducing for large tool application in areas and segments like mining and natural resources. In the second quarter, we saw more progress with those customers due to that expanded offering and a significant industrial sales growth is evidence of that success. Talk about innovation, often at Snap-on.
Our leadership in innovation and design, our focus on safety is also evident with the Bahco brand. Last year, the Bahco handsaw system won the prestigious red dot award for European design excellence, and this year, the recognition continued with the product being named the winner of the Design S award for ergonomics. That system provides ergonomically superior handles in different sizes for left- and right-handed users with 10 different interchangeable blades for cutting a variety of materials, and it offers a patented locking system. 
Innovation driven by customer connection helping SNA Europe sell even in a downturn, helping Bahco maintain a world-class brand. And Asia-Pacific, as I said, is continuing its upward trends. Sales were again up strongly, with gains in India, China, Philippines and Korea leading the way. We've been working hard over several years in that region to establish our physical capabilities. More salesmen more factory capacity, more Asianized product, and it's been paying a lot. You can see it in our numbers. You can see it in the success of our new products. A great example is the new Bahco Asianized band saw. It's been a runaway seller. So much so that we outstripped our recently established capacity, and we're acting right now to double down on Kunshan saw capacity. So Asia's a success.
Moving to the Tools Group. Volumes increased 7.8% in the quarter, about $19 million from last year with the U.S. posting a 9% gain. Operating income was up $7.5 million to $33 million or 12.5% of sales. For some time, one of our key initiatives has been to strengthen the franchisee network. I think we have clear evidence that those efforts continue to pay off. In the second quarter, our sales in the U.S. returned to 2008 pre-recession levels. Now I think it's widely agreed that the overall economy hasn't returned to the same level as two years ago, so reaching that benchmark is encouraging for us. 
I've spoken in the past about our franchisee stimulus programs, aimed at supporting the network. It's been a key to our sales return, and we believe that right now, our franchisees are in better shape. Sales strong, profits robust, cash improved, so the stimulus is working and the network is stronger. I already mentioned big-ticket items in the favorable results. Well those are the products that often require financing, and in that space, Snap-on Credit is a huge advantage. It's a core contributor to the power of our franchise network. The credit company's transition into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Snap-on started about a  year ago, and it's progressing well. And in the second quarter, it's now turned profitable, as we said it would in several prior calls. At the end of the day though, in our business, you have to have great products to sell, and we use our frequent touches with the end customer to create just that. Innovation and new products are often born out of technology advances. But sometimes, it's less complicated. It comes from just knowing your customers' problems. For example, in using the 3,600 franchisees in talking and visiting with customers with automotive technicians, we found that all-in-one wire stripper, crimper and cutter pliers were designed primarily for electricians. They tend to spend more time stripping wires, and you can imagine, they don't have the same space challenges as an auto tech. So with that insight, our engineers went to work and developed a new compact cutter and stripper tool, designed specifically for tight auto application. It's been a huge hit. Not a big-ticket breakthrough product that transforms a company, but thousands were sold. And it's a great example of using customer connection to our advantage, extending Snap-on's tradition of innovation, and that tradition echoes favorably up and down the product line and in and out of garages all over this country and all over the world. 
Now, to Repair Systems & Information or the RS&I Group. This was the group that was formed out of our recent reorganization, lining each new segment up with the primary customer base: The Tools Group, focused on auto technician; C&I, focused on professionals and critical industries in emerging markets; and RS&I, serving vehicle repair shop owners and managers. We're now organized to capture growth in each of these broad and important customer segments. Back to RS&I, overall volumes increased 4.7%, driven by the Equipment division activity, driven by the Equipment division's increases that I mentioned before. It also had some solid improvements at EQS, our Facilitation and Essential Tools business. Those gains in those areas helped to offset Snap-on Business Solutions or SBS, where activity continues to be down related to consolidation in the overall OEM dealer space. Now SBS is working to help itself. It's working to create some offsets of its own by expanding with existing customers, including internationally and with badges that haven't been impacted by the dealership disruption. They're also working hard to grow at near-adjacent markets such as power sport, agricultural and construction. 
Speaking of OEMs and their dealers, we're seeing some improvement in that area in the OEM manufacturers' willingness to commit to Essential Tools, and the dealers themselves are starting to make purchases. So all of this certainly drove some of RS&I's improvement, and the RS&I Group is growing elsewhere. We saw some solid sales increases related to our expansion in heavy truck and fleet markets. If you think about it, that's a natural fit for us. And we've been making investments in product, both diagnostics and repair information, and we're starting to get traction. So that summarizes the markets. And I think it provides you some perspective on our advances in the quarter. So now I'll turn from an operating perspective. So now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a review of the financial results in detail. Aldo?"

Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Sales in the second quarter of $648 million increased to 9.8% from second quarter 2009 levels. The primary drivers behind the $58 million year-over-year sales increase includes hi",2161,"Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Sales in the second quarter of $648 million increased to 9.8% from second quarter 2009 levels. The primary drivers behind the $58 million year-over-year sales increase includes higher sales in critical industries, increased sales in emerging markets, higher equipment sales and increased sales to franchisees in the U.S. and the U.K. Company also saw steady improvement in its European-based businesses. 
Consolidated gross profit of $303.8 million in the quarter increased $49.8 million year-over-year, while the gross margin improved by 380 basis points. These increases were largely due to the higher sales volumes and favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of the increasing levels of production. Savings from rapid continuous improvement or RCI, initiatives and benefits from previous restructuring actions contributed about $7 million of gross profit improvement. Foreign currency, primarily transaction effects, contributed $5 million and lower year-over-year restructuring costs contributed an additional $3 million of gross profit improvement. 
As a result of these factors, consolidated gross margin improved to 46.9% in the quarter, as compared to 43.1% last year. Operating expenses in the quarter increased $25 million from 2009 levels. This was primarily due to higher volume-related expenses and $14.9 million of increased performance-based incentive compensation expense as a result of improved year-over-year operating performance and increased participation in the company's stock purchase programs. 
In addition, we incurred $3.1 million of higher pension expense, largely due to lower-than-projected asset returns in previous years related to the U.S. pension plan. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by $2.5 million of benefits from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction initiatives and $2.5 million of lower restructuring costs. 
As a percent of sales, operating expenses were 34.7% in the second quarter of 2010 as compared to 34% last year. Restructuring costs in the second quarter totaled $3.1 million as compared to $8.6 million last year. Operating earnings of $79 million before Financial Services improved 47% over prior year and a 9.8% sales increase. Financial Services operating earnings of $1.7 million in the quarter improved sequentially from a $1.7 million loss in the first quarter of 2010 and also compares favorably with the $3.8 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2009 and a $5.3 million loss in the third quarter of 2009. 
As previously discussed, and as expected, operating income from Financial Services, which is before interest expense, is consistently improving as the unbooked finance portfolio grows. Since the termination of the Financial Services joint venture with CIT in July of last year, our gross unbooked  finance portfolio has grown over $450 million to $577 million. Year-to-date, this portfolio has grown about $180 million. 
Turning to interest expense, higher average debt levels, primarily related to the growth in our unbooked finance portfolio increased interest expense by $1.6 million year-over-year. The second quarter effective income tax rates were 31.2% in 2010 and 31.9% in 2009. The improved and lower-than-previously-communicated effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2010 primarily benefited from the favorable settlement of the tax audit. The second quarter 2009 rate benefited primarily from the realization of a tax benefit in a foreign jurisdiction. 
Finally, net earnings of $45.3 million or $0.78 per diluted share increased from $37.4 million or $0.65 per share last year, despite $11 million or $0.19 per share of lower year-over-year net earnings from Financial Services. 
Let's now turn to our segment results. Beginning with the C&I group on Slide 7, segment sales of $259 million improved 22% from prior-year levels. The year-over-year sales increase was driven by higher sales across all operating units, with particularly strong increases in those businesses serving customers in critical industries and emerging markets. Again this quarter, sales increases were realized in our European-based Tools business. While we still face headwinds in this region, we are encouraged that the higher year-over-year sales in the first half of the year may be evidence of some continuing stabilization in the European markets, despite the headlines have laid regarding financial market volatility in that region. 
Gross profit in the C&I segment of $93 million increased $27 million or 41.6% from 2009 levels, reflecting the 22% sales increase and $5.2 million of savings from RCI, restructuring and other cost-reduction initiatives. The year-over-year gross profit comparison also benefited from favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increasing production levels. You may recall that last year, we incurred substantial costs to carry excess manufacturing capacity, primarily in Europe, as a result of lower production levels and inventory reduction efforts. 
For the current quarter, gross margin of 35.8% improved 500 basis points from 30.8% last year. Operating expenses in the quarter of $67 million were up slightly year-over-year as higher volume-related and other expenses were partially offset by $1.4 million of lower restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the C&I segment improved from 1.1% in the second quarter of last year to 9.9% this year.
Turning now to Slide 8. On a worldwide basis, second quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group increased 9% from 2009 levels. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 7.8%, including a 9.3% increase in the United States. Van count in the U.S. at end of the second quarter increased slightly compared to prior-year levels. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $116 million increased $14.4 million over the prior year. This increase primarily reflects contributions from higher sales and benefits from favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increasing U.S. production levels and $4.9 million of favorable currency effects. In the quarter, gross margin improved to 43.7%, an increase of 200 basis points over 41.7% last year. Operating expenses of $83 million in the quarter increased $6.9 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 12.5% in the quarter for the Snap-on Tools Group improved 200 basis points from 10.5% last year.
Let's now turn to Slide 9, and the segment we now refer to as Repair Systems & Information or RS&I. As previously communicated, the RS&I segment and its operations are aligned and focused on better serving customers in the worldwide vehicle service and repair marketplace, including owners and managers of independent and OEM dealership service and repair shops. In addition to equipment products and equipment repair services, the RS&I segment includes the business operations as a former Diagnostics & Information Group. Second quarter sales of $206 million in the RS&I segment were up 4% from prior year levels. Excluding currency, organic sales were up 4.7%, primarily due to higher sales of equipment and increased essential tool and facilitation program sales, partially offset by anticipated lower electronic parts catalog sales in North America, the latter a result of OEM dealership consolidations. Gross profit of $96 million in the quarter increased $8.2 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to contributions from the higher sales, $1.6 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives and $1.1 million of lower restructuring costs. Gross margin in the quarter improved to 46.5%, an increase of 230 basis points over 44.2% last year. Operating expenses of $56 million, while up $1.1 million from 2009 levels, improved 50 basis points as a percent of sales. Higher compensation, volume-related and product development expenses were partially offset by $1.7 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives as well as $1 million of lower bad debt expense. Operating earnings of $40 million in the RS&I group for the quarter increased $7.1 million or 21.6% on a $7.9 million or 4% sales increase. The favorable incremental operating margin is primarily due to $3.3 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives and $1.8 million of lower year-over-year restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the RS&I group of 19.4% improved 280 basis points from 16.6% last year. 
Turning to Slide 10. The $1.7 million of Financial Services earnings in the second quarter compares favorably to a loss of $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2010 and a loss of $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Financial Services earnings in the second quarter of 2009 prior to the termination of the joint venture with CIT were $16.6 million. As you know, since July 16 of last year, we are no longer selling loan contracts to CIT and recording gains on sale. Rather, we are building overtime and on-balance sheet interest yielding portfolio. As this portfolio grows, so will our Financial Services operating earnings. 
Moving to Slide 11, as of the second quarter end, our balance sheet includes $451 million in gross financing receivables from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation and $126 million in gross financing receivables from our international finance subsidiaries, for a total financing portfolio of $577 million. In the United States, $384 million of the portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since the termination of the joint venture, Snap-on Credit continues to manage the run-off portfolio of contracts owned by CIT, which totaled $384 million at quarter end, which is down approximately $100 million from first quarter end. 
For the full year 2010, we continue to expect that the unbooked financing portfolio will grow by approximately $300 million. This suggests additional growth in the Snap-on Credit U.S. portfolio of about $110 million to $120 million over the remaining six months of this year. The net cash requirements of our international finance portfolios are substantially self-funding. Portfolio loss and delinquency trends continue to be in line with our expectations and have improved sequentially compared to Q1.
Turning to Slide 12. Consolidated operating cash flow for the quarter was $55.5 million. At the end of the quarter, our cash position of $431 million was down from approximately $472 million at first quarter end. This is driven by the net increase in finance receivables of $73 million, primarily due to the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit. In the quarter, capital spending of $6.6 million was down from $19.5 million spent last year, primarily due to last year's construction of a new R&D facility and headquarters for our Automotive Parts and Service Information business in Richfield, Ohio. 
For the full year 2010, we expect capital expenditures will be approximately $50 million. As seen on Slide 13, trade and other receivables decreased $6.9 million from 2009 year end. Excluding $18.6 million of currency translation impacts, trade and other receivables increased $11.7 million, primarily due to higher sales. Day sales outstanding for trade and other receivables of 59 days improved from 63 days at 2009 year end. Inventories at the end of the quarter increased $21.8 million from 2009 year end. Excluding $14.4 million of currency translation impacts, inventories increased $36.2 million, primarily due to higher production levels as a result of increased customer demand. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns increased to 4.4 turns as compared to 4.1 turns in 2009 year end. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $493 million. Our net debt to capital ratio of 28.3% compares to 22.2% at 2009 year end. We exclude approximately $108 million of cash currently withheld related to the previously disclosed dispute with CIT. Our net debt to capital ratio as of the end of the second quarter would have been 32.5%. 
In addition to $431 million of cash, we continue to maintain a $500-million revolving credit facility that does not expire until August 2012. We also have another $20 million of committed bank lines, and at quarter end, the full $520 million of borrowing capacity was available. In addition to these facilities, our current A2/P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper market should we choose to do so. At quarter end, no commercial paper was outstanding. Our liquidity position and access to credit continues to remain strong. This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. But before turning the call back to Nick, I'd like to review our outlook for the balance of 2010.
For the full year, we presently expect to incur approximately $15 million of restructuring cost, somewhat less than the previously communicated $18 million to $22 million. This reflects the more likely calendarization of program actions to improve the company's fixed cost structure. We also anticipate continuing our planned strategic investments, including expansion in emerging markets. And as I've mentioned earlier, for the full year 2010, we presently expect that capital expenditures will be approximately $50 million. 
With respect to pension, our current expectation is that 2010 full year pension expense will be $16 million higher than last year. This is down from the previously communicated estimate of $20 million due to changes in actuarial assumptions. Finally, as a result of the favorable settlement of certain tax audit in the quarter, the anticipated effective income tax rate for full year 2010 is now expected to approximate 33.7%. 
Before opening the call for questions, Nick would like to provide some final thoughts. Nick?"

So to wrap up, we're encouraged by the quarter's results; the second straight upward movement and perhaps the beginning of another trend, sales up almost 10%, profits up 47% versus last year, good sequential progression versus the first quarter. The OI margin at 12.2% is fairly robust. Our Snap-on value creation processes keep generating gain. In the quarter, we saw all the elements of that playbook work; safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and RCI. And you can see it in the numbers. 
We've said consistently that throughout the downturn, we would keep investing in the key areas, which we believe would be decisive in capturing growth going forward. And we said, as a result, we would take advantage of the recovery as it occurs. Well, the second quarter is a testimony to the success of that approach. The van network is robust and back to 2008 levels. Share is growing in the garage. Our presence in critical industries is expanding and we are building a significant position in emerging markets. 
So looking forward, we're optimistic, although, cautiously so. We see the world leaning favorably in North America, mixed but positive in Europe and clearly growing in Asia. To be sure, the recovery is fragile, and we are going into the third quarter, which is always difficult to predict because of the vacation period. But we now have two positive periods. So we're optimistic. We're not certain what the immediate macroeconomics will hold, but we believe in the special strength of our markets, making work easier for serious professionals performing critical tasks is valued in any situation. And with Snap-on value creation in our strategic investments, we continue to believe that we're very well positioned, well positioned to take advantage of any recovery in whatever shape over whatever timetable it occurs. 
I want to finish just by recognizing our franchisees and our associates. I know many of you are on the call. The successes in the quarter were only possible because of your efforts, your capability and your commitment. You have my congratulations, and you have my thanks.

The other place, I didn't mention RS&I before. Some elements of RS&I, the new Repair Systems & Information Group, Mitchell 1 and Diagnostics are at 2008 levels, but SBS is down because of the consolidation of the dealers, the OEM dealers in the United States.

And that business is, like I said, it's up to 2008 levels and people talk about restocking. We haven't seen any restocking there at all. So in fact, we like the cash position of our vans in that business. So I think we are very encouraged by the 9%, 10% growth in that channel itself. Now the equipment, the big ticket items in there, it's kind of bifurcated. The smaller big ticket items, that is diagnostics and tool storage, are starting to get back to 2008 levels, which we like because this is what we said all along. And if you look at -- I think we had the best quarter since 2008 in that business this quarter. If you look at the equipment, the other piece of the big ticket items, we are encouraged in North America. But we're still below 2008 levels, about low double digits. Europe, though, in equipment, was a big, big strength for us. Europe has gotten back close to 2008 levels in the big ticket items. And that was driven, I didn't talk about this in my remark, by an extraordinary new product, which we launched in Europe, the PRISM aligner. This is an aligner which allows you to package alignment into smaller base. And as you probably configure that the base, the garages in Europe are somewhat more compact, so the value of that aligner breaking on that market has given us some pretty good traction. So we feel pretty good about that situation. So I think those are a couple of places. The other places in the Industrial group, the businesses in critical industries like natural resources and aerospace are up in some pretty -- I don't want to give you any numbers on this because we don't give the numbers out, but they're up very strong and much, much higher than our average. We feel pretty good about that. And as you know, Industrial is not a restocking situation. That's a direct sales model, so restocking doesn't have much to do with that. Now we do have in our Industrial business a smaller group, a smaller piece of the business, which is we sell through distributors. You may remember this in the United States. It's a very small piece of the business. And there could be restocking there, but that business was up over 50% in the quarter. So we feel pretty robust about that situation. The whole idea of recognizing that when we roll the Snap-on brand out of the garage, the customers are open to that idea. They're open in that idea. So it seems to be working."

One is the fact that we know that there are a number of customers who buy Snap-on tools for their workplace. And then at home, they use another brand, let's say, a mid-tier brand. So we can sell Blue-Point. We've launched the mid-tier brand to sell to them. Also, as much as we work to make customers for life with educational institutions and we sell Snap-on brand to them, some new technicians simply don't think they can afford Snap-on. They buy an alternate brand, so they can afford Snap-on. We sell a Blue-Point to them. So there's opportunity to grow in that mid-tier. Secondly, we call on about 800,000 technicians. In the United States, there are 1.3 million. Fully-enabled, our vans call on about 800,000, 850,000 technicians. There are 1.3 million. The reason why we don't call on those others 400,000, 500,000 is because they're lower volume, and our technicians drive by them because they don't want to spend time with them. And that's a productivity issue, and none of our technicians are vans driven, but that's a productivity issue. So productivity on the van will allow us to take our existing framework, our existing network and reach out to a big portion of that $1.3 million. Now it's not a one-for-one replacement, but it's a real opportunity for us. That's why we're launching rapid continuous improvement in the vans. That's what we're doing this year. It's one of our big initiatives, and I see those two things as ways to grow."

And then we'd expect our operating margins on an overall basis to be mid-teens. And the way that lays out with the new segments is that the RS&I, I believe, it's at 18, 19 now. It will be over the 20-mark some place. And the Tools Group and Commercial and Industrial would start to approach the mid-teens to be slightly below the average. And that's we're we see it.

And we now think of ourselves as something broader, that is, a company that provides, makes work easier, productivity solutions for serious professionals, who are performing critical tasks and critical industries like aerospace and oil and gas. And that's a much wider space. And any acquisition, an acquisition that would give us further presence in that broader space with customers, we would be interested in doing. So that's where we'd invest our cash because we believe that concept is a valuable concept. And we believe with Snap-on value creation, we can drive profitability through that.

In all of those categories, I think just let me restate just to be clear is that for diagnostics and tool storage, primarily sold through the van channel, Q2 was the best quarter we've seen since Q2 2008. And that was the best quarter in 2008. So we had a gangbuster this quarter in terms of big ticket items. And actually, if you remember, we said this is exactly how we understood the business. We said that people are in garages. They were buying wrenches, and they kept buying wrenches due to downturn. And that was it. It was big ticket that was off because people thought that they charged, their uncertainty, the idea of not wanting to invest in those big ticket items took them away. Well, we're back to 2008. And lo and behold, the vehicle of restoration has been the rise in the big ticket items. That's exactly what we have been, I think, thinking about and trying to conjure in these calls for a long time. And so that's really what happened. And we did have a good quarter in the first quarter. It was a good quarter, but this quarter was up double digits. And then in terms of equipment, as I said, we're still not back to 2008. We're still coming off the floor and that makes sense, though, Gary, if you think about it. Diagnostics is the best. The most expensive is like an $8,000 purchase. Tool storage can be $5,000 to $10,000. But when you're talking about some of that under-car equipment, it can be up $20,000, and it's much more of a capital type equipment. And so, therefore, the whole idea of the uncertainty around the recession becomes more dampening in that area, and that's what we're seeing. So we are seeing progress, but it just isn't as fast. It hasn't snapped back to the full 2008 levels. In fact, it went deeper than diagnostics and tool storage. The one thing I did say, though, is that what we are really pleased with is the effect of that new PRISM product in Europe, which really gave us some boost in equipment."

I mean, we had some absorption in this period, and we had some cost savings. But still, I feel pretty good about maintaining the gross margin. What you got to remember, though, is is that, I think every body should remember is, we've had a couple of good quarters. We're going into the third quarter, and I think that the third quarter for us is highly unpredictable, more difficult to predict because we have European vacations, the franchisees tend to relax a little bit, they go to the Maryland shore, something like that, whatever they do. And so historically, our third quarter has had more variance than other quarters. So we think of our year as one, two, three and four in terms of trying to model it out.

And we say, ""What do you need?"" And we're not sure. Sometimes we provide them things we never thought was part of our org because we put it in a kit like a flashlight or something or generators and things like that. We sell it, we provide it in package with Snap-on tools. So that's an example of us struggling. We try to identify that. Equally, we find customers that are added, I would say, three years ago. I wouldn't have said wind would've been a customer for us, and now there is some customer there. So it's very difficult to define that. I can just say that, boy, it seems to us based on the growth up to -- we were getting good growth, if you remember, all the way through the first quarter of 2009 in this business. We were expanding. Then we took downtick, growth faster than anybody else was talking about. And we should because we're rolling a Snap-on brand out of the garage. It was a new thing.

But it will take a little bit of time for some of the tale of the old CIT portfolio to come across. So I've been saying as I meet with people that I think we'll see our future state of like a $750-million U.S. portfolio in and around, somewhere around 2012, perhaps somewhere in that time frame. But our future state that we envision for this it's tending to follow the model. We have a portfolio that's yielding at expected rates. We're fortunate in that. The bad debt performance and delinquencies are still on plan and on target and actually have slightly improved. We're very pleased with that. And the originations, which underlie the volume, tend to track more or less with the Tools Group. I think it reflects the actions in the Tools Group. That's what it's there for. So pretty much as the Tools Group volume grows, we expect that this renewal of contracts and add-ons, as we call them, will continue to prosper. So at the endgame, we expect that this has the capability, even after interest expense is allocated, to create a portfolio that will generate about a 25% return on financial income.

303646,114307534,81228,"Snap-on Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2010",2010-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Snap-on Incorporated","Executives","Thanks Leslie. Good morning, everyone. Well, Snap-on had another quarter of improved year-over-year performance. And on top of that, we saw some favorable market signals so it's very encouraging. We believe there's now clear evidence of a building Snap-on",2156,"Thanks Leslie. Good morning, everyone. Well, Snap-on had another quarter of improved year-over-year performance. And on top of that, we saw some favorable market signals so it's very encouraging. We believe there's now clear evidence of a building Snap-on strength in the recovery market. Overall, our organic sales were up 13.4%. Solid by any measure. And that's after being up 9.5% the second quarter and 4% in the first quarter. Needless to say, we like that trend.
Operating income rose 72% from last year, with Financial Services contributing profitability as projected. Improving its performance as it springs the loan portfolio on the Snap-on books. The operating company OI, without Financial Services increased by a strong 46%. So again, overall we're encouraged by the strength of the quarter. And that result was in the face of an unfavorable swing in LIFO.
We would say our run ways for growth our clearing and our Snap-on value creation processes around safety, quality, customer connection, innovation Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI, they continue to drive progress.
So having said that, let me give you a bit of color and my perspective on the trends we see. With respect to the economic environment and the impacts on our markets, there's some nice positives. It was our third straight quarter of increasing year-over-year gain. So that alone, indicates a better environment. And is also a building momentum in some of our most strategically important areas. In our Core Auto Repair business, in emerging markets and critical industries. All areas where we see clear long-term run way.
Now the third quarter is seasonally our most challenging. It can be quite variable. So it's sometimes difficult to draw extended conclusions from the results. But having said that, Snap-on's quarter was robust, completely overcoming the typical seasonal low.
We often talk about big-ticket items, higher-priced products that either have longer payback like diagnostics or undercar equipment, or a more discretionary like tool-storage units. Activity here is usually a barometer of our customers' overall financial health, and of their confidence. You'll recall that during the downturn last year, we saw quite a bit of variation from period-to-period in big-ticket purchase. But with these results, we've now put together three quarters in a row of year-over-year increases in all three big-ticket categories. They're all back now to pre-downturn levels.
In the Tools group, both diagnostics and tool-storage units showed significant gains. A real help in this was our new diagnostics handheld unit called The Verdict. It was launched at our annual franchise e-conference in August and I got great reviews. It's a fully functional unit that we believe set the new industry standard with features like a detachable wireless touch screen display, remote use from anywhere in the garage, WiFi internet capability, and access to Snap-on's unique repair information database.
The Verdict is clearly an innovation. It provides real productivity technicians and as you expect, reception has been very strong.
Beyond the vans our Equipment division, part of the repair systems and information or RS&I group, showed strong year-over-year gains. In particular, and it's big-ticket undercar product, that's what equipment sells. It achieved gains in both North America and Europe, well ahead of our company's overall sales increase. In fact, equipment lines were even slightly ahead of the second quarter, a third quarter sequential increase is very rare for this business, because of a large presence in Europe and the associated seasonality, usually make July through September a tough period. So this quarter's increase, sequential increase in equipment sales was a big win.
From a geographical standpoint, there hasn't been much change in their regional market landscape. North America showed gains that were a bit better than those recorded worldwide. Europe's recovery is generally a little weaker. We were, however, up double digits, though the story there continues to vary region by region. In the South, especially Spain, there still hasn't been much improvement. Spain is important for us because that's in Europe. Our European-based Hand Tools business has an exceptionally strong presence.
On the other hand, the North is decisively more positive. Sales and markets like Germany,Sweden and Finland all grew strongly. So Europe is still mixed, but for us, up double digits overall.
With respect to emerging markets, places were we've made investments and our focus on expansion like Eastern Europe, we saw a strong growth in Russia, again in the quarter, up nearly 50%. And Asia-Pacific continued a steep growth curve, significantly higher than our overall increase with India and China both setting the pace. China continues to sell out all the vans so long as they can produce, and the Indian sales team is now gaining real traction in the undercar equipment market.
So that's some perspective on the global environment, a varied landscape but increasing almost everywhere. Now for some highlights on the operating segments. Commercial Industrial or C&I saw volumes up around about $45 million. That's more than a 21% increase. Operating earnings rose $21 million with those increased volumes and strong RCI results driving in the improvement. RCI results in the quarter are a dramatic testimony to the ongoing power of our Snap-on value creation processes. They've contributed greatly to our progress so far, and we're confident there's still much more opportunity to go.
We've often spoke about the runway in critical industries, where the tap absolutely need to be accomplished without fail. While recently, we had graphic evidence of such a situation, many watched the dramatic rescue of the minors in Chile as it was broadcast around the globe. It was a great story. And you could clearly see, SNA Europe's Bahco-branded tools on the scene, assisting in the, rescue, accomplishing the critical mission of the quarter. 
So our performance, but while -- that's an interesting sidebar. I think I'd like to talk about our performance in the Industrial business. One of the real positives for the company this past quarter. Near-record sales, trailing only the fourth quarter of 2008 volumes, a really strong quarter. Our Industrial business was up 34% and that gain was across the globe.
And that was without much restocking. We believe that, that is evidence of our success in moving the Snap-on brand out of the vehicle garage and into critical industries everywhere. Look it's clear, that overall economic activities is not at precrisis levels, but we still achieved a near-record quarter in the space. It shows we are making significant gain in this strategic area.
I've also mentioned in the past that we're expanding our product offering, aimed specifically at critical industries. Like power generation, mining and aerospace. It's paying off. Along those lines, innovation's played a big part of Snap-on history, and that tradition continues today. Just this past quarter, we launched our new automated tool control or ATC tool-storage product, aimed squarely at the aerospace sector. We've taken our sophisticated digital imaging technology, which is a huge competitive advantage for us in car aligners, and transformed tool-storage boxes into high-tech assets.
Paired with the keyless entry system that laser technology scans the tool drawer. It knows who checked out and who returned every tool, every time. It's important to know where your tools are when you're working on jet engines. ATC accomplishes that task like no other product, and it's a great system, and we started to see our first sales in the quarter. 
The ATC technology is only one example of leveraging Snap-on's breath and depth to drive the company's presence in critical industries. We're collaborating widely across business operations to maximize opportunities by applying our existing advantages in one sector, to develop opportunities and others.
Critical Industries for critical industries such as power generation and aerospace, military and mining and many others, we're well positioned to modify our core product and technologies to meet the unique requirement. The third quarter is more evidence that it's working.
A good portion of our effort in emerging markets gets reflected in C&I. So I'll talk about that now. I touched on the strong increases earlier. And that growth only comes with expanded physicals, presence and products. And we're aggressively building both in those markets. 
In Asia, we're increasing manufacturing capabilities both in Kunsha and in Zhoushan, where our Wanda acquisition is based. And we recently launched our Asian handheld diagnostics unit, it's our first, specifically tailored for the region and there's more in the pipeline. In Eastern Europe, last year, we built the plants in Belarus. 
Just this past month, we have the official inauguration, and included government dignitaries in broad TV coverage. It was great exposure for the innovative technologies we're bringing to the region. And it's just the type of presence and recognition that helps in building a distribution network creating a foothold and in generating the strong sales increased we've seen in this quarter in Eastern Europe.
That's C&I. Let's move to the Tools group. We've seen a return to pre-downturn sales level. Overall volume is up nearly 11%, in the U.S., better at nearly 13%. OI margin is same as last year after adjusting for a $4 million negative LIFO swing. 
These results reflect our balanced approach to maintain the strength of our powerful franchise system. We've invested significantly in training and product support to keep our network robust. In that way, in August, we held our annual Snap-on franchisee's conference. It's annual, but this one was special. It served as the highlight of our 90th anniversary celebration. We've been in business for nine decades, and it was a significant success. Record attendance, more product, more training seminars and a business and profit center aimed specifically at helping our franchisees improve their business efficiencies. It was really popular.
The mood in the conference was very positive, I can tell you. The franchisees are upbeat about their prospect. They enthusiastically embraced Snap-on's coherent focus on making work easier for professionals who perform critical tasks. And because they know our whole organization is behind that mission across the globe in all of our division. They believe strongly in their future with our company.
We've spoken in the past about the Snap-on stimulus program. Well the best stimulus we can provide is great product. So we're encouraged that we were recently recognized for just that. Snap-on was named the overall best brand in six categories of tools by Frost & Sullivan in their 2010 Survey of Technicians. Snap-on carry the number one ranking by wide margins. 
For example, in hand tools, 70% of the technicians preferred the Snap-on brand. The nearest competitor had an 8% share. In diagnostics, the winning margin was 46% to 9%, and the numbers for tool storage were 62% Snap-on, the highest other brand, 8%. Our products were also recognized in the quarter by professional tool and equipment news. The Snap-on low-profile ratchet in the Quadriga tire changer we're both recognized by that publication for outstanding innovations in vehicle repair. Now this award is special, because it was based on the opinion of professional users. The people that gained productivity by actually using Snap-on. So that says a lot.
I already mentioned the recovery in big-ticket items. Many of those sales are through our vans on credit. And that credit has been available without disruption throughout the integration of Snap-on Credit. Our Financial Service business is performing as we predicted, becoming increasingly profitable as the loan portfolio moves onto our books. And that successful integration of Snap-on Credit has had a significant hand in supporting the sales growth.
Now to some discussion of the RS&I group. Sales up about 10% or $19 million excluding currency. OI up 11.2%. I already mentioned the Equipment division's big-ticket sales gains in both in both North America and Europe. The strong increases of equipment are a big part of our RS&I progress. Remember that the RS&I portfolio is where we have our exposure to the North American OEMs, and their contraction of their dealerships. So Snap-on Business Solutions does continue to be impacted by that disruption. 
We did however, in the quarter, achieved more offsets with increasing activity and OEM essential tools and diagnostics programs. We're also gaining in heavy duty diagnostics products, supplying to truck-shop owners in greater volumes than ever before. And you'll probably remember that RS&I focuses on vehicle shop repair owners and managers. We're expanding in that space and you can see it in this group's numbers.
Our diagnostics and Mitchell 1 division is already strong and independent repair shops continue to better their positions. In addition to the successful new Verdict handheld I mentioned earlier, Mitchell1 1 released a new version of a shock management software, with significant success. We've made investments in this area and it's paying off.
Well, that gives you a little color on the quarter. Significant sales increases and encouraging profitability, strengthening strategic position and ample runways for further growth.
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for the financial review."

Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales for the third quarter of $653 million increased 12.3% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, sales increased 13.4%. As Nick mentioned, the primary drivers behin",1816,"Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales for the third quarter of $653 million increased 12.3% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, sales increased 13.4%. As Nick mentioned, the primary drivers behind the $71 million year-over-year sales increased, include significantly higher sales to customers in credit critical industry than emerging markets, as well as double-digit increases in worldwide equipment and sales to franchisees in the United States.
Consolidated gross profit of $301 million increased $40.7 million year-over-year, driven by higher sales, improved manufacturing utilization, and savings from ongoing Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI initiatives and restructuring actions.
Foreign currency benefited gross profit  by $2.7 million, while lower year-over-year restructuring cost contributed another $2 million. The overall benefits from improved manufacturing utilization, RCI, currency and lower restructuring, were partially offset by $4.1 million of higher year-over-year LIFO-related inventory expense.
As a result of these factors, consolidated gross margin improved 130 basis points to 46.1% as compared to 44.8% last year. Operating expenses in the quarter increased $15.9 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. Including higher cost as a result of increased participation at our 2010 Annual Franchisee Conference.
Year-over-year, operating expenses also included $4.1 million of higher U.S. pension expense, largely due to lower the projected asset returns in previous years.
These increases were partially offset by lower bad debt expense, favorable currency translation and savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. As a percent of sales, operating expenses of 34% in the quarter improved 150 basis points from 35.5% last year.
Operating earnings of $78.8 million before financial services improved $24.8 million, which is a 45.9% year-over-year increase on 12.3% of higher sales.
Including financial services, operating earnings increased $35.1 million or 72.1% over 2009 levels.  As a percentage of total revenues, operating earnings increased 420 basis points from 8.3% last year to 12.5% this year.
Financial Services operating earnings of $5 million in the quarter improved $10.3 million from the third quarter 2009 loss of $5.3 million. On a sequential basis, Financial Services operating earnings improved $3.3 million from second quarter 2010 levels. As expected, operating income from Financial Services, which is before interest expense, continues to improve as the on-book finance portfolio grows.
The third quarter effective income tax rates were 34.4% in 2010 and 29.3% last year. The lower rate in 2009 reflects the favorable resolution of certain tax matters, as well as the favorable mix of foreign earnings.
Finally, third quarter net earnings of $46.5 million increased $21.1 million or 83% from the $25.4 million earned last year.
Let's now turn to our segment results. Beginning with the Commercial and Industrial or C&I group on Slide 7, segment sales of $261 million improved 19.5% from prior year levels. Excluding the impact of currency translation, organic sales increased 21.2%. The year-over-year sales increase was again driven by higher sales across all operating units, with particularly strong increases in those businesses serving customers in critical industries and emerging markets.
Gross profit in the C&I segment of $96.2 million increased $25.9 million or 36.8% from 2009 levels. This increase is primarily due to higher sales and $3.5 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. The gross profit comparison also benefited from improved manufacturing utilization, primarily in Europe, as a result of increasing production levels. For the quarter, gross margin of 36.8% improved 460 basis points from 32.2% last year. Operating expenses in the quarter of $65.6 million increased $4.8 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses and increased restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses improved by 280 basis points year-over-year.
Operating margin in the C&I segment of 11.7% in the third quarter of 2010 improved 740 basis points from 4.3% last year. Turning now to Slide 8. On a worldwide basis, third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $259 million increased 10.8% from 2009 levels, including a 12.8% increase in United States. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $108 million in the quarter increased $3.4 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher sales and favorable currency effects. The year-over-year gross profit comparison was also impacted by higher costs associated with increased franchisee product-related programs and by $4.1 million of higher LIFO-related expense.
LIFO-related expense was $600,000 in the third quarter of 2010. Last year, as a result of lower production and inventory reduction efforts, the LIFO-related benefit was $3.5 million.
As a percentage of sales, gross margin in the quarter was 41.6% as compared to 44.7% last year.  Third quarter operating expenses of $79.5 million in the Snap-on Tools Group increased $4.7 million from 2009. This is primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses, as a result of increased participation at this year's Annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, which focused primarily on the development and profitability of the franchise network. In the quarter, we also incurred higher cost associated with the development of a new and expanded product catalog that was deferred from 2009 to 2010.
We view this increased cost as longer-term investments in our business. As a percentage of sales, operating expense in the quarter improved 140 basis points from 32.1% last year to 30.7% this year. Third quarter operating income for the Snap-on Tools segment was $28.2 million or 10.9% of sales compared to $29.5 million or 12.6% of sales last year.
After adjusting for LIFO in both years, operating income in the quarter increased $2.8 million or 10.8% year-over-year. And as a percentage of sales, was 11.1% in both years.
Turning to Slide 9, in the Repair Systems and Information or RS&I segment, third quarter sales of $207 million were up 8.1% from 2009 levels. Excluding currency, organic sales were up 10.1%, primarily due to higher worldwide sales of equipment, increased essential tool and facilitation program sales, and higher diagnostic sales in Mitchell 1 information products. These increases were partially offset by the anticipated lower electronic parts catalog sales in North America, as a result of OEM dealership consolidations.
Gross profit of $97.3 million in the quarter increased $11.4 million or 13.3% from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher sales, lower restructuring costs, material cost reductions and continued savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. Gross margin in the quarter of 46.9% improved 210 basis points over 44.8% last year.
Operating expenses of $55.6 million in the quarter were essentially flat with 2009 levels, as higher volume related, product development and other expenses were largely offset by lower restructuring costs, favorable currency translation, savings from RCI and restructuring initiatives, as well as lower bad debt expense.
As a percentage of sales, operating expenses improved 210 basis points year-over-year. Operating earnings of $41.7 million in the quarter increased $11.2 million or 37%. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the RS&I group improved 420 basis points from 15.9% last year to 20.1% this year.
Turning now to Slide 10. Financial Services operating earnings of $5 million in the quarter compares favorably to both second quarter 2010 earnings of $1.7 million and to the third quarter 2009 loss of $5.3 million. The $10.3 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings, primarily reflects the higher revenue contributions from Snap-on credits, growing on book financed portfolio.
As you know, since July of last year, we are no longer selling loan contracts to CIT and recording gains on sale. Rather, we are building it on balance sheet, interests-yielding portfolio. As this portfolio grows, so will our financial services' operating earnings.
Moving to Slide 11. As the third quarter end, our balance sheet includes gross financing receivables of $528 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation and $139 million from our international finance subsidiaries, for a total financing portfolio of $667 million. In United States, $445 million of the portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Snap-on continues to manage the run off portfolio of contracts owned by CIT, which totaled $317 million at third quarter end, down $67 million from second quarter levels. For the full year, we continue to expect that the on book financing portfolio at Snap-on credit, will have grown by approximately $300 million, resulting in a year end U.S. finance portfolio of about $565 million to $570 million.
Regarding Finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations and have improved compared to both Q1 and Q2 levels. Turning to Slide 12, consolidated operating cash flow for the quarter was $10.2 million. At the end of the third quarter, our cash position of $360 million declined $71 million from second quarter 2010 levels, primarily due to the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit. 
Since second quarter end, net financing contract receivables increased $85 million. In the quarter, capital spending of $10.5 million was down from 2009 levels, primarily due to last year's construction of a new R&D facility in Richfield,Ohio and the accelerated expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in emerging markets.
As seen on Slide 13, since last year end, trade and other receivables increased $20.6 million and day sales outstanding improved to 62 days. Inventories increased $50 million from 2009 year end, primarily due to higher production levels as a result of increased customer demand. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns improved to 4.5 turns as compared to 4.1 turns at 2009 year end.
Net debt at the end of the quarter was $571 million. Our net debt to capital ratio of 29.2% compares to 22.2% at 2009 year end. Excluding approximately $108 million of cash, currently withheld related to the previously disclosed dispute with CIT, our net debt to capital ratio as of the end of the third quarter would have been 32.9%.
In addition to $360 million of cash, we continue to maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility and $20 million of committed bank lines. Most recently, on October 1, we entered into a loan and servicing agreement that allows us to secure additional borrowings of up to $100 million through the pledging of Snap-on Credit finance receivables, under an asset-backed securitization facility.
This agreement provides us with additional available credit capacity and funding diversification that supplements our existing credit agreements. As of third quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. This concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. Before turning the call back to Nick, I'd like to review our outlook for the balance of 2010. 
For the full year, we expect to incur approximately $15 million of restructuring costs and approximately $45 million for capital expenditures. We continue to expect that full year 2010 pension expense will be $16 million higher than last year. Finally, the anticipated effective income tax rate for full year 2010 will approximate 33.6%. Before opening the call for questions, Nick would like to provide some final thoughts. Nick?"

Look, I'll close by saying again that our performance in the quarter was quite encouraging. We believe it represents strong confirmation that Snap-on is a company with unique strengths, ongoing opportunity for improvement and extended runways for growth.
Going into the downturn, we assessed the macroeconomic difficulties saying that big-ticket long payback items were important. They would help lead our recovery, and they have. We said that we would invest in strategic areas that would be decisive going forward, and those efforts appear to be working well. We've maintained our van network. It's more enthusiastic and more stable than when we entered the difficulties. 
We said that critical industries would be a corridor of growth. We're growing strongly in that arena. The industrial division was up 34% for the quarter. We were convinced that our technology and reputation would enable expansion with repair shop owners. Equipment and RS&I are confirming that belief. Equipment shook off the natural third quarter headwind and grew strongly in both the U.S. and Europe. And we said emerging markets, presented with a unique opportunity physically provisioned, would help us grow, and we are growing and gaining in those areas. Those regions are growing at deep double digits, well ahead of even the robust GDPs.
No one can predict how the environment will enfold. The economies of the world are still fragile. Having said that however, we now have three quarters of positive Snap-on momentum. The situation seems to be playing out as we've expected, and our strategic programs are successful. Because of all that, we're more confident than ever before that Snap-on is well positioned to take strong advantage of the future. Strong advantage of the future in whatever shape it unfolds.
Before taking questions, I want to end by thanking the people responsible for these encouraging results. Our associates and franchisees. I know as usual many of you are listening. These results would not have been possible without your capability and your dedication. I thank you for your support and I congratulate you on your success.

It seems to be bumping along the bottom. So I don't know when that's going to recover. So in terms of looking at where improvements are going to come from and looking for recovery, I have a question mark myself about southern Europe. If you're talking about commodity, you could talk about commodity prices, a lot of us talk about it in terms of commodity. We don't see for us a major headwind because we do get commodity prices, but as you know, Jim, a lot of our products are not so much material as they are labor. So our increases are not very devastating, and plus, we generally comprise recognized commodity increases, so that's not such a problem for us. You could say, you could take a look at critical industries and say, ""Okay, well, will the military spend as much as they have in the past?” Maybe they won't, that could be a headwind that we have to offset some places. Some people are talking about restocking, but for us, we see almost none. So the 34% we saw in the critical industry in industrial division in third quarter, had almost no restocking.  I can tell you that we just went through our quarterly reviews here, and I don't think restocking came up at all in a week of discussion. So we're not seeing that as a factor. So for us, the headwinds are mostly around what's going to happen in Southern Europe. Could there be some variation and some cooling in critical industries, but we don't expect a lot. We expect that to continue reasonably good because we've seen it for many quarters now. And some of the traditional headwinds for some other businesses like commodities or restocking, we don't see in our future."

Well, Snap-on had another quarter of improved year-over-year performance and on top of that we saw some favorable market signal, so it’s very encouraging. We believe there is now clear evidence of a building Snap-on",2187,"Thanks Leslie. Good morning everyone. Well, Snap-on had another quarter of improved year-over-year performance and on top of that we saw some favorable market signal, so it’s very encouraging. We believe there is now clear evidence of a building Snap-on strength in the recovering market. Overall, our organic sales were up 13.4%, solid by any measure, and that’s after being up 9.5% in the second quarter and 4% in the first quarter. Needless to say, we like that trend.
Operating income rose 72% from last year with financial services contributing profitability as projected improving its performance as it brings the loan portfolio on to Snap-on’s books. The operating company ally without financial services increased by a strong 46%, so again overall we are encouraged by the strength of the quarter, and that result was in the face of an unfavorable swing in LIFO.
We would say our runways for growth are clearing and our Snap-on value creation processes around safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI, they continue to drive progress. So, having said that let me give you a bit of color, and my perspective on the trends we see.
With respect to the economic environment and the impacts on our market, there are some nice positives. It was our third straight quarter of increasing year-over-year gain. So that alone indicates a better environment, and there is also a building momentum in some of our more strategically important areas in our core auto repair business, in emerging markets, in critical industries, all areas where we see clear long-term runway.
Now, the third quarter is seasonally are most challenging. It can be quite variable. So, it’s some times difficult to draw extended conclusions from the results, but having said that Snap-on’s quarter was robust completely overcoming the typical season low.
We often talk about big ticket items, higher-price products that either have longer paybacks like diagnostics or under-car equipment, or a more discretionary like tool storage units. Activity here is usually a barometer of our customers’ overall financial health and of their confidence. 
You recall that during the downturn last year we saw quite a bit of variation from period to period in big ticket purchases, but with these results we’ve now put together three quarters in a row of year-over-year increases in all three big ticket categories. They are all back now to pre-downturn levels.
In the tools group, both diagnostics and tool storage units showed significant gains. A real help in this was our new diagnostics handheld unit called them VERDICT. It was launched at our annual franchisee conference in August and it got great reviews. It’s a fully functional unit that we believe set a new industry standard with features like detachable wireless touch screen display, remote use from anywhere in the garage, Wi-Fi internet capability and access for Snap-on’s unique repair information and database.
The VERDICT is clearly an innovation. It provides real productivity to technicians and as you would expect the reception has been very strong. Beyond the vans, our equipment division, part of the Repair Systems and Information or RS&I group showed strong year-over-year gains in particular and its big ticket under-car products that’s what equipment sales. It achieved gains in both North America and Europe well ahead of our company’s overall sales increase. In fact equivalent lines were even slightly ahead of the second quarter, and third quarter sequential increases is very rare for this business, because a large presence in Europe and the associated seasonality usually make July through September a tough period. So, this quarter’s increase, sequentially increase in equipment sales was a big win.
From a geographical standpoint, there hasn’t been much change in the regional market landscape. North America showed gains that were a bit better than those recorded worldwide. Europe’s recovery is generally a little weaker, we were however up double-digits, though the story there continues to vary region-by-region.
In the south, especially Spain there still hadn’t been much improved. Spain is important for us because that’s in our European big hand tools business has an exceptionally strong presence. On the other hand, the North is decidedly more positive. Sales in markets like Germany, Sweden and Finland all grew strongly, so Europe is still mixed, but for us up double-digits overall.
With the respect of emerging markets, the places where we’ve made investments and are focused on expansion like Eastern Europe we saw a strong growth in Russia again in the quarter up nearly 50% and Asia-Pacific continued its steep growth curve significantly higher than our overall increase with India and China both setting the pace.
China continues to sell out all the bandsaw’s it can produce and the Indian sales team is now gaining real traction in the under-car equipment market. So that’s some perspective on the global environment, a varied landscape, but increasing almost everywhere.
Now for some highlights on the operating segment. Commercial and Industrial or C&I saw volumes up about $45 million that’s more than a 21% increase, operating earnings rose $21 million with those increased volumes and strong RCI results driving in the improvement. RCI results in the quarter are dramatic testimony to the ongoing power of our Snap-on value creation processes.
They’ve contributed greatly to our progress so far and we are confident there is still much more opportunity to go. We’ve often spoke about the runway in critical industries where the tasks absolutely need to be accomplished without sales. Well, recently we had graphic evidence of such a situation, many watched the dramatic rescue of the miners in Chile as it was broadcast around the globe, it was a great story and you could clearly see SNA Europe’s BAHCO branded tools on the scene assisting in the rescue, accomplishing the critical mission on the quarter.
So, our performance, but while that’s an interesting sidebar. I think I would like to talk about our performance in the industrial business. One of the real positives for the company this past quarter, near record sales trailing only the fourth quarter of 2008 in volumes, a really strong quarter.
Our industrial business was up 34% and that gain was across the globe and that was without much restocking. We believe that is evidence of our success in moving the Snap-on brand out of the vehicle garage and into critical industries everywhere. Look it’s clear, that overall economic activity is not at pre-crisis levels, but we still achieved a near record quarter in this space, it shows we are making significant gain in the strategic area.
I have also mentioned in the past, that we are expanding our product offering aimed specifically at critical industries, like power generation, mining and aerospace, it's paying off. Along those lines innovations play the big part of Snap-on history and that tradition continues today.
Just this past quarter, we launched our new Automated Tool Control or ATC tool storage product aims squarely at the aerospace sector. We’ve taken our sophisticated digital imaging technology, which is a huge competitive advantage for us in car aligners and transform tool storage boxes into hi-tech assets, compared with the keyless entry system that laser technology scans the tool door, it knows who checked out and who returned every tool, every time.
It's important to know where your tools are when you are working on jet engines, ATC accomplishes that task like no other product and it’s a great system and we’ve started to see our first sales in the quarter. The ATC technology is only one example of leveraging Snap-on’s breadths and depths to drive the company’s presence in critical industry. We are collaborating widely across business operations to maximize opportunities by applying our existing advantages in one sector to develop opportunities in others.
For critical industries, such as power generation and aerospace, military, and mining and many other we are well positioned to modify our core product and technologies to meet the unique requirement, the third quarter is more evidenced that it's working. 
A good portion of our effort in emerging markets gets reflected in C&I, so I will talk about that now, I touched on the strong increases earlier and that growth only comes with expanded physicals presence in products, and we are aggressively building both in those market.
In Asia we are increasing manufacturing capabilities, both in Zhejiang and in Xiaoshan were our Wanda acquisition is based and we recently launched our Asian Handheld Diagnostics Unit, it’s our first specifically tailored for the region and there is more in the pipeline. In Eastern Europe, last year we build a plant in Belarus, just this past month we have the official inauguration that included government dignitaries and broad TV coverage.
It was great exposure for the innovated technologies we’re bringing to the region, and it’s just a type of presences and reorganization that helps in building a distribution network, creating a foothold and in generating the strong sales increase we’ve seen in this quarter in Eastern Europe, that’s C&I.
Let’s move to the tools group, we’ve seen a return to pre-downturn sales levels, overall volumes up nearly 11% in the US better at nearly 13%. OI margin is same as last year after adjusting for a $4 million negative LIFO swing. These results reflect our balanced approached to maintain the strength of our powerful franchise system. We’ve invested significantly in training and product support to keep our network robust.
In that way in August we held our annual Snap-on franchisees conference. It’s annual, but this one was special, it served as the highlight of our 90th Anniversary celebration, we’ve been in business for nine decade and it was a significant success, record attendances, more product, more trading seminaries, and a business and profit center aimed specifically at helping our franchisee to improve their business efficiencies. That was really popular.
The mood of the conference was very positive, I can tell you. The franchisees are up beat about their prospects. They enthusiastically embrace Snap-on’s cohered focus on making work easier for professionals who perform critical task and because they know our whole organization is behind that mission across the globe in all of our division. They believe strongly in their future with our company.
We’ve spoken in the past about the Snap-on stimulus program. Well the best stimulus we can provide is great product. So, we’re encouraged that we were recently recognized for just that. Snap-on was named the overall best brand in six tool categories of tools by Frost & Sullivan’s in the 2010 survey of technician. 
Snap-on carried the number one ranking by wide margins, for example in hand tools 70% of the technicians preferred the Snap-on brand. The nearest competitor had an 8% share, and diagnostics in winning margin was 46 to 9 and the numbers for tool storage was 63% Snap-on the highest other brand 8%.
Our products were also recognized in the quarter by professional tool and equipment news, the Snap-on low profile ratchets in the Quadriga tire changers were both recognized by that publication for outstanding innovations in vehicle repair. Now this awarded special, because it was based on the opinion of professional users, the people that gained productivity by actually using Snap-on. So, that says a lot. 
I already mentioned the recovery in big ticket items. Many of those sales are through our vans, on credit and that credit has been available without disruptions throughout the inauguration of Snap-on Credit. Our financial service business is performing as we predicted, becoming increasingly profitable as the loan portfolio moves on to our books and that successful inauguration of Snap- on Credit has had a significant hand in supporting the sales and growth.
Now for some discussion of the RS&I group; sales up about 10% or $19 million excluding currency, OI up 11.2%. I already mentioned the equipment division’s big ticket sales gains in both North America and Europe. The strong increases of equipment are a big part of our RS&I progress. You remember that RS&I portfolio is where we have our exposure to the North American OEMs and their contraction of the dealerships. 
So, Snap-on business solutions does continue to be impacted by that disruption. We did, however, in the quarter, achieved more offsets with an increasing activity and OEM essential tools and diagnostics programs. We’re also gaining a heavy duty diagnostics products, supplying trucks, supplying to truck shop owners in a greater volumes than ever before.
And you’ll probably remember that RS&I focuses on vehicle shop repair owners and managers, we’re expanding in that space and you can see it in this group’s numbers. Our Diagnostics and Mitchell1 divisions already strong in the independent repair shop continue to better the positions. In addition, for the successful new VERDICT handheld I mentioned earlier, Mitchell1 released a new version of a shop management software with significant success. We’ve made investments in this area and it’s paying off.
Well, that gives you a little color on the quarter. Significant sales increases, encouraging profitability, strengthening strategic position and ample runways for further growth.
Now, I’ll turn the call over to Aldo for the financial review.

Net sales for the third quarter of $653 million increased 12.3% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, sales increased 13.4%. As Nick mentioned, the primary drivers behind the $71 million year-over-year sales increase include significantly higher sales to customers in critical industries in emerging markets, as well as double-digit increases in worldwide equipment and sales to franchisees in the United States.
Consolidated gross profit of $301 million increased $40.7 year-over-year driven by higher sales, improved manufacturing utilization and savings from ongoing rapid continues improvement or RCI initiatives and restructuring actions. Foreign currency benefited gross profit by $2.7 million while lower year-over-year restructuring cost contributed another $2 million.
The overall benefits from improved manufacturing utilization, RCI currency and lower restructuring were partially offset by $4.1 million of higher year-over-year LIFO-related inventory expense. As a result of these factors, consolidated gross margin improved 130 basis points a 46.1% as compared to 44.8% last year.
Operating expenses in the quarter increased $15.9 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses including higher cost as a result of increased participation at our 2010 Annual Franchisee Conference.
Year-over-year operating expenses also included $4.1 million of higher U.S. pension expense largely due to lower the projected asset returns in previous years. These increases were partially offset by lower bad debt expense, favorable currency translation and savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives.
As a percent of sales, operating expenses of 34% in the quarter improved to 150 basis points from 35.5% last year. Operating earnings of $78.8 million before financial services improved $24.8 million, which is a 45.9% year-over-year increase on 12.3% of higher sales.
Including financial services, operating earnings increased $35.1 million or 72.1% over 2009 levels. As a percentage of total revenues, operating earnings increased 420 basis points from 8.3% last year to 12.5% this year. Financial services operating earnings of $5 million in the quarter improved $10.3 million for the third quarter 2009 loss of $5.3 million. On a sequential basis, financial services operating earnings improved $3.3 million from second quarter 2010 levels.
As expected operating income from financial services, which is before interest expense continues to improve as the on-book finance portfolio grows. The third quarter effective income tax rates were 34.4% in 2010 and 29.3% last year. The lower rate in 2009 reflects the favorable resolution of certain tax matters as well as the favorable mix of foreign earnings.
Finally, third quarter net earnings of $46.5 million increased $21.1 million or 83% from the $25.4 million earned last year. Let’s now turn to our segment results. Beginning with the Commercial and Industrial or C&I group on slide 7, segment sales of $261 million improved 19.5% from prior year levels. Excluding the impact of currency translation organic sales increased 21.2%. The year-over-year sales increase was again driven by higher sales across all operating units with particularly strong increases in those businesses serving customers in critical industries and emerging markets.
Gross profit in the C&I segment of $96.2 million increased $25.9 million or 36.8% from 2009 levels. This increase is primarily due to higher sales and $3.5 million of savings from on going RCI and restructuring initiatives. The gross profit comparison also benefited from improved manufacturing utilization, primarily in Europe, as a result of increasing production levels.
For the quarter, gross margin of 36.8% improved 460 basis points from 32.2% last year. Operating expenses in the quarter of $65.6 million increased $4.8 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses, and increased restructuring cost. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses improved by 280 basis points year-over-year. Operating margin in the C&I segment of 11.7% in the third quarter of 2010 improved 740 basis points from 4.3% last year.
Turning now to slide 8, on a worldwide basis, third quarter sales in the Snap-on tools group of $259 million increased 10.8% from 2009 levels, including a 12.8% increase in United States. Gross profit in the Snap-on tools group of a $108 million in the quarter increased $3.4 million from 2009 levels primarily due to higher sales in favorable currency effects.
The year-over-year gross profit comparison was also impacted by higher costs associated with increased franchisee product related programs and by $4.1 million of higher LIFO-related expense. LIFO-related expense was $600,000 in the third quarter of 2010. Last year, as a result of lower production in inventory reduction efforts, the LIFO-related benefit was $3.5 million. As a percentage of sales, gross margin in the quarter was 41.6% as compared to 44.7% last year.
Third quarter operating expenses of $79.5 million in the Snap-on tools group increased $4.7 million from 2009. This is primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses as a result of increased participation at this year’s annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, which focused primarily on the development and profitability of the franchise network.
In the quarter, we also incurred higher cost associated with the development of a new and expanded product catalog that was deferred from 2009 to 2010. We view these increased cost as longer-term investments in our business. As a percentage of sales, operating expense from the quarter improve to 140 basis points, from 32.1% last year to 30.7% this year. Third quarter operating income for the Snap-on tools segment was $28.2 million or 10.9%of sales compared to $29.5 million or 12.6% of sales last year.
After adjusting for LIFO on both years, operating income in the quarter increased $2.8 million or 10.8% year-over-year and as a percentage of sales was 11.1% in both years. 
Turning to slide 9; in the Repair Systems and Information or RS&I segment. Third quarter sales of $207 million were up 8.1% from 2009 levels. Excluding currency, organic sales were up 10.1%, primarily due to higher worldwide sales of equipment, increased essential tools and facilitation program sales, and higher diagnostic sales and Mitchell1 information products. These increases were partially offset by the anticipated lower electronic parts catalog sales in North America, as a result of OEM dealership consolidations.
Gross profit of $97.3 million in the quarter increased $11.4 million or 13.3% from 2009 levels. Primarily due to higher sales, low restructuring cost, material cost reductions and continued savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. Gross margin in the quarter of 46.9% improve 210 basis points over 44.8% last year. 
Operating expenses of $55.6 million in the quarter were essentially flat with 2009 levels as higher volume related product development and other expenses were largely offset by lower restructuring cost, favorable currency translation, savings from RCI and restructuring initiatives as well as lower bad debt expense.
As a percentage of sales operating expenses improve 210 basis points year-over-year. Operating earnings of $41.7 million in the quarter increased $11.2 million or 37%. As a percentage of sales operating margins in the RS&I group improve 420 basis points from 15.9% last year to 20.1% this year. 
Turning now to slide 10, financial services, operating earnings of $5 million in the quarter, compares favorably to both second quarter 2010 earnings of $1.7 million and to the third quarter 2009 loss of $5.3 million.
The $10.3 million year-over-year increase and operating earnings primarily reflects the higher revenue contributions from Snap-on Credits growing on-book finance portfolio. As you know, since July of last year, we are no longer selling loan contracts to CIT and recording gains on sale, rather we are building an on-balance-sheet interest yielding portfolio. As this portfolio grows, so well our financial services operating earnings.
Moving to slide 11, as of third quarter ends, our balance sheet includes gross financing receivables of $528 million from our US Snap-on Credit operation and $139 million from our international finance subsidiaries, for a total financing portfolio of $667 million.
In the United States $445 million of the portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Snap-on continues to manage the run-off portfolio of contracts owned by CIT, which totaled $317 million at third quarter end, down $67 million from second quarter levels.
For the full year, we continue to expect that the on-book financing portfolio and Snap-on Credit will have grown by approximately $300 million, resulting in a year end US finance portfolio of about $565 million to $570 million. Regarding finance portfolio losses in delinquency trends, these continue to be inline with our expectations and they have improved compared to both Q1 and Q2 levels.
Turning to slide 12, consolidated operating cash flow for the quarter was $10.2 million. At the end of the third quarter our cash position of $360 million declined $71 million from second quarter 2010 levels, primarily due to the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit.
Since second quarter end, net financing and contract receivables increased $85 million. In the quarter capital spending of $10.5 million was down from 2009 levels, primarily due to last year’s construction of a new R&D facility in Richfield, Ohio and the accelerated expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in emerging markets.
As seen on slide 13, since last year end trade and other receivables increased $20.6 million and days-sales outstanding improved to 62 days. Inventories increased $50 million from 2009 year end, primarily due to higher production levels as a result of increased customer demand. On a trailing 12 month basis, inventory turns improve to 4.5 turns as compared to 4.1 turns in 2009 year end.
Net debt at the end of the quarter was $571 million. Our net debt to capital ratio of 29.2% compares to 22.2% at 2009 year end. Excluding approximately $108 million of cash, currently withheld related to the previously disclosed dispute with CIT, our net debt to capital ratio as of the end of the third quarter would have been 32.9%.
In addition, to $360 million of cash, we continue to maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility and $20 million of committed bank lines. Most recently on October 1, we entered into a loan and servicing agreement that allows us to secure additional borrowings up to $100 million through the pledging of Snap-on Credit finance receivables under an asset back securitization facility.
This agreement provides us with additional available credit capacity and funding diversification that supplement to our existing credit agreements. As of third quarter end no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. This concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance.
Before turning the call back to Nick, I’d like to review our outlook for the balance of 2010. For the full year, we expect to incur approximately $15 million of restructuring cost and approximately $45 million for capital expenditures. We continued to expect that full year 2010 pension expense will be $16 million higher than last year.
Finally, the anticipated effective income tax rate for full year 2010 will approximate 33.6%. Before opening the call for questions, Nick would like to provide some final thoughts. Nick.

Look, I’ll close by saying again that our performance in the quarter was quite encouraged. We believe that represent strong confirmation that Snap-on is a company with unique strengths, ongoing opportunities for improvement and extended runways for growth. 
Going into the downturn, we assess the macroeconomic difficulty saying that big ticket long payback items were important. They would help to ease our recovery and they have.
We said that we would invest in strategic areas that would be decisive growing forward and those efforts appear to be working well. We’ve maintained our van network; it’s more enthusiastic and more stable than when we entered the difficulties. We said that critical industries would be quarter [ph] growth. We are growing strongly in that arena. The industrial division was up 34% in the quarter.
We were convinced that our technology and reputation would enable expansion with repair shop owners. Equipment in RS&I are confirming that belief. Equipment shook off the natural third quarter headwinds and grew strongly in both the US and Europe, and we said emerging markets, presented with the unique opportunity of physically provisioned, would help us grow and we are growing and gaining in those areas. Those regions are growing at deep double-digits, well ahead of even the robust GDPs.
No one can predict how the environment will unfold. The economies of the world are still fragile, having said that, however. We now have three quarters of positive Snap-on momentum. The situation seems to be playing out as we expected and our strategic programs are successful. Because of all that, we are more confident than ever before that Snap-on is well positioned to take strong advantage of the future, strong advantage of the future in whatever shape it unfolds.
Before taking questions, I want to end by thanking the people responsible for these encouraging results, our associates and franchisees. I know as usual, many of you are listening. These results would not have been possible without your capability and your dedication. I thank you for your support and I congratulate you on your success.
Operator, now we’ll take questions.

It seems to be bumping along the bottom, so I don’t know when that’s going to recover. 
So, in terms of looking at where improvements going to come from, and looking from recovery, I have a question marked myself about Southern Europe. 
You can talk about commodity prices, a lot is talked about in terms of commodity, we don’t see for us a major headwinds because we do get commodity prices, but as you know Jim, a lot of our products are not so much material as they are labored, so our increases are not very devastating and plus we generally comprise for recognized commodity increases, so that’s not such a problem for us. 
You could say, you can take a look at critical industries and say okay, well, will the military spend as much as they have in the past, maybe they won’t, that could be a headwind that we have to offset some places. Some people are talking about restocking, but for us we see almost none. 
So, the 34% we saw in the critical industries in the industrial division in third quarter had almost, and only restocking. I can tell you that we just went through our quarterly reviews here and I don’t think restocking came up at all in a week of discussion.
So, we are not seeing that as a factor, so for us the headwinds are mostly around, what’s going to happen in Southern Europe, could there be some variation and some cooling in critical industries, but we don’t expect a lot. We expect that to continue reasonably good because we’ve seen it for many quarters now, and some of the traditional headwinds for some other businesses like commodities or restocking, we’re not seeing in our future.

We also see opportunities to grow our van business, but those are two, three places. Critical industries, repair shop owners and emerging market, and I see those businesses being a bigger part of our company. We are going to continue to pursue roll down those runways, because in the third quarter, I think is abundant evidence that those runaways are clearing for us. 
Now we have said, I think that moving forward, after the recession recovers, after we recover the recession, after recession recovery goes away, we believe we can register between 4% and 6% organic growth consistently and we believe we can drive towards strong mid-teen OI margins. 
And we believe that we will get that through organic growth and then also in those critical runaways we can find both on acquisition, so I see as pursuing that moving forward.

I can’t tell you how much but we are seeing that expansion. And it’s on top of, if you go back previous session, we were growing strong, double-digit in a moderate economy in that areas, so I think this is just extension of that.
Of course we are growing share in emerging markets, and I think one of the places where our people on the ground say we are expanding, is in Europe. Europe was up double-digits even though is in fact to ’08 levels, everybody, a lot of people are saying they are up in Europe, but what we see in Europe is the customers aren’t going way, but the smaller player seem to be contracting.
So, our people on the ground in Europe say we are gaining share even there. I can’t part between, I can’t tell you which part of that is, is market share -it’s share increase and return, but if you look at things like, if you look at places like equipment and the critical industries, equipments up strong double-digits almost 20%, over 20% critical industries are up 30%.

303646,114307534,81305,"Snap-on Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2010",2010-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Snap-on Incorporated","Executives","Thanks Leslie. Good morning, everyone. Well, Snap-on had another quarter of improved year-over-year performance. And on top of that, we saw some favorable market signals, so it's very encouraging. We believe there's now clear evidence of a building Snap-o",2146,"Thanks Leslie. Good morning, everyone. Well, Snap-on had another quarter of improved year-over-year performance. And on top of that, we saw some favorable market signals, so it's very encouraging. We believe there's now clear evidence of a building Snap-on strength in the recovery market. Overall, our organic sales were up 13.4%. Solid by any measure. And that's after being up 9.5% the second quarter and 4% in the first quarter. Needless to say, we like that trend.
Operating income rose 72% from last year, with Financial Services contributing profitability, as projected, improving its performance as it springs the loan portfolio on the Snap-on books. The operating company OI, without Financial Services increased by a strong 46%. So again, overall we're encouraged by the strength of the quarter. And that result was in the face of an unfavorable swing in LIFO.
We would say our runways for growth our clearing and our Snap-on value creation processes around safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI, they continue to drive progress.
So having said that, let me give you a bit of color and my perspective on the trends we see. With respect to the economic environment and the impacts on our markets, there are some nice positives. It was our third straight quarter of increasing year-over-year gain. So that alone indicates a better environment. And there is also a building momentum in some of our most strategically important areas. In our core Auto Repair business, in emerging markets and critical industries. All areas where we see clear long-term runway.
Now the third quarter is seasonally our most challenging. It can be quite variable. So it's sometimes difficult to draw extended conclusions from the results. But having said that, Snap-on's quarter was robust, completely overcoming the typical season low.
We often talk about big-ticket items, higher-priced products that either have longer payback, like diagnostics or undercar equipment, or are more discretionary, like tool-storage units. Activity here is usually a barometer of our customers' overall financial health, and of their confidence. You'll recall that during the downturn last year, we saw quite a bit of variation from period-to-period in big-ticket purchases. But with these results, we've now put together three quarters in a row of year-over-year increases in all three big-ticket categories. They're all back now to pre-downturn levels.
In the Tools group, both diagnostics and tool-storage units showed significant gains. A real help in this was our new diagnostics handheld unit called The Verdict. It was launched at our annual franchise e-conference in August and it got great reviews. It's a fully functional unit that we believe sets a new industry standard with features like a detachable wireless touch screen display, remote use from anywhere in the garage, WiFi internet capability and access to Snap-on's unique repair information database.
The Verdict is clearly an innovation. It provides real productivity technicians and, as you'd expect, reception has been very strong.
Beyond the vans, our Equipment division, part of the repair systems and information or RS&I group, showed strong year-over-year gains. In particular in it's big-ticket undercar product, that's what Equipment sells, it achieved gains in both North America and Europe, well ahead of our company's overall sales increase. In fact, Equipment volumes were even slightly ahead of the second quarter. A third quarter sequential increase is very rare for this business, because a large presence in Europe and the associated seasonality usually make July through September a tough period. So this quarter's sequential increase in Equipment sales was a big win.
From a geographical standpoint, there hasn't been much change in their regional market landscape. North America showed gains that were a bit better than those recorded worldwide. Europe's recovery is generally a little weaker. We were, however, up double digits, though the story there continues to vary region by region. In the South, especially Spain, there still hasn't been much improvement. Spain is important for us because that's in Europe. Our European-based Hand Tools business has an exceptionally strong presence.
On the other hand, the North is decisively more positive. Sales and markets like Germany, Sweden and Finland all grew strongly. So Europe is still mixed, but for us, up double digits overall.
With respect to emerging markets, places where we've made investments and are focused on expansion like Eastern Europe, we saw a strong growth in Russia, again in the quarter, up nearly 50%. And Asia-Pacific continued a steep growth curve, significantly higher than our overall increase, with India and China both setting the pace. China continues to sell out all the bandsaws it can produce, and the Indian sales team is now gaining real traction in the undercar equipment market.
So that's some perspective on the global environment, a varied landscape but increasing almost everywhere. Now for some highlights on the operating segments. Commercial Industrial, or C&I, saw volumes up around about $45 million. That's more than a 21% increase. Operating earnings rose $21 million, with those increased volumes and strong RCI results driving the improvement. RCI results in the quarter are a dramatic testimony to the ongoing power of our Snap-on value creation processes. They've contributed greatly to our progress so far, and we're confident there's still much more opportunity to go.
We've often spoke about the runway in critical industries, where the tasks absolutely need to be accomplished without fail. While recently, we had graphic evidence of such a situation. Many watched the dramatic rescue of the minors in Chile as it was broadcast around the globe. It was a great story. And you could clearly see SNA Europe's Bahco-branded tools on the scene, assisting in the rescue, accomplishing the critical mission of the quarter. 
So our performance, but while that's an interesting sidebar, I think I'd like to talk about our performance in the Industrial business. One of the real positives for the company this past quarter. Near-record sales, trailing only the fourth quarter of 2008 in volumes, a really strong quarter. Our Industrial business was up 34% and that gain was across the globe.
And that was without much restocking. We believe that, that is evidence of our success in moving the Snap-on brand out of the vehicle garage and into critical industries everywhere. Look, it's clear that overall economic activities is not at precrisis levels, but we still achieved a near-record quarter in the space. It shows we are making significant gains in this strategic area.
I've also mentioned in the past that we're expanding our product offering, aimed specifically at critical industries like power generation, mining and aerospace. It's paying off. Along those lines, innovation's played a big part of Snap-on's history, and that tradition continues today. Just this past quarter, we launched our new automated tool control or ATC tool-storage product, aimed squarely at the aerospace sector. We've taken our sophisticated digital imaging technology, which is a huge competitive advantage for us in car aligners, and transformed tool-storage boxes into high-tech assets.
Paired with a keyless entry system that laser technology scans the tool drawer. It knows who checked out and who returned every tool, every time. It's important to know where your tools are when you're working on jet engines. ATC accomplishes that task like no other product, and it's a great system, and we've started to see our first sales in the quarter. 
The ATC technology is only one example of leveraging Snap-on's breadth and depth to drive the company's presence in critical industries. We're collaborating widely across business operations to maximize opportunities by applying our existing advantages in one sector to develop opportunities and others.
Critical industries such as power generation and aerospace, military and mining and many others, we're well positioned to modify our core product and technologies to meet the unique requirements. The third quarter is more evidence that it's working.
A good portion of our effort in emerging markets gets reflected in C&I. So I'll talk about that now. I touched on the strong increases earlier. And that growth only comes with expanded physicals, presence and products. And we're aggressively building both in those markets. 
In Asia, we're increasing manufacturing capabilities both in Kunshan and in Zhoushan, where our Wanda acquisition is based. And we recently launched our Asian handheld diagnostics unit. It's our first, specifically tailored for the region, and there's more in the pipeline. In Eastern Europe, last year, we built the plants in Belarus. 
Just this past month, we have the official inauguration. And included government dignitaries in broad TV coverage. It was great exposure for the innovative technologies we're bringing to the region. And it's just the type of presence and recognition that helps in building a distribution network, creating a foothold and in generating the strong sales increase we've seen in this quarter in Eastern Europe.
That's C&I. Let's move to the Tools group. We've seen a return to pre-downturn sales level. Overall volume is up nearly 11%. In the U.S., better, at nearly 13%. OI margin is same as last year after adjusting for a $4 million negative LIFO swing. 
These results reflect our balanced approach to maintain the strength of our powerful franchise system. We've invested significantly in training and product support to keep our network robust. In that way, in August, we held our annual Snap-on franchisee's conference. It's annual, but this one was special. It served as the highlight of our 90th anniversary celebration. We've been in business for nine decades, and it was a significant success. Record attendance, more product, more training seminars and a business and profit center aimed specifically at helping our franchisees improve their business efficiencies. It was really popular.
The mood of the conference was very positive, I can tell you. The franchisees are upbeat about their prospects. They enthusiastically embraced Snap-on's coherent focus on making work easier for professionals who perform critical tasks. And because they know our whole organization is behind that mission across the globe in all of our division, they believe strongly in their future with our company.
We've spoken in the past about the Snap-on stimulus program. Well the best stimulus we can provide is great product. So we're encouraged that we were recently recognized for just that. Snap-on was named the overall best brand in six categories of tools by Frost & Sullivan in their 2010 Survey of Technicians. Snap-on carried the number one ranking by wide margins. 
For example, in hand tools, 70% of the technicians preferred the Snap-on brand. The nearest competitor had an 8% share. In diagnostics, the winning margin was 46% to 9%, and the numbers for tool storage were 62% Snap-on, the highest other brand, 8%. Our products were also recognized in the quarter by professional tool and equipment news. The Snap-on low-profile ratchet and the Quadriga tire changer were both recognized by that publication for outstanding innovations in vehicle repair. Now this award is special, because it was based on the opinion of professional users, the people that gain productivity by actually using Snap-on. So that says a lot.
I already mentioned the recovery in big-ticket items. Many of those sales are through our vans, on credit. And that credit has been available without disruption throughout the integration of Snap-on Credit. Our Financial Service business is performing as we predicted, becoming increasingly profitable as the loan portfolio moves onto our books. And that successful integration of Snap-on Credit has had a significant hand in supporting the sales growth.
Now to some discussion of the RS&I group. Sales up about 10% or $19 million excluding currency. OI up 11.2%. I already mentioned the Equipment division's big-ticket sales gains in both in both North America and Europe. The strong increases of Equipment are a big part of our RS&I progress. Remember that the RS&I portfolio is where we have our exposure to the North American OEMs, and their contraction of their dealerships. So Snap-on Business Solutions does continue to be impacted by that disruption. 
We did however, in the quarter, achieve more offsets with increasing activity and OEM essential tools and diagnostics programs. We're also gaining in heavy-duty diagnostics products, supplying to truck-shop owners in greater volumes than ever before. And you'll probably remember that RS&I focuses on vehicle shop repair owners and managers. We're expanding in that space and you can see it in this group's numbers.
Our diagnostics and Mitchell 1 divisions, already strong and independent repair shops, continue to better their positions. In addition to the successful new Verdict handheld I mentioned earlier, Mitchell 1 released a new version of its shop management software, with significant success. We've made investments in this area and it's paying off.
Well, that gives you a little color on the quarter. Significant sales increases and encouraging profitability, strengthening strategic position and ample runways for further growth.
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for the financial review."

Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales for the third quarter of $653 million increased 12.3% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, sales increased 13.4%. As Nick mentioned, the primary drivers behin",1807,"Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales for the third quarter of $653 million increased 12.3% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, sales increased 13.4%. As Nick mentioned, the primary drivers behind the $71 million year-over-year sales increase include significantly higher sales to customers in credit critical industries and emerging markets, as well as double-digit increases in worldwide equipment and sales to franchisees in the United States.
Consolidated gross profit of $301 million increased $40.7 million year-over-year, driven by higher sales, improved manufacturing utilization and savings from ongoing Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI initiatives and restructuring actions.
Foreign currency benefited gross profit by $2.7 million, while lower year-over-year restructuring cost contributed another $2 million. The overall benefits from improved manufacturing utilization, RCI, currency and lower restructuring, were partially offset by $4.1 million of higher year-over-year LIFO-related inventory expense.
As a result of these factors, consolidated gross margin improved 130 basis points to 46.1% as compared to 44.8% last year. Operating expenses in the quarter increased $15.9 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses, including higher cost as a result of increased participation at our 2010 Annual Franchisee Conference.
Year-over-year, operating expenses also included $4.1 million of higher U.S. pension expense, largely due to lower-than-projected asset returns in previous years.
These increases were partially offset by lower bad debt expense, favorable currency translations and savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. As a percent of sales, operating expenses of 34% in the quarter improved 150 basis points from 35.5% last year.
Operating earnings of $78.8 million, before Financial Services, improved $24.8 million, which is a 45.9% year-over-year increase on 12.3% of higher sales.
Including Financial Services, operating earnings increased $35.1 million or 72.1% over 2009 levels. As a percentage of total revenues, operating earnings increased 420 basis points from 8.3% last year to 12.5% this year.
Financial Services operating earnings of $5 million in the quarter improved $10.3 million from the third quarter 2009 loss of $5.3 million. On a sequential basis, Financial Services operating earnings improved $3.3 million from second quarter 2010 levels. As expected, operating income from Financial Services, which is before interest expense, continues to improve as the on-book finance portfolio grows.
The third quarter effective income tax rates were 34.4% in 2010 and 29.3% last year. The lower rate in 2009 reflects the favorable resolution of certain tax matters, as well as the favorable mix of foreign earnings.
Finally, third quarter net earnings of $46.5 million increased $21.1 million or 83% from the $25.4 million earned last year.
Let's now turn to our segment results. Beginning with the Commercial and Industrial or C&I group on Slide 7, segment sales of $261 million improved 19.5% from prior-year levels. Excluding the impact of currency translation, organic sales increased 21.2%. The year-over-year sales increase was again driven by higher sales across all operating units, with particularly strong increases in those businesses serving customers in critical industries and emerging markets.
Gross profit in the C&I segment of $96.2 million increased $25.9 million or 36.8% from 2009 levels. This increase is primarily due to higher sales and $3.5 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. The gross profit comparison also benefited from improved manufacturing utilization, primarily in Europe, as a result of increasing production levels. For the quarter, gross margin of 36.8% improved 460 basis points from 32.2% last year. Operating expenses in the quarter of $65.6 million increased $4.8 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses and increased restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses improved by 280 basis points year-over-year.
Operating margin in the C&I segment of 11.7% in the third quarter of 2010 improved 740 basis points from 4.3% last year. Turning now to Slide 8. On a worldwide basis, third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $259 million increased 10.8% from 2009 levels, including a 12.8% increase in United States. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $108 million in the quarter increased $3.4 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher sales and favorable currency effects. The year-over-year gross profit comparison was also impacted by higher cost associated with increased franchisee product-related programs and by $4.1 million of higher LIFO-related expense.
LIFO-related expense was $600,000 in the third quarter of 2010. Last year, as a result of lower production and inventory reduction efforts, the LIFO-related benefit was $3.5 million.
As a percentage of sales, gross margin in the quarter was 41.6% as compared to 44.7% last year. Third quarter operating expenses of $79.5 million in the Snap-on Tools Group increased $4.7 million from 2009. This is primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses, as a result of increased participation at this year's Annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, which focused primarily on the development and profitability of the franchise network. In the quarter, we also incurred higher cost associated with the development of a new and expanded product catalog that was deferred from 2009 to 2010.
We view these increased costs as longer-term investments in our business. As a percentage of sales, operating expense in the quarter improved 140 basis points from 32.1% last year to 30.7% this year. Third quarter operating income for the Snap-on Tools segment was $28.2 million or 10.9% of sales compared to $29.5 million or 12.6% of sales last year.
After adjusting for LIFO in both years, operating income in the quarter increased $2.8 million or 10.8% year-over-year. And as a percentage of sales, was 11.1% in both years.
Turning to Slide 9, in the Repair Systems and Information or RS&I segment, third quarter sales of $207 million were up 8.1% from 2009 levels. Excluding currency, organic sales were up 10.1%, primarily due to higher worldwide sales of equipment, increased essential tool and facilitation program sales, and higher diagnostic sales in Mitchell 1 information products. These increases were partially offset by the anticipated lower electronic parts catalog sales in North America, as a result of OEM dealership consolidations.
Gross profit of $97.3 million in the quarter increased $11.4 million or 13.3% from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher sales, lower restructuring costs, material cost reductions and continued savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. Gross margin in the quarter of 46.9% improved 210 basis points over 44.8% last year.
Operating expenses of $55.6 million in the quarter were essentially flat with 2009 levels, as higher volume-related, product development and other expenses were largely offset by lower restructuring costs, favorable currency translation, savings from RCI and restructuring initiatives, as well as lower bad debt expense.
As a percentage of sales, operating expenses improved 210 basis points year-over-year. Operating earnings of $41.7 million in the quarter increased $11.2 million or 37%. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the RS&I group improved 420 basis points from 15.9% last year to 20.1% this year.
Turning now to Slide 10. Financial Services operating earnings of $5 million in the quarter compares favorably to both second quarter 2010 earnings of $1.7 million and to the third quarter 2009 loss of $5.3 million. The $10.3 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings primarily reflects the higher revenue contributions from Snap-on credits, growing on-book financed portfolio.
As you know, since July of last year, we are no longer selling loan contracts to CIT and recording gains on sale. Rather, we are building an on-balance sheet, interests-yielding portfolio. As this portfolio grows, so will our Financial Services operating earnings.
Moving to Slide 11. As the third quarter end, our balance sheet includes gross financing receivables of $528 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation and $139 million from our international finance subsidiaries, for a total financing portfolio of $667 million. In the United States, $445 million of the portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Snap-on continues to manage the run off portfolio of contracts owned by CIT, which totaled $317 million at third quarter end, down $67 million from second quarter levels. For the full year, we continue to expect that the on-book financing portfolio at Snap-on credit, will have grown by approximately $300 million, resulting in a year-end U.S. finance portfolio of about $565 million to $570 million.
Regarding Finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations and have improved compared to both Q1 and Q2 levels. Turning to Slide 12, consolidated operating cash flow for the quarter was $10.2 million. At the end of the third quarter, our cash position of $360 million declined $71 million from second quarter 2010 levels, primarily due to the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit. 
Since second quarter end, net financing contract receivables increased $85 million. In the quarter, capital spending of $10.5 million was down from 2009 levels, primarily due to last year's construction of a new R&D facility in Richfield, Ohio and the accelerated expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in emerging markets.
As seen on Slide 13, since last year end, trade and other receivables increased $20.6 million and day sales outstanding improved to 62 days. Inventories increased $50 million from 2009 year end, primarily due to higher production levels as a result of increased customer demand. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns improved to 4.5 turns as compared to 4.1 turns at 2009 year end.
Net debt at the end of the quarter was $571 million. Our net debt to capital ratio of 29.2% compares to 22.2% at 2009 year end. Excluding approximately $108 million of cash, currently withheld related to the previously disclosed dispute with CIT, our net debt to capital ratio as of the end of the third quarter would have been 32.9%.
In addition to $360 million of cash, we continue to maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility and $20 million of committed bank lines. Most recently, on October 1, we entered into a loan and servicing agreement that allows us to secure additional borrowings of up to $100 million through the pledging of Snap-on Credit finance receivables, under an asset-backed securitization facility.
This agreement provides us with additional available credit capacity and funding diversification that supplements our existing credit agreements. As of third quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. This concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. Before turning the call back to Nick, I'd like to review our outlook for the balance of 2010. 
For the full year, we expect to incur approximately $15 million of restructuring costs and approximately $45 million for capital expenditures. We continue to expect that full year 2010 pension expense will be $16 million higher than last year. Finally, the anticipated effective income tax rate for full year 2010 will approximate 33.6%. Before opening the call for questions, Nick would like to provide some final thoughts. Nick?"

Look, I'll close by saying again that our performance in the quarter was quite encouraging. We believe it represents strong confirmation that Snap-on is a company with unique strengths, ongoing opportunity for improvement and extended runways for growth.
Going into the downturn, we assessed the macroeconomic difficulties saying that big-ticket long payback items were important. They would help lead our recovery, and they have. We said that we would invest in strategic areas that would be decisive going forward, and those efforts appear to be working well. We've maintained our van network. It's more enthusiastic and more stable than when we entered the difficulties. 
We said that critical industries would be a corridor of growth. We're growing strongly in that arena. The industrial division was up 34% for the quarter. We were convinced that our technology and reputation would enable expansion with repair shop owners. Equipment and RS&I are confirming that belief. Equipment shook off the natural third quarter headwind and grew strongly in both the U.S. and Europe. And we said emerging markets, presented with the unique opportunity if physically provisioned, would help us grow, and we are growing and gaining in those areas. Those regions are growing at deep double digits, well ahead of even the robust GDPs.
No one can predict how the environment will unfold. The economies of the world are still fragile. Having said that however, we now have three quarters of positive Snap-on momentum. The situation seems to be playing out as we've expected, and our strategic programs are successful. Because of all that, we're more confident than ever before that Snap-on is well-positioned to take strong advantage of the future. Strong advantage of the future in whatever shape it unfolds.
Before taking questions, I want to end by thanking the people responsible for these encouraging results: our associates and franchisees. I know as usual many of you are listening. These results would not have been possible without your capability and your dedication. I thank you for your support and I congratulate you on your success.

It seems to be bumping along the bottom. So I don't know when that's going to recover. So in terms of looking at where improvement's going to come from and looking for recovery, I have a question mark myself about Southern Europe. If you're talking about commodity, you could talk about commodity prices. A lot of is talked about in terms of commodity. We don't see, for us, a major headwind, because we do get commodity prices, but as you know, Jim, a lot of our products are not so much material as they are labor. So our increases are not very devastating, and plus, we generally can price recognized commodity increases, so that's not such a problem for us. You could say, you could take a look at critical industries and say, ""Okay, well, will the military spend as much as they have in the past?” Maybe they won't, that could be a headwind that we have to offset some places. Some people are talking about restocking, but for us, we see almost none. So the 34% we saw in the critical industries and the Industrial division in third quarter had almost no restocking. I can tell you that we just went through our quarterly reviews here, and I don't think restocking came up at all in a week of discussion. So we're not seeing that as a factor. So for us, the headwinds are mostly around what's going to happen in Southern Europe. Could there be some variation and some cooling in critical industries, but we don't expect a lot. We expect that to continue reasonably good because we've seen it for many quarters now. And some of the traditional headwinds for some other businesses like commodities or restocking, we don't see in our future."

So, when we sell a kit to an aerospace company, or we sell a kit to the military, we're usually displacing a number of different competitors. When we sell to Shanghai Airlines, we may be replacing a German competitor, a Japanese competitor and a Chinese competitor at the same time. So, it's a mix."

Well, Snap-on had another quarter of improved year-over-year performance. And on top of that, we saw some favorable market signals, so it's very encouraging.

And on top of that, we saw some favorable market signals, so it's very encouraging. We believe there's now clear evidence of a building Snap-on strength in the recovery market. Overall, our organic sales were up 13.4%. Solid by any measure. And that's after being up 9.5% the second quarter and 4% in the first quarter. Needless to say, we like that trend.
Operating income rose 72% from last year, with Financial Services contributing profitability, as projected, improving its performance as it springs the loan portfolio on the Snap-on books. The operating company OI, without Financial Services increased by a strong 46%. So again, overall we're encouraged by the strength of the quarter. And that result was in the face of an unfavorable swing in LIFO.
We would say our runways for growth our clearing and our Snap-on value creation processes around safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI, they continue to drive progress.
So having said that, let me give you a bit of color and my perspective on the trends we see. With respect to the economic environment and the impacts on our markets, there are some nice positives. It was our third straight quarter of increasing year-over-year gain. So that alone indicates a better environment. And there is also a building momentum in some of our most strategically important areas. In our core Auto Repair business, in emerging markets and critical industries. All areas where we see clear long-term runway.
Now the third quarter is seasonally our most challenging. It can be quite variable. So it's sometimes difficult to draw extended conclusions from the results. But having said that, Snap-on's quarter was robust, completely overcoming the typical season low.
We often talk about big-ticket items, higher-priced products that either have longer payback, like diagnostics or undercar equipment, or are more discretionary, like tool-storage units. Activity here is usually a barometer of our customers' overall financial health, and of their confidence. You'll recall that during the downturn last year, we saw quite a bit of variation from period-to-period in big-ticket purchases. But with these results, we've now put together three quarters in a row of year-over-year increases in all three big-ticket categories. They're all back now to pre-downturn levels.
In the Tools group, both diagnostics and tool-storage units showed significant gains. A real help in this was our new diagnostics handheld unit called The Verdict. It was launched at our annual franchise e-conference in August and it got great reviews. It's a fully functional unit that we believe sets a new industry standard with features like a detachable wireless touch screen display, remote use from anywhere in the garage, WiFi internet capability and access to Snap-on's unique repair information database.
The Verdict is clearly an innovation. It provides real productivity technicians and, as you'd expect, reception has been very strong.
Beyond the vans, our Equipment division, part of the repair systems and information or RS&I group, showed strong year-over-year gains. In particular in its big-ticket undercar product, that's what Equipment sells, it achieved gains in both North America and Europe, well ahead of our company's overall sales increase. In fact, Equipment volumes were even slightly ahead of the second quarter. A third quarter sequential increase is very rare for this business, because a large presence in Europe and the associated seasonality usually make July through September a tough period. So this quarter's sequential increase in Equipment sales was a big win.
From a geographical standpoint, there hasn't been much change in their regional market landscape. North America showed gains that were a bit better than those recorded worldwide. Europe's recovery is generally a little weaker. We were, however, up double digits, though the story there continues to vary region by region. In the South, especially Spain, there still hasn't been much improvement. Spain is important for us because that's in Europe. Our European-based Hand Tools business has an exceptionally strong presence.
On the other hand, the North is decisively more positive. Sales and markets like Germany, Sweden and Finland all grew strongly. So Europe is still mixed, but for us, up double digits overall.
With respect to emerging markets, places where we've made investments and are focused on expansion like Eastern Europe, we saw a strong growth in Russia, again in the quarter, up nearly 50%. And Asia-Pacific continued a steep growth curve, significantly higher than our overall increase, with India and China both setting the pace. China continues to sell out all the bandsaws it can produce, and the Indian sales team is now gaining real traction in the undercar equipment market.
So that's some perspective on the global environment, a varied landscape but increasing almost everywhere. Now for some highlights on the operating segments. Commercial Industrial, or C&I, saw volumes up around about $45 million. That's more than a 21% increase. Operating earnings rose $21 million, with those increased volumes and strong RCI results driving the improvement. RCI results in the quarter are a dramatic testimony to the ongoing power of our Snap-on value creation processes. They've contributed greatly to our progress so far, and we're confident there's still much more opportunity to go.
We've often spoke about the runway in critical industries, where the tasks absolutely need to be accomplished without fail. While recently, we had graphic evidence of such a situation. Many watched the dramatic rescue of the minors in Chile as it was broadcast around the globe. It was a great story. And you could clearly see SNA Europe's Bahco-branded tools on the scene, assisting in the rescue, accomplishing the critical mission of the quarter. 
So our performance, but while that's an interesting sidebar, I think I'd like to talk about our performance in the Industrial business. One of the real positives for the company this past quarter. Near-record sales, trailing only the fourth quarter of 2008 in volumes, a really strong quarter. Our Industrial business was up 34% and that gain was across the globe.
And that was without much restocking. We believe that, that is evidence of our success in moving the Snap-on brand out of the vehicle garage and into critical industries everywhere. Look, it's clear that overall economic activities is not at precrisis levels, but we still achieved a near-record quarter in the space. It shows we are making significant gains in this strategic area.
I've also mentioned in the past that we're expanding our product offering, aimed specifically at critical industries like power generation, mining and aerospace. It's paying off. Along those lines, innovation's played a big part of Snap-on's history, and that tradition continues today. Just this past quarter, we launched our new automated tool control or ATC tool-storage product, aimed squarely at the aerospace sector. We've taken our sophisticated digital imaging technology, which is a huge competitive advantage for us in car aligners, and transformed tool-storage boxes into high-tech assets.
Paired with a keyless entry system that laser technology scans the tool drawer. It knows who checked out and who returned every tool, every time. It's important to know where your tools are when you're working on jet engines. ATC accomplishes that task like no other product, and it's a great system, and we've started to see our first sales in the quarter. 
The ATC technology is only one example of leveraging Snap-on's breadth and depth to drive the company's presence in critical industries. We're collaborating widely across business operations to maximize opportunities by applying our existing advantages in one sector to develop opportunities and others.
Critical industries such as power generation and aerospace, military and mining and many others, we're well positioned to modify our core product and technologies to meet the unique requirements. The third quarter is more evidence that it's working.
A good portion of our effort in emerging markets gets reflected in C&I. So I'll talk about that now. I touched on the strong increases earlier. And that growth only comes with expanded physicals, presence and products. And we're aggressively building both in those markets. 
In Asia, we're increasing manufacturing capabilities both in Kunshan and in Zhoushan, where our Wanda acquisition is based. And we recently launched our Asian handheld diagnostics unit. It's our first, specifically tailored for the region, and there's more in the pipeline. In Eastern Europe, last year, we built the plants in Belarus. 
Just this past month, we have the official inauguration. And included government dignitaries in broad TV coverage. It was great exposure for the innovative technologies we're bringing to the region. And it's just the type of presence and recognition that helps in building a distribution network, creating a foothold and in generating the strong sales increase we've seen in this quarter in Eastern Europe.
That's C&I. Let's move to the Tools group. We've seen a return to pre-downturn sales level. Overall volume is up nearly 11%. In the U.S., better, at nearly 13%. OI margin is same as last year after adjusting for a $4 million negative LIFO swing. 
These results reflect our balanced approach to maintain the strength of our powerful franchise system. We've invested significantly in training and product support to keep our network robust. In that way, in August, we held our annual Snap-on franchisee's conference. It's annual, but this one was special. It served as the highlight of our 90th anniversary celebration. We've been in business for nine decades, and it was a significant success. Record attendance, more product, more training seminars and a business and profit center aimed specifically at helping our franchisees improve their business efficiencies. It was really popular.
The mood of the conference was very positive, I can tell you. The franchisees are upbeat about their prospects. They enthusiastically embraced Snap-on's coherent focus on making work easier for professionals who perform critical tasks. And because they know our whole organization is behind that mission across the globe in all of our division, they believe strongly in their future with our company.
We've spoken in the past about the Snap-on stimulus program. Well the best stimulus we can provide is great product. So we're encouraged that we were recently recognized for just that. Snap-on was named the overall best brand in six categories of tools by Frost & Sullivan in their 2010 Survey of Technicians. Snap-on carried the number one ranking by wide margins. 
For example, in hand tools, 70% of the technicians preferred the Snap-on brand. The nearest competitor had an 8% share. In diagnostics, the winning margin was 46% to 9%, and the numbers for tool storage were 62% Snap-on, the highest other brand, 8%. Our products were also recognized in the quarter by professional tool and equipment news. The Snap-on low-profile ratchet and the Quadriga tire changer were both recognized by that publication for outstanding innovations in vehicle repair. Now this award is special, because it was based on the opinion of professional users, the people that gain productivity by actually using Snap-on. So that says a lot.
I already mentioned the recovery in big-ticket items. Many of those sales are through our vans, on credit. And that credit has been available without disruption throughout the integration of Snap-on Credit. Our Financial Service business is performing as we predicted, becoming increasingly profitable as the loan portfolio moves onto our books. And that successful integration of Snap-on Credit has had a significant hand in supporting the sales growth.
Now to some discussion of the RS&I group. Sales up about 10% or $19 million excluding currency. OI up 11.2%. I already mentioned the Equipment division's big-ticket sales gains in both in both North America and Europe. The strong increases of Equipment are a big part of our RS&I progress. Remember that the RS&I portfolio is where we have our exposure to the North American OEMs, and their contraction of their dealerships. So Snap-on Business Solutions does continue to be impacted by that disruption. 
We did however, in the quarter, achieve more offsets with increasing activity and OEM essential tools and diagnostics programs. We're also gaining in heavy-duty diagnostics products, supplying to truck-shop owners in greater volumes than ever before. And you'll probably remember that RS&I focuses on vehicle shop repair owners and managers. We're expanding in that space and you can see it in this group's numbers.
Our diagnostics and Mitchell 1 divisions, already strong and independent repair shops, continue to better their positions. In addition to the successful new Verdict handheld I mentioned earlier, Mitchell 1 released a new version of its shop management software, with significant success. We've made investments in this area and it's paying off.
Well, that gives you a little color on the quarter. Significant sales increases and encouraging profitability, strengthening strategic position and ample runways for further growth.
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for the financial review."

Net sales for the third quarter of $653 million increased 12.3% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, sales increased 13.4%. As Nick mentioned, the primary drivers behind the $71 million year-over-year sales increase include significantly higher sales to customers in credit critical industries and emerging markets, as well as double-digit increases in worldwide equipment and sales to franchisees in the United States.
Consolidated gross profit of $301 million increased $40.7 million year-over-year, driven by higher sales, improved manufacturing utilization and savings from ongoing Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI initiatives and restructuring actions.
Foreign currency benefited gross profit by $2.7 million, while lower year-over-year restructuring cost contributed another $2 million. The overall benefits from improved manufacturing utilization, RCI, currency and lower restructuring, were partially offset by $4.1 million of higher year-over-year LIFO-related inventory expense.
As a result of these factors, consolidated gross margin improved 130 basis points to 46.1% as compared to 44.8% last year. Operating expenses in the quarter increased $15.9 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses, including higher cost as a result of increased participation at our 2010 Annual Franchisee Conference.
Year-over-year, operating expenses also included $4.1 million of higher U.S. pension expense, largely due to lower-than-projected asset returns in previous years.
These increases were partially offset by lower bad debt expense, favorable currency translations and savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. As a percent of sales, operating expenses of 34% in the quarter improved 150 basis points from 35.5% last year.
Operating earnings of $78.8 million, before Financial Services, improved $24.8 million, which is a 45.9% year-over-year increase on 12.3% of higher sales.
Including Financial Services, operating earnings increased $35.1 million or 72.1% over 2009 levels. As a percentage of total revenues, operating earnings increased 420 basis points from 8.3% last year to 12.5% this year.
Financial Services operating earnings of $5 million in the quarter improved $10.3 million from the third quarter 2009 loss of $5.3 million. On a sequential basis, Financial Services operating earnings improved $3.3 million from second quarter 2010 levels. As expected, operating income from Financial Services, which is before interest expense, continues to improve as the on-book finance portfolio grows.
The third quarter effective income tax rates were 34.4% in 2010 and 29.3% last year. The lower rate in 2009 reflects the favorable resolution of certain tax matters, as well as the favorable mix of foreign earnings.
Finally, third quarter net earnings of $46.5 million increased $21.1 million or 83% from the $25.4 million earned last year.
Let's now turn to our segment results. Beginning with the Commercial and Industrial or C&I group on Slide 7, segment sales of $261 million improved 19.5% from prior-year levels. Excluding the impact of currency translation, organic sales increased 21.2%. The year-over-year sales increase was again driven by higher sales across all operating units, with particularly strong increases in those businesses serving customers in critical industries and emerging markets.
Gross profit in the C&I segment of $96.2 million increased $25.9 million or 36.8% from 2009 levels. This increase is primarily due to higher sales and $3.5 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. The gross profit comparison also benefited from improved manufacturing utilization, primarily in Europe, as a result of increasing production levels. For the quarter, gross margin of 36.8% improved 460 basis points from 32.2% last year. Operating expenses in the quarter of $65.6 million increased $4.8 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses and increased restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses improved by 280 basis points year-over-year.
Operating margin in the C&I segment of 11.7% in the third quarter of 2010 improved 740 basis points from 4.3% last year. Turning now to Slide 8. On a worldwide basis, third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $259 million increased 10.8% from 2009 levels, including a 12.8% increase in United States. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $108 million in the quarter increased $3.4 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher sales and favorable currency effects. The year-over-year gross profit comparison was also impacted by higher cost associated with increased franchisee product-related programs and by $4.1 million of higher LIFO-related expense.
LIFO-related expense was $600,000 in the third quarter of 2010. Last year, as a result of lower production and inventory reduction efforts, the LIFO-related benefit was $3.5 million.
As a percentage of sales, gross margin in the quarter was 41.6% as compared to 44.7% last year. Third quarter operating expenses of $79.5 million in the Snap-on Tools Group increased $4.7 million from 2009. This is primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses, as a result of increased participation at this year's Annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, which focused primarily on the development and profitability of the franchise network. In the quarter, we also incurred higher cost associated with the development of a new and expanded product catalog that was deferred from 2009 to 2010.
We view these increased costs as longer-term investments in our business. As a percentage of sales, operating expense in the quarter improved 140 basis points from 32.1% last year to 30.7% this year. Third quarter operating income for the Snap-on Tools segment was $28.2 million or 10.9% of sales compared to $29.5 million or 12.6% of sales last year.
After adjusting for LIFO in both years, operating income in the quarter increased $2.8 million or 10.8% year-over-year. And as a percentage of sales, was 11.1% in both years.
Turning to Slide 9, in the Repair Systems and Information or RS&I segment, third quarter sales of $207 million were up 8.1% from 2009 levels. Excluding currency, organic sales were up 10.1%, primarily due to higher worldwide sales of equipment, increased essential tool and facilitation program sales, and higher diagnostic sales in Mitchell 1 information products. These increases were partially offset by the anticipated lower electronic parts catalog sales in North America, as a result of OEM dealership consolidations.
Gross profit of $97.3 million in the quarter increased $11.4 million or 13.3% from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher sales, lower restructuring costs, material cost reductions and continued savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. Gross margin in the quarter of 46.9% improved 210 basis points over 44.8% last year.
Operating expenses of $55.6 million in the quarter were essentially flat with 2009 levels, as higher volume-related, product development and other expenses were largely offset by lower restructuring costs, favorable currency translation, savings from RCI and restructuring initiatives, as well as lower bad debt expense.
As a percentage of sales, operating expenses improved 210 basis points year-over-year. Operating earnings of $41.7 million in the quarter increased $11.2 million or 37%. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the RS&I group improved 420 basis points from 15.9% last year to 20.1% this year.
Turning now to Slide 10. Financial Services operating earnings of $5 million in the quarter compares favorably to both second quarter 2010 earnings of $1.7 million and to the third quarter 2009 loss of $5.3 million. The $10.3 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings primarily reflects the higher revenue contributions from Snap-on credits, growing on-book financed portfolio.
As you know, since July of last year, we are no longer selling loan contracts to CIT and recording gains on sale. Rather, we are building an on-balance sheet, interests-yielding portfolio. As this portfolio grows, so will our Financial Services operating earnings.
Moving to Slide 11. As the third quarter end, our balance sheet includes gross financing receivables of $528 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation and $139 million from our international finance subsidiaries, for a total financing portfolio of $667 million. In the United States, $445 million of the portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Snap-on continues to manage the run off portfolio of contracts owned by CIT, which totaled $317 million at third quarter end, down $67 million from second quarter levels. For the full year, we continue to expect that the on-book financing portfolio at Snap-on credit, will have grown by approximately $300 million, resulting in a year-end U.S. finance portfolio of about $565 million to $570 million.
Regarding Finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations and have improved compared to both Q1 and Q2 levels. Turning to Slide 12, consolidated operating cash flow for the quarter was $10.2 million. At the end of the third quarter, our cash position of $360 million declined $71 million from second quarter 2010 levels, primarily due to the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit. 
Since second quarter end, net financing contract receivables increased $85 million. In the quarter, capital spending of $10.5 million was down from 2009 levels, primarily due to last year's construction of a new R&D facility in Richfield, Ohio and the accelerated expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in emerging markets.
As seen on Slide 13, since last year end, trade and other receivables increased $20.6 million and day sales outstanding improved to 62 days. Inventories increased $50 million from 2009 year end, primarily due to higher production levels as a result of increased customer demand. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns improved to 4.5 turns as compared to 4.1 turns at 2009 year end.
Net debt at the end of the quarter was $571 million. Our net debt to capital ratio of 29.2% compares to 22.2% at 2009 year end. Excluding approximately $108 million of cash, currently withheld related to the previously disclosed dispute with CIT, our net debt to capital ratio as of the end of the third quarter would have been 32.9%.
In addition to $360 million of cash, we continue to maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility and $20 million of committed bank lines. Most recently, on October 1, we entered into a loan and servicing agreement that allows us to secure additional borrowings of up to $100 million through the pledging of Snap-on Credit finance receivables, under an asset-backed securitization facility.
This agreement provides us with additional available credit capacity and funding diversification that supplements our existing credit agreements. As of third quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. This concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. Before turning the call back to Nick, I'd like to review our outlook for the balance of 2010. 
For the full year, we expect to incur approximately $15 million of restructuring costs and approximately $45 million for capital expenditures. We continue to expect that full year 2010 pension expense will be $16 million higher than last year. Finally, the anticipated effective income tax rate for full year 2010 will approximate 33.6%. Before opening the call for questions, Nick would like to provide some final thoughts. Nick?"

Look, I'll close by saying again that our performance in the quarter was quite encouraging. We believe it represents strong confirmation that Snap-on is a company with unique strengths, ongoing opportunity for improvement and extended runways for growth.
Going into the downturn, we assessed the macroeconomic difficulties saying that big-ticket long payback items were important. They would help lead our recovery, and they have. We said that we would invest in strategic areas that would be decisive going forward, and those efforts appear to be working well. We've maintained our van network. It's more enthusiastic and more stable than when we entered the difficulties. 
We said that critical industries would be a corridor of growth. We're growing strongly in that arena. The industrial division was up 34% for the quarter. We were convinced that our technology and reputation would enable expansion with repair shop owners. Equipment and RS&I are confirming that belief. Equipment shook off the natural third quarter headwind and grew strongly in both the U.S. and Europe. And we said emerging markets, presented with the unique opportunity if physically provisioned, would help us grow, and we are growing and gaining in those areas. Those regions are growing at deep double digits, well ahead of even the robust GDPs.
No one can predict how the environment will unfold. The economies of the world are still fragile. Having said that however, we now have three quarters of positive Snap-on momentum. The situation seems to be playing out as we've expected, and our strategic programs are successful. Because of all that, we're more confident than ever before that Snap-on is well-positioned to take strong advantage of the future. Strong advantage of the future in whatever shape it unfolds.
Before taking questions, I want to end by thanking the people responsible for these encouraging results: our associates and franchisees. I know as usual many of you are listening. These results would not have been possible without your capability and your dedication. I thank you for your support and I congratulate you on your success.
Operator, now we'll take questions."

It seems to be bumping along the bottom. So I don't know when that's going to recover. So in terms of looking at where improvement's going to come from and looking for recovery, I have a question mark myself about Southern Europe. If you're talking about commodity, you could talk about commodity prices. A lot of is talked about in terms of commodity. We don't see, for us, a major headwind, because we do get commodity prices, but as you know, Jim, a lot of our products are not so much material as they are labor. So our increases are not very devastating, and plus, we generally can price recognized commodity increases, so that's not such a problem for us. You could say, you could take a look at critical industries and say, ""Okay, well, will the military spend as much as they have in the past?” Maybe they won't, that could be a headwind that we have to offset some places. Some people are talking about restocking, but for us, we see almost none. So the 34% we saw in the critical industries and the Industrial division in third quarter had almost no restocking. I can tell you that we just went through our quarterly reviews here, and I don't think restocking came up at all in a week of discussion. So we're not seeing that as a factor. So for us, the headwinds are mostly around what's going to happen in Southern Europe. Could there be some variation and some cooling in critical industries, but we don't expect a lot. We expect that to continue reasonably good because we've seen it for many quarters now. And some of the traditional headwinds for some other businesses like commodities or restocking, we don't see in our future."

We also see opportunities to grow our van business, but those are three places: critical industries, repair shop owners, and emerging markets. And I see those businesses being a bigger part of our company. We're going to continue to pursue, roll down those runways. Because the third quarter, I think, is abundant evidence that those runways are clearing for us. Now we've said, I think, that moving forward, after the recession recovers, after we recover from the recession, after recession recovery goes away, we believe we can register between 4% and 6% organic growth consistently. And we believe we can drive towards a strong mid-teen OI margins. And we believe that we'll get that through organic growth, and then also in those critical runways, we can find bolt-on acquisitions. So I see us pursuing that moving forward."

And it's on top of, if you go back prerecession, we we're growing strong double digits in a moderate economy in that area, so I think this is just extension of that. Of course, we're growing share in emerging markets. And I think one of the places where our people on the ground say we're expanding is in Europe. Europe was up double digits even though it isn't back to '08 levels. Everybody, a lot of people are saying we're up in Europe, but what we see in Europe is the customers aren't going away, but the smaller players seem to be contracting. So our people on the ground in Europe say we're gaining share even there. I can't parse between, I can't tell you which part of that is share increase and return, but if you look at places like Equipment and critical industries, Equipment's up strong double digits, almost 20% or over 20%, critical industries are up 30%, you see Europe up double digits.
