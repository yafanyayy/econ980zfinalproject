We are very pleased with our financial performance for all of 2009.

We are very pleased with our financial performance for all of 2009. FLIR recorded its ninth straight year of record revenue, operating income and earnings per share, and achieved the highest operating income margin in our company's history. For all of 2009, revenue increased by 7% to $1.15 billion. We earned $1.45 per share, an increase of 13% compared to '08. We set a record for cash flow from operations, which reached $272 million or 118% of net income. The soft worldwide economy affected our Thermography business the most in 2009, as revenues declined by 13%. But through good expense management, strong gross margins, Thermography operating income rose by 3% for the year. Our Commercial Vision Systems revenue grew by 14% in 2009, and operating profit rose by 32%. These businesses, which, effectively January 1, have been combined into a new Commercial Systems division, are exceptionally well-positioned. And we expect them to post very good growth in 2010.Government Systems had another good year in 2009, with revenue up 15% and operating income up by 22%. We issued our initial outlook for 2010 this morning. For the full year, we currently expect net revenue in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion and earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $1.48 to $1.53. Good growth from Commercial Systems with stabilizing worldwide demand, continued growth in Asia and the impact of numerous new product introductions support our 2009 view. Government Systems, which has grown at a compound rate of 36% for the past three years, will slow in 2010 due largely to the anticipated decline in deliveries of the BETTS-C program and its related programs. However, we expect the core Government Systems business to again perform well in 2010. With that, we'll have each of the company's Presidents talk, beginning with Arne Almerfors. Thank you, Arne.[p id=""327425"" name=""Arne Almerfors"" /> Thank you, Earl. Thermography revenue in Q4 was $84.8 million, a decrease of 4% from the fourth quarter of 2008, up 21% from the second quarter, reflecting stabilizing demand, as well as normal seasonal pattern. For all of 2009, revenue was $285.5 million, a decrease of 13% from 2008. Revenue in both the U.S. and Europe were down during 2009, reflecting the impact of the global recession. Revenue in the U.S. increased 5% in the fourth quarter due to growth in the High Volume segment market. Asia-Pacific was the bright spot during the year, as revenue grew over 75%. As a result of our month to year infrastructure investment, Asia-Pacific had healthy growth during the year, particularly in China, Japan and Korea. Thermography operating margin in Q4 was 27%, up from 26% last year due to improved gross margins and cost controls. Q4 operating margin was the highest in two years. And despite lower revenue, operating income of $23.3 million was up 3% over 2008, highlighting our ability to manage the business effectively in a difficult economic environment.For the market segment perspective, the Building market continue to do well in the fourth quarter and represents about 30% of revenue. The Building market has been particularly strong in the U.S. and Europe where government regulations and incentives have helped drive demand. The Electrical & Mechanical market holds about 30% of revenue was slow in the fourth quarter, reflecting continued depressed capital spending activity in the U.S. and Europe. The Electrical & Mechanical market is experiencing growth in Asia-Pacific, as infrastructure development drives demand. In addition, we experienced strong demand for cameras used to detect elevated body temperature in an effort to contain swine flu, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. In the High Volume segment, we recently reduced the street price of our low-cost i5 camera to rent to $1,195 to further stimulate price elastic demand. We also introduced the i7 camera, a higher resolution variant of the same platform at the $2,995 price point. These changes resulted in a year-over-year increase in units of 80%. We expect continued growth in this segment as the economy improves and distribution expands. And I will now turn the call over to Andrew Teich, President of our newly-formed Commercial System division."

There are many similarities between the two businesses, which can be leveraged to create value for FLIR. Both are pursuing commercial customers, both are exploiting the price elasticity of the market, with lower cost uncooled products and both utilize a third-party distribution model in their go-to-market strategy. I look forward to uniting the two divisions and building on our global leadership position in the commercial infrared market.Turning to CVS, the division had a terrific fourth quarter. Revenue was $57 million, an increase of 34% compared to the fourth quarter a year ago and the fastest growth rate in nearly two years. Revenue for the full year of 2009 was $206.3 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year. Backlog increased $10 million during the quarter to $103 million due to strong orders in U.S. course in components and security and surveillance markets. Operating income for Q4 was $13 million, up 61% from the prior year and the second highest in CVS history. Operating margins were 23%, up four percentage points from the prior year due primarily to leveraging of operating costs. Operating income for all of 2009 was $49.3 million, an increase of 32% over the prior year.Demand in the security and surveillance market was excellent around the world, as worldwide orders were up over 3x from the third quarter. Orders for short-range cameras were up significantly, as we trend towards more private industry funding. While we will continue to target large-order programs through our network of integrators, the foundation of our Security business is rapidly moving towards our higher volume, lower priced, uncooled short and mid-range system. Bookings in the fourth quarter were particularly strong in the nuclear power industry, where our new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations require a 24/7 surveillance by April 2010. In addition, the new H-Series Hand-Held Thermal Imager gained immediate acceptance and contributed to the growth. In the maritime market, orders were flat with the prior year, as strong growth in the U.S. was offset by a decrease in Europe. Unit volumes doubled in the U.S. as the new First Mate Handheld Camera drove demand. For the year, worldwide orders were up 20%, reflecting healthy demand for a compelling new product segment in an otherwise soft market. We see the Maritime business as having great promise for the future, and we'll continue to focus on expanding distribution and working to establish a position in the maritime electronics industry. To that end, we recently added West Marine to our distribution network. West Marine is the largest nationwide mass retailer of maritime electronics products. They have 340 stores and two major catalogs. We believe West Marine channel will be increasingly important as we work to become a major player in the marine electronics industry. Demand in our Course and Component segment was up over 25% from the fourth quarter of the prior year. Orders were strong across our broad OEM customer base and included growth in a variety of commercial and military applications. Even the Auto segment, which has been slow for most of the year, grew nicely during the fourth quarter. With the addition of the Audi A8 and the Rolls Royce Ghost vehicles, we expect higher volumes for our NV2 core, resulting in lower component costs for our uncooled detectors, which support the cost target goals of products across FLIR. In late December, we announced the acquisition of Directed Perception, a leading provider of pan-tilt motion control systems for our commercial and military market. The acquisition enhances and differentiates our pan-tilt zoom camera systems for both commercial and military markets through lower costs, improve functionality and ease-of-use. We have renamed Directed Perception FLIR Motion Control Systems, and I'm delighted to work welcome their talented employees to our team. Looking to 2010, we see strong performance for the combined Commercial Systems business, driven by a stabilizing economy, a refreshed product line in many markets and the leverage efforts of our newly combined, highly capable team. That concludes my comments. Let me now turn the call over to Bill Sundermeier, President of the Government Systems division."

We increased revenue 15% to a record $655 million, increased operating income by 22% to a record $286 million and achieved operating margins of 44%. Backlog declined 22% during 2009 to $433 million at year-end due to the high shipments for the BETTS-C programs during the year. Excluding the impact of the BETTS-C programs, net orders increased modestly in 2009, led by a strong order growth internationally. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $169.7 million, a decrease of 1% from the prior year. Q4 operating income of $68.8 million was down 7%, primarily due to revenue mix and increases in R&D and the marketing activities year-over-year. Operating margins of 41% remain very strong in the quarter. Q4 order activity was slower in the U.S. as anticipated, with the late approval of government budgets. International orders continue to grow, however, with more than half of the orders received from overseas customers.With the recent release of the 2010 OCONUS [outside the continental United States] supplemental, the fiscal year 2011 U.S. Defense budget proposal and the Quadrennial Defense Review, we believe EO/IR capabilities will continue to be a priority. And Secretary Gates briefed in on the budget, he highlighted the need to expand both intelligent surveillance and reconnaissance capability and special operations capability, both areas were FLIR has been a key supplier. In addition to U.S. defense requirements, we also believe there's a growing opportunity with the Department of Homeland Security. FLIR has historically been a major supplier to both Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard. With a budget request of $56 billion, an increase of over 20% from the prior year, we believe we will see more procurement activity from DHS going forward. In the force protection area, the effort to transition the RAID portion of BETTS-C into an army program of record continues, and we now expect the effort to be completed in time for the fiscal year 2012 budget cycle. The Marines are also running a separate process to transition their GBOSS program to a program of record status, which we believe will also coincide with this fiscal year 2012 budget. There may be opportunities with the Army and the Marines to provide force protection systems prior to the completion of the program of record process, but any orders are difficult to predict at this time. They are having an ongoing dialogue with both the Army and the Marines and look forward to building our long-term relationship. In addition to force protection, another key area of growth for Government Systems is in the handheld and fixed based surveillance system. Over the past several years, we have successfully leveraged our spiral development and vertical integration capabilities to develop an attractively priced line of handheld and fixed based systems that are gaining favor with the worldwide military community. The recent acquisition of OmniTech will further enhance our capabilities in this area. Looking at 2010, we believe Government Systems revenue will be flat to slightly up during the year based on the healthy level of beginning backlog and the current factored order forecast for the year. When the planning for the Afghanistan surge is complete, we expect U.S. DoD procurement activities to improve over the year. We also expect continued growth in our international markets. Operating margins will likely decline a few points as product mix changes, and we invest to support our customer and product expansion plans. We remain very bullish on the long-term prospects for infrared systems in military applications and are excited about 2010 and beyond. That concludes my comments. Let me turn the call back over to Earl."

The decrease in average gross margin during the quarter is primarily due to the shift of product mix in both Government Systems and Commercial Vision Systems. For the year, gross margins were 57.4% as compared to 56.3% in 2008, with margin improvement related to production and manufacturing efficiencies. Research and development expense of $24.4 million or 7.8% of revenue for the quarter as compared to $21.7 million or 7.2% of revenue for the fourth quarter 2008. For the year, the company has incurred research and development expense of $91.3 million or 8% of revenue, as compared to $90 million or 8.4% of revenue during 2008.Selling, general and administrative expense for the quarter and the year of $61.7 million and $219.9 million, respectively, were constant at 19.8% and 19.2% of revenue for the period.

During the quarter, the company earned $1.7 million of other income from a number of sources, including $200,000 of currency gains, $400,000 of interest income and $1.1 million of other investment income as compared to $11.6 million of quarterly income in 2008, which included $10.2 million of currency gains during that period of 2008. For the full year 2009, other expenses amounted to a nominal $12,000 as currency losses of $3.9 million were offset with interest income of $1.7 million and other investment income of $2.1 million. This compared to 2008 other income of $20.2 million, which included currency gains of $12.9 million and interest income of $7.4 million. Based on the mix of foreign and domestic income for the full year, the effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 33.4% and 32.4% for the full year. The increase in the annual rate over the 30.8% reported in 2008 was primarily due to the change in geographic mix of earnings and higher state tax rules.For the fourth quarter, net earnings of $60.3 million or $0.38 per diluted share, as compared to earnings of $65 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the same quarter 2008.

We finished the year with cash on hand of $422 million as compared to Q3 quarter-ending cash balance of $403.3 million and a year-end 2008 cash balance of $289.4 million. During the fourth quarter, the cash increase of $18.7 million was primarily due to cash provided from operating activities of $72.3 million, cash generated from stock compensation programs of $12.2 million and cash provided by other investing activities of $4.2 million, partially offset by business acquisitions of $60.4 million, capital expenditures of $7.4 million and the negative impact of cash on the exchange rates of $2.4 million. For the year, we had an increase in cash of $132.6 million. For 2009, we generated cash from operations of $271.8 million, cash from stock compensation programs of $31.2 million and from other investment of $7.7 million. Partially offsetting these amounts were cash used of $73.6 million for acquisitions, $73.2 million used for repurchase of common stock, capital expenditures of $41.9 million and repayment of debt of approximately $2 million, and the positive impact of currency exchange rates increased cash by $12.1 million.

There's also you mentioned $486 million in the fiscal year 2011 budget, and I have the JBook in front of me here. There's $24.4 million in for Cerberus, which we are a player in. Now realize that there are four components to BETTS-C, which we play and major player in two of those, the tall RAID towers and the Cerberus programs. So there's some potential there. The actual RAID line item is empty as it was in fiscal year '09. But some new line items have come on from BETTS-C system reset at $72.5 million and initial spares at $38.7 million. So we're trying to gain more visibility into the portions of that, that might be coming our way for both for RAID replacements, as well as Cerberus systems. But don't have further detail and of course, that's FY '11 funding, and it won't flow until Q4 this year starting in October.

The big driver there is automotive, with two new OEMs onboard. Our Q4 bookings in the automotive sector were almost 2x, what they were historically, which is what we'd expect to see kind in a couple of new OEMs onboard. So that will pull our detector costs down across the board. We're also taking some actions to consolidate some of the manufacturing activities between CVS and Thermography, most notably in the area of lenses. For example, Arne makes all of his own lenses. And right now or up until now, I've bought all my lenses externally for the CVS business, and we'll move those internally. So we'll see a pickup there. As we have done, we'll probably give some of that back to the market to continue to flex the price elasticity. We've seen very good elasticity in both CVS and Thermography business. As Arne mentioned, with the price reduction on i5, very, very good demonstrated price elasticity there. And I'm seeing it in the CVS business on products like First Mate Handheld Thermal Imager at $3,000 that we've got in the maritime market. We're seeing very, very good pickup rates there. So I think that our forecast for the year is actually to have operating income be in line with where it has been historically."

And now that it has been successful over multiple years, typically that's when something does transition to a program of record. And it was early this last year, it was what portions have been successful of BETTS-C if you will that we do want to carry forward as a program of record, so that was early been sitting down over this last year of finding out what was successful in Iraq, and fair what they did want to carry forward from all the different things that were field-in. So I think that they're on the right track now in scaling these programs down to the products that they did find very useful, and some of the things that -- they looked at it as how mobile some platforms were versus other things like that. So clearly the surge getting things there, finally winning it down to the items that they really want for the long run. Reflecting on the program of record, is it good or bad as an investor. As things get put into the president's budget, very similar to what we're seeing here for the 2011 budget. You have multiple line items and they continue to get flexed up over years in maintenance programs. I think you could get a little bit more visibility into what happens and these programs will be scaled down to be a little bit more specific versus the many different pieces that we'd see there. So there'll be some more insight. And of course as a program of record happens, we'll be more in tune with the program office and add better communications with them on a yearly basis about why they're putting in certain dollars in those budgets. So I think as an investor, it will give us more insight over the long run."

Our Commercial business did much better than they did last year and as planned, the Government Systems revenue was little changed. Gross margins and operating margins improved from Q4 and remain at near-record levels.
Both of our Commercial businesses reported better year-over-year margins in Q1. While Government margins were down slightly from last year but remain very strong. Cash from operations was $82 million and cash balances increased by $40 million during the quarter. Our 12-month backlog at the end of the quarter was $543 million, down approximately 4% and in line with our expectations. With that, I'm going to turn this call over to Andy to discuss Q1 Commercial Systems. Andy?"

And we've made significant progress capitalizing on the combination. We are working to streamline the sales and marketing organization, leverage operational synergies and coordinate R&D efforts. When we are done, we expect to have an even stronger position as a market leader in commercial infrared. Overall, commercial Systems division revenue in Q1 was $129 million, an increase of 17% compared to the combined first quarter results of Thermography and CVS a year ago. Operating income for Q1 was $34 million, up 25% from the prior year, while operating margin was a very strong 26%.
The promising signs of an economic recovery we saw in the fourth quarter were sustained throughout Q1 and led to healthy growth across most product lines.
Thermography revenue in Q1 was $75.6 million, an increase of 18% from the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the impact of currency, Thermography revenue grew 11%. Operating margins were 27%, up from 25% last year, due to better gross margins and operating leverage.
The U.S. improved substantially in the first quarter as growth in both the mid-range and the high-volume segments accelerated. Asia-Pacific continues its strong growth across most product lines, applications and countries. EMEA revenue was up only slightly. However, as the economic recovery in most European countries lagged the modest recovery in the United States.
We made some changes to our organization in Europe and expect better performance in the second half of 2010. Thermography unit volume increased over 40% compared to last year, a substantially better result than in 2009. Volumes were up across almost all product lines, indicating a return to the broad-based, multi- application demand drivers we experienced prior to the economic downturn.
Turning to Commercial Vision Systems, revenue was $53.4 million, an increase of 16% compared to the first quarter a year ago. Backlog remained very strong at $101 million, down just $2 million from year-end. Operating income for Q1 was $13.8 million, up 22% from the prior year and the highest in CVS history. Operating margins were 26%, up 1% from the prior year, due to higher gross margins, which were partially offset by increased operating expenses.
Demand in the security and surveillance market was excellent as worldwide orders were up over 30% from the first quarter of the prior year, driven by outstanding growth in Europe. Unit growth was up nearly 60%, continuing the trend towards lower-priced short and mid-range uncooled cameras purchased with private industry funding. Our global distribution network now boasts 433 dealers worldwide, up nearly 100 from a year ago and reflecting our focus on expanding distribution for long-term growth.
In the Maritime market, orders were up dramatically compared to the prior year and reached the highest quarterly level ever. Demand was strong across product lines from the top of the line Voyager system to the new M-series multi-sensor system to the new First Mate handheld camera. The Maritime business has great promise for the future. Demand in Cores and Components, the largest CVS segment, was down slightly from the first quarter of 2009, due primarily to the timing of orders of some of our major military OEMs. The Auto segment, which has been slow for most of 2009, grew significantly during the first quarter, reflecting the addition of a second large OEM, as well as improved tank rates.
Recently, we launched a new segments within CVS called Personal Vision Systems. This segment was created to drive growth of our commercial handheld systems for law enforcement, security professionals and personnel use. The H-Series handheld camera has sold nearly 2,000 units since introduction nine months ago.
We continue to introduce new products at a rapid rate. In Q1, we launched three new models, including the world's first commercial high-definition IR camera, the Tau 640 uncooled camera core, which utilizes our first ever 17-micron barometer. And we leveraged the short-wave infrared expertise from the recently acquired Salvador imaging team in Colorado Springs to develop and launch the Tau short-wave infrared camera core. Looking forward, we continue to see strong performance for the combined Commercial Systems business as the worldwide economy stabilizes and we effectively execute our high-volume, low-cost growth strategy.
Before I conclude my comments, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank my friend and former colleague, Arne Almerfors, for delivering to me a very well-run Thermography business. After getting more familiar with this business over the last four months, I'm even more confident that this business's prospects for the future are very bright. With that, let me now turn the call over to Bill Sundermeier to comment on the results of the Government Systems business."

For the first quarter, Government Systems revenue was $158.3 million, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. Q1 operating income was $62.8 million, was down 14% primarily due to revenue mix and increased operating expenses. Operating margins of 40% remained very strong in the quarter.
First quarter order activity was a bit better than expected, and our backlog of $418 million at March 31 was only $15 million lower than year-end. We received over 80 orders during the quarter, the value of which was split nearly evenly between domestic and international. Airborne applications represented the majority of the orders with ground-based applications a strong second. In the U.S., delayed procurement decisions related to Afghan surge requirements are slowing order activity. We do not expect this situation to improve in the second quarter, but the pipeline remains healthy and we expect better orders in the second half.
In the force protection area, we received orders totaling $21.7 million from the U.S. Navy for our Star SAFIRE three stabilized multi-sensor systems and RECON III handheld binoculars to support the Marine Corps ground-based operations surveillance system, the GBOSS program. This award supports near-term program requirements and is an interim award before the expected program of record process, which we believe will coincide with the fiscal year 2012 budget. 
In addition, the Army recently released a request for information related to the integrated tower needs of the BETTS-C program. This RFI may relate to interim requirements prior to the Army's planned program of record for BETTS-C. We are pleased with this recent activity from both the Marines and Army as it supports the premise that our force protection solutions are and will continue to be critically important.
Q1 was also a solid quarter in the airborne markets. We received a $12.4 million order from the Army for Star SAFIRE systems for Black Hawk MEDEVAC helicopters and a $13.5 million order from the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane division for our BRITE Star II laser designation multi-sensor systems for Marine Corps and Navy applications. We received two other sizable orders for the BRITE Star II totaling $15 million. Further demonstrating the widespread adoption of our flagship designation platform.
A key area of growth for government system's is in the military vehicle applications for targeting IED detection, situational awareness and driver vision enhancement. We have leveraged our airborne multi-sensor system and uncooled low-cost system expertise to develop an extensive product portfolio for these emerging applications and see a strong pipeline of demand. In fact, early in Q2, we received a delivery order for $20.9 million under a $35.2 million IDIQ for the LRGM-VAS program, which will utilize our talent-stabilized multi-sensor system.
The Government Systems division has the broadest product portfolio in its history and is targeting more applications than ever before. To take advantage of the opportunity, we have increased our investment in sales and marketing. In particular, we are increasing our Washington, D.C. presence to better position us early in the procurement process.
Looking toward the remainder of 2010, we continue to believe Government Systems revenue will be flat to slightly up during the year based on the current level of backlog and the factor order forecast. Our objective as we progress through the year is to build a strong order book for 2011, as we work through planned mix changes. We also expect operating margins will hover around Q1 levels throughout the remainder of the year. That concludes my comments. Let me turn the call back over to Earl."

We are seeing a good recovery in our Commercial business and expect strong growth from it in the rest of the year. Our Government System business as Bill reported is on plan and its expanding sales footprint and marketing activities are positioning us for long-term growth.
In all our markets, we continue to focus on improving our operations, expanding our distribution, proving the quality of our products and in leading in promising gross growth markets. We have a significant cash position, no debt after we retire our convertible bonds in June, and a very strong cash flow. This will enable us to continue the strategy of using our financial strength to make value-creating acquisitions, invest in our existing business and when appropriate, repurchase our own common stock.
We did not acquire any of our own stock in Q1, and still have nearly 17 million shares authorized for repurchase. We will continue to seek opportunities to buy back our shares in the future. The M&A market, while difficult to predict, has some interesting opportunities for FLIR, and we continue to be very active in that market.
We've had some questions recently about whether FLIR intends to begin paying a dividend. This is a topic we regularly evaluate, and we will continue to do so. Our size and our cash flow can certainly support a meaningful dividend. But given the opportunities we see in front of us, and the likely significant increase in personal dividend tax rates next year, we do not intend to institute a pay out in the near future.
Before I turn the call over to Steve for his review of the finances in detail, I'd like to again thank our dedicated employees for their terrific focus, execution and their contribution to FLIR's continuing success. With that, Steve?"

Revenue for the first quarter of 2010 totaled $287.3 million, an increase of 6% from the same quarter last year. Revenue from Government Systems was $158.3 million, 2% less from the first quarter of 2009, while Commercial Systems revenue was $129 million, an increase of 17% over first quarter 2009.
Revenue from our Commercial division of $129 million is comprised of some Thermography revenue of $75.6 million, an increase of 18% over first quarter 2009, of which, approximately 7% of the increase was due to currency due to a weaker dollar as compared to the first quarter of 2009. Revenue from the Commercial Vision Systems of $53.4 million was an increase of 16% as compared to the first quarter of 2009. For the quarter, revenue was distributed 55% from Government Systems, 26% from Thermography and 19% from Commercial Vision Systems. Our international revenues for the quarter were 42% of total revenue, while revenues from the U.S. government sales accounted for 38% of consolidated revenue during the period, down from 45% of revenue for the first quarter of 2009.
We closed the quarter with a 12-month backlog of $543 million, a decrease of approximately 4% or $20 million less than our backlog in year-end 2009. By division, backlog amounted to Government Systems, $418 million; Thermography, $24 million; and Commercial Vision Systems, $101 million, representing declines from year-end 2009 by all divisions of $15 million, Government Systems were 3%, Thermography, $3 million or 11%; and Commercial Vision Systems of $2 million or 2%.
Gross margins for the current quarter was 57.6% as compared to 58% for the first quarter of last year and as compared to 56.5% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Research and development expenses of $24.8 million were 8.6% of revenue for the quarter, as compared to $22.4 million or 8.2% of revenue for the first quarter of 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses first quarter of 2010 of $56.2 million were 19.6% of sales, as compared to $51.9 million or 19.1% from the same period in 2009. Earnings from operations for the quarter totaled $84.3 million or 29.4% of revenue, as compared to $83.4 million or 30.6% of revenue first quarter 2009.
Interest expense for the quarter totaled $1.2 million, as compared to $2.8 million for the same period last year. The quarterly expense relates to the remaining $58.5 million of convertible notes and the decrease from the year-over-year expenses due to the conversion of the Notes and common stock in 2009. During the quarter, the company earned $254,000 of interest income and $53,000 of other income per comprised of currency loss of shorter than $14,000, offset by $264,000 of other miscellaneous income. For the first quarter of 2009, the currency gain was $896,000. Based on the anticipated mix of foreign and domestic income for the full year, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 7.33%.
For the first quarter, net earnings are $55.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share. The 3% increase in net earnings compares to a net earnings of $54.3 million and an equivalent $0.35 per diluted share for the same quarter 2009. We finished the quarter with cash of approximately $462 million, as compared to year-end 2009 cash balance of $422 million. Our cash provided from operating activities during the quarter totaled $82.2 million. Cash used in investing activities of $37.9 million was primarily applied to capital expenditures in the amount of $36.9 million, of which included the acquisition of a facility in Santa Barbara of $29 million.
Depreciation during the quarter amounted to $7.1 million. Cash provided by financing activities during the quarter of $1.6 million is primarily due to the cash benefit from stock option exercises. Cash balances at March 31 were reduced by $6.2 million, due to the effective exchange rates during the quarter.
As mentioned earlier, the company expects to convert or redeem the remainder of its $58.5 million of convertible notes during the second quarter. Thus today, we will be providing notice to the trustee of the company's 3% convertible senior debentures of our intent to redeem the debentures on June 8 of 2010. As required by the indenture governing the debentures, we will also be notifying the holders of their rights to require the company to repurchase the debentures on June 1, 2010.
The specific terms and conditions of this redemption and this repurchase right will be contained in separate notices mailed on or about May 5, 2010 by the trustees to the holders of the debentures. The debentures are currently convertible into shares of our common stock. In the expected event that holders convert their debentures into common stock prior to redemption date, there will be no impact on earnings per share or cash flow. In the event some or all of the holders do not convert prior to redemption, such holders will receive the face value of their debentures in cash, which will reduce cash but also reduce FLIR's diluted fully diluted share count and may subsequently increase earnings per share. This concludes the summary, Earl. I'll turn the call back to you."

And this presents me the opportunity to reminisce a little bit. Steve and I joined in 2000. The company had, I believe, $100 million in debt. We were doing about $160 million in revenue and about 11% of our revenue went to pay for the debt, I think, something on that order.

There was certainly some commentary that was presented in a few days ago about how they wanted an initial 72 sites in Afghanistan. But what we're hearing so far is they're trying to move -- still trying to move equipment from Iraq to Afghanistan and the difficulties of doing so because of the road infrastructure over there.

So we've consolidated sales and marketing efforts globally between Thermography and CVS. And that's has a pretty significant pop from that, and that's part of what drove our orders in Q1 as well. So the Thermography organization had a more well-established international sales capability, particularly with all the international subsidiaries that we're beginning to operate in. So we've now injected the CVS product line into each of those organizations, and we're already seeing some payoffs from that. On the operations side, there are a couple of synergies there. Certainly in the product-development side, we're working much more closely together on future product developments to spread radiometry across all products, spread Nexus networking technology across all products, those kinds of things. The calibration methodology used in Thermography is one that will be propagated into CVS as well.

Indigo has had the capability of manufacturing SWR detectors for many years. But we really hadn't invested much in the back end of the camera. So we had a fairly large, not very feature-rich camera that really had grown non-competitive. Prior to our acquiring Indogo, they were using those detectors primarily in the telecom business for D-WDM activity. Since then, there's been a growing level of interest from the Army on the use of SWR detectors for night vision and fused sensor activities to include the MANTIS program. And we've taken an interest in that. We think that we have the ability to offer the same kind of value-add in terms of innovation that we've done with our Tau camera core and the uncooled space in the SWR space. So what we've done is as it turns out there's quite a bit of expertise in this area and the acquisition that we made in Colorado Springs, the Salvador imaging company. When we initially acquired then we talked about EMCCD capabilities they have, but they also have very good capability and high-resolution visual and in SWR. The detector that we're using at present is the detector that is our readout. So it's an Indigo readout, which is I think a very competitive from a feature-standpoint readout in the market. And the current detectors we're using, we're actually have a third-party to do the in-gas piece of it, not because we're not capable of doing it, we are capable of doing it. But frankly, we're so busy with MC and titanium oxide that we don't have the capacity to sort of divert for a small volume of SWR. But our intention is that once the SWR business ramps up, we will bring the Indian piece back in-house and do it ourselves. What we've done that's unique here is that we're taking we basically made a Tau in-gas camera. So it's got the very attractive characteristics of small size, weight, low power consumption, ease of integration with the Tau family. And our goal there is to provide to our system OEMs and into our own internal capability the ability to choose various different Tau cameras.  A Tau camera for a long-wave and a Tau camera for SWR, a TAU camera for low-light color, those kind of capabilities.  And we think that will be very attractive to both our internal customers and our OEMs, UAV users and so forth."

They have a Canadian gimbal on there. We have through the JWins [ph] program which really started off the rate program my 35 sensors that are for over 20 aerostats that are in theater. And we see some other opportunities coming on to be on other aerostats. So I think that, that will increase but I think the aerostat portion isn't going to be as big, for example, as the towers. Just because the expense and they'reputting them over major cities as compared to the forward-operating bases. And I mentioned earlier, we do still see that there are requirement numbers being generated for additional tower-based systems. I'm doubting this 20-fold more tower-based systems.

The question is, what's the next -- historically, our mix has been roughly been half and half. It's been half share buyback and half acquisitions. Right now, we've built up a pretty good pool of, and it looks like we'll continue to do that. We've also done most of our backward integration already. In other words, both businesses, Commercial and Government, are pretty well backward integrated. So the vast majority of the things that we need from backwards integration, we already control. Going forward, we made one acquisition that was more in the distribution channel, and that was Extech and that's worked out fairly well for us. So I think clearly one of our strategies particularly on the Commercial side, is to look at where we could expand into the distribution part of our business and where we think that will give us more  entry into the market. And there are some opportunities in there we're exploring today. In those areas, I think there's some technology opportunities we may be able to have. There's multiple sensors that can be used in multiple applications and we're looking at some different businesses there. And I think there's some public knowledge as to what's for sale. So we'll look at some of those opportunities and there are two or three now that are actively being shopped, if you will. We need to deploy our cash. We need to do it in a good way and hopefully by the end of this year, we will have had an acquisition at least maybe two that are significant for the long-range future of our company."

Gross margins and operating margins improved from Q4 and remain at near-record levels.
Both of our Commercial businesses reported better year-over-year margins in Q1. While Government margins were down slightly from last year but remain very strong. Cash from operations was $82 million and cash balances increased by $40 million during the quarter.

And we've made significant progress capitalizing on the combination. We are working to streamline the sales and marketing organization, leverage operational synergies and coordinate R&D efforts. When we are done, we expect to have an even stronger position as a market leader in commercial infrared. Overall, commercial Systems division revenue in Q1 was $129 million, an increase of 17% compared to the combined first quarter results of Thermography and CVS a year ago. Operating income for Q1 was $34 million, up 25% from the prior year, while operating margin was a very strong 26%.
The promising signs of an economic recovery we saw in the fourth quarter were sustained throughout Q1 and led to healthy growth across most product lines.
Thermography revenue in Q1 was $75.6 million, an increase of 18% from the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the impact of currency, Thermography revenue grew 11%. Operating margins were 27%, up from 25% last year, due to better gross margins and operating leverage.
The U.S. improved substantially in the first quarter as growth in both the mid-range and the high-volume segments accelerated. Asia-Pacific continues its strong growth across most product lines, applications and countries. EMEA revenue was up only slightly. However, as the economic recovery in most European countries lagged the modest recovery in the United States.
We made some changes to our organization in Europe and expect better performance in the second half of 2010. Thermography unit volume increased over 40% compared to last year, a substantially better result than in 2009. Volumes were up across almost all product lines, indicating a return to the broad-based, multi-application demand drivers we experienced prior to the economic downturn.
Turning to Commercial Vision Systems, revenue was $53.4 million, an increase of 16% compared to the first quarter a year ago. Backlog remained very strong at $101 million, down just $2 million from year end. Operating income for Q1 was $13.8 million, up 22% from the prior year and the highest in CVS history. Operating margins were 26%, up 1% from the prior year, due to higher gross margins, which were partially offset by increased operating expenses.
Demand in the security and surveillance market was excellent as worldwide orders were up over 30% from the first quarter of the prior year, driven by outstanding growth in Europe. Unit growth was up nearly 60%, continuing the trend towards lower-priced short and mid-range uncooled cameras purchased with private industry funding. Our global distribution network now boasts 433 dealers worldwide, up nearly 100 from a year ago and reflecting our focus on expanding distribution for long-term growth.
In the maritime market, orders were up dramatically compared to the prior year and reached the highest quarterly level ever. Demand was strong across product lines from the top-of-the-line Voyager system to the new M-series multi-sensor system to the new First Mate handheld camera. The Maritime business has great promise for the future. 
Demand in Cores and Components, the largest CVS segment, was down slightly from the first quarter of 2009, due primarily to the timing of orders from some of our major military OEMs. The Auto segment, which has been slow for most of 2009, grew significantly during the first quarter, reflecting the addition of a second large OEM, as well as improved take rates.
Recently, we launched a new segments within CVS called Personal Vision Systems. This segment was created to drive growth of our commercial handheld system for law enforcement, security professionals and personnel use. The H-Series handheld camera has sold nearly 2,000 units since introduction nine months ago.
We continue to introduce new products at a rapid rate. In Q1, we launched three new models, including the world's first commercial high-definition IR camera, the Tau 640 uncooled camera core, which utilizes our first-ever 17-micron bolometer. And we leveraged the short-wave infrared expertise from the recently acquired Salvador Imaging team in Colorado Springs to develop and launch the Tau short-wave infrared camera core. Looking forward, we continue to see strong performance for the combined Commercial Systems business as the worldwide economy stabilizes and we effectively execute our high-volume, low-cost growth strategy.
Before I conclude my comments, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank my friend and former colleague, Arne Almerfors, for delivering to me a very well-run Thermography business. After getting more familiar with this business over the last four months, I'm even more confident that this business' prospects for the future are very bright. With that, let me now turn the call over to Bill Sundermeier to comment on the results of the Government Systems business."

For the first quarter, Government Systems revenue was $158.3 million, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. Q1 operating income was $62.8 million, was down 14% primarily due to revenue mix and increased operating expenses. Operating margins of 40% remained very strong in the quarter.
First quarter order activity was a bit better than expected, and our backlog of $418 million at March 31 was only $15 million lower than year end. We received over 80 orders during the quarter, the value of which was split nearly evenly between domestic and international. Airborne applications represented the majority of the orders with ground-based applications a strong second. In the U.S., delayed procurement decisions related to Afghan surge requirements are slowing order activity. We do not expect this situation to improve in the second quarter, but the pipeline remains healthy and we expect better orders in the second half.
In the force protection area, we received orders totaling $21.7 million from the U.S. Navy for our Star SAFIRE III stabilized multi-sensor systems and RECON III handheld binoculars to support the Marine Corps Ground-Based Operations Surveillance System, the G-BOSS program. This award supports near-term program requirements and is an interim award before the expected program of record process, which we believe will coincide with the fiscal year 2012 budget. 
In addition, the Army recently released a request for information related to the integrated tower needs of the BETTS-C program. This RFI may relate to interim requirements prior to the Army's planned program of record for BETTS-C. We are pleased with this recent activity from both the Marines and Army as it supports the premise that our force protection solutions are and will continue to be critically important.
Q1 was also a solid quarter in the airborne markets. We received a $12.4 million order from the Army for Star SAFIRE systems for Black Hawk MEDEVAC helicopters and a $13.5 million order from the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane division for our BRITE Star II laser designation multi-sensor systems for Marine Corps and Navy applications. We received two other sizable orders for the BRITE Star II totaling $15 million. Further demonstrating the widespread adoption of our flagship designation platform.
A key area of growth for government system's is in the military vehicle applications for targeting IED detection, situational awareness and driver vision enhancement. We have leveraged our airborne multi-sensor system and uncooled low-cost system expertise to develop an extensive product portfolio for these emerging applications and see a strong pipeline of demand. In fact, early in Q2, we received a delivery order for $20.9 million under a $35.2 million IDIQ for the LRGM-VAS program, which will utilize our talent-stabilized multi-sensor system.
The Government Systems division has the broadest product portfolio in its history and is targeting more applications than ever before. To take advantage of the opportunity, we have increased our investment in sales and marketing. In particular, we are increasing our Washington, D.C. presence to better position us early in the procurement process.
Looking toward the remainder of 2010, we continue to believe Government Systems revenue will be flat to slightly up during the year based on the current level of backlog and the factor order forecast. Our objective as we progress through the year is to build a strong order book for 2011, as we work through planned mix changes. We also expect operating margins will hover around Q1 levels throughout the remainder of the year. That concludes my comments. Let me turn the call back over to Earl."

We are seeing a good recovery in our Commercial business and expect strong growth from it in the rest of the year. Our Government System business as Bill reported is on plan and its expanding sales footprint and marketing activities are positioning us for long-term growth.
In all our markets, we continue to focus on improving our operations, expanding our distribution, proving the quality of our products and in leading in promising gross growth markets. We have a significant cash position, no debt after we retire our convertible bonds in June, and a very strong cash flow. This will enable us to continue the strategy of using our financial strength to make value-creating acquisitions, invest in our existing business and when appropriate, repurchase our own common stock.
We did not acquire any of our own stock in Q1, and still have nearly 17 million shares authorized for repurchase. We will continue to seek opportunities to buy back our shares in the future. The M&A market, while difficult to predict, has some interesting opportunities for FLIR, and we continue to be very active in that market.
We've had some questions recently about whether FLIR intends to begin paying a dividend. This is a topic we regularly evaluate, and we will continue to do so. Our size and our cash flow can certainly support a meaningful dividend. But given the opportunities we see in front of us, and the likely significant increase in personal dividend tax rates next year, we do not intend to institute a pay out in the near future.
Before I turn the call over to Steve for his review of the finances in detail, I'd like to again thank our dedicated employees for their terrific focus, execution and their contribution to FLIR's continuing success. With that, Steve?"

Revenue for the first quarter of 2010 totaled $287.3 million, an increase of 6% from the same quarter last year. Revenue from Government Systems was $158.3 million, 2% less from the first quarter of 2009, while Commercial Systems revenue was $129 million, an increase of 17% over first quarter 2009.
Revenue from our Commercial division of $129 million is comprised of some Thermography revenue of $75.6 million, an increase of 18% over first quarter 2009, of which, approximately 7% of the increase was due to currency due to a weaker dollar as compared to the first quarter of 2009. Revenue from the Commercial Vision Systems of $53.4 million was an increase of 16% as compared to the first quarter of 2009. For the quarter, revenue was distributed 55% from Government Systems, 26% from Thermography and 19% from Commercial Vision Systems. Our international revenues for the quarter were 42% of total revenue, while revenues from the U.S. government sales accounted for 38% of consolidated revenue during the period, down from 45% of revenue for the first quarter of 2009.
We closed the quarter with a 12-month backlog of $543 million, a decrease of approximately 4% or $20 million less than our backlog in year-end 2009. By division, backlog amounted to Government Systems, $418 million; Thermography, $24 million; and Commercial Vision Systems, $101 million, representing declines from year-end 2009 by all divisions of $15 million, Government Systems were 3%, Thermography, $3 million or 11%; and Commercial Vision Systems of $2 million or 2%.
Gross margins for the current quarter was 57.6% as compared to 58% for the first quarter of last year and as compared to 56.5% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Research and development expenses of $24.8 million were 8.6% of revenue for the quarter, as compared to $22.4 million or 8.2% of revenue for the first quarter of 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses first quarter of 2010 of $56.2 million were 19.6% of sales, as compared to $51.9 million or 19.1% from the same period in 2009. Earnings from operations for the quarter totaled $84.3 million or 29.4% of revenue, as compared to $83.4 million or 30.6% of revenue first quarter 2009.
Interest expense for the quarter totaled $1.2 million, as compared to $2.8 million for the same period last year. The quarterly expense relates to the remaining $58.5 million of convertible notes and the decrease from the year-over-year expenses due to the conversion of the Notes and common stock in 2009. During the quarter, the company earned $254,000 of interest income and $53,000 of other income per comprised of currency loss of shorter than $14,000, offset by $264,000 of other miscellaneous income. For the first quarter of 2009, the currency gain was $896,000. Based on the anticipated mix of foreign and domestic income for the full year, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 7.33%.
For the first quarter, net earnings are $55.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share. The 3% increase in net earnings compares to a net earnings of $54.3 million and an equivalent $0.35 per diluted share for the same quarter 2009. We finished the quarter with cash of approximately $462 million, as compared to year-end 2009 cash balance of $422 million. Our cash provided from operating activities during the quarter totaled $82.2 million. Cash used in investing activities of $37.9 million was primarily applied to capital expenditures in the amount of $36.9 million, of which included the acquisition of a facility in Santa Barbara of $29 million.
Depreciation during the quarter amounted to $7.1 million. Cash provided by financing activities during the quarter of $1.6 million is primarily due to the cash benefit from stock option exercises. Cash balances at March 31 were reduced by $6.2 million, due to the effective exchange rates during the quarter.
As mentioned earlier, the company expects to convert or redeem the remainder of its $58.5 million of convertible notes during the second quarter. Thus today, we will be providing notice to the trustee of the company's 3% convertible senior debentures of our intent to redeem the debentures on June 8 of 2010. As required by the indenture governing the debentures, we will also be notifying the holders of their rights to require the company to repurchase the debentures on June 1, 2010.
The specific terms and conditions of this redemption and this repurchase right will be contained in separate notices mailed on or about May 5, 2010 by the trustees to the holders of the debentures. The debentures are currently convertible into shares of our common stock. In the expected event that holders convert their debentures into common stock prior to redemption date, there will be no impact on earnings per share or cash flow. In the event some or all of the holders do not convert prior to redemption, such holders will receive the face value of their debentures in cash, which will reduce cash but also reduce FLIR's diluted fully diluted share count and may subsequently increase earnings per share. This concludes the summary, Earl. I'll turn the call back to you."

So we've now injected the CVS product line into each of those organizations, and we're already seeing some payoffs from that. On the operations side, there are a couple of synergies there. Certainly in the product-development side, we're working much more closely together on future product developments to spread radiometry across all products, spread Nexus networking technology across all products, those kinds of things.

Indigo has had the capability of manufacturing SWR detectors for many years. But we really hadn't invested much in the back end of the camera. So we had a fairly large, not very feature-rich camera that really had grown non-competitive. Prior to our acquiring Indigo, they were using those detectors primarily in the telecom business for DWDM activity. Since then, there's been a growing level of interest from the Army on the use of SWR detectors for night vision and fused sensor activities to include the MANTIS program. And we've taken an interest in that. We think that we have the ability to offer the same kind of value-add in terms of innovation that we've done with our Tau camera core and the uncooled space in the SWR space. So what we've done is as it turns out there's quite a bit of expertise in this area and the acquisition that we made in Colorado Springs, the Salvador imaging company. When we initially acquired then we talked about EMCCD capabilities they have, but they also have very good capability and high-resolution visual and in SWR. The detector that we're using at present is the detector that is our readout. So it's an Indigo readout, which is I think a very competitive from a feature-standpoint readout in the market. And the current detectors we're using, we're actually have a third-party to do the in-gas piece of it, not because we're not capable of doing it, we are capable of doing it. But frankly, we're so busy with MC and titanium oxide that we don't have the capacity to sort of divert for a small volume of SWR. But our intention is that once the SWR business ramps up, we will bring the Indian piece back in-house and do it ourselves. What we've done that's unique here is that we're taking we basically made a Tau in-gas camera. So it's got the very attractive characteristics of small size, weight, low power consumption, ease of integration with the Tau family. And our goal there is to provide to our system OEMs and into our own internal capability the ability to choose various different Tau cameras.  A Tau camera for a long-wave and a Tau camera for SWR, a TAU camera for low-light color, those kind of capabilities.  And we think that will be very attractive to both our internal customers and our OEMs, UAV users and so forth."

They have a Canadian gimbal on there. We have through the JWins [ph] program which really started off the rate program my 35 sensors that are for over 20 aerostats that are in theater. And we see some other opportunities coming on to be on other aerostats. So I think that, that will increase but I think the aerostat portion isn't going to be as big, for example, as the towers. Just because the expense and they're putting them over major cities as compared to the forward-operating bases. And I mentioned earlier, we do still see that there are requirement numbers being generated for additional tower-based systems. I'm doubting this 20-fold more tower-based systems.

The question is, what's the next -- historically, our mix has been roughly been half and half. It's been half share buyback and half acquisitions. Right now, we've built up a pretty good pool of, and it looks like we'll continue to do that. We've also done most of our backward integration already. In other words, both businesses, Commercial and Government, are pretty well backward integrated. So the vast majority of the things that we need from backwards integration, we already control. Going forward, we made one acquisition that was more in the distribution channel, and that was Extech and that's worked out fairly well for us. So I think clearly one of our strategies particularly on the Commercial side, is to look at where we could expand into the distribution part of our business and where we think that will give us more  entry into the market. And there are some opportunities in there we're exploring today. In those areas, I think there's some technology opportunities we may be able to have. There's multiple sensors that can be used in multiple applications and we're looking at some different businesses there. And I think there's some public knowledge as to what's for sale. So we'll look at some of those opportunities and there are two or three now that are actively being shopped, if you will. We need to deploy our cash. We need to do it in a good way and hopefully by the end of this year, we will have had an acquisition at least maybe two that are significant for the long-range future of our company."

We earned $0.37 per share on a 19% increase in revenue or 9% if you exclude Raymarine. Our Commercial Vision Systems Business grew 27% in the quarter and our thermography grew through 7% in a very uneven economy.
Government systems performed very well, even as the U.S. funding delays continued. Gross margins and operating margins remained very strong and in line with our expectation. We exited the quarter with cash of 285 million no debt. On May 14th, we completed the acquisition of Raymarine the number one brand in the marine electronics industry for approximately $175 million net of cash.
The acquisition was attractive for several reasons; first Raymarine dramatically expanded our maritime distribution network which will enable us to sell more of our thermal images to this large unpenetrated market. Second, our distribution in the higher end commercial marine market will enable us to expand the breath of Raymarine's products. And third we believe the timing though this transaction is very good. We may be in the early stages of a recovery in the market.
And finally we see substantial opportunities to improve Raymarine's operating performance and to bring it more in line with that with the rest of FLIR. When we fully integrated we expect to have a large growing maritime business with margins similar to those that we currently enjoy.
With that, we’ll let Andy to discuss the Commercial Systems Business. Go ahead, Andy.

Overall Commercial Systems division revenue in Q2 excluding Raymarine was 136 million, an increase of 16% compared to the second quarter results of Thermography in CVS a year ago.Operating income for Q2 excluding Raymarine was 36 million up",728,"Thank, Earl. Overall Commercial Systems division revenue in Q2 excluding Raymarine was 136 million, an increase of 16% compared to the second quarter results of Thermography in CVS a year ago.
Operating income for Q2 excluding Raymarine was 36 million up 25% from the prior year. We experienced generally stable economic conditions in our markets around the world during the quarter with a notable exception of the thermography market in Germany. The thermography revenue in Q2 was 71.4 million an increase of 7% from the second quarter of 2009.
Operating margins were 23%. U.S. thermography revenue grew slightly in the quarter, while Asia Pacific continued its strong growth across most product lines applications, and countries. EMEA was down however, as economic conditions impacted our customer activity. We made some changes to our organization in Europe and expect to return to solid growth once these changes take effect in the economic conditions stabilize.
From an application perspective, electrical, building and gas imagining were all up nicely in the quarter. Test and measurement was flat and automation and R&D applications were down. Overall, thermography unit volumes increased 40% compared to last year, again illustrating the significant opportunities to penetrate price that last in low and mid range segments such as those addressed by our I 5, I 7 and T series products.
The invasion engine and thermography remain strong. In Q2 we launched the A-640 a new product platform for the factory automation market featuring a 17-micron 640 by 480 high resolutions, high speed camera for demanding process and production monitoring application. CVS had a very good second quarter, revenue was 64.7 million an increase of 27% compared to the second quarter a year ago.
Backlog remained very strong at 104 million up 3 million from Q1. CVS operating income for Q2 was 19.2 million up 45% from the prior year and the highest in CVS history by far. Operating margins were also a record at 30%, up 4 percentage points from the prior year due to favorable product mix, higher volumes and lower material costs.
Demand for CVS products was very strong around the world; growth in Asia was particularly robust as the front end integration of the CVS team with the larger more established thermography team in Asia helped generate demand.
Demand in the security and surveillance market was very strong and unit growth was up over 70% compared to last Q2. Of course in components, the largest CVS segment was up significantly from the second quarter of 2009 due to increased orders from several OEM customers for both cool and uncooled cores. The new Tau 17-micron uncooled core which we launched back in April at the SPIE conference is performing extremely well in the marketplace. We believe this camera is the most sensitive, most uniformed and most stable uncooled 17-micro camera available and based on customer interest we expect it to do very well in the marketplace.
Growth in auto segment is exceeding our expectations. In the first half of 2010, we shipped the same number of units as in all of 2009 and we expect 2010 volume to approximate the total that we shipped in 2008 and 2009 combined. In addition to our success with the Audi A8, Audi has added our camera to the A6 model which we believe could significantly add to our unit volumes overtime.
The recently launched personal vision system segment was created to drive growth of the commercial handheld systems for law enforcement, security professional and personal use. The initial product line with the segment the H series handheld camera has grown rapidly, since its launch and has sold over 1600 units in the first year. We’re very pleased to welcome the Raymarine team to FLIR and are excited about the opportunities to grow their businesses while leveraging their brand and distribution for our core thermal business.
Since the acquisition in May, we’ve added thermal cameras to Raymarine's global marketing activity, reduced component supply constraints that were limiting growth and reorganized the management structure. We are also aligning the expense structure to be more in line with the FLIR model and working toward launch of Raymarine branded thermal cameras in time for the Fall Trade Show Season.
That concludes my comments. Let me now turn the call over to Bill Sundermeier to comment on the results in the Government System Business.

In the second quarter, the Government Systems revenue was 167.9 million, an increase of 5% from the prior year. Q2 operating income of 65.8 million was down 9% primarily due to revenue mix and planned increases in operating expenses.
Operating margins of 39% remained very strong in the quarter. Second quarter order activity was consistent with our expectations and continued to be impacted by slow U.S. procurement activity. Backlog was 375 million at June 30th, a decrease of 43 million from the prior quarter.
Order activity was once again split nearly, evenly between domestic and international. Ground based applications represented the majority of orders with airborne a strong second. Our leadership position and force protection applications is paying dividend beyond the rate platform. In Q2 we received a $14.1 million award from star technologies for Star SAFIRE 3 and Star SAFIRE HD multi-sensor systems to support the rapid fielding of the persistent and ground surveillance system which provides force protection to U.S. nationals in Afghanistan.
We are pleased to see the success we have enjoyed with the ray platform carry over to new force protection applications, utilizing advanced sensors such as the Star HD. There was no order activity in the quarter for either the G-Boss or BETSS-C programs and we do not expect any large orders for the remainder of the year. However, we may receive small orders for maintenance, sparing or service related demand.
While U.S. order activity remains slow, strong international activity continued unabated with both order size and breadth increasing during the quarter. Our established sales and customer support presence in numerous locations across the Middle East are key to our strong position in this marketplace.
During Q2 we received two contracts in excess of 11 million to supply a Middle East allies ground forces with recon 3 thermal binoculars. These ground systems will compliment the nearly 60 FLIR airborne sensors this ally is already operating. Also in the Middle East we received a $5 million order from the navy of Kuwait for C-FLIR 3 systems, we look forward to continue growth in other Middle Eastern countries that are working to improve their security.
In Europe, we received a multimillion dollars order from finish Defense Company, Patria Oy for the direct fire sight system. These units will be deployed on Patria’s 120-millimeter unmanned mortar turret which can be mounted on to various track in a wheel chassis. The remote weapon stations site market is emerging and we are well positioned to participate in its growth.
In South America, we received an $8 million order to supply Star SAFIRE III to support Brazil's army, navy and air force. We enjoy a long-term relationship with the Brazilian military and look forward to additional potential orders for this program. The interest in attendance to this year's Farnborough air show which is happening this week has been very good. We have been show casing our new Star SAFIRE HD Gen II with full HD imagers for IR, visible and low-light operation.
We are also showing our new HD common architecture solutions which are being well received by aircraft integrators. Our outlook for all of 2010 hasn't changed. We see Government Systems revenue as flat to slightly up for the year, based on the current level of backlog and the order forecast. Our current outlook for the U.S. is a bit uncertain, but we do expect third quarter orders to be better than what we have experienced in Q1 and Q2.

Our strategy to expand the market for infrared technology by driving down costs continues as our outstanding operating model. It does however appear to us that economic conditions remain hard to predict and that was actually written before Ben Bernanke said he couldn't do it.
This environment is problematic so we have decided that in this call we will leave our earnings per share outlook as we had at the end of the year. Our revenue outlook however will increase by approximately $100 million to reflect the impact of the Raymarine acquisition.

Commercial vision systems increased 27% as a result of very good growth in virtually all geographies and market. Thermography sales increased 7% for the quarter and Asia was again very strong while Europe was impacted by uncertain economic environment.
Government systems revenue increased by 5%, entirely due to growth internationally. International revenue was 37% of the total NGS the highest in at least ten years. For the entire company, international revenue was 49% of the total compared with 41% in the second quarter of 2009. Sales to the U.S. Government represented 32% of total sales and 34% of sales excluding Raymarine compared with 41% in the second quarter of last year.
International sales as a percentage of our total was the highest in four years and our U.S. Government sales as a percentage of the total was the lowest in four years. Consolidated gross margin was 55.4% compared with 58.3% last year. Excluding Raymarine, order 2 2010 gross margin was 57.6%. The remaining difference compared to Q2 of last year was due to lower gross margin in Government systems resulting from an expected shift in mix.
Consolidated operating margin in the second quarter was 27.1% and 28.4% excluding Raymarine. This compares with an operating margin of 30.5% last Q2. Government systems operating income for the quarter was 65.8 million compared with 72.4 million in the second quarter of last year. GS operating margins remained very strong at 39.2% versus the record level of 45.2% reached in the second quarter of 2009.
Thermography reported operating income of 16.7 million for an operating margin of 23.4% up about 35 basis points from last year. CVS’s operating income for the quarter of 19.2 million yielded a record operating margin of 29.7% up 3.6 percentage points from last year.
Corporate expenses for the quarter were 15.4 million including 3.2 million of expenses related to the Raymarine acquisition. This compares with 16.4 million in corporate expenses in quarter two of 2009. Raymarine performed very well, since the acquisition of May 14th, revenue was 27.2 million and operating income was 3.4 million from an operating margin of 12.6%.
Excluding reserves free structuring of approximately 1.4 million is contained in the Raymarine results, the Raymarine operating margin was 17.8%. The second quarter is a seasonally strong quarter for the marine electronics business, so we don't expect margins at this level for the second half of 2010, but we're very pleased with the progress being made to improve profitability at Raymarine.
We did not report any amortization of intangibles arising from the Raymarine transaction during Q2 as we have not yet completed the final purchase price allocation. Based on the current analysis we expect to record between 1.6 and $1.8 million per quarter of amortization relating to - amortization of intangibles related to Raymarine beginning in the third quarter of this year.
As a result, we expect Raymarine to be slightly dilutive to GAAP earnings per share in the second half. Changes in currency rates had a minor impact on our second quarter results. Excluding Raymarine, revenue growth in constant currency terms was 8% with the largest impact driven by the change in the Euro relative to the dollar.
Excluding Raymarine, approximately three quarters of consolidated second quarter revenue was reported in U.S. dollars, with the next largest currency, the Euro representing approximately 1/6 of the total and the remainder in the range of currency. Other income for the quarter totaled 1.9 million a swing of 3 million from last Q2. Included in this quarters other income was a currency gain of 576,000 and a gain on investments of 775,000.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 34.6% compared with 32% last Q2. The tax rate was unusually high in Q2 due to the continued delay in approving R&D tax credits in U.S. as well as the non-deductibility of the expenses associated with the Raymarine acquisition. We expect our rate for the full year to be in the range of 32 to 34%.
Cash flow from operations for the quarter totaled 42.7 million compared with 57.7 million in the second quarter of last year, due largely to a $20 million increase in net current assets excluding the impact of Raymarine. This increase was related to the timing of orders within the quarter.
Significant cash outlays in the quarter included 175 million net for the acquisition of Raymarine, 7 million for capital expenditures and 33 million for the repurchase of 1.2 million shares of common stock at an average price of $27.59 per share.
Major balance sheet changes for the quarter reflect the acquisition of Raymarine. Cash balances declined by 177 million, while other long term assets increased by 125 million reflects the access purchase price over the net asset value of Raymarine of 123 million. This balance will be re-categorized into goodwill and intangibles upon completion of the Raymarine purchase price allocation in Q3.
This concludes the summary of our second quarter financial results. I’ll now turn it back to Earl.

That's what we added to guidance a minute ago. I have never liked the term low-hanging fruit. Everything you do in business is work and requires thought and has consequences.
With that said, we think the business can be improved significantly. We have a new CEO if you will or President of Raymarine, a man we have known for a long time, Tom Saram [ph]. He is tackling every part of the business in terms of cost reductions, in order to improve gross margins, in terms of distribution channel, in terms of development of new products that are exciting. We just had to review with Tom a minute ago. I would say he's on track to improve every area of the business. That will take a while and I think it is safe to say that probably if you include the acquisition costs and everything, this year will not be accretive to our earnings. But absolutely it will be accretive next year.

Our growth in that business is a function of what the products do and how they perform. And those activities will continue independent of what the budget is. We are not a - we're a provider of a component that can significantly improve a platform and upgrade and he knows et cetera. Our issue with the U.S. Government orders is the change in the rate program which has been such a big change in us.
Our base business is still growing and I think our base business will grow this year and next year as well. It is that big slug that moves through the snake, that's the issue for us much more than a change in DOD budgets of 5% to 10%. The reason international is so interesting, I think, for us right now isn't the DOD problem if you will. It is more that there are a lot of international opportunities, we think, that our products particularly ground base where we starting, remember so much at all into ground base programs, internationally are starting to come about.
I think Bill mentioned the higher percentage. I think this quarter than it has been in (inaudible) and three years ago, I don't think we sold anything, for the most part ground based. So those products are really starting to take hold and we are starting to take hold with some vehicle programs internationally. So this is an expansion of our markets as opposed to a defensive move because the DOD has cut the budget.

And there was money there for SBInet and it’s in the fund. And they're starting to spend some of that.
And certainly, internationally, all of the Middle Eastern countries are very focused on border protection and security. General Atomics just announced that they have a license field to show their predator XP and export version in the Middle East now. And that's primarily for monitoring borders and doing surveillance. So I still think that there's a very growing interest both in the U.S. and abroad for border potential. I think we’re going to see that in the second half of this year and next year as a growing part of our business.

So, you know, we are - we are reminding you of the numbers that we just gave, you know, 35% to 40% of our business is currently coming of our Government systems business is currently coming outside, from outside the U.S. And that's a percentage that, that we see an opportunity to continue to grow.

Those show up as CS margin that are a little bit lower and hold down my overall gross margin and we have had very, very good success in the Middle East in particular border programs.
So I have got a bunch of that revenue that will be going through the income statement in Q3 and Q4. So those may pull the CS margins down slightly but it also adds internal margins to the GS division. So it is good for the company overall. The other thing that we are doing as we design new products, we strive to design products that have better gross margins. So when we have been doing that since the formation of CVS back in Q2, 2006 and I think you have seen that in the model, that the margins have growth.

We are in $0.37 per share on a 19% increase in revenue or 9%, if you exclude Raymarine. 
Our Commercial Vision Systems business grew 27% in the quarter, and our Thermography group grew 7% in a very uneven economy. Government Systems performs very well, even as the U.S. funding delays continued. Gross margins and operating margins remained very strong and in line with our expectation. We exited the quarter with cash of $285 million and no debt. 
On May 14, we completed the acquisition of Raymarine, the number one brand in the marine electronics industry for approximately $175 million net of cash. The acquisition was attractive for several reasons. First, Raymarine dramatically expanded our maritime distribution network, which will enable us to sell more of our thermal images to this large unpenetrated market. Second, our distribution in the higher end commercial Marine market will enable us to expand the breadth of Raymarine's products. And third, we believe that the timing of this transaction is very good. We may be in the early stages of a recovery in the maritime market. 
And finally, we see substantial opportunities to improve Raymarine's operating performance and to bring it more in line with that and the rest of FLIR. When we fully integrated, we expect to have a large growing Maritime business with margins similar to those that we currently enjoy. With that, we'll let Andy to discuss the Commercial Systems business. Go ahead, Andy."

Operating income for Q2, excluding Raymarine was $36 mil",716,"Thanks, Earl. Overall, Commercial Systems division revenue in Q2, excluding Raymarine, was $136 million, an increase of 16% compared to the second quarter results of Thermography and CVS a year ago. Operating income for Q2, excluding Raymarine was $36 million, up 25% from the prior year. We experienced generally stable economic conditions in our markets around the world during the quarter with a notable exception of the thermography market in Germany. 
Thermography revenue in Q2 was $71.4 million, an increase of 7% from the second quarter of 2009. Operating margins were 23%. U.S. Thermography revenue grew slightly in the quarter, while Asia-Pacific continued its strong growth across most product lines, applications and countries. 
EMEA was down, however, as economic conditions impacted our customer activity. We made some changes to our organization in Europe and expect to return to solid growth once these changes take effect and the economic conditions stabilize. 
From an application perspective, Electrical, Building and Gas Imaging were all up nicely in the quarter. Test and measurement was flat, and automation and R&D applications were down. Overall Thermography unit volumes increased 40% compared to last year, again, illustrating the significant opportunities to penetrate price elastic low- and mid-range segments, such as those addressed by our i5, i7 and P-Series products. 
The innovation engine in Thermography remains strong. In Q2, we launched A640, a new product platform for the factory automation market featuring a 17-micron, 640x480 high-resolution, high-speed camera for demanding process and production-monitoring application. 
CVS had a very good second quarter. Revenue was $64.7 million, an increase of 27% compared to the second quarter a year ago. Backlog remained very strong at $104 million, up $3 million from Q1. CVS operating income for Q2 was $19.2 million, up 45% from the prior year and of the highest in CVS history by far. Operating margins were also a record at 30%, up four percentage points from the prior year due to favorable product mix, higher volumes and lower material costs. 
Demand for CVS products was very strong around the world. Growth in Asia was particularly robust as the front-end integration of the CVS team was the larger, more established Thermography team in Asia helped generate demand. Demand in the security and surveillance market was very strong, and unit growth was up over 70% compared to last Q2. 
Cores and Component, the largest CVS segment, was up significantly from the second quarter of 2009 due to increased orders from several OEM customers for both cooled and uncooled cores. The new Tau 17-micron uncooled core, which we launched back in April at the SPIE Conference is performing extremely well in the marketplace. We believe this camera is the most sensitive, most uniform and most stable uncooled 17-micron camera available. And based on current customer interest, we expect it to do very well in the marketplace. 
Growth in the Auto segment is exceeding our expectations. In the first half of 2010, we shipped the same number of units as in all of 2009, and we expect 2010 volume to approximate the total that we shipped in 2008 and 2009 combined. In addition to our success with the Audi A8, Audi has added our camera to the ASICs model, which we believe could significantly add to our unit volumes over time. 
The recently launched Personal Vision Systems segment was created to drive growth of our commercial handheld systems for law enforcement, security professionals and personal use. The initial product line for this segment, the H-series can help camera has grown rapidly since its launch and has sold over 1,600 units in the first year. 
We're very pleased to welcome the Raymarine team to FLIR and are excited about the opportunity to grow their businesses, while leveraging their brand and distribution for our core thermal business. Since the acquisition in May, we've added thermal cameras to Raymarine's global marketing activities, reduced component supply constraints that were limiting growth and reorganized the management structure. We are also aligning the expense structure to be more in line with the FLIR model and working towards launch of Raymarine branded thermal cameras in time for the fall trade show season. 
That concludes my comment. Let me now turn the call over to Bill Sundermeier to comment on the results in the Government Systems business."

Q2 operating income of $65.8 million was down 9%, primarily due to revenue mix and planned increases in operating expenses. Opera",582,"Thank you, Andy. In the second quarter, Government Systems revenue was $167.9 million, an increase of 5% from the prior year. Q2 operating income of $65.8 million was down 9%, primarily due to revenue mix and planned increases in operating expenses. Operating margins of 39% remained very strong in the quarter. 
Second quarter order activity was consistent with our expectations and continued to be impacted by slow U.S. procurement activity. Backlog was $375 million at June 30, a decrease of $43 million from the prior quarter. Order activity was once again split nearly evenly between domestic and international. 
Ground-based applications represented the majority of orders, with Airborne, a strong second. Our leadership position at force-protection applications is paying dividends beyond the rate platform. In Q2, we received a $14.1 million award from STARA Technologies for Star SAFIRE III and Star SAFIRE HD multi-sensor systems to support the rapid fielding of the persistent ground-surveillance systems, which provides force protection to U.S. nationals in Afghanistan. 
We are pleased to see the success we have enjoyed with the RAID platform carryover to new force-protection applications, utilizing advanced sensors such as the STAR HD. There were no order activity in the quarter for either the G-BOSS or BETTS-C programs, and we do not expect any large orders for the remainder of the year. However, we may receive small orders for maintenance, sparing or servers-related demands. 
While U.S. order activity remains slow, strong international activity continued unabated, with both order size and breadth increasing during the quarter. Our established sales- and customer-support presence in numerous locations across the Middle East are key to our strong position in this marketplace. During Q2, we received two contracts in excess of $11 million to supply a Middle East allies ground forces with Recon III thermal binoculars. These ground systems will complement the nearly 60 FLIR airborne sensors this ally is already operating. 
Also in the Middle East, we received a $5 million order from the Navy of Kuwait SeaFLIR III systems. We look forward to continued growth in other Middle Eastern countries that are working to improve their security. 
In Europe, we received a multimillion dollar order from Finnish defense company, Patria Oy, for the Direct Fire Sight System. These units will deployed on Patria's 120-millimeter unmanned mortar turret, which can be mounted on to various track and a wheel chassis. The Remote Weapon Station Sight market is emerging, and we are well positioned to participate in its growth.
In South America, we received an $8 million order to supply Star SAFIRE III to support Brazil's Army, Navy and Air Force. We enjoy long-term relationship with the Brazilian military, and look forward to additional, potential orders for this program. 
The interest in attendance of this year's Farnborough Air Show, which is happening this week, has been very good. We have been showcasing our new Star SAFIRE HD Gen II with full HD imagers for IR, visible and low-light operations. We are also showing our new HD common architecture solutions, which are being well received by aircraft integrators. 
Our outlook for all of 2010 hasn't changed. We see Government Systems revenue as flat to slightly up for the year based on the current level of backlog and the order forecast. Our current outlook for the U.S. is a bit uncertain, but we do expect third quarter orders to be better than what we have experienced in Q1 and Q2. That concludes my comments. Let me turn it back over to Earl."

It does, however, appear to us that economic conditions remain hard to predict, and that was actually written before than Bernanke said he couldn't do it. This environment is problematic, so we have decided that in this call, we will leave our earnings per share outlook as we had at the end of the year.

Commercial Vision Systems increased 27% as a result of very good growth in virtually all geographies and markets. Marketing sales increased 7% for the quarter, and Asia was again very strong, while Europe was impacted by an uncertain economic environment. 
Government Systems revenue increased by 5%, entirely due to growth internationally. International revenue was 37% for the total in GS, the highest in at least 10 years. For the entire company, International revenue was 49% of the total compared with 41% in the second quarter of 2009. 
Sales to the U.S. government represented 32% of total sales and 34% of sales, excluding Raymarine, compared with 41% in the second quarter of last year. International sales as a percentage of our total was the highest in four years and our U.S. government sales as a percentage of the total was the lowest in four years. 
Consolidated gross margin was 55.4% compared with 58.3% last year. Excluding Raymarine, quarter two 2010 gross margin was 56.7%. The remaining difference compared to Q2 of last year was due to lower gross margins and Government Systems resulting from an expected shift in mix. 
Consolidated operating margin in the second quarter was 27.1% and 28.4%, excluding Raymarine. This compares with an operating margin of 30.5% last Q2. Government Systems' operating income for the quarter was $65.8 million compared with $72.4 million in the second quarter of last year. 
GS operating margins remained very strong at 39.2% versus the record level of 45.2% reached in the second quarter of 2009. Thermography reported operating income of $16.7 million for an operating margin of 23.4%, up about 35 basis points from last year. CVS' operating income for the quarter of $19.2 million yielded a record operating margin of 29.7%, up 3.6 percentage points from last year. 
Corporate expenses for the quarter were $15.4 million including $3.2 million of expenses related to the Raymarine acquisition. This compares with $16.4 million in corporate expenses in quarter two of 2009. 
Raymarine performed very well since the acquisition on May 14. Revenue was $27.2 million, and operating income was $3.4 million for an operating margin of 12.6%. Excluding reserves restructuring of approximately $1.4 million that is contained in the Raymarine results, the Raymarine operating margin was 17.8%. 
The second quarter is a seasonally strong period for the Marine Electronics business, so we don't expect margins at this level for the second half of 2010. But we're very pleased with the progress being made to improve profitability at Raymarine. We did not record any amortization of intangibles arising from the Raymarine transaction during Q2 as we have not yet completed the final purchase-price allocation. Based on our current analysis, we expect to record between $1.6 million in $1.8 million per quarter of amortization of intangibles related to Raymarine beginning in the third quarter of this year. As a result, we expect Raymarine to be slightly dilutive to GAAP earnings per share in the second half. 
Changes in currency rates had a minor impact on our second quarter sales results. Excluding Raymarine, revenue growth in constant-currency terms was 8%, with the largest impact driven by the change in the euro relative to the dollar. Excluding Raymarine, approximately three-quarters of consolidated second quarter revenue was recorded in U.S. dollars, with the next largest currency, the euro, representing approximately one-sixth of the total and the remainder in a range of currencies. 
Other income for the quarter totaled $1.9 million, a swing of $3 million from last Q2. Included in this quarter's other income was a currency gain of $576,000 and a gain on investments of $775,000. 
Our tax rate for the quarter was 34.6% compared with 32% last Q2. The tax rate was unusually high at Q2 due to the continued delay in approving R&D tax credits in the U.S., as well as the non-deductibility of the expenses associated with the Raymarine acquisition. We expect our rates for the full year to be in the range of 32% to 34%. 
Cash flow from operations for the quarter totaled $42.7 million compared with $57.7 million in the second quarter of last year, due largely to a $20 million increase in net current assets, excluding cash and the impact of Raymarine. This increase was related to the timing of orders within the quarter. 
Significant cash outlays in the quarter included $175 million net for the acquisition of Raymarine, $7 million for capital expenditures and $33 million for the repurchase of 1.2 million shares of common stock at an average price of $27.59 per share. 
Intra-balance sheet changes for the quarter reflect the acquisition of Raymarine. Cash balances declined by $177 million while other long-term assets increased by  $125 million, reflecting the excess purchase price for the net asset value of Raymarine of $123 million. This balance will be re-categorized into goodwill and intangibles upon completion of the Raymarine purchase-price allocation in Q3.
This concludes the summary of our second quarter financial results. I'll now turn it back to Earl."

Everything you do in business is work and requires thought, and has consequences. With that said, we think the business can be improved significantly. We have a new CEO, if you will, or President of Raymarine, a man we've known for long time, Tom Surran. He is tackling every heart of the business in terms of cost reductions in order to improve gross margins, in terms of distribution channels, in terms of development of new products that are exciting. We just had a review with Tom a minute ago and I would say, he's on track to improve every area of the business. That'll take a while, and I think it's safe to say that, probably, if you include the acquisition costs and everything, this year will not be accretive to our earnings. But absolutely, we'll be accretive next year."

I'll start with the idea that the U.S. government's cutting their budgets. The DoD isn't. Yes, they are, of course, I don't think that in itself is what's an issue with our growth. Our growth in that business is a function of what our products do and how they perform and those activities are going to continue, independent of what the budget is. We're a provider of a component that can significantly improve a platform. And upgrading those, et cetera, would be good. Our issue with the U.S. government orders is the change in the RAID program, which has been such a big change in us. Our base business is still growing and I think, our base businesses will grow this year and next year as well. It's that big slug that's move through the snake. That is the issue for us, much more than the change in DoD budgets of 5% or 10%. The reason International is so interesting, I think, for us right now, isn't the DoD problem, if you will. It's more that there are a lot of international opportunities where we rethink that our products, particularly ground based, where we historically never sold much at all into ground-based programs internationally, are starting to come about. I think, Bill mentioned it's a higher percentage, I think, this quarter than it has been -- than our Airborne, and was it three years ago? I don't think we sold anything. For the most part, ground-based. So those products are really starting to take hold, and we're starting to take hold with some vehicle programs internationally. So this is expansion of our markets as opposed to a defensive move because the DoD has cut their budget."

But the brand -- Germany has been a big problem for us, and it's been a combination of a number of things. It's been economic factors. We've made some pretty significant organizational changes in EMEA as a result of the integration of CVS and Thermography to include a new leader running the organization. But it's an individual who ran that organization five years ago. He's quite experienced, and I'm confident that he's going to do the right things there. So Germany has been a bigger problem for us than the other countries. We've seen modest growth in the U.K. and some of the other major European countries. The PIG  countries that we hear a lot about in the news these days, they're growth area problems for us: Portugal, Italy, Greece. I'm hoping that, that situation is going to recover, both in terms of the organizational structural changes that we've made in the first half. I'm hoping that, that surgery will heal, and that the organization will take hold there, and we'll see results together with an economic improvement in the second half. The rest of the Thermography business, we had decent growth in the U.S. in the first half, and I think as long as we don't have a W situation here, I think we'll have a good second half for the U.S. market.

CVS margins are going to move around a little bit as they have in the past. And that's driven by our mix. So to the extent that, for example, on delivering on border programs, we're selling through integrators and in buying product through GS, where they're produced by Bill Zachary. Those show up as CS [Commercial Systems] margins that are a little bit lower and pulled down by overall gross margin. And we've had very, very good success in the Middle East, in particular, border-programmed. So I've got a bunch of that revenue that will be going through the income statement in Q3 and Q4. So those may pull the CS margins down slightly, but it also adds internal margin to the GS division. So it's good for the company overall. The other thing that we're doing though is as we design new product, we strive to design products that have better gross margins. And we've been doing that since the formation of CVS back in Q2 of 2006, and I think you've seen that in the model that the margins have improved."

We had a successful third quarter with earnings of $0.39 per share on a 16% increase in revenue. Our Commercial Vision Systems revenue was up 17% over the third quarter of 2009 to $61 million, and the division posted a 54% increase in their operating income.
Thermography revenue increased 4%, excluding the Extech printer division, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2009 and generated 19% growth in operating income. While Government System revenue was essentially flat, operating margins remain robust at 38%. Our order activity for Government Systems were strong, backlog increased by approximately $10 million. 
During the first week of the fourth quarter, we closed the acquisition of ICx Technologies. We purchased the company for $232 million, net of their closing cash balance. This business was attractive for its technology leadership in chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive detection. It expands our footprint by adding products in these emerging detection sensor categories.
ICx also augments our surveillance capabilities by adding integration services and advanced radars to our portfolio. We believe there's significant opportunity to reduce costs, increase profitability by leveraging the FLIR operating model and focusing on the strength of ICx products and employees.
This quarter again demonstrates our ability to produce strong, profitable results. We have never felt better about our mix of products, diversity of our markets, our ability to innovate and our operational and financial flexibility.

Thermography revenue was $71 million, an increase of 4% over the third quarter of 2009 when you exclude that divested Extech printer division revenue from the third quarter of 2009.
Profitability improved significantly with operating income reaching 31% of revenue or $21.8 million. This represents a 19% increase over the prior year and our best operating margin performance since 2007. Unit volumes were up approximately 30% overall, and they doubled for the high-volume i5, i7 series cameras. 
The U.S. showed significant improvement in the high-end P-Series and T-Series sales, and we are seeing significant growth in the sales of our gas finder product. The electrical, mechanical and building markets, which together make up over 50% of Thermography revenue were flat during the quarter, in part due to the EMEA region being down compared to the third quarter of the prior year. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to see the usual seasonal increase in our Thermography business. We continue to innovate and expand the applications for our products, and margins should remain strong as we continue to control costs and utilize our Sonia [ph] manufacturing site.
For the Commercial Vision Systems business, we saw another excellent quarter. Revenues were up 17% over the prior year to $61.4 million. Operating income was $18.1 million, up 54%, and yielding an operating margin of 29%. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, CVS operating margin improved over 700 basis points due to a favorable product mix, higher volumes and lower costs. Additionally, CVS backlog increased 12% over the second quarter this year to $116 million.
Demand in security and surveillance was very strong. Our growing global dealer base is driving awareness of our technology. And as a result, we saw strong growth in the number of orders for security and surveillance products. Cores and Components bookings were also up, reflecting strong demand for our new uncooled tau cores from our OEM customers. We are also seeing robust orders internationally for camera cores made by the former Cedip operation in France. Interest in our new short wave infrared tau cameras has been strong as has the reception of our new color night vision cameras, which use EMCCD technology. 
We expect great things from these products in 2011 and beyond. Auto continues to perform very well with bookings up significantly over the prior year, driven by the inclusion of our products in certain Audi models. Our Maritime bookings increased 50%, with the mix shift towards higher ASP products.
We completed our first full quarter with Raymarine, and performance was good. Revenue was $36.9 million, in line with our expectations for the seasonally weakest quarter of the year after the summer's voting season. Operating income was $1 million, up significantly from a loss in the prior year. Gross margins increased, while we continue to reduce operating expenses, showing our operational improvement plans are beginning to bare fruit.
There is more opportunity for improvement, and we are excited to be launching the integrated Raymarine branded thermal cameras at this fall's maritime trade shows. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of Commercial Systems, and we expect a strong fourth quarter, particularly in CVS. Being more dependent on macroeconomic trends, Thermography is expected to see a more modest growth experience to sustain worldwide economic growth.
Now Bill will discuss the Government Systems division."

Order activity was good during the quarter and our 12-month backlog came in at $386 million, up $10 million from the second quarter of this year.
Airborne systems as well as ground-based applications saw strong orders in Q3. Domestically, we saw better orders from the U.S. government as their fiscal year came to a close at the end of September. We received an $18.5 million order from a U.S. agency for onboard aircraft systems, as well as a $14.4 million order for BRITE Star IIs from the Navy, which showcases our ongoing success with the Marine Corp NTIS program. 
Force protection initiative continue to show strength as we received a $5.3 million order for our Star SAFIRE HD gimbal system. Additionally, we were awarded $63 million IDIQ from the U.S. Army for spares for the RAID program. While no new RAID system orders are expected in the near future, we continue to provide service and spares that deal with systems.
Our international business continues to grow as we were awarded a $4.1 million contract from a European helicopter manufacturer. We continued our penetration at the soldier level with the $2.1 million order to a European agency for weapon scopes. Investments in sales and service operations around the world are growing our footprint into key emerging markets, such as in Northern Africa, India and Russia.
Additionally, we had an official opening in Q3 of our new operation center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in order to increase our service capacity in the region. Overall, we are seeing our efforts to expand our troop level and other ground-based exposure to exceed as we received over $30 million in orders for our recon handheld products during the quarter.
Our Boston location had its best booking quarter ever, suggesting particular strength in smaller gimbals and handheld products that incorporate latest feature sets into smaller, lighter systems.
Excluding ICx, our revenue and profit outlook for all of 2010 has not changed. We currently anticipate a challenging environment for fourth quarter bookings, as we navigate a difficult spending environment, especially in the U.S. Over the longer term, we see significant opportunity as users recognize the merits of innovations, such as digital high-definition systems, and the market evolves from analog to HD.
The close of the ICx acquisition is an exciting event for Government Systems and for FLIR. The inclusion of their products and platforms will allow us to expand our leadership in force protection and government agencies around the world with everything from thermal sensor systems and radars to explosive detectors and integrated systems. We continue to work on the integration of the business into our division. ICx's solid IP portfolio, dedicated employees and culture of innovation will indeed be a solid fit wit FLIR, and we expect excellent opportunity for sustained growth. 
I'll turn the call back over to Earl."

The FLIR operating model continues to succeed as shown by these third quarter results. We continue to penetrate our infrared markets. Our customer base is growing, along with the applications and use of tools that we make in the field. We're optimistically diversifying into areas of growth, exemplified by our two latest acquisitions, Raymarine providing us with adjacent markets, and ICx providing us with adjacent products. We are leveraged in our leadership in the industry to drive down cost and build awareness, which is working to grow the size of our addressable markets. These strategies have not changed and we continue to execute on these goals.
Our challenge as we ended the last quarter of the year is to gain more clarity in how the changing dynamics of the U.S. military spending will impact our overall Government Systems business. I'm encouraged with the growth of Government Systems as shown in the face of this macro environment. Our U.S. military revenue represents less than 25% of our total revenue. And while we continue to see significant opportunity in this important market, we are very pleased with the diversification we have, not only within GS but across the company.
Commercial Systems continues to grow rapidly by executing on the vision of infrared everywhere, and has successfully improved profitability along the way. Thermography is a leader in smart goods, and we see renewed growth ahead. Our two acquisitions will add meaningfully to our growth in the years ahead. Our balance sheet remains strong. It provides us with sustainable substantial flexibility in 2011.
Our guidance for 2010 is improved based on the outlook for Q4 and the impact of our acquisitions. We now estimate our full year earnings per share will be in the range of $1.53 to $1.56. We are increasing our revenue outlook range for the year to $1.375 billion to $1.4 billion to reflect the addition of ICx. Including the costs associated with acquisitions, we expect both ICx and Raymarine to be profitable in Q4 2010 and substantially accretive in 2011 and beyond.
Now Tony will go through a detailed review of our financials."

Revenue growth in constant currency terms without Raymarine was 5%. Commercial Vision Systems revenue increased 17%, with particularly good growth in transportation, cores and personal vision systems market. 
Thermography sales increased 2% during the quarter, or 4% when excluding Extech's printer division revenues for Q3 2009, aided by better demand in the U.S. for gas imaging products and strength in test and measurement markets.
Government Systems revenue was unchanged from the third quarter of 2009. International revenue was 32.9% of the total in Government Systems. And for the entire company, international revenue was 41.9% of the total compared with 43.5% in the third quarter of 2009.
Sales to the U.S. government represent a 35.9% of total revenue in Q3, down from 43.8% of revenue in the third quarter of last year. Consolidated gross margin was 54.8% for the quarter. Excluding Raymarine, gross margin in Q3 was 57.1% compared with 57% in the third quarter of 2009.
Consolidated operating margin in the third quarter was 25.8%, and 28.7% excluding Raymarine. This compares with an operating margin of 31.3% last Q3.
Government Systems operating income for the quarter was $62.2 million compared with $71.8 million in the third quarter last year. GS operating margins remained robust at 38.1% versus the near record level of 44.1% in Q3 of 2009.
Thermography operating income increased by 19% to $21.8 million, yielding an operating margin of 30.7%, up 4.6 percentage points over Q3 2009 and the highest Thermography operating margins since 2007.
Commercial Vision Systems earned an operating income of $18.1 million in Q3, up 54% last year, while CVS operating margin increased by 7.1 percentage points to 29.4%.
Corporate expenses in the third quarter were $17.2 million, an increase of $4.8 million from last year. Included in the Q3 corporate expenses was $2.5 million of costs associated with the ICx acquisition and an accrual of $3 million related to an agreement in principal to settle all pending tax claims associated with the litigation matter dating back to 2007.
Excluding these items, corporate expenses were down 6% compared to Q3 2009. Raymarine reported third quarter revenue of $36.9 million and operating income of $1 million. We substantially completed the purchase price allocation for Raymarine during the quarter, and included in the Q3 results was approximately $1.2 million in amortization of intangible assets.
Going forward, intangible amortization at Raymarine will be approximately $900,000 per quarter. Raymarine made good progress in reducing run rate expense and streamline of supply chain during the quarter, and we expect further improvement in these areas moving forward. Q4 is a seasonally slow period in the marine electronics business, but we do expect Raymarine to be profitable in Q4.
Other income for the quarter totaled $1.1 million, a swing of $2.7 million from Q3 of 2009. The majority of other income related to a currency gain of $606,000 as compared to the currency loss of $3 million in Q3 2009.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 27.2% compared with 30.5% in Q3 2009. This year's third quarter tax expense was favorably impacted by the release of tax reserves, driven by the expiration of certain statutory periods in the U.S., partly offset by the capitalization for tax purposes of $2.5 million in expenses associated with the ICx acquisition.
In total, nonrecurring expenses related to the ICx acquisition and the legal reserve were largely offset by our lower tax rate. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was very strong at $85.1 million compared to $67.4 million last Q3. Investments for the quarter were modest, with 99,000 shares of stocks repurchased for a total of $2.4 million and $7.2 million in capital expenditures.  As a result, cash on hand increased by $95.4 million to $380 million.
Moving to the balance sheet. The largest shift during the quarter was due to the substantial completion of the purchase price allocation for Raymarine, which reallocated $128 million from other assets equally to goodwill and intangible assets. One item still to be completed is the allocation of certain tax assets associated with Raymarine which will be concluded in Q4.
We completed the previously announced acquisition of ICx Technologies on October 4 for a total of $232 million, net of $36 million in cash acquired. In Q4, we will complete the purchase price allocation for ICx, and currently estimate amortization of intangible to be in the range of $2 million to $3 million in Q4. In addition, we anticipate additional transaction expenses of approximately $2 million to $3 million during the quarter.
Including all of these items, we do expect ICx to be profitable in the fourth quarter. Including all of these items, we now anticipate earnings per share for all of 2010 to be in the range of $1.53 to $1.56 compared with our previous full year EPS outlook of $1.48 to $1.53. Our full year revenue outlook including ICx and Raymarine is now $1.375 billion to $1.4 billion.
This concludes the summary of our third quarter financial results. Let me now turn the call back to Earl."

I think the real issue of pointing that here is they historically have had not been very good at forecasting their profitability of meeting their numbers that they have. And I think one of the big reasons for that is that it is a company that is very much decentralized. It has multiple locations. I think it's more like 30 locations around the U.S. and some in Canada and Europe. And it's been relatively tough to manage. It has not been well integrated. And I don't mean that negatively to previous management. I just think that there is some integration that needs to be done. And I think there's some trimming that needs to be done.

And looking at Raymarine, we thought we saw an opportunity to significantly increase infrared in that market. The concerned, I think, people have is the fact that it was a large acquisition, it was $180 million. And therefore, a change in our company. If Raymarine was a $60 million company, I would have been just delighted to buy it. You don't have your pick in that decision-making. Yes, it was a relatively large company compared to FLIR, but you say was it difficult for us to? No, I don't think so. I think in the beginning, we struggled a lot. Then as we understood what the ability of that business might be to grow infrared, and therefore, how profitable it might be, and it as a business by itself, was a very good business. It became more interesting for us to buy it. ICx, on the other hand, just gives us a lot more sensors. And eventually, we see these sensors being in combination with infrared in many applications. Right now, we know that radar and infrared that ICx makes is clearly 100% in our camp, if you will, today. Overtime, these other sensors will be used with infrared sensors. So yes, I guess, but also, the timing was right for us. The economy was bad. The prices of these companies were, I think, exceptionally good. And their future is exceptionally good as a stand-alone company. So a whole bunch of things went in to the thinking. I don't think there was a lot of fighting internally about whether we're dampening our infrared business or not. That wasn't discussed."

Switching to maritime, the SPS program, which we've re-won this last quarter and announced. It's a great maritime for us, as you may know. We're putting two sensors on all the Navy ship. And we've started with the Aegis cruisers and are now going to be working through the next fleet over the five years to add our sensors, and can boast that in the first round of that, we were none of the only products, if not the only product to pass [indiscernible], actually even bowing [ph] up one of our sensors to make sure that it wouldn't send trap all around the deck of the ship. So very strong there and as well with our small boats, with SeaFLIR, with the Coast Guard, these are all opportunities and great customers that we've had on board for a long time. So maritime opportunities grow slower than the airborne ones, but we think that we're very well established in the Navy and the Coast Guard and ships abroad as well. We'll have some international ship programs in the future as well."

So when you kind of cut through their business, there's some very, very nice parts of it. Radar is an immediate link as you point out, some of the others will take longer. But over the long run, eventually, people are going to want to see a threat and they're going to want to measure that threat. And we see the threat today, we don't measure it today.

We had a successful third quarter with earnings of $0.39 per share on a 16% increase in revenue. Our Commercial Vision Systems revenue was up 17% over the third quarter of 2009 to $61 million, and the division posted a 54% increase in their operating income.
Thermography revenue increased 4%, excluding the Extech printer division, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2009 and generated 19% growth in operating income. While Government System revenue was essentially flat, operating margins remain robust at 38%. Our order activity for Government Systems was strong. Backlog increased by approximately $10 million. 
During the first week of the fourth quarter we closed the acquisition of ICx Technologies. We purchased the company for $232 million, net of their closing cash balance. This business was attractive for its technology leadership in chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive detection. It expands our footprint by adding products in these emerging detection sensor categories.
ICx also augments our surveillance capabilities by adding integration services and advanced radars to our portfolio. We believe there's significant opportunity to reduce costs, increase profitability by leveraging the FLIR operating model and focusing on the strength of ICx products and employees.
This quarter again demonstrates our ability to produce strong, profitable results. We have never felt better about our mix of products, diversity of our markets, our ability to innovate and our operational and financial flexibility. I'm now going to turn the call over to Tom Surran, who's filling in for Andy Teich while he attends the advanced management program at Harvard. Both Tony and Bill are scheduled to attend this program next year. Tom will discuss the results in the Commercial Systems division. Tom?"

Commercial Systems revenue, excluding Raymarine, was $132 million, up 8% over the third quarter results for CVS and Thermography last year. Operating income, again excluding Raymarine, increased 33% over the prior year to $40 million. Thermography revenue was $71 million, an increase of 4% over the third quarter of 2009 when you exclude that divested Extech printer division revenue from the third quarter of 2009.
Profitability improved significantly with operating income reaching 31% of revenue, or $21.8 million. This represents a 19% increase over the prior year and our best operating margin performance since 2007. Unit volumes were up approximately 30% overall, and they doubled for the high-volume i5, i7 series cameras. 
The U.S. showed significant improvement in the high-end P-Series and T-Series sales, and we are seeing significant growth in the sales of our gas finder products. The electrical, mechanical and building markets, which together make up over 50% of Thermography revenue, were flat during the quarter, in part due to the EMEA region being down compared to the third quarter of the prior year. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to see the usual seasonal increase in our Thermography business. We continue to innovate and expand the applications for our products, and margins should remain strong as we continue to control costs and utilize our Sonia [ph] manufacturing site.
For the Commercial Vision Systems business, we saw another excellent quarter. Revenues were up 17% over the prior year to $61.4 million. Operating income was $18.1 million, up 54%, and yielding an operating margin of 29%. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, CVS operating margin improved over 700 basis points due to a favorable product mix, higher volumes and lower costs. Additionally, CVS backlog increased 12% over the second quarter this year to $116 million.
Demand in security and surveillance was very strong. Our growing global dealer base is driving awareness of our technology. And as a result, we saw strong growth in the number of orders for security and surveillance products. Cores and Components bookings were also up, reflecting strong demand for our new uncooled Tau cores from our OEM customers. We are also seeing robust orders internationally for camera cores made by the former Cedip operation in France. Interest in our new short wave infrared Tau cameras has been strong as has the reception of our new color night vision cameras, which use EMCCD technology. 
We expect great things from these products in 2011 and beyond. Auto continues to perform very well with bookings up significantly over the prior year, driven by the inclusion of our products in certain Audi models. Our Maritime bookings increased 50%, with the mix shift towards higher ASP products.
We completed our first full quarter with Raymarine, and performance was good. Revenue was $36.9 million, in line with our expectations for the seasonally weakest quarter of the year after the summer's boating season. Operating income was $1 million, up significantly from a loss in the prior year. Gross margins increased, while we continue to reduce operating expenses, showing our operational improvement plans are beginning to bear fruit.
There is more opportunity for improvement, and we are excited to be launching the integrated Raymarine branded thermal cameras at this fall's maritime trade shows. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of Commercial Systems, and we expect a strong fourth quarter, particularly in CVS. Being more dependent on macroeconomic trends, Thermography is expected to see a more modest growth experience to sustain worldwide economic growth.
Now Bill will discuss the Government Systems division."

Order activity was good during the quarter and our 12-month backlog came in at $386 million, up $10 million from the second quarter of this year.
Airborne systems as well as ground-based applications saw strong orders in Q3. Domestically, we saw better orders from the U.S. government as their fiscal year came to a close at the end of September. We received an $18.5 million order from a U.S. agency for onboard aircraft systems, as well as a $14.4 million order for BRITE Star IIs from the Navy, which showcases our ongoing success with the Marine Corps NTIS program. 
Force protection initiatives continue to show strength, as we received a $5.3 million order for our Star SAFIRE HD gimbal system. Additionally, we were awarded a $63 million IDIQ from the U.S. Army for spares for the RAID program. While no new RAID system orders are expected in the near future, we continue to provide service and spares that deal with systems.
Our international business continues to grow as we were awarded a $4.1 million contract from a European helicopter manufacturer. We continued our penetration at the soldier level with the $2.1 million order to a European agency for weapon scopes. Investments in sales and service operations around the world are growing our footprint into key emerging markets, such as in Northern Africa, India and Russia.
Additionally, we had an official opening in Q3 of our new operation center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in order to increase our service capacity in the region. Overall, we are seeing our efforts to expand our troop level and other ground-based exposure succeed as we received over $30 million in orders for our recon handheld products during the quarter.
Our Boston location had its best booking quarter ever, suggesting particular strength in smaller gimbals and handheld products that incorporate latest feature sets into smaller, lighter systems.
Excluding ICx, our revenue and profit outlook for all of 2010 has not changed. We currently anticipate a challenging environment for fourth quarter bookings, as we navigate a difficult spending environment, especially in the U.S. Over the longer term, we see significant opportunity as users recognize the merits of innovations such as digital high-definition systems, and the market evolves from analog to HD.
The close of the ICx acquisition is an exciting event for Government Systems and for FLIR. The inclusion of their products and platforms will allow us to expand our leadership in force protection in government agencies around the world with everything from thermal sensor systems and radars to explosive detectors and integrated systems. We continue to work on the integration of the business into our division. ICx's solid IP portfolio, dedicated employees and culture of innovation will indeed be a solid fit with FLIR, and we expect excellent opportunity for sustained growth. 
I'll turn the call back over to Earl."

The FLIR operating model continues to succeed as shown by these third quarter results. We continue to penetrate our infrared markets. Our customer base is growing, along with the applications and use of tools that we make in the field. We're optimistically diversifying into areas of growth, exemplified by our two latest acquisitions, Raymarine providing us with adjacent markets, and ICx providing us with adjacent products. We are leveraging in our leadership in the industry to drive down cost and build awareness, which is working to grow the size of our addressable markets. These strategies have not changed and we continue to execute on these goals.
Our challenge as we enter the last quarter of the year is to gain more clarity in how the changing dynamics of the U.S. military spending will impact our overall Government Systems business. I'm encouraged with the growth of Government Systems as shown in the face of this macro environment. Our U.S. military revenue represents less than 25% of our total revenue. And while we continue to see significant opportunity in this important market, we are very pleased with the diversification we have, not only within GS, but across the company.
Commercial Systems continues to grow rapidly by executing on the vision of infrared everywhere, and has successfully improved profitability along the way. Thermography is a leader in smart goods, and we see renewed growth ahead. Our two acquisitions will add meaningfully to our growth in the years ahead. Our balance sheet remains strong. It provides us with substantial flexibility in 2011.
Our guidance for 2010 is improved based on the outlook for Q4 and the impact of our acquisitions. We now estimate our full year earnings per share will be in the range of $1.53 to $1.56. We are increasing our revenue outlook range for the year to $1.375 billion to $1.4 billion to reflect the addition of ICx. Including the costs associated with acquisitions, we expect both ICx and Raymarine to be profitable in Q4 2010, and substantially accretive in 2011 and beyond.
Now Tony will go through a detailed review of our financials."

Revenue growth in constant currency terms without Raymarine was 5%. Commercial Vision Systems revenue increased 17%, with particularly good growth in transportation, cores and personal vision systems market. 
Thermography sales increased 2% during the quarter, or 4% when excluding Extech's printer division revenues for Q3 2009, aided by better demand in the U.S. for gas imaging products, and strength in test and measurement markets.
Government Systems revenue was unchanged from the third quarter of 2009. International revenue was 32.9% of the total in Government Systems. And for the entire company, international revenue was 41.9% of the total, compared with 43.5% in the third quarter of 2009.
Sales to the U.S. government represent a 35.9% of total revenue in Q3, down from 43.8% of revenue in the third quarter of last year. Consolidated gross margin was 54.8% for the quarter. Excluding Raymarine, gross margin in Q3 was 57.1%, compared with 57% in the third quarter of 2009.
Consolidated operating margin in the third quarter was 25.8%, and 28.7% excluding Raymarine. This compares with an operating margin of 31.3% last Q3.
Government Systems operating income for the quarter was $62.2 million, compared with $71.8 million in the third quarter last year. GS operating margins remained robust at 38.1%, versus the near record level of 44.1% in Q3 of 2009.
Thermography operating income increased by 19% to $21.8 million, yielding an operating margin of 30.7%, up 4.6 percentage points over Q3 2009, and the highest Thermography operating margins since 2007.
Commercial Vision Systems earned an operating income of $18.1 million in Q3, up 54% last year, while CVS operating margin increased by 7.1 percentage points to 29.4%.
Corporate expenses in the third quarter were $17.2 million, an increase of $4.8 million from last year. Included in the Q3 corporate expenses was $2.5 million of costs associated with the ICx acquisition, and an accrual of $3 million related to an agreement in principal to settle all pending patent claims associated with the litigation matter dating back to 2007.
Excluding these items, corporate expenses were down 6% compared to Q3 2009. Raymarine reported third quarter revenue of $36.9 million and operating income of $1 million. We substantially completed the purchase price allocation for Raymarine during the quarter, and included in the Q3 results was approximately $1.2 million in amortization of intangible assets.
Going forward, intangible amortization at Raymarine will be approximately $900,000 per quarter. Raymarine made good progress in reducing run rate expense and streamlined the supply chain during the quarter, and we expect further improvement in these areas moving forward. Q4 is a seasonally slow period in the marine electronics business, but we do expect Raymarine to be profitable in Q4.
Other income for the quarter totaled $1.1 million, a swing of $2.7 million from Q3 of 2009. The majority of other income related to a currency gain of $606,000, as compared to a currency loss of $3 million in Q3 2009.
Our tax rate for this quarter was 27.2%, compared with 30.5% in Q3 2009. This year's third quarter tax expense was favorably impacted by the release of tax reserves, driven by the expiration of certain statutory periods in the U.S., partly offset by the capitalization for tax purposes of $2.5 million in expenses associated with the ICx acquisition.
In total, nonrecurring expenses related to the ICx acquisition and the legal reserve were largely offset by our lower tax rate. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was very strong at $85.1 million, compared to $67.4 million last Q3. Investments for the quarter were modest, with 99,000 shares of stocks repurchased for a total of $2.4 million, and $7.2 million in capital expenditures.  As a result, cash on hand increased by $95.4 million to $380 million.
Moving to the balance sheet. The largest shift during the quarter was due to the substantial completion of the purchase price allocation for Raymarine, which reallocated $128 million from other assets equally to goodwill and intangible assets. One item still to be completed is the allocation of certain tax assets associated with Raymarine, which will be concluded in Q4.
We completed the previously announced acquisition of ICx Technologies on October 4 for a total of $232 million, net of $36 million in cash acquired. In Q4, we will complete the purchase price allocation for ICx, and currently estimate amortization of intangible to be in the range of $2 million to $3 million in Q4. In addition, we anticipate additional transaction expenses of approximately $2 million to $3 million during the quarter.
Including all of these items, we do expect ICx to be profitable in the fourth quarter. Including all of these items, we now anticipate earnings per share for all of 2010 to be in the range of $1.53 to $1.56, compared with our previous full year EPS outlook of $1.48 to $1.53. Our full year revenue outlook including ICx and Raymarine is now $1.375 billion to $1.4 billion.

There are definitely things that are in that budget that are headed our way that should help improve things. So I've been fairly impressed with Q3's bookings. It’s about where we thought it was going to be. And Q4 will give us what we need to build very strong. I want to say that even though in Q3 our revenue was flat. Q3 of last year, however, had over $30 million of RAID shipments in it, and this quarter there was less than $3 million of RAID shipments in Q3. And Q4 we'll have very few. So we're getting other opportunities to throw in that pipeline. But really kind of anticipate in the new year as we start to see resurgence once the defense budget gets back on track and some of the other opportunities that we're chasing continue to be pushed to the right. So I'm hoping that in the new year we'll start to see a pickup."

I think the real issue your pointing at here is they historically have had not been very good at forecasting their profitability or meeting their numbers that they have. And I think one of the big reasons for that is that it is a company that is very much decentralized. It has multiple locations. I think it's more like 30 locations around the U.S., and some in Canada and Europe. And it's been relatively tough to manage. It has not been well integrated.

And looking at Raymarine, we thought we saw an opportunity to significantly increase infrared in that market. The concern I think people have is the fact that it was a large acquisition. It was $180 million, and therefore a change in our company. If Raymarine was a $60 million company, I would have been just delighted to buy it. You don't have your pick in that decision-making. Yes, it was a relatively large company compared to FLIR, but you say was it difficult for us to? No, I don't think so. I think in the beginning, we struggled a lot. Then as we understood what the ability of that business might be to grow infrared, and therefore, how profitable it might be. And it as a business by itself, was a very good business. It became more interesting for us to buy it. ICx, on the other hand just gives us a lot more sensors. And eventually, we see these sensors being in combination with infrared in many applications. Right now, we know that radar and infrared that ICx makes is clearly 100% in our camp, if you will, today. Overtime, these other sensors will be used with infrared sensors. So yes, I guess, but also, the timing was right for us. The economy was bad. The prices of these companies were, I think, exceptionally good. And their future is exceptionally good as stand-alone companies. So a whole bunch of things went in to the thinking. I don't think there was a lot of fighting internally about whether we're dampening our infrared business or not. That wasn't discussed."

And it wasn't by accident that we were communicating that. When we look at our acquisition opportunities and the opportunities to invest that cash, those are really the key areas. And Raymarine and ICx fit very nicely into that sort of paradigm. It doesn't mean that infrared isn't going to be a terrific growth market. Doesn't mean that it's not going to be our core going forward. But we clearly have an opportunity to drive value, not only from the terrific core business that we have, but also from doing logical acquisitions that are adjacent in the way we've tried to communicate to the investment community."

Outside of the Oconus opportunities and what we have done there, our airborne platforms are extremely strong and continuing to be. As, in fact, here at AUSA, which is next week, we'll be showcasing our multispectral star HD systems. We’re on our second generation of high-definition camera systems and putting in a shortwave infrared camera as well. So we'll have visible shortwave, long wave. We're out there on the leading edge of technology. I just saw an announcement this last week where one of our competitors is actually getting funded by the government to improve their system to our kind of capability, and we're already there. So we're very strong in both the large gimbal, and in the small gimbal platform as well, as it moves to HD and [indiscernible] systems. So those systems are being accepted around the world. It's not just a U.S. phenomenon for us, but actually we're very, very strong internationally with our airborne products. Switching to maritime. The SPS program, which we've re-won this last quarter and announced, is a great maritime for us. As you may know, we're putting two sensors on all the Navy ship. And we've started with the Aegis cruisers and are now going to be working through the next fleet over the five years to add our sensors. And we can boast that in the first round of that, we were one of the only products, if not the only product, to pass [indiscernible]. Actually even blowing up one of our sensors to make sure that it wouldn't send shrapnel around the deck of the ship. So very strong there as well with our small boats. With SeaFLIR. With the Coast Guard. These are all opportunities and great customers that we've had on board for a long time. So maritime opportunities grow slower than the airborne ones, but we think that we're very well established in the Navy and the Coast Guard and ships abroad as well. We'll have some international ship programs in the future as well."

But over the long run, eventually, people are going to want to see a threat and they're going to want to measure that threat. And we see the threat today. We don't measure it today.

For the things that are within that defense budget, which in no way is our entire plan for Q1, so it'll have an impact, but eventually it will get spent. As far as international and U.S. mix. We mentioned in Q3 that the U.S. component was stronger of course because of the end of year fiscal budget. But our international orders still remained strong. And I don't have a mix for you there as a percentage for Q3. And then U.K., with their recent announcement of reducing troops and saving money, of course, it's going to be a very difficult environment. Although we have done quite a bit of business in the U.K., especially with the special operation forces, but not as much with the regular forces there. And it's been an area for us to try and penetrate in the MoD in the U.K. And I think that's going to be even more difficult in this environment. So it hasn't been a large mix of our revenue and our bookings in the past. So we'll continue our focus in other parts of Europe in the Middle East to keep our international business strong."

We had a successful third quarter with earnings of $0.39 per share on a 16% increase in revenue. Our Commercial Vision Systems revenue was up 17% over the third quarter of 2009 to $61 million, and the division posted a 54% increase in their operating income.
 Thermography revenue increased 4%, excluding the Extech printer division, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2009 and generated 19% growth in operating income. While Government System revenue was essentially flat, operating margins remain robust at 38%. Our order activity for Government Systems was strong. Backlog increased by approximately $10 million.
 During the first week of the fourth quarter we closed the acquisition of ICx Technologies. We purchased the company for $232 million, net of their closing cash balance. This business was attractive for its technology leadership in chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive detection. It expands our footprint by adding products in these emerging detection sensor categories.
 ICx also augments our surveillance capabilities by adding integration services and advanced radars to our portfolio. We believe there's significant opportunity to reduce costs, increase profitability by leveraging the FLIR operating model and focusing on the strength of ICx products and employees.
 This quarter again demonstrates our ability to produce strong, profitable results. We have never felt better about our mix of products, diversity of our markets, our ability to innovate and our operational and financial flexibility. I'm now going to turn the call over to Tom Surran, who's filling in for Andy Teich while he attends the advanced management program at Harvard. Both Tony and Bill are scheduled to attend this program next year. Tom will discuss the results in the Commercial Systems division. Tom?

Commercial Systems revenue, excluding Raymarine, was $132 million, up 8% over the third quarter results for CVS and Thermography last year. Operating income, again excluding Raymarine, increased 33% over the prior year to $40 million. Thermography revenue was $71 million, an increase of 4% over the third quarter of 2009 when you exclude that divested Extech printer division revenue from the third quarter of 2009.
 Profitability improved significantly with operating income reaching 31% of revenue, or $21.8 million. This represents a 19% increase over the prior year and our best operating margin performance since 2007. Unit volumes were up approximately 30% overall, and they doubled for the high-volume i5, i7 series cameras.
 The U.S. showed significant improvement in the high-end P-Series and T-Series sales, and we are seeing significant growth in the sales of our gas finder products. The electrical, mechanical and building markets, which together make up over 50% of Thermography revenue, were flat during the quarter, in part due to the EMEA region being down compared to the third quarter of the prior year.
 Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to see the usual seasonal increase in our Thermography business. We continue to innovate and expand the applications for our products, and margins should remain strong as we continue to control costs and utilize our Sonia [ph] manufacturing site.
 For the Commercial Vision Systems business, we saw another excellent quarter. Revenues were up 17% over the prior year to $61.4 million. Operating income was $18.1 million, up 54%, and yielding an operating margin of 29%. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, CVS operating margin improved over 700 basis points due to a favorable product mix, higher volumes and lower costs. Additionally, CVS backlog increased 12% over the second quarter this year to $116 million.
 Demand in security and surveillance was very strong. Our growing global dealer base is driving awareness of our technology. And as a result, we saw strong growth in the number of orders for security and surveillance products. Cores and Components bookings were also up, reflecting strong demand for our new uncooled Tau cores from our OEM customers. We are also seeing robust orders internationally for camera cores made by the former Cedip operation in France. Interest in our new short wave infrared Tau cameras has been strong as has the reception of our new color night vision cameras, which use EMCCD technology.
 We expect great things from these products in 2011 and beyond. Auto continues to perform very well with bookings up significantly over the prior year, driven by the inclusion of our products in certain Audi models. Our Maritime bookings increased 50%, with the mix shift towards higher ASP products.
 We completed our first full quarter with Raymarine, and performance was good. Revenue was $36.9 million, in line with our expectations for the seasonally weakest quarter of the year after the summer's boating season. Operating income was $1 million, up significantly from a loss in the prior year. Gross margins increased, while we continue to reduce operating expenses, showing our operational improvement plans are beginning to bear fruit.
 There is more opportunity for improvement, and we are excited to be launching the integrated Raymarine branded thermal cameras at this fall's maritime trade shows. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of Commercial Systems, and we expect a strong fourth quarter, particularly in CVS. Being more dependent on macroeconomic trends, Thermography is expected to see a more modest growth experience to sustain worldwide economic growth.
 Now Bill will discuss the Government Systems division.

Order activity was good during the quarter and our 12-month backlog came in at $386 million, up $10 million from the second quarter of this year.
 Airborne systems as well as ground-based applications saw strong orders in Q3. Domestically, we saw better orders from the U.S. government as their fiscal year came to a close at the end of September. We received an $18.5 million order from a U.S. agency for onboard aircraft systems, as well as a $14.4 million order for BRITE Star IIs from the Navy, which showcases our ongoing success with the Marine Corps NTIS program.
 Force protection initiatives continue to show strength, as we received a $5.3 million order for our Star SAFIRE HD gimbal system. Additionally, we were awarded a $63 million IDIQ from the U.S. Army for spares for the RAID program. While no new RAID system orders are expected in the near future, we continue to provide service and spares that deal with systems.
 Our international business continues to grow as we were awarded a $4.1 million contract from a European helicopter manufacturer. We continued our penetration at the soldier level with the $2.1 million order to a European agency for weapon scopes. Investments in sales and service operations around the world are growing our footprint into key emerging markets, such as in Northern Africa, India and Russia.
 Additionally, we had an official opening in Q3 of our new operation center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in order to increase our service capacity in the region. Overall, we are seeing our efforts to expand our troop level and other ground-based exposure succeed as we received over $30 million in orders for our recon handheld products during the quarter.
 Our Boston location had its best booking quarter ever, suggesting particular strength in smaller gimbals and handheld products that incorporate latest feature sets into smaller, lighter systems.
 Excluding ICx, our revenue and profit outlook for all of 2010 has not changed. We currently anticipate a challenging environment for fourth quarter bookings, as we navigate a difficult spending environment, especially in the U.S. Over the longer term, we see significant opportunity as users recognize the merits of innovations such as digital high-definition systems, and the market evolves from analog to HD.
 The close of the ICx acquisition is an exciting event for Government Systems and for FLIR. The inclusion of their products and platforms will allow us to expand our leadership in force protection in government agencies around the world with everything from thermal sensor systems and radars to explosive detectors and integrated systems. We continue to work on the integration of the business into our division. ICx's solid IP portfolio, dedicated employees and culture of innovation will indeed be a solid fit with FLIR, and we expect excellent opportunity for sustained growth.
 I'll turn the call back over to Earl.

The FLIR operating model continues to succeed as shown by these third quarter results. We continue to penetrate our infrared markets. Our customer base is growing, along with the applications and use of tools that we make in the field. We're optimistically diversifying into areas of growth, exemplified by our two latest acquisitions, Raymarine providing us with adjacent markets, and ICx providing us with adjacent products. We are leveraging in our leadership in the industry to drive down cost and build awareness, which is working to grow the size of our addressable markets. These strategies have not changed and we continue to execute on these goals.
 Our challenge as we enter the last quarter of the year is to gain more clarity in how the changing dynamics of the U.S. military spending will impact our overall Government Systems business. I'm encouraged with the growth of Government Systems as shown in the face of this macro environment. Our U.S. military revenue represents less than 25% of our total revenue. And while we continue to see significant opportunity in this important market, we are very pleased with the diversification we have, not only within GS, but across the company.
 Commercial Systems continues to grow rapidly by executing on the vision of infrared everywhere, and has successfully improved profitability along the way. Thermography is a leader in smart goods, and we see renewed growth ahead. Our two acquisitions will add meaningfully to our growth in the years ahead. Our balance sheet remains strong. It provides us with substantial flexibility in 2011.
 Our guidance for 2010 is improved based on the outlook for Q4 and the impact of our acquisitions. We now estimate our full year earnings per share will be in the range of $1.53 to $1.56. We are increasing our revenue outlook range for the year to $1.375 billion to $1.4 billion to reflect the addition of ICx. Including the costs associated with acquisitions, we expect both ICx and Raymarine to be profitable in Q4 2010, and substantially accretive in 2011 and beyond.
 Now Tony will go through a detailed review of our financials.

Revenue growth in constant currency terms without Raymarine was 5%. Commercial Vision Systems revenue increased 17%, with particularly good growth in transportation, cores and personal vision systems market.
 Thermography sales increased 2% during the quarter, or 4% when excluding Extech's printer division revenues for Q3 2009, aided by better demand in the U.S. for gas imaging products, and strength in test and measurement markets.
 Government Systems revenue was unchanged from the third quarter of 2009. International revenue was 32.9% of the total in Government Systems. And for the entire company, international revenue was 41.9% of the total, compared with 43.5% in the third quarter of 2009.
 Sales to the U.S. government represent a 35.9% of total revenue in Q3, down from 43.8% of revenue in the third quarter of last year. Consolidated gross margin was 54.8% for the quarter. Excluding Raymarine, gross margin in Q3 was 57.1%, compared with 57% in the third quarter of 2009.
 Consolidated operating margin in the third quarter was 25.8%, and 28.7% excluding Raymarine. This compares with an operating margin of 31.3% last Q3.
 Government Systems operating income for the quarter was $62.2 million, compared with $71.8 million in the third quarter last year. GS operating margins remained robust at 38.1%, versus the near record level of 44.1% in Q3 of 2009.
 Thermography operating income increased by 19% to $21.8 million, yielding an operating margin of 30.7%, up 4.6 percentage points over Q3 2009, and the highest Thermography operating margins since 2007.
 Commercial Vision Systems earned an operating income of $18.1 million in Q3, up 54% last year, while CVS operating margin increased by 7.1 percentage points to 29.4%.
 Corporate expenses in the third quarter were $17.2 million, an increase of $4.8 million from last year. Included in the Q3 corporate expenses was $2.5 million of costs associated with the ICx acquisition, and an accrual of $3 million related to an agreement in principal to settle all pending patent claims associated with the litigation matter dating back to 2007.
 Excluding these items, corporate expenses were down 6% compared to Q3 2009. Raymarine reported third quarter revenue of $36.9 million and operating income of $1 million. We substantially completed the purchase price allocation for Raymarine during the quarter, and included in the Q3 results was approximately $1.2 million in amortization of intangible assets.
 Going forward, intangible amortization at Raymarine will be approximately $900,000 per quarter. Raymarine made good progress in reducing run rate expense and streamlined the supply chain during the quarter, and we expect further improvement in these areas moving forward. Q4 is a seasonally slow period in the marine electronics business, but we do expect Raymarine to be profitable in Q4.
 Other income for the quarter totaled $1.1 million, a swing of $2.7 million from Q3 of 2009. The majority of other income related to a currency gain of $606,000, as compared to a currency loss of $3 million in Q3 2009.
 Our tax rate for this quarter was 27.2%, compared with 30.5% in Q3 2009. This year's third quarter tax expense was favorably impacted by the release of tax reserves, driven by the expiration of certain statutory periods in the U.S., partly offset by the capitalization for tax purposes of $2.5 million in expenses associated with the ICx acquisition.
 In total, nonrecurring expenses related to the ICx acquisition and the legal reserve were largely offset by our lower tax rate. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was very strong at $85.1 million, compared to $67.4 million last Q3. Investments for the quarter were modest, with 99,000 shares of stocks repurchased for a total of $2.4 million, and $7.2 million in capital expenditures.  As a result, cash on hand increased by $95.4 million to $380 million.
 Moving to the balance sheet. The largest shift during the quarter was due to the substantial completion of the purchase price allocation for Raymarine, which reallocated $128 million from other assets equally to goodwill and intangible assets. One item still to be completed is the allocation of certain tax assets associated with Raymarine, which will be concluded in Q4.
 We completed the previously announced acquisition of ICx Technologies on October 4 for a total of $232 million, net of $36 million in cash acquired. In Q4, we will complete the purchase price allocation for ICx, and currently estimate amortization of intangible to be in the range of $2 million to $3 million in Q4. In addition, we anticipate additional transaction expenses of approximately $2 million to $3 million during the quarter.
 Including all of these items, we do expect ICx to be profitable in the fourth quarter. Including all of these items, we now anticipate earnings per share for all of 2010 to be in the range of $1.53 to $1.56, compared with our previous full year EPS outlook of $1.48 to $1.53. Our full year revenue outlook including ICx and Raymarine is now $1.375 billion to $1.4 billion.
 This concludes the summary of our third quarter financial results. Let me now turn the call back to Earl.

It’s about where we thought it was going to be. And Q4 will give us what we need to build very strong. I want to say that even though in Q3 our revenue was flat. Q3 of last year, however, had over $30 million of RAID shipments in it, and this quarter there was less than $3 million of RAID shipments in Q3. And Q4 we'll have very few. So we're getting other opportunities to throw in that pipeline. But really kind of anticipate in the new year as we start to see resurgence once the defense budget gets back on track and some of the other opportunities that we're chasing continue to be pushed to the right.

I think the real issue your pointing at here is they historically have had not been very good at forecasting their profitability or meeting their numbers that they have.

I think it's more like 30 locations around the U.S., and some in Canada and Europe. And it's been relatively tough to manage. It has not been well integrated.

And looking at Raymarine, we thought we saw an opportunity to significantly increase infrared in that market. The concern I think people have is the fact that it was a large acquisition. It was $180 million, and therefore a change in our company. If Raymarine was a $60 million company, I would have been just delighted to buy it. You don't have your pick in that decision-making. Yes, it was a relatively large company compared to FLIR, but you say was it difficult for us to? No, I don't think so. I think in the beginning, we struggled a lot. Then as we understood what the ability of that business might be to grow infrared, and therefore, how profitable it might be. And it as a business by itself, was a very good business. It became more interesting for us to buy it. ICx, on the other hand just gives us a lot more sensors. And eventually, we see these sensors being in combination with infrared in many applications. Right now, we know that radar and infrared that ICx makes is clearly 100% in our camp, if you will, today. Overtime, these other sensors will be used with infrared sensors. So yes, I guess, but also, the timing was right for us. The economy was bad. The prices of these companies were, I think, exceptionally good. And their future is exceptionally good as stand-alone companies. So a whole bunch of things went in to the thinking. I don't think there was a lot of fighting internally about whether we're dampening our infrared business or not. That wasn't discussed.

And it wasn't by accident that we were communicating that. When we look at our acquisition opportunities and the opportunities to invest that cash, those are really the key areas. And Raymarine and ICx fit very nicely into that sort of paradigm. It doesn't mean that infrared isn't going to be a terrific growth market. Doesn't mean that it's not going to be our core going forward. But we clearly have an opportunity to drive value, not only from the terrific core business that we have, but also from doing logical acquisitions that are adjacent in the way we've tried to communicate to the investment community.

Outside of the Oconus opportunities and what we have done there, our airborne platforms are extremely strong and continuing to be. As, in fact, here at AUSA, which is next week, we'll be showcasing our multispectral star HD systems. We’re on our second generation of high-definition camera systems and putting in a shortwave infrared camera as well. So we'll have visible shortwave, long wave. We're out there on the leading edge of technology. I just saw an announcement this last week where one of our competitors is actually getting funded by the government to improve their system to our kind of capability, and we're already there. So we're very strong in both the large gimbal, and in the small gimbal platform as well, as it moves to HD and [indiscernible] systems. So those systems are being accepted around the world. It's not just a U.S. phenomenon for us, but actually we're very, very strong internationally with our airborne products. Switching to maritime. The SPS program, which we've re-won this last quarter and announced, is a great maritime for us. As you may know, we're putting two sensors on all the Navy ship. And we've started with the Aegis cruisers and are now going to be working through the next fleet over the five years to add our sensors. And we can boast that in the first round of that, we were one of the only products, if not the only product, to pass [indiscernible]. Actually even blowing up one of our sensors to make sure that it wouldn't send shrapnel around the deck of the ship. So very strong there as well with our small boats. With SeaFLIR. With the Coast Guard. These are all opportunities and great customers that we've had on board for a long time. So maritime opportunities grow slower than the airborne ones, but we think that we're very well established in the Navy and the Coast Guard and ships abroad as well. We'll have some international ship programs in the future as well.

We had a successful third quarter with earnings of $0.39 per share on a 16% increase in revenue. Our Commercial Vision Systems revenue was up 17% over the third quarter of 2009 to $61 million, and the division posted a 54% increase in their operating income.
Thermography revenue increased 4%, excluding the Extech printer division, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2009, and generated 19% growth in operating income. While Government System revenue was essentially flat, operating margins remain robust at 38%. Our order activity for Government Systems was strong, and backlog increased by approximately $10 million. 
During the first week of the fourth quarter, we closed the acquisition of ICx Technologies. We purchased the company for $232 million, net of their closing cash balance. This business was attractive for its technology leadership in chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive detection. It expands our footprint by adding products in these emerging detection sensor categories.
ICx also augments our surveillance capabilities by adding integration services and advanced radars to our portfolio. We believe there's significant opportunity to reduce costs, increase profitability by leveraging the FLIR operating model and focusing on the strength of ICx products and employees.
This quarter again demonstrates our ability to produce strong, profitable results. We have never felt better about our mix of products, the diversity of our markets, our ability to innovate and our operational and financial flexibility.

Thermography revenue was $71 million, an increase of 4% over the third quarter of 2009 when you exclude the divested Extech printer division revenue from the third quarter of 2009.
Profitability improved significantly with operating income reaching 31% of revenue or $21.8 million. This represents a 19% increase over the prior year and our best operating margin performance since 2007. Unit volumes were up approximately 30% overall, and they doubled for the high-volume i5, i7 series cameras. 
The U.S. showed significant improvement in the high-end P-Series and T-Series sales, and we are seeing significant growth in the sales of our GasFindIR products. The electrical, mechanical and building markets, which together make up over 50% of Thermography revenue, were flat during the quarter, in part due to the EMEA region being down compared to the third quarter of the prior year. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to see the usual seasonal increase in our Thermography business. We continue to innovate and expand the applications for our products, and margins should remain strong as we continue to control costs and utilize our Estonia manufacturing site.
For the Commercial Vision Systems business, we saw another excellent quarter. Revenues were up 17% over the prior year to $61.4 million. Operating income was $18.1 million, up 54% and yielding an operating margin of 29%. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, CVS operating margin improved over 700 basis points due to a favorable product mix, higher volumes and lower costs. Additionally, CVS backlog increased 12% over the second quarter this year to $116 million.
Demand in security and surveillance was very strong. Our growing global dealer base is driving awareness of our technology. And as a result, we saw strong growth in the number of orders for security and surveillance products. Cores and Components bookings were also up, reflecting strong demand for our new uncooled Tau cores from our OEM customers. We are also seeing robust orders internationally for camera cores made by the former Cedip operation in France. Interest in our new short wave infrared Tau cameras has been strong as has the reception of our new color night vision cameras, which use EMCCD technology. 
We expect great things from these products in 2011 and beyond. Auto continues to perform very well with bookings up significantly over the prior year, driven by the inclusion of our products in certain Audi models. Our Maritime bookings increased 50%, with the mix shift towards higher ASP products.
We completed our first full quarter with Raymarine, and performance was good. Revenue was $36.9 million, in line with our expectations for the seasonally weakest quarter of the year after the summer's boating season. Operating income was $1 million, up significantly from a loss in the prior year. Gross margins increased, while we continue to reduce operating expenses, showing our operational improvement plans are beginning to bear fruit.
There is more opportunity for improvement, and we are excited to be launching the integrated Raymarine branded thermal cameras at this fall's maritime trade shows. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of Commercial Systems, and we expect a strong fourth quarter, particularly in CVS. Being more dependent on macroeconomic trends, Thermography is expected to see a more modest growth [indiscernible] experience sustained worldwide economic growth.

Order activity was good during the quarter and our 12-month backlog came in at $386 million, up $10 million from the second quarter of this year.
Airborne systems as well as ground-based applications saw strong orders in Q3. Domestically, we saw better orders from the U.S. government as their fiscal year came to a close at the end of September. We received an $18.5 million order from a U.S. agency for onboard aircraft systems, as well as a $14.4 million order for BRITE Star IIs from the Navy, which showcases our ongoing success with the Marine Corps NTIS program. 
Force protection initiatives continue to show strength, as we received a $5.3 million order for our Star SAFIRE HD gimbal system. Additionally, we were awarded a $63 million IDIQ from the U.S. Army for spares for the RAID program. While no new RAID system orders are expected in the near future, we continue to provide service and spares that deal with systems.
Our international business continues to grow as we were awarded a $4.1 million contract from a European helicopter manufacturer. We continued our penetration at the soldier level with a $2.1 million order to a European agency for weapon scopes. Investments in sales and service operations around the world are growing our footprint into key emerging markets, such as in Northern Africa, India and Russia.
Additionally, we had an official opening in Q3 of our new operation center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in order to increase our service capacity in the region. Overall, we are seeing our efforts to expand our troop level and other ground-based exposure succeed as we received over $30 million in orders for our recon handheld products during the quarter.
Our Boston location had its best booking quarter ever, suggesting particular strength in smaller gimbals and handheld products that incorporate latest feature sets into smaller, lighter systems.
Excluding ICx, our revenue and profit outlook for all of 2010 has not changed. We currently anticipate a challenging environment for fourth quarter bookings, as we navigate a difficult spending environment, especially in the U.S. Over the longer term, we see significant opportunity as users recognize the merits of innovations such as digital high-definition systems and the market evolves from analog to HD.
The close of the ICx acquisition is an exciting event for Government Systems and for FLIR. The inclusion of their products and platforms will allow us to expand our leadership in force protection in government agencies around the world with everything from thermal sensor systems and radars to explosive detectors and integrated systems. We continue to work on the integration of the business into our division. ICx's solid IP portfolio, dedicated employees and culture of innovation will indeed be a solid fit with FLIR, and we expect excellent opportunity for sustained growth.

The FLIR operating model continues to succeed as shown by these third quarter results. We continue to penetrate our infrared markets. Our customer base is growing, along with the applications and use of tools that we make in the field. We're optimistically diversifying into areas of growth, exemplified by our two latest acquisitions: Raymarine providing us with adjacent markets and ICx providing us with adjacent products. We are leveraging in our leadership in the industry to drive down costs and build awareness, which is working to grow the size of our addressable markets. These strategies have not changed and we continue to execute on these goals.
Our challenge as we enter the last quarter of the year is to gain more clarity in how the changing dynamics of the U.S. military spending will impact our overall Government Systems business. I'm encouraged with the growth of Government Systems has shown in the face of this macro environment. Our U.S. military revenue represents less than 25% of our total revenue. And while we continue to see significant opportunity in this important market, we are very pleased with the diversification we have, not only within GS, but across the company.
Commercial Systems continues to grow rapidly by executing on the vision of infrared everywhere and has successfully improved profitability along the way. Thermography is a leader in its markets, and we see renewed growth ahead. Our two acquisitions will add meaningfully to our growth in the years ahead. Our balance sheet remains strong and provides us with substantial flexibility in 2011.
Our guidance for 2010 is improved based on the outlook for Q4 and the impact of our acquisitions. We now estimate our full year earnings per share will be in the range of $1.53 to $1.56. We are increasing our revenue outlook range for the year to $1.375 billion to $1.4 billion to reflect the addition of ICx. Including the costs associated with acquisitions, we expect both ICx and Raymarine to be profitable in Q4 2010, and substantially accretive in 2011 and beyond.

Thermography sales increased 2% during the quarter or 4% when excluding Extech's printer division revenues for Q3 2009, aided by better demand in the U.S. for gas imaging products and strength in test and measurement markets.
Government Systems revenue was unchanged from the third quarter of 2009. International revenue was 32.9% of the total in Government Systems. And for the entire company, international revenue was 41.9% of the total compared with 43.5% in the third quarter of 2009.
Sales to the U.S. government represent 35.9% of total revenue in Q3, down from 43.8% of revenue in the third quarter of last year. Consolidated gross margin was 54.8% for the quarter. Excluding Raymarine, gross margin in Q3 was 57.1% compared with 57% in the third quarter of 2009.
Consolidated operating margin in the third quarter was 25.8% and 28.7% excluding Raymarine. This compares with an operating margin of 31.3% last Q3.
Government Systems operating income for the quarter was $62.2 million compared with $71.8 million in the third quarter last year. GS operating margins remained robust at 38.1%, versus the near record level of 44.1% in Q3 of 2009.
Thermography operating income increased by 19% to $21.8 million, yielding an operating margin of 30.7%, up 4.6 percentage points over Q3 2009 and the highest Thermography operating margin since 2007.
Commercial Vision Systems earned an operating income of $18.1 million in Q3, up 54% last year, while CVS operating margin increased by 7.1 percentage points to 29.4%.
Corporate expenses for the third quarter were $17.2 million, an increase of $4.8 million from last year. Included in the Q3 corporate expenses was $2.5 million of costs associated with the ICx acquisition and an accrual of $3 million related to an agreement in principal to settle all pending patent claims associated with a litigation matter dating back to 2007.Excluding these items, corporate expenses were down 6% compared to Q3 2009. 
Raymarine reported third quarter revenue of $36.9 million and operating income of $1 million. We substantially completed the purchase price allocation for Raymarine during the quarter, and included in the Q3 results was approximately $1.2 million in amortization of intangible assets. Going forward, intangible amortization at Raymarine will be approximately $900,000 per quarter. 
Raymarine made good progress in reducing run rate expense and streamlined the supply chain during the quarter, and we expect further improvement in these areas moving forward. Q4 is a seasonally slow period in the marine electronics business, but we do expect Raymarine to be profitable in Q4.
Other income for the quarter totaled $1.1 million, a swing of $2.7 million from Q3 of 2009. The majority of other income related to a currency gain of $606,000 as compared to a currency loss of $3 million in Q3 2009.
Our tax rate for this quarter was 27.2%, compared with 30.5% in Q3 2009. This year's third quarter tax expense was favorably impacted by the release of tax reserves, driven by the expiration of certain statutory periods in the U.S., partly offset by the capitalization for tax purposes of $2.5 million in expenses associated with the ICx acquisition.
In total, nonrecurring expenses related to the ICx acquisition and the legal reserve were largely offset by our lower tax rate. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was very strong at $85.1 million compared to $67.4 million last Q3. Investments for the quarter were modest, with 99,000 shares of stock repurchased for a total of $2.4 million and $7.2 million in capital expenditures. As a result, cash on hand increased by $95.4 million to $380 million.
Moving to the balance sheet. The largest shift during the quarter was due to the substantial completion of the purchase price allocation for Raymarine, which reallocated $128 million from other assets equally to goodwill and intangible assets. One item still to be completed is the allocation of certain tax assets associated with Raymarine, which will be concluded in Q4.
We completed the previously announced acquisition of ICx Technologies on October 4 for a total of $232 million, net of $36 million in cash acquired. In Q4, we will complete the purchase price allocation for ICx, and currently estimate amortization of intangible to be in the range of $2 million to $3 million in Q4. In addition, we anticipate additional transaction expenses of approximately $2 million to $3 million during the quarter.
Including all of these items, we do expect ICx to be profitable in the fourth quarter. Including all of these items, we now anticipate earnings per share for all of 2010 to be in the range of $1.53 to $1.56 compared with our previous full year EPS outlook of $1.48 to $1.53. Our full year revenue outlook including ICx and Raymarine is now $1.375 billion to $1.4 billion.
This concludes the summary of our third quarter financial results. Let me now turn the call back to Earl."

Q3 of last year, however, had over $30 million of RAID shipments in it, and this quarter was less than $3 million of RAID shipments in Q3. And Q4 we'll have very few. So we're getting other opportunities to throw in that pipeline.

The other thing is Q4 is traditionally, I think, pretty good for them. And so they’ll have pretty good revenue in Q4. I think the real issue you’re pointing at here is they historically have had not been very good at forecasting their profitability or meeting their numbers that they have. And I think one of the big reasons for that is that it is a company that is very much decentralized. It has multiple locations. I think it's more like 30 locations around the U.S. and some in Canada and Europe. And it's been relatively tough to manage. It has not been well integrated. And I don't mean that negatively to previous management. I just think that there is some integration that needs to be done. And I think there's some trimming that needs to be done. And that will be a process that we are beginning. I think the people at ICx are excited about the opportunity to join FLIR. They can see where our products and their products can add value to the customer together, particularly when we integrate them together. So I think there's a lot of work to be done, clearly.

And looking at Raymarine, we thought we saw an opportunity to significantly increase infrared in that market. The concern I think people have is the fact that it was a large acquisition. It was $180 million, and therefore a change in our company. If Raymarine was a $60 million company, I would have been just delighted to buy it. You don't have your pick in that decision-making. Yes, it was a relatively large company compared to FLIR, but you say was it difficult for us to? No, I don't think so. I think in the beginning, we struggled a lot. Then as we understood what the ability of that business might be to grow infrared, and therefore, how profitable it might be. And it as a business by itself, was a very good business. It became more interesting for us to buy it. ICx, on the other hand just gives us a lot more sensors. And eventually, we see these sensors being in combination with infrared in many applications. Right now, we know that radar and infrared that ICx makes is clearly 100% in our camp, if you will, today. Overtime, these other sensors will be used with infrared sensors. So yes, I guess, but also, the timing was right for us. The economy was bad. The prices of these companies were, I think, exceptionally good. And their future is exceptionally good as stand-alone companies. So a whole bunch of things went in to the thinking. I don't think there was a lot of fighting internally about whether we're dampening our infrared business or not. That wasn't discussed."

Doesn't mean that it's not going to be our core going forward.

So we’re on our second generation of high-definition camera systems and putting in a shortwave infrared camera as well. So we'll have visible shortwave, long wave. We're out there on the leading edge of technology. I just saw an announcement this last week where one of our competitors is actually getting funded by the government to improve their system to our kind of capability, and we're already there. So we're very strong in both the large gimbal and in the small gimbal platform as well, as it moves to HD and [indiscernible] systems. So those systems are being accepted around the world. It's not just a U.S. phenomenon for us, but actually we're very, very strong internationally with our airborne products. Switching to maritime. The SPS program, which we've re-won this last quarter and announced, is a great maritime program for us. As you may know, we're putting two sensors on all the Navy ships. And we've started with the Aegis cruisers and are now going to be working through the next fleet over the five years to add our sensors and can boast that in the first round of that, we were one of the only products, if not the only product, to pass APA valve [ph]. Actually even blowing up one of our sensors to make sure that it wouldn't send shrapnel around the deck of the ship, so very strong there as well with our small boats, with SeaFLIR, with the Coast Guard. These are all opportunities and great customers that we've had on board for a long time. So maritime opportunities grow slower than the airborne ones, but we think that we're very well established in the Navy and the Coast Guard and ships abroad.

So I think that we should see in that particular business. And let me expand that comment. They have products that they have developed that have extremely good margins. Some of them are better than ours. And those are products that we want to push on and grow. Radar is one of those. Some of their explosive detection is another. Some of their radiological work that they've done is another. Some of their chemical biological tools are very good margin. So when you kind of cut through their business, there's some very, very nice parts of it. Radar is an immediate link as you point out, some of the others will take longer. But over the long run, eventually, people are going to want to see a threat and they're going to want to measure that threat. And we see the threat today. We don't measure it today. When ICx comes along we'll be able to measure it. And we'll find different ways of integrating that scene and measuring with our equipment. So over the long run those sensors will integrate all of them. Right now, the immediate integration is radar. To your point."

We mentioned in Q3 that the U.S. component was stronger of course because of the end of year fiscal budget. But our international orders still remained strong. And I don't have a mix for you there as a percentage for Q3. And then U.K., with their recent announcement of reducing troops and saving money, of course, it's going to be a very difficult environment. Although we have done quite a bit of business in the U.K., especially with the special operation forces, but not as much with the regular forces there.
