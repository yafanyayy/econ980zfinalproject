We grew our revenues by 4% and adjusted OIBDA by 5% compared to 2008. And that was despite a sharp recession that caused many consumers to lose their jobs and homes, and was drove the sharpest advertising downturn in a generation.Despite these challenges, we met or exceeded every element of our guidance for the year. We posted net adds of nearly 800,000 primary service units in 2009, and customer relationships were steady at 14.6 million. Our 2009 performance reinforces our belief that we are in a great business, and it demonstrates that we manage it prudently. We again carefully balanced ARPU and subscriber growth, and we controlled our costs. Despite lower growth in our subscription business and a decline in add sales, we increased our adjusted OIBDA margin in 2009 compared to 2008.We also reached a significant qualitative milestone in 2009. Through our spin-off from Time Warner, we became an independent, publicly traded company with a single class of stock. In the year just ended, we strengthened our balance sheet considerably. After paying a $10.9 billion special dividend, which from perspective is equal to more than $30 per new Time Warner Cable share. We reduced our leverage from 3.7x adjusted OIBDA last March 31, just over 3.3x at year end. We're comfortably on track to achieve our target leverage of 3.25x in the first quarter of 2010.As a result of our progress in 2009, we're now positioned to begin returning capital to our shareholders. This morning, we announced the initiation of a regular dividend and established a quarterly rate of $0.40 per share or $1.60 per share annually. This starting point reflects our confidence, the strength and stability of the company's cash flows. We set the yield higher than our cable peers and higher than the average of S&P 500 companies that pay a dividend. In fact, the yield initiation is in the 85th percentile of all dividend initiations the S&P 500 companies in the last 10 years. The dividend provides a significant yield, yet, it also provides us the flexibility to invest in organic growth, as well as to consider strategic acquisitions and additional means of returning capital to shareholders over time. Now turning to the year ahead. There are widespread reports of economic turnaround. However, we have not seen a material improvement in the economic factors most relevant to our business, things like housing vacancies, unemployment and consumer confidence.Nonetheless, we expect that our core residential business will continue to grow, and that growth in our Commercial business will accelerate in 2010. In addition, we're pleased to see growth in our high-margin advertising business for the first time in over a year due to a strengthening ad market and political ad spending around the midterm elections that promise some very competitive races in parts of our footprint.You'll see both new products and product improvements from us this year. In video, we'll have the capability to carry as many as 200 HD channels. We'll enhance our network DVR base to Start Over and Look Back products, and we'll introduce Multi-Room DVR. In high-speed data, we'll make our DOCSIS 3.0 product available in more cities, and we're about to launch a portal that will enable our digital phone customers to manage their accounts of features to which they subscribe. In addition to the accelerated growth we expect in our Commercial business, we will invest in our Road Runner Mobile product in the year ahead. Now available in parts of Texas, the Carolinas and Hawaii, Road Runner Mobile will become more broadly available as the year proceeds. We will have some margin dilutions into the start-up costs of this business. But we believe that mobile broadband could become an important part of our product portfolio in the coming years. We'll continue to focus on cost management, not just due to the continuing weakness in the economy, but because it's part of what we do every year. In summary, we came out of 2009 strong and well positioned to face the challenges in the year ahead. Our balance sheet is strong, and we're very pleased to demonstrate our confidence on our free cash flow through the initiation of a meaningful quarterly dividend. We will execute with the same discipline  you have come to expect and we will continue to invest in growth in 2010. I'll now over to Rob for more details."

Despite the weak econom",2446,"Thanks, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. As Glenn mentioned, we delivered another quarter of solid financial results, meeting or exceeding our full year guidance in every category. Let's start with the 2009 highlights on Slide 3. Despite the weak economy and tough competition, we held customer relationships essentially flat in 2009, while adding almost 800,000 primary service units and more than 1 million revenue-generating units. We grew full year 2009 revenues by almost 4% and adjusted OIBDA by almost 5%, demonstrating the resilience of our business, our financial discipline and our focus on balancing ARPU and subscriber net adds.We also reduced our capital intensity, while still investing in our fast-growing Commercial Services business. Full year CapEx as a percentage of revenues was down 240 basis points from last year. This decline, coupled with our adjusted OIBDA growth, resulted in adjusted OIBDA less CapEx growth of almost 22%, exceeding our full year guidance. We generated record full year free cash flow of over $1.9 billion and diluted EPS of $3.05 per share, slightly ahead of what we projected at the start of the year. With our very healthy free cash flow, we delevered rapidly following the payment of our special dividend in March, and we ended the year with a leverage ratio of 3.3x. And as Glenn discussed, given our reduced leverage and our ability to generate free cash flow, we are starting to return capital to our shareholders through the initiation of a $1.60 per share annual dividend.Before we turn to our results, let's turn to Slide 4, and I'll spend a minute on the dividend. First, I want to say that I'm really excited to have reached this significant milestone, and to have done so less than a year after taking on an incremental $10.9 billion in debt to finance our special dividend. In the intervening months, we did a lot of research, which included talking with many of you about you're views of return of capital. Our dividend announcement today incorporates key elements of what we heard. First, we heard that we should make the dividend meaningful. Our initial dividend yield is higher than our cable peers and higher than the average of S&P 500 companies that pay a dividend. And I think it's significant that very few companies initiated dividend of 53%. Second, we heard that it is important to increase the dividend over time. And while it's premature to talk about future increases, it's clear that our dividend payout ratio leaves us flexibility to do just that. And third, we heard that we should retain adequate liquidity for other initiatives. Our dividend provides us with the flexibility to invest in organic growth, as well as consider strategic acquisitions and additional meanings of returning capital to shareholders over time.With that, let's turn to our results, starting with the subscriber trends on the next slide. During the fourth quarter, we added 101,000 primary service units to end the year with 26.4 million PSUs. As a reminder, that includes both residential and commercial PSUs. PSU connects continues to be much weaker than a year ago, offset in part by much lower disconnects, as churn was down across the board.Fourth quarter video subscriber trends improved, with video subscribers declining by 105,000 compared to 119,000 lost in the fourth quarter of 2008. Fourth quarter digital video net adds of 56,000 also improved meaningfully year-over-year, as the DVR net adds of 105,000. Once again, HSD was our best-performing PSU category. We added 122,000 high-speed data subscribers, an 8% increase over the 113,000 HSD subs we added in last year's fourth quarter.We finished the year with just under 9.3 million HSD subscribers. Our residential HSD subscriber mix continues to shift toward our Premium Tier products, with Turbo accounting for almost 70% of our residential net adds in the quarter, that's the highest percentage in the last six quarters. At year end, Turbo subscribers represented about 11% of our residential HSD subscriber base. Digital Phone was only PSU category for which net additions were down year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We did however add 84,000 subs as we continue to take share from the telcos. Total subscribers at year end exceeded 4.2 million.While customer relationships declined by 55,000 in the quarter, we continue to increase the number of customers in bundles. We added 64,000 Triple Plays 27,000 Double Plays. As a result, over 57% of our customers were in Double or Triple Play packages at year end. Let me briefly summarize our full year subscriber results on Slide 6. I think it's important to remember that despite all the very difficult economic news in 2009, we held our customer relationships pretty much flat and grew PSUs by almost 800,000 and RGUs by over 1 million. Digital Phone subscribers increased nearly 12% and high-speed data subscribers grew over 6%. Video subscribers declined by 210,000, that's more than 104,000 we lost in 2008 despite the benefits of the DTV transition. However, we continue to grow our Digital Video and DVR subscriber base. Before moving on to our financial results, let me give you some color on what we're seeing early in 2010. In aggregate, year-to-date PSU net adds are well below year-ago levels. Net adds in all three residential PSU categories are up with last year's pace. This is not unexpected. While there is some signs that the economy is set to recover, unemployment and vacancy rates in our footprint continue to be much higher than they were in the year-ago period. On a positive note, commercial PSU net adds have actually been somewhat higher than last year. Moving on to our financial result, let's start with revenues on the next slide. Full year revenues increased 3.9% or $668 million to $17.9 billion. Fourth quarter revenues of $4.5 billion grew 3% over the fourth quarter of 2008. During the fourth quarter, subscription revenues increased just over 4%, reflecting a 3% year-over-year increase in primary service units and over a 1% improvement in subscription revenue per PSU. Residential revenues grew over 3 1/2% while commercial revenues grew just over 14%. HSD subscriber growth drove a 7 1/2% increase in HSD revenues. Once again, providing the largest contribution to our subscription revenue growth.Voice revenues rose more than 11%, also driven by subscriber growth, partially offset by lower monthly ARPU. And Video revenues rose about 1 1/2% year-over-year, driven by an increase in DVR revenues, price increases and an increase in Digital Video subscribers, which were partially offset by declines in the Video and Premium Channel subscribers and transactional Video on Demand revenues. You'll notice that our trending schedules this quarter include a more detailed break out of the components of Video revenue, which should help you better understand the drivers of our Video revenue performance.Let's turn to our commercial operations on the next slide. We added 9,000 Business Class Phone customers and 2,000 Commercial HSD subs in the quarter. We closed the year with 67,000 Commercial Digital Phone subscribers and 184,000 Voice lines. That's more than double the number of subs and lines we had at the end of 2008. At year end, we had 295,000 commercial HSD customers. Commercial revenue growth remained strong despite the weak economy, growing just over 14% to $243 million in the fourth quarter and increasing nearly 15.5% to $915 million for the full year. Our fourth quarter commercial revenue growth was driven by commercial data, which grew 6 1/2%; Business Class Phone revenues, which doubled year-over-year; cell backhaul revenues, which increased five fold. During 2009, we restructured our commercial organization and staffed up our commercial sales force. And as we said to you last quarter, we expect these changes to reaccelerate our commercial revenue growth to north of 20% in 2010.Flipping to the next slide. As we've been discussing all year, ad revenue declines have been a drag on our overall revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth, as well as our margins. Full year ad revenues were down nearly 22% versus 2008. In the fourth quarter, ad revenues were once again significantly lower the year-ago period, down about 17 1/2%. But as you can see from the chart, the trend is encouraging. Ad revenue grew 10% sequentially, and the year-over-year decline in Q4 was the lowest of the year.Moreover, more than 2/3 of the year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter was driven by lower political advertising. The reminder of the shortfall came from national sales. So our local and regional sales, which comprise the largest part of our business, were actually relatively flat. Given the recent improvement in advertising trends and the anticipated benefit from political advertising in 2010, we expect advertising revenues to return to growth in 2010.Turning to ARPU on Slide 10. Fourth quarter subscription ARPU per customer relationship increased almost 5% to nearly $99, reflecting continued increases in bundled penetration and our pricing discipline. As I mentioned, our subscription ARPU per PSU was up over 1% year-over-year in Q4, and has increased year-over-year for each of the last six quarters. Higher commercial contribution had certainly helped here, as residential subscription ARPU per PSU was essentially flat, in part reflecting a shift in our residential subscription revenue mix from higher ARPU Video to lower ARPU HSD and Voice.Looking at product ARPUs, video ARPU increased nearly 4% from Q4 '08, driven primarily by price increases and higher penetration of Digital Video Services including DVRs. Both residential and commercial video ARPUs improved. HSD ARPU grew over 1% versus Q4 '08 and increased year-over-year during each quarter of 2009. While the year-over-year growth in Q4 was primarily driven by increased revenues from commercial HSD, residential HSD ARPU also improved. Digital Phone ARPU declined just over 1% year-over-year, that's a continued improvement in the year-over-year trends. Turning to adjusted OIBDA on the next slide. Full year adjusted OIBDA increased 4.7% to $6.5 billion, as margins improved by 20 basis points. Fourth quarter adjusted OIBDA grew 3% year-over-year to $1.7 billion. Once again, the decline in our high-margin advertising business was a drag on adjusted OIBDA growth and margins. Our focus on cost management yielded fourth quarter operating expenses growth of just 3%, reflecting a 4.1% increase in cost of revenues and flat SG&A expenses. Drawing down further on costs. Programming expense, our largest cost category, increased just over 5% for the quarter and 6 1/5% for the full year, as Video and Premium Channel sub declines and lower VOD costs only partly offset contractual rate increases, incremental retrans costs and fees for new channel offerings. I know there's a great deal of interest in how our recent programming deals will affect 2010 programming expense. At this point, our expectation is that 2010 programming cost growth will be modestly higher than in 2009.Employee costs, which represent roughly a third of our total OpEx, grew almost 3% in Q4 '09, with almost all of the increase attributable to higher pension and medical expenses. Marketing expense of $155 million in the quarter increased 27% versus last year's fourth quarter, as we spread our marketing more evenly across the quarters this year. Full year marketing spend was pretty much flat versus 2008.Fourth quarter voice costs were up over 11 1/2% due to growth in Digital Phone subscribers. Bad debt expense for the quarter was down $40 million year-over-year. This decline was primarily due to improvements in collection efforts and a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the quality of residential receivables at the end of the year. For the full year, bad debt expense was less than 1% of revenues, down 30 basis points year-over-year. Turning to capital spending on Slide 12. Our capital spending in the quarter was $944 million, bringing our full year CapEx to just over $3.2 billion, consistent with our guidance. Total CapEx as a percentage of revenues for the year was 18.1% versus 20.5% in 2008. For the full year, we increased commercial capital spending about 60% year-over-year to $352 million. We increased commercial line extension CapEx, which includes the capital we spent this year to grow our Cell Tower Backhaul business. We also spent more on scalable infrastructure to support some of our other commercial growth initiatives.Residential capital spending was down approximately 13% versus 2008, with the decline in CPE CapEx, mostly lower HD DVR spending, accounting for nearly 90% of the full year reduction. Residential line extension and upgrade CapEx declined, while scalable infrastructure and support capital spending increased, primary related to spending on capacity expansion initiatives to accommodate more HD channels and faster-rate HSD speeds. Landel will talk about some of these initiatives in a moment.Looking forward to 2010, we expect that capital spending will be less than $3 billion Moving on to cash flow on Slide 13. Full year adjusted OIBDA less CapEx increased 21.7% year-over-year. In the year ahead, we plan to grow adjusted OIBDA less CapEx in the mid-teens percent, even as we incur on the order of $50 million in startup loses in conjunction with the continued rollout of our new Wireless Broadband business. We generated full year free cash flow, a record $1.9 billion. Our full year free cash flow increased 10.2% year-over-year despite significantly higher interest payments. As you look out at our 2010 forecast, remember that unless this further economic stimulus legislation bonus depreciation will go away in any event, prior-year depreciation benefits will reverse. So cash taxes will be significantly higher this year.Turning to the next slide. Diluted earnings per share exceeded guidance at $3.05 for the full year 2009 compared with a diluted loss per share of $22.55 in 2008. Looking forward, we expect that 2010 full year diluted EPS will be in the $3.25 to $3.50 per share range.Turning to the balance sheet on the last slide. At December 31, our net debt and preferred equity totaled $21.6 billion, and our leverage ratio was 3.3x. We remain on track to achieve our target leverage ratio of 3.25x by the end of the first quarter even with our new dividend. During the quarter, we continue to solidify our balance sheet, taking advantage of favorable market conditions to replace short-term borrowings with attractive longer-term bonds. We've also continued to swap fixed interest for floating to improve our overall cost of borrowing. I'm exceptionally pleased with what we've been able to accomplish this year to strengthen our balance sheet.So to summarize, before I turn it over to Landel, we posted another quarter of revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth, rounding out a year in which we generated very strong free cash flows despite the challenging environment, we strengthened our balance sheet further and we demonstrated our confidence in our long-term fundamentals by initiating a very meaningful dividend.

This morning, I'm going to take a couple of minutes to recap some of our key accomplishments in 2009 before turning to an overview of the important work ahead in 2010. Operationally, we made a lot of progress last year in a very difficult environment. Let me share some of the highlights. First on the product front. We rolled out our own program guides, which are now deployed on more than half of our digital set tops. We expanded the deployment of Start Over, now reaching 7 million households or about 80% of our Digital Video subscribers. Through our successful efforts for Switched Digital Video in all digital conversions, a lot of our cities have north of 100 HD channels, and our average is now 87 compared to 57 a year ago. And we made DOCSIS 3.0 technology a reality in New York City, for our Wideband product is now available. In marketing, we expanded our enhanced store deployments in Best Buy and we heavied up our fourth quarter media spending in key cities and customer segments. And in commercial, we brought in new seasoned management and we hired more than 240 sales professionals towards the end of the year, which positions us well for 2010. So to summarize 2009. We made a lot of operational progress in a challenging environment, and we made investments that will make us even stronger as we go forward.Turning next to the competitive environment. As we enter 2010, we believe that we are well positioned competitively. Telcos have continued to expand their fiber-based deployments, and we estimate that AT&T's U-verse product is now available to approximately 20% of our homes passed and Verizon's FiOS offering is available to 9%. This availability has increased in a relatively steady, predictable manner. And we expect that by the end of 2010, the two ILECs will expand their respective fiber-based offerings to cover between 38% to 40% of our passes. Verizon said that they will complete their FiOS build in 2010 and AT&T in 2011.These deployments in many cities have now passed their first, in some cases, their second anniversaries. And as a result, the increasing numbers of telco video customers are coming off their initial contracts. This provides a significant opportunity for us to win back customers who mistakenly thought that grass might be greener over the telco fence. That is until the telcos dug up their yard. In fact, we have seen increasing numbers of win-backs in recent quarters, and we intend to sharpen our focus on this opportunity in 2010.One last point on telco competition. It appears that in our service area, the footprint of expansion have slowed. But more importantly, their video share of growth is also slow. We're also competing well against the satellite providers. Recent aggressive promotional activity, particularly from dish has continued. But we believe, we were successful in slowing the subscriber migration in the fourth quarter, strong with balanced promotions and increased media spend.Turning to 2010. We have aggressive operational objectives for the year ahead. We intend to further strengthened our products, sharpen our marketing and investing key growth initiatives even as we reduced costs by further improving the efficiency of our operations. Beginning with our Residential Subscription business, I want to highlight some of the changes we're driving in 2010. First, we're redoubling our focus on our Video product. In a number of cities, we're going to carefully realigned the Digital Video line ups with channels of like genre or group. We're also putting in place capabilities to accommodate as many as 150 to 200 HD channels in most of our systems by the end of the year. We're able to do this in large part due to the success of our Switched Digital Video deployment. This year, we will effectively complete our company-wide deployment by installing switches in L.A., Dallas and New York City. Our Network DVR-based Start Over product has been a tremendous success with customers. Now that it's broadly available, we're turning our focus to Look Back. To extend the availability window to 72 hours after programs air. We now have Look Back rights for 87 networks. We're planning to launch in additional cities this year.  In addition to enhances to our Network DVR products, we're exited about our new Multi-Room DVR product, which will also introduce later in 2010. Next, turning to high-speed data. The early experience DOCSIS 3.0-enabled Wideband Service has been very positive. In it's first quarter of availability in New York City, we generated 2,000 net additions. More than a third of these were commercial customers. Not surprisingly, roughly nine of 10 new residential Wideband subscribers were existing Time Warner Cable subscribers who upgraded their service. In 2010, we plan to make our Wideband product available in additional cities. As I mentioned in the past, our deployment will be surgical, focusing on those areas in which we need higher speed than our existing Turbo product provide. And to the extent that we identify a broader need, we can expand our deployment.In phone, our net adds declined pretty sharply over the past year, as competition from wireless continued. Despite the challenging environment, we believe that we have substantial opportunity in phone. So this month, we embarked on a plan to recharge our Digital Phone product. Our approach has three key elements: First, we're focusing internally on driving better performance of our sales channel through training, coaching and most importantly, incentive. We launched a similar program in the Carolinas a couple of quarters ago with strong results. Second, we'll adjust the positioning of Digital Phone to customers, and we will introduce more differentiation. You'll hear more about this as the year progresses. Third, we're focused on segmentation. Our analysis indicates that certain of our large and profitable customer segments continued to hold substantial untapped opportunity. We also plan to launch our new Phone Manager product, beginning in the second quarter of 2010. In addition to enabling our customers to manage their accounts and features to which they took pride [ph], our new portal will provide viewable voice mail and caller ID on the PC, is really cool stuff. We're off to a good start with our new wireless broadband product, Road Runner mobile. Since our product launched in Dallas, parts of the Carolinas in December, we've added more than 1,000 subs. In the recent weeks, we've launched a service in San Antonio and Hawaii.As you would expect, most of our Road Runner mobile subs were existing Time Warner Cable customers. So far around two-thirds have taken the unlimited 4G service and most of the rest, have taken a nationwide 4G/3G plan. We're encouraged that almost 20% of new wireless customers also added one or more additional Time Warner Cable products. We expect to launch Road Runner Mobile in sizable fraction of our footprint in 2010. As a result, we expect to incur pretty substantial expenses, especially related to marketing and device activation. We're willing to make a significant investment in the start-up years because we believe that wireless broadband could become a meaningful part of our business down the road. Commercial, we hit the ground running in 2010 after spending much of 2009 hiring and training new members of the team. We ended 2009 with approximately 2,500 employees, an increase of more than 500 during the year. And we expect to drive commercial revenue growth above 20% in 2010.In advertising, we're seeing positive signs, as Rob mentioned. During last year's downturn, we focused on metrics and more importantly, share gain. We think that the investments we made will enable us to come back even stronger this year. Another component of the opportunity here is advanced advertising. We expect to continue to make steady progress in 2010, with the focus on interactivity. The first set is implementation of EBIF, which is a set of standards underlying interactive applications. We currently have around 900,000 EBIF-enabled set-tops in New York City alone and we expect to have approximately 7 million deployed our systems by the end of 2010. In addition to our own use, EBIF-enabled set-tops are also critical to Canoe's success. Canoe's first iTV advertising product will be a request for information application, which will allow viewers the 30-second spot to use their remote control to request advertisers' special offers like coupons or product samples via mail. Canoe is currently testing this product with several network partners and are on track for commercial launch this spring.Turning now to marketing. We upweighted [ph] media spending on the fourth quarter, using marketing resource allocation model and I'll govern how and where we place media. We will use this model for 2010 to better allocate our media on a consolidated enterprise-wide basis. We will also continue our successful competitive advertising campaign in 2010. We believe our message continues to keep the competitors at bay as we go directly at competitors' weaknesses.We went to school [ph] on pricing in late 2009 and we think the rate increases we've undertaken are more strategic, smarter for yield management. In addition, we've created a longer term enterprise-wide pricing architecture. And by the end of the year, all areas will have standardized pricing and promotional approaches. We think this more centralized approach, combined with increased use of segmentation and targeting of high-value customers will also improve yield management. One last point on marketing. All of our containing improvements are in the context of balancing share, ARPU and profitability. We're always focused on improving the efficiency of our operations. And in 2010, we'll continue to put a lot of energy in the cost management. It's a little early, but we think restructuring expense in 2010 may be anywhere for $25 million to $50 million. We'll update you on this later in the year as we have firmer estimates. Now let's give you three examples of our cost management initiatives this year. First, we're planning to further consolidate some subscale calls. While our satisfaction of scores have been climbing and we feel our service levels are good, we think there's a significant opportunity to find a more optimal spread and sites for call centers. In 2010, we'll work to consolidate centers where it make sense and virtualize calls across more markets to load balance and reduce cost to serve.Second, we've embarked on a concentrated effort to streamline our procurement processes by leveraging our nationwide scale. And third, we've launch an initiative we call Go it alone, in which we will transition certain digital phone support functions away from Sprint. Transition will improve our economics but will take several years to complete.In summary, we made great progress on the operational front in 2009, even while making some investments that we expect to benefit us in the years ahead. In 2010, we have an aggressive agenda to further improve our products and marketing, and we plan to expand our investments in commercial and wireless broadband. All of this is targeted at making Time Warner Cable more competitive, so we can drive more growth and more profitability. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

As you know, we have an ongoing dialogue with all of our owners, at least, certainly, our largest ones. And what they've been expressing is very consistent with what we're doing. So first, they're saying they like the capital structure with the 3.25x target. It was like their appropriate kind of leverage that keeps us investment grade. And recognize this is just a target, so we're probably going to be not exactly that. We can be a little more, a little less over time. It's hard to hit it exactly. Second, we're hearing, ""Make sure you're investing enough in the business, where you get a good return and keep the business healthy."" And then third, to the extent there's excess capital, return it. And we've had a lot of dialogue about the preferred form of returning money, because there's obviously different techniques. And although we hear different things from different people, I think there was a strong consensus that starting with a meaningful dividend was a good idea. So that's what we've done and we think we've made quite a statement with the size of the dividend. As I said in my prepared remarks, it's significant, the yield is significant compared to what others have done on the S&P 500. So that gives you a question which is, clearly, if nothing were to change and we weren't to make any more investments, over time, we would further delever. And I'd say it's our attempt to stick to what I just said. So 3.25 is kind of our north star target. We do want to make sure that we've invested the right amount of money in the business, and the business environment remains uncertain, particularly tax laws and policies. Rob talked about the meaning of the bonus depreciation over [ph] free cash flow. So we want to start with this big dividend and if we want to explore organic growth, perhaps some smaller investments in and around our business. And over time, if we keep delevering, then we'll look at additional ways to return capital."

One was to better educate consumers about how all this works. And then secondly, to start a dialogue with consumers and hear back from them about what they had thought. I think that one thing we have learned, which maybe we all should've known but we are all so close to the business, consumers really don't understand how this business works. They don't understand the fees they paid us. In part, go to, for us, to buy programming. In fact, as recently as yesterday, I had somebody sort of man on the street [indiscernible] and he thought we just owned all the channels. So I think that education effort was well worthwhile. I think in a broader sense, I said this at conferences, we heard from consumers' frustration about the size of the package and perhaps, desire for more choice. Everybody on this call knows that going to the full ala carte is completely impractical. It's impractical for the program economics. Just think about doing an installation call, trying to take a customer through hundreds of channels, describe each one, do you want it or do you not want it. Clearly, that doesn’t make any sense. But I think that if this industry and the programmers work towards an environment where we offer more variety of packages, some of which might be slightly smaller, I think that would be consumer friendly and I think we would be in better shape as an industry including programmers. Beyond that I think the retrans process is clearly broken. And we're hearing that from public officials. The rules around this date largely back to 1992, the Telecom Act, when the world was a lot different than it is now. 18 years is a long time. I think the idea that consumers are being held hostage, there's a threat signals are going to be pulled off and these things happen at 3:00 in the morning, New Year’s eve. That's not a good consumer thing for anybody, and it's not a great mechanism. So I think we need to reform how these negotiations work. That's not to say there shouldn’t be payments, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying the way you arrive at the payment. This isn’t working for consumers, which means it's not really working for the broader industry. So having said that, Rob can you talk about specifics?"

Obviously, I'm not going to talk about the Comcast deal. They need to talk about that and their motivation. I think I've made, in the past, some comments about what happened when we put Time and Warner together which is many, many years ago now. I think it was back, I think, 1990 and the deal was made obviously in the year or so leading up to that. And so different era, 20 years ago. At that time, we had a theory that by being vertically integrated, by having a studio and by having networks and by having cable distribution, that as the world changed and it continues to change, that the relative profitability in those segments might change and we would have everything and we'd be fine. And that indeed turns out to be the case, even though there were no particular operating synergies between the pieces. But we also discovered over time that not only couldn’t we lose in a sense, but we could also never win, because Time Warner had other businesses too, but there was always some part of the company that was not doing well and some other parts that were doing quite well and investors tend to focus on part that wasn’t doing well. So I think Time Warner can speak for itself but I think that, in part, is what's led to the various spinoffs that you've seen and what is obviously a different company today than it was. But I don’t know that any of that is necessarily relevant to Comcast/NBC. They have to talk to themselves. More broadly on M&A, I think that we've been pretty consistent on this. We will consider looking at acquisitions in our space. Nothing too far from our space. And we're going to do it in a disciplined way, meaning that we're here to earn returns for our shareholders.

I think that's the same thing I said to you last year, at this time, when you asked the question. Maybe even slightly down a bit. Let me just give you the drivers so you can get a flavor for what's going on here. Our residential subscription revenue mix continues to shift in the direction of higher margin businesses, meaning more HSD and phone relative to video. That's actually a benefit to margins. Our overall subscription revenue mix continues to shift toward commercial, which is higher margin. That's another good guy. And then we've got the return to growth of our high margin ad business. So that all those things should help and when you layer on top of that some of the initiatives Landel discussed, that those are all helpers. But on the other side, we've got this continual issue we've talked about a lot, which is margin compression on the video side. And the new piece to the puzzle is that we are going to invest a bunch of money this year and what I suggest is something on the order of $50 million that shows up as operating expense in the rollout of Road Runner mobile, our wireless broadband offering. So when you roll all those things together, I think they more or less offset one another, and we're probably in the flat to maybe a slight bit down realm."

And you've probably heard me say this before, but the first is that I don’t believe networks of the future are going to be a bright line, either wireless or wireline. I think the networks of the future are hybrid networks, where similar products are going to be offered to a whole variety of different devices the Four Any's that we've talked about publicly. So wireless delivery has certain features for certain devices and wireline for other ones. And in particular, because spectrum is ultimately limited, I think that that needs to be brought through carefully and the traffic dumped in the wires probably as quickly as possible. If you look at some of the problems people are having with iPhones, I think that speaks to that. So within that context, I think what we're doing with Clearwire is really just the very beginning. The network is being built. We're selling a relatively simple product. It's just air cards for PCs. But I think within the context of the Four Any's, this will develop in exciting ways that we can't really quite imagine today, but I think there's going to be a whole array of products using these hybrid networks of the future. So this is a very, very early beginning, I don’t know how to size the opportunity, because I don’t think any of us really and fully imagine what the products are going to be, but it's an exciting opportunity. As to voice, we have the capability of creating a voice product. We're working with both Clearwire and Sprint on that. Having said that, I think there's plenty of voice providers out there today in the cellular business and there doesn’t appear to be a crying demand for another one, nor does it appear that we really need that in our product portfolio. But we have the capability if we actually need it but right now, I don’t think we do."

It's been quite a few quarters since we've been able to deliver such positive news. We grew first quarter revenues by over 5% and adjusted our OIBDA by almost 11% compared to the year ago quarter. The economy remained weak and subscriber net adds again declined year-over-year but importantly, net adds showed an improving trend as the quarter proceeded.
Free cash flow at $652 million was very strong. I would attribute much of our strength in the quarter to our continued operational discipline. In particular, our ARPU growth demonstrates our ability to match the increasing value of our products to consumers expanding needs even in a challenging economy. Through a combination of product enhancements and more comprehensive marketing, we've grown profitably even in the face of more intense competition from both satellite and telephone companies. Our strong performance was also driven by accelerated growth in two of our businesses. In our Commercial business, our first quarter revenue growth rate of 19% was higher than we achieved in any quarter last year and is fully consistent with our achieving a growth rate north of 20% for the full year. Our Advertising business has re-bounded even faster than we expected as first quarter revenues grew 19%.
We intend to continue to develop new high-growth businesses. An early stage example is our 4G Road Runner Mobile product, which we now launched in several cities. This quarter we also delivered our commitment to return capital to our shareholders by paying our first regular dividend, which at inception provided a yield above 3.5%. In addition, we reduced our leverage to our target of the timetable we promised a year ago. 
Before I turn the call over to Rob for a more detailed discussion of our financial results, I'd like to touch on two regulatory topics. First, there's been a lot of speculation that in response to a recent DC circuit court decision and related net neutrality concerns that the government might impose new laws and rules that would discourage investment and Internet infrastructure. There's also a concern than an extended period of regulatory uncertainty might have much the same effect.
We remain hopeful that the FCC and Congress will proceed with these concerns in mind as they consider various approaches to regulation of the Internet. We intend to continue to advocate strongly for the network owners for the role of private capital in building an Internet that serves even more people with ever higher capacity each year. 
Another important issue is re-transmission consent. The process by which re-transmission fees are set is broken and broadcasters are using that broken process in a way that's disruptive to consumers by threatening to withhold signals as a negotiating tactic. As you're aware, we filed a petition on this issue with the FCC last month calling for a better process to set these fees, including arbitration and interim carriage. The commission is currently soliciting comments. In the meantime, we'll keep doing what we do best, providing innovative and increasing valuable services to our customers, generating free cash flow and making smart capital allocation decisions to provide attractive returns to our shareholders. Next Rob will give you additional insight into our financial performance."

Let's turn to our first quarter highlights on Slide 3.First quarter revenues grew 5.4% over the first quarter of last year. That's the highest year-over-year revenue growth we've seen since the fourth quarter of 2008. The growth was driven by solid residential revenue growth, coupled with accelerating growth in our Commercial and Ad Sales businesses, both of which posted over 19% increases. We continue to focus on balancing subscriber and ARPU growth, and our ARPU per customer relationship grew by almost 6%. Adjusted OIBDA was up a very strong 10.9%, and adjusted OIBDA less CapEx was up nearly 27%, reflecting both our revenue performance and our ongoing efforts to manage both operating and capital costs. We generated over $650 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which we used to pay our first quarterly dividend and to further reduce our debt. And I'm pleased to report that we finished the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.17x below the target leverage ratio we established when we announced our separation from Time Warner. Finally, our first quarter results put us right on track to meet or exceed all of the elements of our full year guidance.
Let's move to our subscriber results on the next slide. We added 276,000 Primary Service Units and 378,000 revenue-generating units in the first quarter and ended the quarter with 26.6 million PSUs and 35.6 million RGUs. While we added fewer PSUs in this year's first quarter than in last year's, there are two points worth noting. First, most of the year-over-year difference can be attributed to the DTV transition, which accounted for roughly 100,000 PSU net additions in Q1 '09. And second, year-over-year comparisons in the latter part of the quarter were significantly better than in January and in early February. I'll come back to what we're seeing so far in Q2 in a minute.
Once again, connects were down year-over-year in all PSU categories, but so were disconnects, as churn was down across the board. First quarter video subscribers declined by 42,000. Excluding the roughly 80,000 video subscribers we estimate we added in Q1 '09 related to the DTV transitions, video net adds were essentially flat year-over-year. We added 102,000 digital video customers in the quarter, pushing digital penetration to 70% of total video customers at quarter end. We also added 111,000 DVR customers in the quarter, and now over half our digital customers have DVRs. 
HSD continued to be our strongest PSU category. HSD net adds of 221,000 in the quarter were pretty much flat versus year-ago levels. Our HSD penetration increased to over 35% of homes passed. Residential HSD net adds were 212,000, and we continued to see the mix of our residential HSD subscriber base shift towards our higher-speed tiers as Turbo accounted for roughly 77,000 net adds and Wideband, our DOCSIS 3.0 offering, accounting for another 1,000. Over 11% of our residential HSD subscriber base now takes the Turbo product. For the second quarter in a row, the percentage of our residential HSD customer base that subscribes to our basic and light years of service declined. Commercial HSD net adds were 9,000, that's the highest since 2007.
We also added another 97,000 Digital Phone customers during the quarter, and our phone penetration at quarter end stood at over 16%. We added 86,000 residential voice customers and 11,000 Business Class Phone subs. We ended the quarter with 78,000 Business Class Phones subscribers, and that's more than twice the number of subscribers we had a year ago. Our customer relationships increased by 46,000 in the quarter, and we continued to have great success in increasing the number of customers in bundles. We added 73,000 Triple Plays and 82,000 Double Plays, ending the quarter with over 58% of our customers in Double or Triple Play packages.
Before we turn to our financial results, I promised I'd give you some color on the subscriber performance in the second quarter. The trends we experienced late in Q1 have continued into Q2, and PSU net adds over the last several weeks have been closer to last year's levels. I should remind you of two things as you think about Q2 subscriber performance. First, Q2 is typically a seasonally weak quarter for sub growth. And second, we picked up about 60,000 video subs related to the completion of the DTV transition in June of last year, which will negatively affect 2Q comparisons this year.
Turning to our financial results, let's start with revenues on the next slide. As I mentioned earlier, first quarter revenues increased 5.4% year-over-year to $4.6 billion. That's the product of just over 4% growth in residential subscription revenues and over 19% growth in both commercial subscription revenues and advertising revenues. Total subscription revenues, residential and commercial combined, grew almost 5%, driven by a healthy mix of rate and volume increases. HSD revenues were up more than 8% versus last year's first quarter, and again were the largest contributor to subscription revenue growth. Video revenues increased 2.5%, driven by price increases and increasing digital video subscribers and higher DVR service revenues, partially offset by a decline in video subs. And voice revenues grew over 9% driven by subscriber growth, which was partially offset by a modest decline in ARPU. Ad sales finally turned the corner in Q1, up over 19% powered by strong growth in most categories, particularly auto, media and political. Given our performance thus far, we now expect that full-year ad revenue will grow at least 15%.
Moving on to our commercial operations on the next slide. Commercial revenue growth re-accelerated to over 19% in the quarter, reflecting the steps we took last year to refocus and recharge our commercial organization. The increase was driven by 11% growth in commercial data revenues and a doubling of Business Class Phone revenues. Sell Backhaul revenues more than tripled from the year ago period. While still small, the Sell Backhaul business continues to contribute nicely to our overall commercial growth. As of quarter end, we were receiving revenues from wireless carriers for providing backhaul from cell towers with 3,600 radios. And we had another 1,800 radios under contract that have not yet come online. So overall, we're very pleased with our commercial performance so far in 2010, and we are on track to achieve the better than 20% full year commercial revenue growth that we discussed at the beginning of the year.
Moving on to ARPU on Slide 7. Although last year or so, we've talked frequently about balancing subscriber and ARPU growth, once again this quarter we maintained our discipline in this area and drove some of the strongest year-over-year and sequential ARPU growth we've seen in quite a while. First quarter ARPU per customer relationship increased 5.6% to $105. This was the biggest jump in ARPU per customer relationships since 2008 and was fueled by growth in PSUs per customers, growth in our Commercial and Ad Sales businesses and residential price increases. Subscription ARPU per PSU was up over 2%, driven by increases in both residential and commercial subscription ARPU per PSU.
Drilling down on product ARPUs. Video ARPU grew over 4.5% year-over-year and improved over 2.5% sequentially, driven primarily by price increases and higher penetration of digital programming tiers and DVRs. Both residential and commercial video ARPUs contributed to the growth. HSD ARPU was up almost 2% compared to last year's first quarter and was 1.3% higher than Q4 '09. The increases were largely the product of increased contribution from commercial HSD but residential HSD ARPU improved as well.  The decline in Digital Phone ARPU continued to moderate. In the first quarter, it was down about 1% year-over-year.
Let's turn to adjusted OIBDA on the next slide. First quarter adjusted OIBDA grew a very strong 10.9% to $1.7 billion as margin increased 180 basis points to 36.3%. The first quarter growth in high margin ad revenues certainly helped both adjusted OIBDA growth and overall margins as did margin improvement in our Residential Subscription business. Total first quarter operating expenses grew just 2.5% compared to last year. Programming expense increased just over 5%. Once again, video and premium channel subscriber declines partially offset contractual rate increases and incremental re-transmission consent costs. At this point, we still expect that full-year programming cost growth will be a little higher than last year with the year-over-year growth increasing as we progress through the year. Marketing expense of $151 million increased close to 8% over Q1 '09 with about half of the growth coming from increased marketing spend in our Commercial business. Voice costs were up just over 6.5% due to growth in Digital Phone subs. Employee costs, which represents roughly a third of our total operating expense were essentially flat with the prior year period as salary increases and higher medical expenses were almost fully offset by a reduction in internal headcount and contract labor and lower pension expense. It's worth noting that growth in compensation expense was lower than normal this quarter as our 2010 salary increases did not take effect until March of this year and due to uncertainty in the economy last year, most management salaries had not been increased since 2008.
Once again, our net bad debt expense was down significantly, falling over 60% to just $17 million, reflecting the better quality of our residential receivables versus last year and better collections. I'd also note that part of the year-over-year improvement in bad debt related to the fact that we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts in Q1 '09, given the then existing uncertainty in the economy. Those reserves were reversed in Q4 '09. 
At the start of the year, we mentioned that we expected to incur about $15 million of start-up losses in connection with the deployment of Road Runner Mobile, our wireless broadband offering. We incurred about $5 million of such losses in the first quarter, and we're still expecting full-year losses in the $50 million zone.
While we were pleased with our ability to manage costs in Q1, we are always focused on improving the efficiency of our operations, and we're engaged in a number of initiatives to further improve our cost structure over time. I think Landel mentioned last quarter that we're focused on consolidating our call centers, optimizing our procurement processes and reducing voice costs by in-sourcing the management of certain Digital Phone support functions.
Let's move on to CapEx on Slide 9. First quarter CapEx was $736 million or 16% of revenues. That's down from over 17.5% in Q1 '09. As has been the case for the last several quarters, we increased commercial CapEx while reducing residential capital spending. Commercial CapEx was $116 million. That's about 80% higher than in last year's first quarter as we invested in commercial growth initiatives including Sell Backhaul. Residential capital spending was down approximately 12% from Q1 '09, mostly due to the declines in CPE Capital, specifically HD DVRs and modems as well as lower support capital. 
Scalable infrastructure spending increased as we continue to rollout DOCSIS 3.0 and Switched Digital Video. We've now completed our rollout of Switched Digital Video in all but New York City, which is all digital, Dallas and LA. We expect to finish up those markets over the next several quarters. Landel will talk about some of the product enhancements facilitated by these capital investments in a moment. We still expect our full-year capital expenditures to be less than $3 billion. 
On to cash flow on the next slide. Higher adjusted OIBDA and lower CapEx yielded first quarter adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditure growth of almost 27% year-over-year. On our last earnings call, I said that we expected our full-year adjusted OIBDA less CapEx would grow in the mid-teens percent. But given our strong Q1 growth, we now think full-year adjusted OIBDA less CapEx will be up around 20%.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $652 million, a very healthy increase of almost $300 million over Q1 '09, driven by growth in adjusted OIBDA less CapEx, as well as lower pension contributions and favorable working capital, partially offset by lower cash tax refunds. We converted 39% of our adjusted OIBDA into free cash flow. Although neither had a significant impact during the first quarter, I should point out that higher cash interests and cash taxes will affect our free cash flow growth during the remainder of the year.
Turning to the next slide. Diluted earnings per share of $0.60 were up 25% over last year's first quarter, despite a $0.20 per share non-cash charge to reverse previously recognized tax benefits primarily related to the exploration of certain Time Warner in-stock options held by Time Warner Cable employees. In total, items affecting the comparability of this quarter's EPS with those of the first quarter of last year reduced this quarter's EPS by $0.22 and Q1 '09 EPS by $0.27. More detail on these items is included in this morning's press release. We continue to expect that our full-year earnings per share will be between $3.25 and $3.50.
Turning to the balance sheet on the last slide. I am pleased to report that this quarter we fulfilled the commitment we made when we first announced our separation from Time Warner Inc. to reduce our leverage to 3.25x within one year of separation. At quarter end, our net debt and preferred equity totaled $21.1 billion, and our leverage ratio was 3.17x. That's below our 3.25x target even after paying out $144 million for our first quarterly dividend in March.
So to summarize, before I turn it over to Landel, we posted very strong financial results this quarter. Commercial and advertising revenue growth accelerated and residential revenues increased nicely due to balanced subscriber and ARPU growth. That, coupled with effective management of operating and capital costs, generated extremely healthy free cash flow, which enabled us to reduce our leverage to below our target even after paying our first quarterly dividend. With that, I'll turn it over to Landel."

In the first quarter, we continue to operate the company in a very disciplined fashion. In the next few minutes, I'll review the competitive landscape, update you on our product plans and provide a peek at the strategic direction of our products and services. 
So to begin, the telcos have continued to expand their fiber-based deployment, and we estimate that AT&T's U-verse product is now available to approximately 21% of our homes passed. The Verizon's FiOS offering is available to 10%. The rate of expansion of serviceable homes was slightly below what we've seen over the last six quarters, and our penetration growth rate also continues to slow. 
Competitive offers in the first quarter remained aggressive. However, ad spending was flat to down on a sequential basis for the four major telco and satellite competitors according to our analysis. Except for Verizon's no-contract offers targeted to MDUs and consumers ordering online, promotional activity didn't appear to accelerate during the quarter. In the context of this competitive environment, our analysis suggests that video subscriber losses to the telcos continue to decline modestly in our footprint. And our analysis further suggests that we performed better against satellite, breaking even or posting modest subscriber net additions in the quarter. In broadband, we continue to outperform the telcos. In the first quarter, we had twice as many high-speed data subscriber net additions as the two telcos combined on a footprint adjusted basis. So net-net, we continue to compete well.
Next, I'll turn to our product plans beginning with video. We have a terrific video offering, and we're putting a lot of energy into making it even better. Here are just a few of the things we're working on. First, we're working to realize more of the promotion potential of VOD by improving the availability of new releases day-to-day with their availability at retail. In support of this effort, we joined with major studios, other MSOs to launch a $30 million campaign last month for most movies on demand. In the first quarter, 2/3 of new titles were available day and day. We're also continuing to improve our high-definition offerings. We now have at least 100 HD channels in most of our service areas, led by New York City with 124. Over the past year, we've raised the average number of HD channels in the areas we serve by more than 60%. 
As I've indicated in previous quarters, we're also focused on providing a great video product for Hispanic customers. This customer segment is very important to us, and we're pleased with the response we received to our El Paquetazo and Lomando [ph] on-demand products. This year, we expect to carry over 100 LA Dodgers, LA Angels and Texas Ranger games in Spanish and local markets. And the World Cup will be a large part of our appeal to the Hispanic market this summer, as we anticipate making many games available on demand.
Further this month, we held very successful 3D TV viewing events in a number of our cities. The Augusta National Course looked incredible in 3D, but equally impressive was our ability to carry the event in 3D over our existing network with our most current generation of set tops. There probably will be a limited amount of 3D content available in the near term, but as we've demonstrated, we're ready. 
Next turning to high-speed data. Our DOCSIS 3.0 deployment in New York City is still in its early days, with subs in the low thousands, but there are some interesting early trends. First, we're attracting new customers with our super-fast broadband. More than a quarter of residential Wideband customers didn't previously subscribe to our Road Runner high-speed data product. Second, approximately 20% of our new commercial high-speed data customers subscribe to our new Wideband product. As we indicated last quarter, we're expanding the availability of our DOCSIS 3.0-based services. In addition to New York City our Wideband service is now available in parts of Dallas, Cincinnati, Buffalo and Syracuse and we expect to launch it soon in Charlotte.
In wireless data, we continue to make progress in the first quarter, with our 4G service available in key parts of our footprint in the Carolinas, Texas and Hawaii. And just last week we launched Business Class Mobile, our commercial wireless service in Dallas. We think this can become an important addition for our wireline commercial services. We're planning to expand our Road Runner Mobile footprint substantially this year with launches scheduled in Kansas City, Cincinnati, Cleveland, New York and around year end, LA. Earlier this month, we announced an agreement with Cablevision and Comcast to allow our high-speed Internet customers to roam freely across the three companies Wi-Fi networks in the New York City area at no additional charge. This partnership is a win-win for our 1 million Road Runner customers in the New York City Metro area, adding yet another dimension of value and convenience.
As we indicated last quarter, we're introducing changes to Digital Phone to drive faster growth. In the first quarter, we implemented new training and incentives for our front line sales team, and we're focused specifically on those customer segments that we expect to be most receptive. It's early going but we've already seen an increase in volume related to these changes. In addition, we're on track to roll out features to further differentiate Digital Phones later this year. 
In the Commercial business, we're just beginning a customer segmentation analysis like the one we conducted in the residential space some time ago. We're in the early going but it already is providing some actionable insights. You'll hear more about this in future quarters. Our objective for this business this year is pretty simple. We have for the most part all the products we need to serve the SMB space so we're focused on selling our core Business Class Phone, high-speed data and Metro Ethernet products to more customers. And, of course, we're going to continue to drive Sell Backhaul as hard as we can. I'm very pleased with our commercial progress to date. Our 19% year-over-year revenue growth rate for the first quarter of 2010 was 500 basis points better than our growth rate in the preceding quarter. 
In support of our growth objective, we continue to add sales staff. In the first quarter, we added a net 75 quota-bearing salespeople for a quarter end total of over 700 folks focused on driving sales in the Commercial business. On the marketing front, I've been talking increasingly about our residential segmentation efforts. Our work here has developed quickly and grown substantially in sophistication. Our early efforts were focused on identifying different needs among our existing and prospective customers, which guided us in building tiers of service for both Our Road Runner high-speed data product and our Digital Phone product.
Refinements in our segmentation work then enabled us to identify which marketing channels and messages would be most effective in winning customers with various characteristics. As a result, our advertising has become much more focused, efficient and relevant. And most recently, we've been using our segmentation analysis to identify the varying ways in which different customers sets perceive value. This work is has then formed our approach to pricing as well as the ways we manage customers rolling off promotions, Price Lock Guarantee agreements. I'm really pleased with our results here, as reflected in our ability to generate healthy ARPU growth. In coming quarters, you'll see the next stage in the evolution of our segmentation work. Increasingly, we will tailor the multi-product bundles and the service experience itself to the needs of specific customer sets. Bottom line, the era of 1-size-fits all in cable is coming to an end. Stay tuned for more on this strategy.
So in summary, we've built a disciplined operation that performed well during rough economic times. We've continued to invest in the products and services that differentiate us and enable us to generate strong results despite increased competitive intensity. And in my opinion, we have hired some of the most innovative thinkers in the industry, and we're now leading our business through a transformation in how we think about serving customers. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call"

And I would say that the only thing that really binds it altogether is there's a feeling of discomfort that the Internet isn't more heavily regulated and that this is despite the incredible success its had. Broadband was invented by the cable industry and the phone industry followed, if you remember that. It's available via cable in 52% of the homes in the country. I believe it has the fastest uptake of any consumer electronics product ever. So by any measure, it's been a great success without any government subsidies, I might add. But still, there's this kind of feeling out there with a lot of groups that somehow needs to be more heavily regulated. Most of this is based on either agendas by the participants, which are not always what they seem on the surface. Or sometimes a feeling that while even though there haven't been any bad behaviors that maybe somebody could have potentially behave badly so we'd need to regulate it ahead of time. Obviously, we think that's a bad idea. The particular -- so the FCC has initiated net neutrality proceedings. The court case was unfortunate. I think that under the previous FCC Chairman he took a number of actions against the cable industry, most of which have been overturned  industry most of which have been over the course current FCC and this is more particularly overturned either in the courts or by the current FCC. And this was one where he was particularly going after Comcast and they were seeking to overturn it, and the court went further and questioned the authority of the FCC in the first place. I'm not aware but my understanding is that decision was fairly narrow, and the FCC retains some authority to do probably what needs to be done or, which is probably not much in my mind. I think the discussion about Title II and all of that is really just demonstrates that we have in our case set of laws and regulations that were largely intended to regulate the old twisted-pair telephone industry. And trying to fit all this new technology into it is pretty tough. So I think at some point Congress is going to have to take all this up but probably not immediately. On the gateway issue that, I've probably already talked long enough, the whole set-top, gateway, whatever you call that thing is very complicated. Suffice it to say that we are in favor of a more open network that allows more places to connect to it. We think whatever the rules are they need to apply to all multi-channel providers. One of the reasons these things haven't worked well in the past is they apply to only the cable companies and that's embodied in this. But exactly what it means and how it develops I think is a very complicated thing. Let's see what happens."

We were very pleased with our increase in margins in the first quarter. We're up about 180 basis points over last year's first quarter, but I think as you point out, there are some items that will occur in the balance of the year that will probably moderate the normal uptick in margins that we see. And I think just as a rough working assumption, you should think of sequential margins kind of staying in the flattish area off of first quarter, maybe up a tick but not necessarily the same trajectory you've seen in past years. And the big drivers of that are that we expect programming cost growth to increase as we progress through the year. The salary increase, as you pointed out, will cause employee compensation expense to increase in the back half of the year. Most of the losses that we expect to incur in the Road Runner Mobile business are going to be back-half loaded. In addition, we've got some of the items that -- some of our cost initiatives will actually cost us money in their early stages before they start to generate the positive effects that we expect, and some of that will be back loaded. And then finally, bad debt was particularly good this quarter. We had some favorable year-over-year comparisons partially related to those incremental reserves we took in Q1 of '09. And what happened was when the economy improved somewhat and our actual experience demonstrated that our receivables were better than what we had anticipated at the time we took the reserves, we actually reversed of those reserves in Q4. So you actually have a good guy in Q1 and a bad guy in Q4 of this year related to bad debt. So all of those things would lead me to moderate expectations on really significant improvement in margins over the course of the year. In terms of lower-term margins, we've talked about this a lot. I've given you the puts and takes and the big margin contracting influencer is contraction of video margins relating to continued programming cost growth going the other way is really the mix of our businesses as more of our revenues are generated by the Commercial business. That's higher-margin business, should improve margins. Similarly, the Ad business as a high-margin business, and as that improves over last year as it did in the first quarter, that should help. And then our cost initiatives, especially our migration away from Sprint in terms of the management of certain of the voice support functions should really improve our voice margins. So I'm not going to give you beyond 2010 guidance on margins, but those are the real big drivers."

I think we've said in the past and I'll be consistent, we think that eventually we will not only deploy Switched Digital Video but that we will go all digital. We'll do both. I don't think it's either/or. In our case the initial way to reclaim our bandwidth given the state of our plans, Switched Digital Video was the easiest, cheapest, fastest way to do it. But I do think we will go all digital at some point. We already have in New York City and parts of LA. It's hard to get you a set of rules for when and where and how but we will do that. I might add that the small D/A converters are getting smaller and cheaper all the time. A couple of us were over in HO last week and we saw a D/A converter that was smaller than a BlackBerry so it's going to get to be pretty trivial places. Wi-Fi, there's no specific commitments on all the lines you were just asking. I think Wi-Fi is an interesting technology. We're working with the other cable companies really to enhance the consumer experience for our broadband customers. I think particularly as there is a growing perception that the spectrum for sub-to-cellular and wireless data networks are going to be short, in short supply I think that Wi-Fi is going to be more important. We've actually been active in it for quite a while, perhaps we've gotten less publicity than others, but going back almost 10 years we've been doing lots of Wi-Fi work in other markets. So it's not new to us and I'll think we'll keep being active."

It's been quite a few quarters since we've been able to deliver such positive news. We grew first quarter revenues by over 5% and adjusted our OIBDA by almost 11% compared to the year ago quarter. The economy remained weak and subscriber net adds again declined year-over-year but importantly, net adds showed an improving trend as the quarter proceeded.
Free cash flow at $652 million was very strong. I would attribute much of our strength in the quarter to our continued operational discipline. In particular, our ARPU growth demonstrates our ability to match the increasing value of our products to consumers expanding needs even in a challenging economy. Through a combination of product enhancements and more comprehensive marketing, we've grown profitably even in the face of more intense competition from both satellite and telephone companies. Our strong performance was also driven by accelerated growth in two of our businesses. In our Commercial business, our first quarter revenue growth rate of 19% was higher than we achieved in any quarter last year and is fully consistent with our achieving a growth rate north of 20% for the full year. Our Advertising business has re-bounded even faster than we expected as first quarter revenues grew 19%.
We intend to continue to develop new high-growth businesses. An early stage example is our 4G Road Runner Mobile product, which we now launched in several cities. This quarter we also delivered our commitment to return capital to our shareholders by paying our first regular dividend, which at inception provided a yield above 3.5%. In addition, we reduced our leverage to our target of the timetable we promised a year ago. 
Before I turn the call over to Rob for a more detailed discussion of our financial results, I'd like to touch on two regulatory topics. First, there's been a lot of speculation that in response to a recent DC circuit court decision and related net neutrality concerns that the government might impose new laws and rules that would discourage investment and Internet infrastructure. There's also a concern than an extended period of regulatory uncertainty might have much the same effect.
We remain hopeful that the FCC and Congress will proceed with these concerns in mind as they consider various approaches to regulation of the Internet. We intend to continue to advocate strongly for the network owners for the role of private capital in building an Internet that serves even more people with ever higher capacity each year. 
Another important issue is re-transmission consent. The process by which re-transmission fees are set is broken and broadcasters are using that broken process in a way that's disruptive to consumers by threatening to withhold signals as a negotiating tactic. As you're aware, we filed a petition on this issue with the FCC last month calling for a better process to set these fees, including arbitration and interim carriage. The commission is currently soliciting comments. In the meantime, we'll keep doing what we do best, providing innovative and increasing valuable services to our customers, generating free cash flow and making smart capital allocation decisions to provide attractive returns to our shareholders. Next Rob will give you additional insight into our financial performance."

First quarter revenues grew 5.4% over the first quarter of last year. That's the highest year-over-year revenue growth we've seen since the fourth quarter of 2008. The growth was driven by solid residential revenue growth, coupled with accelerating growth in our Commercial and Ad Sales businesses, both of which posted over 19% increases. We continue to focus on balancing subscriber and ARPU growth, and our ARPU per customer relationship grew by almost 6%. Adjusted OIBDA was up a very strong 10.9%, and adjusted OIBDA less CapEx was up nearly 27%, reflecting both our revenue performance and our ongoing efforts to manage both operating and capital costs. We generated over $650 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which we used to pay our first quarterly dividend and to further reduce our debt. And I'm pleased to report that we finished the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.17x below the target leverage ratio we established when we announced our separation from Time Warner. Finally, our first quarter results put us right on track to meet or exceed all of the elements of our full year guidance.
Let's move to our subscriber results on the next slide. We added 276,000 Primary Service Units and 378,000 revenue-generating units in the first quarter and ended the quarter with 26.6 million PSUs and 35.6 million RGUs. While we added fewer PSUs in this year's first quarter than in last year's, there are two points worth noting. First, most of the year-over-year difference can be attributed to the DTV transition, which accounted for roughly 100,000 PSU net additions in Q1 '09. And second, year-over-year comparisons in the latter part of the quarter were significantly better than in January and in early February. I'll come back to what we're seeing so far in Q2 in a minute.
Once again, connects were down year-over-year in all PSU categories, but so were disconnects, as churn was down across the board. First quarter video subscribers declined by 42,000. Excluding the roughly 80,000 video subscribers we estimate we added in Q1 '09 related to the DTV transitions, video net adds were essentially flat year-over-year. We added 102,000 digital video customers in the quarter, pushing digital penetration to 70% of total video customers at quarter end. We also added 111,000 DVR customers in the quarter, and now over half our digital customers have DVRs. 
HSD continued to be our strongest PSU category. HSD net adds of 221,000 in the quarter were pretty much flat versus year ago levels. Our HSD penetration increased to over 35% of homes passed. Residential HSD net adds were 212,000, and we continued to see the mix of our residential HSD subscriber base shift towards our higher-speed tiers as Turbo accounted for roughly 77,000 net adds and Wideband, our DOCSIS 3.0 offering, accounting for another 1,000. Over 11% of our residential HSD subscriber base now takes the Turbo product. For the second quarter in a row, the percentage of our residential HSD customer base that subscribes to our basic and light tiers of service declined. Commercial HSD net adds were 9,000. That's the highest since 2007.
We also added another 97,000 Digital Phone customers during the quarter, and our phone penetration at quarter end stood at over 16%. We added 86,000 residential voice customers and 11,000 Business Class Phone subs. We ended the quarter with 78,000 Business Class Phones subscribers, and that's more than twice the number of subscribers we had a year ago. Our customer relationships increased by 46,000 in the quarter, and we continued to have great success in increasing the number of customers in bundles. We added 73,000 Triple Plays and 82,000 Double Plays, ending the quarter with over 58% of our customers in Double or Triple Play packages.
Before we turn to our financial results, I promised I'd give you some color on the subscriber performance in the second quarter. The trends we experienced late in Q1 have continued into Q2, and PSU net adds over the last several weeks have been closer to last year's levels. I should remind you of two things as you think about Q2 subscriber performance. First, Q2 is typically a seasonally weak quarter for sub growth. And second, we picked up about 60,000 video subs related to the completion of the DTV transition in June of last year, which will negatively affect 2Q comparisons this year.
Turning to our financial results, let's start with revenues on the next slide. As I mentioned earlier, first quarter revenues increased 5.4% year-over-year to $4.6 billion. That's the product of just over 4% growth in residential subscription revenues and over 19% growth in both commercial subscription revenues and advertising revenues. Total subscription revenues, residential and commercial combined, grew almost 5%, driven by a healthy mix of rate and volume increases. HSD revenues were up more than 8% versus last year's first quarter, and again were the largest contributor to subscription revenue growth. Video revenues increased 2.5%, driven by price increases and increasing digital video subscribers and higher DVR service revenues, partially offset by a decline in video subs. And voice revenues grew over 9% driven by subscriber growth, which was partially offset by a modest decline in ARPU. Ad sales finally turned the corner in Q1, up over 19% powered by strong growth in most categories, particularly auto, media and political. Given our performance thus far, we now expect that full-year ad revenue will grow at least 15%.
Moving on to our commercial operations on the next slide. Commercial revenue growth re-accelerated to over 19% in the quarter, reflecting the steps we took last year to refocus and recharge our commercial organization. The increase was driven by 11% growth in commercial data revenues and a doubling of Business Class Phone revenues. Sell Backhaul revenues more than tripled from the year ago period. While still small, the Sell Backhaul business continues to contribute nicely to our overall commercial growth. As of quarter end, we were receiving revenues from wireless carriers for providing backhaul from cell towers with 3,600 radios. And we had another 1,800 radios under contract that have not yet come online. So overall, we're very pleased with our commercial performance so far in 2010, and we are on track to achieve the better than 20% full year commercial revenue growth that we discussed at the beginning of the year.
Moving on to ARPU on Slide 7. Although last year or so, we've talked frequently about balancing subscriber and ARPU growth, once again this quarter we maintained our discipline in this area and drove some of the strongest year-over-year and sequential ARPU growth we've seen in quite a while. First quarter ARPU per customer relationship increased 5.6% to $105. This was the biggest jump in ARPU per customer relationships since 2008 and was fueled by growth in PSUs per customers, growth in our Commercial and Ad Sales businesses and residential price increases. Subscription ARPU per PSU was up over 2%, driven by increases in both residential and commercial subscription ARPU per PSU.
Drilling down on product ARPUs. Video ARPU grew over 4.5% year-over-year and improved over 2.5% sequentially, driven primarily by price increases and higher penetration of digital programming tiers and DVRs. Both residential and commercial video ARPUs contributed to the growth. HSD ARPU was up almost 2% compared to last year's first quarter and was 1.3% higher than Q4 '09. The increases were largely the product of increased contribution from commercial HSD but residential HSD ARPU improved as well.  The decline in Digital Phone ARPU continued to moderate. In the first quarter, it was down about 1% year-over-year.
Let's turn to adjusted OIBDA on the next slide. First quarter adjusted OIBDA grew a very strong 10.9% to $1.7 billion as margin increased 180 basis points to 36.3%. The first quarter growth in high margin ad revenues certainly helped both adjusted OIBDA growth and overall margins as did margin improvement in our Residential Subscription business. Total first quarter operating expenses grew just 2.5% compared to last year. Programming expense increased just over 5%. Once again, video and premium channel subscriber declines partially offset contractual rate increases and incremental re-transmission consent costs. At this point, we still expect that full-year programming cost growth will be a little higher than last year with the year-over-year growth increasing as we progress through the year. Marketing expense of $151 million increased close to 8% over Q1 '09 with about half of the growth coming from increased marketing spend in our Commercial business. Voice costs were up just over 6.5% due to growth in Digital Phone subs. Employee costs, which represents roughly a third of our total operating expense were essentially flat with the prior year period as salary increases and higher medical expenses were almost fully offset by a reduction in internal headcount and contract labor and lower pension expense. It's worth noting that growth in compensation expense was lower than normal this quarter as our 2010 salary increases did not take effect until March of this year and due to uncertainty in the economy last year, most management salaries had not been increased since 2008.
Once again, our net bad debt expense was down significantly, falling over 60% to just $17 million, reflecting the better quality of our residential receivables versus last year and better collections. I'd also note that part of the year-over-year improvement in bad debt related to the fact that we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts in Q1 '09, given the then existing uncertainty in the economy. Those reserves were reversed in Q4 '09. 
At the start of the year, we mentioned that we expected to incur about $15 million of start-up losses in connection with the deployment of Road Runner Mobile, our wireless broadband offering. We incurred about $5 million of such losses in the first quarter, and we're still expecting full-year losses in the $50 million zone.
While we were pleased with our ability to manage costs in Q1, we are always focused on improving the efficiency of our operations, and we're engaged in a number of initiatives to further improve our cost structure over time. I think Landel mentioned last quarter that we're focused on consolidating our call centers, optimizing our procurement processes and reducing voice costs by in-sourcing the management of certain Digital Phone support functions.
Let's move on to CapEx on Slide 9. First quarter CapEx was $736 million or 16% of revenues. That's down from over 17.5% in Q1 '09. As has been the case for the last several quarters, we increased commercial CapEx while reducing residential capital spending. Commercial CapEx was $116 million. That's about 80% higher than in last year's first quarter as we invested in commercial growth initiatives including Sell Backhaul. Residential capital spending was down approximately 12% from Q1 '09, mostly due to the declines in CPE Capital, specifically HD DVRs and modems as well as lower support capital. 
Scalable infrastructure spending increased as we continue to rollout DOCSIS 3.0 and Switched Digital Video. We've now completed our rollout of Switched Digital Video in all but New York City, which is all digital, Dallas and LA. We expect to finish up those markets over the next several quarters. Landel will talk about some of the product enhancements facilitated by these capital investments in a moment. We still expect our full-year capital expenditures to be less than $3 billion. 
On to cash flow on the next slide. Higher adjusted OIBDA and lower CapEx yielded first quarter adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditure growth of almost 27% year-over-year. On our last earnings call, I said that we expected our full-year adjusted OIBDA less CapEx would grow in the mid-teens percent. But given our strong Q1 growth, we now think full-year adjusted OIBDA less CapEx will be up around 20%.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $652 million, a very healthy increase of almost $300 million over Q1 '09, driven by growth in adjusted OIBDA less CapEx, as well as lower pension contributions and favorable working capital, partially offset by lower cash tax refunds. We converted 39% of our adjusted OIBDA into free cash flow. Although neither had a significant impact during the first quarter, I should point out that higher cash interests and cash taxes will affect our free cash flow growth during the remainder of the year.
Turning to the next slide. Diluted earnings per share of $0.60 were up 25% over last year's first quarter, despite a $0.20 per share non-cash charge to reverse previously recognized tax benefits primarily related to the exploration of certain Time Warner in-stock options held by Time Warner Cable employees. In total, items affecting the comparability of this quarter's EPS with those of the first quarter of last year reduced this quarter's EPS by $0.22 and Q1 '09 EPS by $0.27. More detail on these items is included in this morning's press release. We continue to expect that our full-year earnings per share will be between $3.25 and $3.50.
Turning to the balance sheet on the last slide. I am pleased to report that this quarter we fulfilled the commitment we made when we first announced our separation from Time Warner Inc. to reduce our leverage to 3.25x within one year of separation. At quarter end, our net debt and preferred equity totaled $21.1 billion, and our leverage ratio was 3.17x. That's below our 3.25x target even after paying out $144 million for our first quarterly dividend in March.
So to summarize, before I turn it over to Landel, we posted very strong financial results this quarter. Commercial and advertising revenue growth accelerated and residential revenues increased nicely due to balanced subscriber and ARPU growth. That, coupled with effective management of operating and capital costs, generated extremely healthy free cash flow, which enabled us to reduce our leverage to below our target even after paying our first quarterly dividend. With that, I'll turn it over to Landel."

In the next few minutes, I'll review the competitive landscape, update you on our product plans and provide a peek at the strategic dire",1389,"Thanks, Rob. And good morning. In the first quarter, we continue to operate the company in a very disciplined fashion. In the next few minutes, I'll review the competitive landscape, update you on our product plans and provide a peek at the strategic direction of our products and services. 
So to begin, the telcos have continued to expand their fiber-based deployment, and we estimate that AT&T's U-verse product is now available to approximately 21% of our homes passed. The Verizon's FiOS offering is available to 10%. The rate of expansion of serviceable homes was slightly below what we've seen over the last six quarters, and our penetration growth rate also continues to slow. 
Competitive offers in the first quarter remained aggressive. However, ad spending was flat to down on a sequential basis for the four major telco and satellite competitors according to our analysis. Except for Verizon's no-contract offers targeted to MDUs and consumers ordering online, promotional activity didn't appear to accelerate during the quarter. In the context of this competitive environment, our analysis suggests that video subscriber losses to the telcos continue to decline modestly in our footprint. And our analysis further suggests that we performed better against satellite, breaking even or posting modest subscriber net additions in the quarter. In broadband, we continue to outperform the telcos. In the first quarter, we had twice as many high-speed data subscriber net additions as the two telcos combined on a footprint adjusted basis. So net-net, we continue to compete well.
Next, I'll turn to our product plans beginning with video. We have a terrific video offering, and we're putting a lot of energy into making it even better. Here are just a few of the things we're working on. First, we're working to realize more of the promotion potential of VOD by improving the availability of new releases day-to-day with their availability at retail. In support of this effort, we joined with major studios, other MSOs to launch a $30 million campaign last month for most movies on demand. In the first quarter, 2/3 of new titles were available day and day. We're also continuing to improve our high-definition offerings. We now have at least 100 HD channels in most of our service areas, led by New York City with 124. Over the past year, we've raised the average number of HD channels in the areas we serve by more than 60%. 
As I've indicated in previous quarters, we're also focused on providing a great video product for Hispanic customers. This customer segment is very important to us, and we're pleased with the response we received to our El Paquetazo and Lomando [ph] on-demand products. This year, we expect to carry over 100 LA Dodgers, LA Angels and Texas Ranger games in Spanish and local markets. And the World Cup will be a large part of our appeal to the Hispanic market this summer, as we anticipate making many games available on demand.
Further this month, we held very successful 3D TV viewing events in a number of our cities. The Augusta National Course looked incredible in 3D, but equally impressive was our ability to carry the event in 3D over our existing network with our most current generation of set tops. There probably will be a limited amount of 3D content available in the near term, but as we've demonstrated, we're ready. 
Next turning to high-speed data. Our DOCSIS 3.0 deployment in New York City is still in its early days, with subs in the low thousands, but there are some interesting early trends. First, we're attracting new customers with our super-fast broadband. More than a quarter of residential Wideband customers didn't previously subscribe to our Road Runner high-speed data product. Second, approximately 20% of our new commercial high-speed data customers subscribe to our new Wideband product. As we indicated last quarter, we're expanding the availability of our DOCSIS 3.0-based services. In addition to New York City our Wideband service is now available in parts of Dallas, Cincinnati, Buffalo and Syracuse and we expect to launch it soon in Charlotte.
In wireless data, we continue to make progress in the first quarter, with our 4G service available in key parts of our footprint in the Carolinas, Texas and Hawaii. And just last week we launched Business Class Mobile, our commercial wireless service in Dallas. We think this can become an important addition for our wireline commercial services. We're planning to expand our Road Runner Mobile footprint substantially this year with launches scheduled in Kansas City, Cincinnati, Cleveland, New York and around year end, LA. Earlier this month, we announced an agreement with Cablevision and Comcast to allow our high-speed Internet customers to roam freely across the three companies Wi-Fi networks in the New York City area at no additional charge. This partnership is a win-win for our 1 million Road Runner customers in the New York City Metro area, adding yet another dimension of value and convenience.
As we indicated last quarter, we're introducing changes to Digital Phone to drive faster growth. In the first quarter, we implemented new training and incentives for our front line sales team, and we're focused specifically on those customer segments that we expect to be most receptive. It's early going but we've already seen an increase in volume related to these changes. In addition, we're on track to roll out features to further differentiate Digital Phones later this year. 
In the Commercial business, we're just beginning a customer segmentation analysis like the one we conducted in the residential space some time ago. We're in the early going but it already is providing some actionable insights. You'll hear more about this in future quarters. Our objective for this business this year is pretty simple. We have for the most part all the products we need to serve the SMB space so we're focused on selling our core Business Class Phone, high-speed data and Metro Ethernet products to more customers. And, of course, we're going to continue to drive Sell Backhaul as hard as we can. I'm very pleased with our commercial progress to date. Our 19% year-over-year revenue growth rate for the first quarter of 2010 was 500 basis points better than our growth rate in the preceding quarter. 
In support of our growth objective, we continue to add sales staff. In the first quarter, we added a net 75 quota-bearing salespeople for a quarter end total of over 700 folks focused on driving sales in the Commercial business. On the marketing front, I've been talking increasingly about our residential segmentation efforts. Our work here has developed quickly and grown substantially in sophistication. Our early efforts were focused on identifying different needs among our existing and prospective customers, which guided us in building tiers of service for both Our Road Runner high-speed data product and our Digital Phone product.
Refinements in our segmentation work then enabled us to identify which marketing channels and messages would be most effective in winning customers with various characteristics. As a result, our advertising has become much more focused, efficient and relevant. And most recently, we've been using our segmentation analysis to identify the varying ways in which different customers sets perceive value. This work is has then formed our approach to pricing as well as the ways we manage customers rolling off promotions, Price Lock Guarantee agreements. I'm really pleased with our results here, as reflected in our ability to generate healthy ARPU growth. In coming quarters, you'll see the next stage in the evolution of our segmentation work. Increasingly, we will tailor the multi-product bundles and the service experience itself to the needs of specific customer sets. Bottom line, the era of 1-size-fits all in cable is coming to an end. Stay tuned for more on this strategy.
So in summary, we've built a disciplined operation that performed well during rough economic times. We've continued to invest in the products and services that differentiate us and enable us to generate strong results despite increased competitive intensity. And in my opinion, we have hired some of the most innovative thinkers in the industry, and we're now leading our business through a transformation in how we think about serving customers. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call"

I think particularly in the Wireless space where there's some anticipation that there's going to be big storage capacity. So obviously we're not in that business except a little bit through Clearwire, but there seems to be a lot of anticipation that in the Wireless space you will start seeing some form of usage-based pricing. So my guess is that's where you'll see it first but stay tuned."

First of all on the constellation of the District Court decision of Title II, net neutrality and all that, I think the backdrop is that there's obviously a large people with a great variety of interests under that neutrality umbrella. And I would say that the only thing that really binds it altogether is there's a feeling of discomfort that the Internet isn't more heavily regulated and that this is despite the incredible success its had. Broadband was invented by the cable industry and the phone industry followed, if you remember that. It's available via cable in 52% of the homes in the country. I believe it has the fastest uptake of any consumer electronics product ever. So by any measure, it's been a great success without any government subsidies, I might add. But still, there's this kind of feeling out there with a lot of groups that somehow needs to be more heavily regulated. Most of this is based on either agendas by the participants, which are not always what they seem on the surface. Or sometimes a feeling that while even though there haven't been any bad behaviors that maybe somebody could have potentially behave badly so we'd need to regulate it ahead of time. Obviously, we think that's a bad idea. The particular -- so the FCC has initiated net neutrality proceedings. The court case was unfortunate. I think that under the previous FCC Chairman he took a number of actions against the cable industry, most of which have been overturned  industry most of which have been over the course current FCC and this is more particularly overturned either in the courts or by the current FCC. And this was one where he was particularly going after Comcast and they were seeking to overturn it, and the court went further and questioned the authority of the FCC in the first place. I'm not aware but my understanding is that decision was fairly narrow, and the FCC retains some authority to do probably what needs to be done or, which is probably not much in my mind. I think the discussion about Title II and all of that is really just demonstrates that we have in our case set of laws and regulations that were largely intended to regulate the old twisted-pair telephone industry. And trying to fit all this new technology into it is pretty tough. So I think at some point Congress is going to have to take all this up but probably not immediately. On the gateway issue that, I've probably already talked long enough, the whole set-top, gateway, whatever you call that thing is very complicated. Suffice it to say that we are in favor of a more open network that allows more places to connect to it. We think whatever the rules are they need to apply to all multi-channel providers. One of the reasons these things haven't worked well in the past is they apply to only the cable companies and that's embodied in this. But exactly what it means and how it develops I think is a very complicated thing. Let's see what happens."

We were very pleased with our increase in margins in the first quarter. We're up about 180 basis points over last year's first quarter, but I think as you point out, there are some items that will occur in the balance of the year that will probably moderate the normal uptick in margins that we see. And I think just as a rough working assumption, you should think of sequential margins kind of staying in the flattish area off of first quarter, maybe up a tick but not necessarily the same trajectory you've seen in past years. And the big drivers of that are that we expect programming cost growth to increase as we progress through the year. The salary increase, as you pointed out, will cause employee compensation expense to increase in the back half of the year. Most of the losses that we expect to incur in the Road Runner Mobile business are going to be back-half loaded. In addition, we've got some of the items that -- some of our cost initiatives will actually cost us money in their early stages before they start to generate the positive effects that we expect, and some of that will be back loaded. And then finally, bad debt was particularly good this quarter. We had some favorable year-over-year comparisons partially related to those incremental reserves we took in Q1 of '09. And what happened was when the economy improved somewhat and our actual experience demonstrated that our receivables were better than what we had anticipated at the time we took the reserves, we actually reversed those reserves in Q4. So you actually have a good guy in Q1 and a bad guy in Q4 of this year related to bad debt. So all of those things would lead me to moderate expectations on really significant improvement in margins over the course of the year. In terms of lower-term margins, we've talked about this a lot. I've given you the puts and takes and the big margin contracting influencer is contraction of video margins relating to continued programming cost growth going the other way is really the mix of our businesses as more of our revenues are generated by the Commercial business. That's higher-margin business, should improve margins. Similarly, the Ad business as a high-margin business, and as that improves over last year as it did in the first quarter, that should help. And then our cost initiatives, especially our migration away from Sprint in terms of the management of certain of the voice support functions should really improve our voice margins. So I'm not going to give you beyond 2010 guidance on margins, but those are the real big drivers."

I think we've said in the past and I'll be consistent, we think that eventually we will not only deploy Switched Digital Video but that we will go all digital. We'll do both. I don't think it's either/or. In our case the initial way to reclaim our bandwidth given the state of our plans, Switched Digital Video was the easiest, cheapest, fastest way to do it. But I do think we will go all digital at some point. We already have in New York City and parts of LA. It's hard to get you a set of rules for when and where and how but we will do that. I might add that the small D/A converters are getting smaller and cheaper all the time. A couple of us were over in HO last week and we saw a D/A converter that was smaller than a BlackBerry so it's going to get to be pretty trivial places. Wi-Fi, there's no specific commitments on all the lines you were just asking. I think Wi-Fi is an interesting technology. We're working with the other cable companies really to enhance the consumer experience for our broadband customers. I think particularly as there is a growing perception that the spectrum for sub-to-cellular and wireless data networks are going to be short, in short supply I think that Wi-Fi is going to be more important. We've actually been active in it for quite a while, perhaps we've gotten less publicity than others, but going back almost 10 years we've been doing lots of Wi-Fi work in other markets.

We had a good second quarter in which we grew both revenues and adjusted OIBDA around 6% compared to last year's second quarter. Through the first half of the year, we generated more than $1.2 billion of free cash flow. 
In the second quarter, we continue to see accelerated growth in our Advertising business, where revenues grew 24% year-over-year, and our Commercial business performed very well, growing 20%. Revenues in our Residential Subscription business grew a little more than 4% as we continued our steady approach to pricing and yield management. Our subscriber net adds were just a little below last year's levels excluding the favorable impact of the over-the-air DTV transition in last year's second quarter.
There's not a lot of change in the external environment. It appears that the economy is bouncing along the bottom, and subscriber net adds have continued to reflect the weakness in housing and employment markets, as well as competitive pressures. On the regulatory front, we and other interested parties are working constructively with the FCC to find a reasonable path for them to implement the national growth and plan.
Midway through 2010, it's worth taking a step back to assess several of the key drivers of our strong performance to help with the industry, our focus on better understanding our customers and our drive to improve the efficiency of our operations. We're in the right place, by which I mean I like the business we're in. We've performed very steadily and reliably throughout the segmental [ph] cycle. Few businesses can say that. 
In the residential space, our products are highly valued and heavily used. Although multichannel video is almost fully, broadband is still growing nicely and becoming a more important part of people's everyday lives, and we're seeing tangible evidence that consumers are willing to pay more for the speed and reliability that we offer. 
In the commercial space, our prospects may be even better.  Through our segmentation analysis, we now know a lot more about who are customers are and what they need and how they value our services. As Landel will tell you in a few minutes, we're now launching products and service offerings designed to meet the needs of specific customer sets. This more targeted approach will be important to both the residential and commercial sides of our business.
We're delivering products that give our customers control in ways that are simple and easy. For example, we've long offered Caller ID on TV, now we're launching Caller ID on the PC. In video, we just introduced a new series of DVR features, enabling customers to control their DVRs remotely and to watch recorded programs on any TV in their home. And our Wi-Fi, our 4G wireless products are giving our customers even more flexibility. 
We're doing all of this while improving our efficiency. We're increasingly centralizing our operations and strengthening the benefits of scale, in a business that, historically, has operated in an almost completely decentralized fashion. I have confidence that our work in consolidating our operations will enable us to provide better, more consistent service, and cares for our customers even as we reduce costs.
In summary, we're performing well. We're in a great business, and we're focused on the fundamentals to drive continued profitable growth. 
And now Rob will give you additional details about our financial performance."
862598,107916835,72473,"Time Warner Cable Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-05-2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Time Warner Cable Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Let's jump right into our second quarter highlights on Slide 3. Second quarter revenues grew almost 6% year-over-year as Residential subscription revenues increased over 4% and Commercial and Advertising revenu",2103,"Thanks, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Let's jump right into our second quarter highlights on Slide 3. 
Second quarter revenues grew almost 6% year-over-year as Residential subscription revenues increased over 4% and Commercial and Advertising revenues jumped 20% and 24%, respectively. Our continued pricing discipline contributed to a 6.6% increase in our ARPU per customer relationship. Adjusted OIBDA grew 6% in the quarter, reflecting our strong revenue growth, increased contribution from our higher margin Ad Sales and Commercial businesses and continuing efforts to manage our operating costs.
Through the first half of the year, adjusted OIBDA less CapEx increased almost 20%, and free cash flow was up nearly 19%. We continue to reduce our debt even after making our second regular dividend payment and ended the second quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.07x. With half the year behind us, we are on track to meet or exceed all of the elements of our full year guidance.
Let's drill down on our second quarter results starting with our subscriber performance on the next slide. We added 60,000 Primary Service Units in the second quarter and ended the quarter with 26.7 million PSUs. Adjusting for the roughly 80,000 PSUs that we estimate we added in Q2 '09 related to the DTV transition, PSU net adds were down about 15% year-over-year, which was the best year-over-year net add performances since the beginning of the downturn in Q4 '08. Once again, lower connects drove the year-over-year decline in PSU net additions. Share improved versus Q2 of last year in each PSU category.
High-speed data remained our strongest product. While the telcos combined lost HSD subscribers in the quarter, we increased HSD subs by 96,000 bringing our total HSD subscriber base to over 9.6 million or 35.4% of homes passed. We continue to see a shift in the mix of our residential HSD subscriber base to our higher-speed tiers. About 2/3 of our residential HSD net adds took Turbo and another thousand took our Widebands or DOCSIS 3.0 tier. Close to 12% of our residential HSD subscribers now take the Turbo products.
Commercial HSD net adds accelerated the second consecutive quarter to 11,000, the highest since 2007. We added 75,000 Digital Phone customers during the quarter, bringing our total voice subscriber count to almost 4.4 million, approximately 16.5% of homes passed. Commercial Phone continue to grow rapidly. We added 12,000 Business Class Phone customers in the quarter and ended Q2 with 90,000 Business Class Phone subs, nearly double the number we had a year ago.
Second quarter video subscribers declined by 111,000. Adjusting for the roughly 60,000 video net adds attributable to the DTV transition in Q2 '09, video net losses were actually better than in the year-ago period. Digital video net adds were 50,000 and DVR net adds were 52,000 in the quarter. At June 30, 71% of our video subs were digital, with over half of our digital subs taking DVRs.
We continue to increase the total number of customers in bundles. Triple Play net additions were 68,000, and we ended the quarter with 59% of our customers taking more than one PSU and over 1/4 of our subscribers taking all three PSUs. As for Q3 subscriber performance, it's still too early to make any meaningful projections. As you'll recall, third quarter subscriber net adds are typically very heavily dependent on the back-to-school season, which really doesn't begin until mid-August.  Over the first few weeks of the quarter, though, PSU net adds have been well below year-ago levels, even after adjusting to the DTV transition effect which spilled over into the beginning of last year's third quarter.
Turning to our financial, let's talk of revenues on the next slide. Second quarter revenues increased 5.8% year-over-year to $4.7 billion. Total subscription revenues, that's Residential and Commercial combined, grew about 5%, and Advertising revenues increase over 24%. As I already mentioned, the key driver of our financial performance has been our focus on balancing subscriber and ARPU growth. Total ARPU per customer relationship grew 6.6% to over $108, and subscription ARPU per customer relationship grew 5.9% to more than $103.
Revenues were $260 million higher than they were in Q2 '09, with $173 million of that growth coming from our Residential Subscription business, $45 million coming from Commercial and $42 million coming from Advertising.
Let's focus on our Residential Subscription revenues on Slide 6. Residential Subscription revenues grew over 4% year-over-year, driven by a healthy mix of price and volume increases. Residential HSD revenues were up over 8% versus last year's second quarter, driven by sub growth as well as a close to 2% year-over-year increase in Residential HSD ARPU. 
Residential video revenues increased almost 3%, driven by price increases and increase in digital video subscribers, as well as higher DVR service revenues and transactional video-on-demand revenues. DVR revenues were up about 13% due to unit growth and price increases. Transactional VOD revenues were up 9%, fueled by an increase in buys and revenue per buy, in the movies on demand and event categories, which more than offset weakness in the adult category. Video ARPU increased over 5% from Q2 '09 and improved nearly 2% sequentially.
Residential voice revenues grew about 4.5%, driven by subscriber growth partially offset by a close to 3% decline in ARPU. On a sequential basis, residential voice ARPU was pretty much flat.
Now let's flip to our Commercial revenues on the next slide. Commercial Subscription revenue growth accelerated to over 20% in the second quarter, on pace to achieve the better than 20% full year Commercial revenue growth that we discussed in the beginning of the year. Commercial data revenue increased 11.5% with more than 30% growth in dedicated Internet access and Metro Ethernet revenues. 
Business Class Phone revenues nearly doubled, driven by an increase in BCP customers. Cell power backhaul revenues more than tripled versus Q2 '09, and commercial video revenues also helped [indiscernible], increasing just over 6% as a result of increases in both prices and subscribers.
Turning to Advertising revenues. Ad sales were up over 24% in Q2 with improvement in most categories. Almost a third of the growth came from auto, our largest category, and around 25% of the growth came from political. On our first quarter call, we told you that what we expected that ad revenue would grow at least 15% to the full year. Given our performance for the first six months and the anticipated boost for political in the second half of the year, we expect to handily beat that estimate.
Moving on to Adjusted OIBDA. Second quarter Adjusted OIBDA grew 6% to $1.8 billion. Our margin improved 10 basis points year-over-year to 37%, the product of growth and higher margin advertising in commercial revenues, as well as our continued cost management efforts. Total second quarter operating expenses grew 5.7% compared to last year. Programming expense increased just under 6%. Video and premium channel subscriber declines partially offset contractual rate increases incremental retransmission consent costs and higher transactional VOD expense. We still expect that full year programming cost growth will be a little higher than last year, with the year-over-year growth increasing as we progress through the year.
Employee costs, which represent roughly a third of our total OpEx, were up 4% year-over-year reflecting higher headcount, compensation and medical expenses that were partially offset by lower pension expense. A majority of the increase in employee expenses was attributable to growth in our Commercial operations. 
Marketing expense of $156 million was in line with the marketing spend over the last couple of quarters, what was about $28 million higher than in Q2 '09 due primarily to our efforts this year to more evenly spread our marketing spending over the full year. Voice costs were up close to 6.5% due to growth in Digital Phone subscribers. 
As we've highlighted in the past, we are in the process of insourcing many of the voice support functions that have historically been outsourced to Sprint. Over time, we expect this will meaningfully improve our direct voice costs. This process did not have a meaningful impact on Q2 voice costs, and while we will incur some cost during the back half of this year, we don't anticipate seeing the benefits from this migration until 2011.
Our net bad debt expense declined nearly 22% to $40 million, reflecting better collections. We incurred about $10 million of start-up losses during Q2 in connection with the deployment of our wireless broadband offer. That's on top of the roughly $5 million of losses we incurred in Q1, and we're still expecting full year losses in the $50 million zone. 
Before I will read expenses, I want to remind you that restructuring expense is not reflected in adjusted OIBDA. Restructuring costs were $31 million through June 30, and we expect full year restructuring cost to be around $50 million.
Turning to capital spending on Slide 10. The capital intensity of our overall business continue to decline even as we accelerated investment in our growing Commercial Services business. Second quarter CapEx was $736 million or 15.5% of revenues and consisted of a $619 million of Residential CapEx and $117 million of Commercial CapEx. 
Through the first six months of the year, CapEx was just under $1.5 billion or 15.8% of revenues, down from over 17% in the first half of 2009. Residential CapEx for the first half was down over 10% versus the first half of 2009 due to declines in support capital and CPE capital, which benefited from both lower volume and better per unit prices.
Commercial capital expenditures were $233 million in the first half, a more than 36% increase from the prior-year period as we invested in commercial growth initiatives including cell backhaul. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be less than $3 billion.
On to cash flow on the next slide. Adjusted OIBDA less CapEx for the second quarter was $1 billion, resulting in an Adjusted OIBDA less CapEx of $1.95 billion for the first half of 2010, a nearly 20% year-over-year increase. Given our year-to-date performance, we continue to expect our full year adjusted OIBDA less CapEx will increase around 20% over last year. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $571 million, driving our first half free cash flow to $1.2 billion, nearly 19% higher than the first half of 2009 despite an increase in cash interest of $152 million and a jump in cash taxes of $181 million, in part resulting from the reversal of almost [ph] depreciation. Through June 30, we converted almost 36% of our adjusted OIBDA into free cash flow. Free cash flow per diluted share of $3.41 for the first half of the year grew almost 14.5% versus the year ago period.
Turning to the next slide. Diluted earnings per share of $0.95 were 6.7% higher than the last year's second quarter. Through the first two quarters, EPS was $1.55 come, up 11.5% over the same period last year. We continue to expect the full year EPS will be between $3.25 and $3.50.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our net debt and preferred equity totaled $20.7 billion and our blended cost of debt financing, which continued to benefit from interest rate swaps we put in place over the last year, was 6.4%. Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 3.07x, well below our 3.25x target. 
As our strong Adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow growth continue to drive our leverage ratio further below our 3.25x times target, the question naturally arises as to whether we're committed to 3.25x, and if so, how we intend to increase our leverage. In the interest of saving you a question when we move to the Q&A, first, we are committed to 3.25x of long-term leverage target and second, while we're not ready to announce anything today, we are in discussions with our board and our finance committee about additional ways we might return the capital to shareholders, and we expect to be in the position to say more on the topic on our third quarter call.
So with that said, let me quickly summarize. We delivered another quarter of strong financial results with accelerated Commercial and Advertising revenue growth, as well as continued solid Residential growth. We once again successfully balanced subscriber and ARPU growth in our Subscription businesses. 
We continue to generate significant free cash flow despite higher cash taxes and interest payments, and we continue to reduce our leverage, creating greater financial capacity for potential return to our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Landel."

From an operational perspective, performing very well in all areas of our business: Residential, Commercial and Advertising. Over the next few minutes, I'll share with you some of the progress we're making in two of these areas: Residential and Commercial. We'll start with Residential.
Telephone companies continue to expand their number of homes passed. Although in our footprint, similar to last quarter, the rate of increases continue to slow. We estimate that at the end of June, AT&T's U-Verse product was available to approximately 22% of our homes passed, up from 21% a quarter earlier. Verizon's FiOS offering continue to be available to about 10% of our passes. 
AT&T's advertising spending seems to be up sharply year-over-year, although spending by the other participants has not changed dramatically. Promotional intensity across all competitors appear to have increased somewhat in the quarter.
In the face of this competitive environment, we continue to take broadband market share in the second quarter, getting most of our broadband Internet ads from the telcos. In Video, our internal research indicates that similar to last quarter, telco penetration continue to slow. And our best estimate is that we lost a small number of video subscribers to satellite competition in the quarter. But we actually saw an improvement here on a year-over-year basis. So we continue to be very competitive, while effectively balancing profitability and share.
Turning to products, we continue to make great progress. In Video, we're now in average of roughly 100 HD channels across our footprint. In New York City, where we've now introduced Switched Digital Video into our all digital system. We expect to have close to 150 HD channels for the next several weeks. We launched industry-leading whole-home DVR solution in Charlotte. We expect to roll it out broadly in the second half of the year. Customers have one terabyte of storage and can record four simultaneous streams, which can be played back on any TV in the house.
In addition, we recently launched our remote DVR management. This product enables our customers to schedule or modify recordings on their Time Warner Cable DVRs from a PC, iPhone or any other browser capable device. We continue to invest in making our Road Runner service even better. 
Last month, we added DOCSIS 3.0 base services, an opening in Charlotte. Expanding DOCSIS 3.0 availability to almost a third of our footprint. Road Runner Mobile continues to expand. Earlier this week, we launched in Syracuse at Rochester. Also of note, we introduced our dual mode mobile hotspot, IntelliGo. IntelliGo enables us many as five WiFi capable devices simultaneously connect to Time Warner Cable's 4G and 3G Mobile services.
I told you on our fourth quarter 2009 earnings call, of our records to recharge Digital Phone. So last month, we introduced a major enhancement to the service called VoiceZone. VoiceZone is a Web portal where subscribers can manage their home voicemail features anywhere, anytime. It enables them to receive their voicemail as an e-mail attachment and has a number of useful features including caller ID on the PC. I've talked to you before about segmentation. We began to use our segmentation capabilities to crack unique offerings for our customers. Last month, we launched a trial of the new offering in Charlotte, similar to our ultimate triple-play offering in New York City, it's targeted at high ARPU consumers who want all our best-in-class products and to demand a more personalized service experience. We're actively learning from this trial, and we expect to launch the offering broadly across our footprint later this year. In addition, we are hard work on combined product-for-service experiences, for other customer segments as well.
Turning now to Commercial. Commercial is switcher's game. There's just not enough new business formation present to drive sufficient growth, best to come [ph] as no surprise. So in that context, competition in the SMB market is intensifying. They always become aware that cable companies are serious about gaining market share. Telcos have been very aggressive in launching promotions to voice and data bundles that include either DSL or Integrated T-1 access responding in part for our success with voice and data bundles. The largest Time Warner Cable markets, New York, L.A. and Dallas, The dialers [ph] are offering discounts from 15% to 40% exchange for a multiyear contracts of small business customers. 
Despite the telco discounts, we've been able to drive rapid growth by promoting the value of our products and solutions coupled with a focus on the customer experience. Our Commercial products is in good shape. Even so, we continue to invest in Commercial products so that we can better read customer needs and fuel faster growth.
A couple of examples. First, Business Class Mobile, our Wireless data product, is now available in combination with our core data products in Texas and the Carolina, with other areas planning the launch by the end of 2010. Second, we've expanded the selling area for our Metro Ethernet products enabling us to connect and serve more customer locations. Third, we expanded availability from our wideband Internet access product, making it available to portion of our Northeast Texas regions. In Voice, our PRI service offering has expanded. We've increased the selling footprint by introducing PRI products that worked on HSD network complementing our existing fiber base product. These two PRI products are available system-wide. 
Cell tower backhaul continues to be a star offering. At the end of the second quarter, we were receiving revenues for providing backhaul of 4,600 sites or about 1,000 more sites than at the end of the first quarter. During the second quarter, we signed contracts covering about 400 additional towers, and at quarter end, we had about 1,200 towers under contract that had yet to come online.
We've also made terrific progress in the past several months, our segmentation analysis on the Commercial market. Our objective is to identify those businesses most likely to switch their service from an established competitor. We analyze that 2.5 million to 3 million businesses in our footprint have fewer than 1,000 employees. We now have much more effective capabilities for lead regeneration with tin [ph] industry segments, and we're focusing our approach on media buying and product offerings by segment.
Our analysis also highlighted that we've achieved substantial penetration level in certain geographies and segments. Now as a result, we're expanding our serviceability to cities like New York, where we are using heat maps to target capital spending to locations where we think we can generate the best returns. We expect to accelerate the expansion of serviceability in the other cities in the coming quarters.
So in summary, we're really encouraged and are working better understanding our customers' needs paying off, both the Residential and Commercial sides of our business for better customer experiences and a profitable growth. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

And I wanted to get your sense for realistically, if you think we can avoid, the industry can avoid the Title II reclassification based on what you know. Today, it also seems like usage caps across the Data business, obviously, in Wireless or AT&T, seemed to be becoming more and more of a reality. So I know it's been a little bit of a tough road over the last 18 months on this front. But do you think we're closer to tearing usage caps, usage base billing now than we were even last quarter?"

What you call the usage caps, actually, I don't like that way of describing, and I think, that implies that maybe to denote. So real question is, will there be pricing structure over time for Internet and Wireless where people use more, pay more, people who use less, pay less.

I think if you look at the key indicators in the economy, things like vacancy rates, things like unemployment rates lower. We're off the highs, We're still at an exceptionally high levels. So it shouldn't be terribly surprising that we continue to see weakness in subscriber net adds. I will say that HSD is held up better than the other two products, and Voice is probably the softest. And some of that we can attribute to the lack of move activity because move activities certainly generates opportunities for us to settle Voice. In all cases, the net add weakness is a function of the absence of Connect as opposed to anything happening on Disconnect side. Churn has been pretty much under control, if not down in most categories over the last, I don't know, year or so. Movies on demand, we were up on movies on demand revenue in the quarter. But a lot of that was April driven and the April effect was a combination, I would imagine, of the slate, but also of the promotion you referred to in March. Throughout Q2, we did have a higher number of day-and-day titles than we did a year ago, and that's certainly helping the cause as well. Nothing pronounced though in July that I can tie back to the economy yet. As for your last question on the balance sheet, we're really not going to say more than that will have more to say on the topic on our Q3 call."

Jason, I think as you've watched this over time, couple of things have evolved from our market perspective. Glenn hit it right. The first place we focused in on is proprietary segmentation, not only in the Residential side, but the Commercial side. Then we began to refine the type of marketing by sales channel and then of course got much more sophisticated around pricing. The creative itself will also continue to revolve to be more aggressive. So for example, a lot of these innovative items you're talking about will begin to show up more and more in our creative. However, one thing to watch for from us on the creative side is, and I referred to in my comments, that we're looking at products sets and service set combinations by segment. So I think as you move toward the tail at the end of the year, you're going to see a different kind of advertising around segment base products and then also watch for our branding to begin to evolve and change, where in the branding itself we begin to try to focus on everything we talked about whether it be simplicity around technology, ease of use and control. So I think that's what you'll see as we evolve in the marketing part of the business over the next six months and then moving into the next year."

On the first one, I must admit there's a certain amount of globalling going on there. As I see consumers and recognize that we're in a position where we deal with consumers and programming companies tend to deal indirectly with consumers through us. What we see is a segment of the economy, and some people clearly would like to be able to buy smaller video packages when they're, perhaps, stressed financially. And I think it would be a good idea for the broader industry of multichannel providers and programmers to meet that need. Obviously, the economics of the programmers, where they try to bundle all of their networks together and there's a history of ever adding more networks, they think that their interest is having the big packages. So not surprisingly, we don't see a lot of people signing up for the smaller packages.

I think we will stick with our earlier comments. Obviously, there's some different components to that. We've seen the spending on residential decline, at the same time, our spending on commercial, which is very high return, has been going up. So that should be seen as a positive among other things because the economy is depressed, spending on CPE has been down because all the volumes of activity are down. So all that's going on. And the third category is either commercial in our CPE but the sort of spending on the ongoing plan and the specific projects change from time to time, products that squeeze are current [ph] for example. And our strategy has been to have that be relatively even over the years, and we try not to have the big lumps and then big declines which you've seen with some of the other operators.

Welcome to Time Warner Cable's 2010 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we issued two press releases, one detailing our 2010 third quarter results, and the other announcing our share repurchase program and the declaration of our regular quarterly dividends.
Before we begin, there are several items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including operating income before depreciation and amortization or OIBDA. In addition, we refer to adjusted OIBDA and adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditures. Definitions and schedules setting out reconciliations of these historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release or our trending schedules. 
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by statements herein due to various factors, including economic, business, competitive, technological, strategic and/or regulatory changes that could affect our business. 
These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner Cable's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner Cable is under no obligation to, and in fact, expressly disclaims any such obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 And finally, today's press release, trending schedules, presentation slides and related reconciliation schedules are available on our company's web site at timewarnercable.com/investors. A replay of today's call will be available beginning approximately two hours after the call has ended and will run through midnight Eastern Time on August 9.

We had a good third quarter, in which we grew revenues and adjusted OIBDA roughly 5% and 6%, respectively. ARPU growth was strong. In fact, total ARPU per customer relationship increased almost 7%.

In fact, total ARPU per customer relationship increased almost 7%. Our Commercial Services and Advertising businesses continued to accelerate with year-over-year revenue growth rates of approximately 22% and 23%, respectively. 
Consistent with our comments during the quarter, subscriber net adds grew weaker than we've seen before. These results reflect the weak economy, with continuing high rates of unemployment and housing vacancies, as well as a very competitive marketplace. The impact wasn't uniform. Some services fared better than others. Our high speed data product performed the best on a relative basis and our customers continued to choose faster speeds. 
In terms of the bottom line, we generated $1 of EPS in the quarter for the first time since becoming a public company. And through the first nine months of the year, we have generated more than $1.6 billion of free cash flow.
When we went public three and a half years ago, we had set out to build a company that is consistent, transparent and shareholder-friendly. We followed through in a series of steps, starting with our separation from Time Warner Inc. and our payment of a $10.9 billion special dividend. Since then, we've been steadfastly committed to a leverage target of 3.25x adjusted OIBDA and we've been consistent in our public statements that as we delevered below 3.25x, we would return capital to our shareholders. In keeping with this strategy, we announced regular dividend this last January with the yield at announcement of 3.7%. Despite strong appreciation of our stock price in the intervening nine months, our yield remains well above our cable and satellite years.
As a result of our continuing progress, we're now positioned to return even more capital to our shareholders. This morning, we announced that our board has authorized a $4 billion share repurchase program. This repurchase program, in conjunction with our regular dividend, once again reflects our confidence in the strength and stability of the company's free cash flows. 
In operations, we are redoubling our focus on the customer experience to further improve our competitive position. A number of very exciting products and services that have been in the incubation process are now poised for release. These new capabilities support our 4 Anys framework, that is the notion that our customers want access to any content any time, anywhere and on any device.
Consistent with the anywhere and anytime aspects, we have launched our Remote DVR Manager to much of our footprint including New York City and whole home DVRs available in some systems and will be broadly available by year-end. We're proud to be the first multichannel provider to offer ESPN to our customers via TV Everywhere capability. Last week, we debuted authenticated access to ESPN3 and the ESPN linear feed for customers who subscribe to a video tier that includes ESPN. In the near future, we plan to offer access to ESPN2, ESPNU and the new ESPN goal line and the ESPN Buzzer Beater through the same process. This gives our customers an unprecedented level of access from multiple locations and devices to great live sports content. We plan to add more content from a wide range of networks to our TV Everywhere capability in the near future.
In addition, we are on the cusp of harnessing the power of consumer electronics products in the home. In the not-too-distant future, our customers will have the opportunity to use their iPad as a remote control. And we're working on infrastructure that could enable customers to enjoy our entire video product on any IP-connected device in the home. 
On a different front, we've been very pleased with our signature home offering in Charlotte. Signature home is a feature-rich, triple-play offering targeted at high ARPU customers who want all of our best-in-class products and who demand a much more personalized service experience. It's been rolled out across much of our footprint in the coming weeks. In addition, we're planning to complement this high-end suite of services with a budget-oriented video offering, consistent with our belief that some customers would like a smaller package.
In summary, the company is doing well. We're introducing important new offerings that we think will give our customers control in ways that are simple and easy. We are performing well financially despite the economic and competitive climate, and our efforts are paying off in the generation of strong free cash flow. And all of these makes it possible for us to return a large amount of capital to our shareholders through regular dividends and the share repurchase program that we announced this morning.
Next, Rob will give you additional details on our financial performance."

Third quarter revenues grew over 5% year-over-year as residential subscription revenues increased 3.5% and Commercial and Advertising revenues each jumped about 22%. Despite the tough economic and competitive climate which negatively affected subscriber growth in the quarter, our ARPU per customer relationship rose 6.6% year-over-year to more than $109. 
Adjusted OIBDA grew almost 6% in the quarter, reflecting our strong revenue growth and improved margins. Through the first nine months of the year, adjusted OIBDA less CapEx increased almost 20% and free cash flow was up over 8%. EPS of $1 marked a record since becoming a public company.

And last but certainly not least, as Glen discussed, we are very pleased that our board has authorized a $4 billion share repurchase program.
Before we review our operating results, let's turn to Slide 4 so I can provide some color on the share repurchase plan. As we've been saying, since our separation from Time Warner, our target leverage ratio is 3.25x. At quarter end, we were just under 3x and going forward, our strong free cash flow and OIBDA growth would reduce our leverage even further absent additional returns of capital to shareholders. So in the interest of managing to our leverage target, we are initiating a $4 billion share repurchase program to complement our regular dividend. We showed you a chart like the one on Slide 4 about nine months ago when we announced the initiation of our regular dividend. At that time, we pointed out that our initial dividend yield of 3.7% was much higher than the average dividend of dividend-paying S&P 500 companies, and was among the highest yields of companies initiating a dividend in the last five years. Similarly, as the chart shows, our buyback authorization is large. At $4 billion, the program provides us the capacity to repurchase up to almost 20% of our total market Cap at today's stock price. That's higher than our peers and larger than nearly 95% of the more than 600 share repurchase authorizations announced in the first nine months of this year. We're not announcing a timeframe for completing the repurchase program as the timing of our purchases will be dictated by market conditions, as well as other factors. We'll obviously be reporting our monthly share repurchase activity each quarter and that will provide you a good indicator of the pace of which we're buying.
So getting back to Q3 performance, let's look first at our Subscriber results. During the quarter, we continued to grow our high-speed data subscribers and take share from the telcos. We increased total HSD subs by 104,000 bringing our total HSD subscriber base to over 9.7 million, a 5.9% year-over-year increase. At quarter end, 35.6% of homes passed took our HSD products. We also continued to see a shift in the mix of our residential HSD subscriber base to our higher-speed tiers. Customers taking our Turbo offering increased by 123,000, and subscribers taking our Wideband or DOCSIS 3.0 tier grew by 4,000. About 13% of our residential HSD subscribers now take either the Turbo or DOCSIS 3.0 product. Commercial HSD net adds more than doubled year-over-year to 9,000. We added 34,000 Residential and Commercial digital phone customers during the quarter, bringing our total voice subscriber count to over 4.4 million, approximately 16.5% of homes passed and a 7% increase from the end of Q3 '09.
We added 12,000 Business Class Phone customers in the quarter for a total of 102,000, an increase of more than 75% since the end of Q3 '09. As we stated during the quarter, our video subscriber performance in particular was negatively affected by the challenging competitive and economic environment, and in particular, high unemployment, high housing vacancy rates and anemic new home information. For the quarter, we lost 155,000 residential and commercial video subscribers. The video sub declines were primarily driven by losses in analog Single Play video customers.
As a result of the video subscriber losses, total Primary Service Units declined by 17,000 for the quarter. The good news, however, is that year-over-year video sub performance and in turn, total PSU performance, did improve in each month of the quarter. August was better than July and September was better than August. So far in the fourth quarter, subscriber performance is looking better than in the third quarter. In fact, we've already added more voice customers in Q4 than we did in all of Q3. Overall though, PSU net adds continued to be below year ago levels. 
For the quarter, video and voice gross connects were down versus last year's third quarter while HSD connects were actually up year-over-year. Churn was flat to down year-over-year in each PSU category. Especially given the absence of new occupied homes to sell to, we continue to focus on migrating customers into bundles. As a result, we added 15,000 double play customers and 14,000 triple play customers. At quarter end, over 59% of our customers took more than one PSU, with more than a quarter of our subscribers taking all three PSUs. 
Turning to our financial results, let's start with revenues on the next slide. Third quarter revenues increased 5.2% year-over-year to $4.7 billion. Total subscription revenues, residential and commercial combined, grew 4.5%, driven by increased subscribers and a roughly 6% increase in subscription ARPU per customer relationship. Advertising revenues increased 22.5%. In dollar terms, total revenues were $236 million higher than in Q3 '09, with $144 million of that growth coming from our Residential Subscription business, $51 million coming from Commercial and $41 million coming from Advertising.
Let's focus on our Residential subscription revenues on Slide 7. Residential subscription revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year, driven by a healthy mix of price and volume increases. Residential HSD revenues were up 8.5% or $84 million from last year's third quarter, driven by sub growth, as well as a year-over-year increase of over 2% in Residential HSD ARPU. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year Residential HSD ARPU improvement as we benefited from price increases, and more subscribers taking premium tiers of service.
Residential video revenues increased $42 million, driven by price increases, and higher digital video and DVR revenues, partially offset by a decline in video subscribers and lower transactional VOD revenues. Our Movies On-Demand business grew 11.5% over last year's third quarter, reflecting increased buys and higher revenue per buy. But our overall transactional VOD revenues were way down by declines in adult and event revenues.
Residential video ARPU increased nearly 5% from Q3 '09. Residential voice revenues grew almost 4%, driven by subscriber growth, partially offset by a year-over-year ARPU decline of just over 2.5%, which was actually the smallest decline this year. On a sequential basis, residential voice ARPU was pretty much flat.
Now let's flip to Commercial revenues on the next slide. Commercial subscription revenue growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter to over 21.5%, remaining on pace to achieve the better than 20% full year commercial revenue growth that we discussed at the beginning of the year. The growth was balanced across Data, Business Class Phone and cell tower backhaul, with each contributing roughly 30% of the growth, the remainder came from video. Commercial data revenue increased almost 12.5%, driven by growth in shared Internet access, dedicated Internet access and Metro ethernet revenues. Business Class Phone revenues increased nearly 80%, driven by subscriber growth and cell tower backhaul revenues more than tripled versus Q3 '09.
Moving on to Advertising revenues. Our surge in ad sales business continued to drive a disproportionate share of our total revenue growth in the third quarter, rising 22.5% over last year. Advertising revenues per video subscriber increased about 27% to $5.89. The auto category accounted for a about a quarter of total ad sales and about a third of the year-over-year growth. The media 
and entertainment category contributed about 20% of the growth and political ad sales were responsible for roughly 15% of the growth. Year-to-date through the end of Q3, we've generated about $32 million of political ad dollars.
Through the first nine months of the year, our Advertising revenues have grown just over 22%. With continued strength in our core Advertising business, and the benefit of additional political spending, leading us to this week's elections, we're on pace to easily surpass our initial estimate of 15% growth for the full year.
Let's turn to adjusted OIBDA on Slide 10. Third quarter adjusted OIBDA grew 5.7% to $1.7 billion. Our margin improved 10 basis points year-over-year to 36.2%. Total third quarter operating expenses grew 5% compared to last year. Employee costs were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting higher headcount and compensation expenses, especially in our Commercial business, partially offset by lower pension expense. Programming expense increased only 3.5%. That's less than we had anticipated due to video sub losses and some items described in our press release which reduced year-over-year growth by about $20 million. Year-to-date programming costs have grown less than 5%, but we expect growth to accelerate in Q4 and full year programming costs growth should land in the 5.5% to 6% range. Third quarter programming cost per video subscriber increased 6.8% year-over-year.
Marketing expense of $156 million was higher than last year, but in line with the marketing spend over the last few quarters. Voice costs were up 4% due to growth in digital phone subscribers. As we previewed earlier in the year, we have begun the process of in-sourcing various voice support functions. We expected that about half of our voice subs will be migrated by the end of next year, with the balance moving over the following three years. The financial benefits of this move will begin to show up next year and over time, should be pretty meaningful. We continued to invest in our Wireless business during Q3, incurring about $15 million of wireless losses which reduced our adjusted OIBDA growth by almost a full percentage point and our margin by roughly 30 basis points. We are still expecting full year Wireless losses in the $50 million zone.
You'll recall that restructuring is excluded from adjusted OIBDA. Restructuring costs were $44 million through September 30, year-to-date and we anticipate another $15 million or so in the fourth quarter. Based on our year-to-date performance and our outlook for Q4, including higher year-over-year programming, bad debt and casualty insurance expense growth, and larger Wireless losses, we now expect the full year adjusted OIBDA growth will come in around 6%.
Turning to capital spending on Slide 11. Capital intensely declined for the fourth consecutive quarter, as third quarter CapEx came in at $676 million or 14.3% of revenues. Third quarter residential capital expenditures were down more than 15% year-over-year to $563 million, driven by declines in scalable infrastructure, CPE and support capital. Once again, in the quarter, we continued to invest more in our fast growing Commercial business. Commercial CapEx was $113 million, up about 24%, with about half the growth attributable to expanding our cell tower backhaul footprint. Through the first nine months of the year, CapEx was $2.1 billion or 15.3% of revenues, down from over 17% of revenues in the first nine months of 2009. As usual, we expect Q4 will be the highest CapEx quarter of the year. But we're very comfortable that capital expenditures for the full year will be less than $3 billion.
On to cash flow on the next slide. Adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditures for the third quarter was $1 billion, resulting in adjusted OIBDA less CapEx of nearly $3 billion for the first nine months of 2010, a nearly 20% year-over-year increase. Given our year-to-date performance, we continued to expect our full year adjusted OIBDA less CapEx will increase around 20% over 2009. Free cash flow for the quarter was $396 million, driving our nine month free cash flow to $1.6 billion or $4.50 per diluted share. Free cash flow was 8% higher than in the first nine months of 2009 as higher adjusted OIBDA less CapEx and lower pension contributions more than compensated for a jump in cash taxes of $333 million and an increase in cash interest of $159 million.
As you model Q4 free cash flow, remember that the recent Small Business Jobs Act extended bonus depreciation retroactive to the beginning of this year. That should reduce to zero, our fourth quarter Federal estimated tax payment. I'd also point out that we may make additional pension contributions in the fourth quarter.
Turning to the next slide. Diluted earnings per share were $1, an all-time high for Time Warner Cable since becoming a public company and 32% higher than the last year's third quarter. Through the first three quarters, diluted EPS was $2.55, up 19% over the same period last year. Given our EPS performance through the first nine months, we now expect to exceed the high end of the $3.25 to $3.50 per share range that we provided at the beginning of this year.
Finally, moving to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our net debt and preferred equity totaled $20.5 billion, a reduction of $1.1 billion from year-end 2009 despite our having paid out $432 million in regular dividends. Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 2.99x. 
Just yesterday, we entered into a new three-year $4 billion revolving credit facility which replaced the $5.875 billion facility that was set to mature in February 2011. We provide more information about the new facility in our 10-Q, but suffice it to say that we're very pleased with the terms. We now have no debt maturities until 2012.
So with that said, let me quickly summarize. We delivered another quarter of solid financial results, with accelerating commercial and advertising revenue growth, as well as stable residential revenue growth. Our free cash flow continued to grow at a healthy pace despite higher cash taxes and interest payments. As a result, we continued to reduce our leverage and create greater financial capacity, enabling us to launch our $4 billion share repurchase program. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Landel."
862598,113694924,85316,"Time Warner Cable Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Time Warner Cable Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good morning. From an operational perspective, we're performing well in all areas of our business, residential, commercial and advertising. Over the next few minutes, I'll share with you some of the progress we're making in each of these",1728,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning. From an operational perspective, we're performing well in all areas of our business, residential, commercial and advertising. Over the next few minutes, I'll share with you some of the progress we're making in each of these areas. 
We'll start with Residential. On the competitive front, the telephone companies continued to expand their number of homes passed, although in our footprint, the rate of increase, similar to last quarter, has continued to slow. We estimate that at the end of September, AT&T's U-verse product was available to approximately 23% of our homes passed, up from 22% a quarter earlier. Verizon FiOS offering continued to be available to about 10% of our passings. The competitive intensity in Q3 was about the same or slightly more aggressive than in the second quarter.
On the video side of the business, we continued to see very little expansion of multichannel video homes on an industry-wide basis. This is consistent with the ongoing weakness in the macroeconomic environment. Our third quarter video losses were driven primarily by lower connects. In particular, we have under indexed in low-end segments. Most of these households appeared to be going to satellite or leaving the pay TV category entirely. We also saw some increase in disconnects among subscribers who signed up during last year's over the year digital TV transition. By and large, similar to what we saw on the connect side, these subs win our two lowest value segments. On the other hand, we've been performing well in high-end, high-ARPU segments. And by the way, we haven't been able to identify any increase in video cord cutting related to over-the-top video. 
A couple of examples. First, as Rob mentioned, our video losses in the quarter were driven by Single Play video customers. And second, our video high-speed data Double Plays actually increased in the quarter. That's the opposite of what we'd expect to see of the remaining for cord cutting. And another example, we look at college towns like Austin, Texas and Columbus, Ohio in our footprint to examine the pieces that video cord cutting among students might have contributed to weaker connect volume this quarter. It turns out that college enrollment is flat this year compared to last and our video connect volumes were also flat. So we'll continue to monitor cord cutting but haven't found evidence where we might expect to see it.
Turning to broadband. We continued to compete very well in Q3. AT&T's promotional pricing of its six megabit per second DSL service at $19.95 a month appears to have reduced the exodus of DSL subs. However, on a footprint-adjusted basis, our 104,000 broadband net additions were around 50% higher than the two big telcos, demonstrating that we continued to take share in Q3. In voice, we continued to take share from the telcos in Q3 albeit at a slower rate than we would like. We recently have adjusted Triple Play bundled marketing and pricing in our East region to good effect. We actually seen year-over-year improvement in digital phone net adds in recent weeks.
With that as a backdrop, let me highlight several initiatives that we expect to further enhance the competitiveness of our products. First, I'd be remiss if I didn't update you on our high definition product. As we indicated last quarter, we completed the implementation of video switching in New York City, and as a result, we now have 156 HD channels in the city. Nationwide, our weighted average is now over 110. This demonstrates the ability of our infrastructure in meeting customer's needs. We've lost Remote DVR Manager across our footprint and it's now available to more than 3 million DVRs. And this week, there's a lot of excitement around our mobile Internet product as we launched our combined 4G/3G wireless service in New York City. It delivers speeds up to six megabits per second, 5x faster than 3G, making it one of the fastest mobile broadband networks available. With our wireline Time Warner cable Internet, mobile Internet and Wi-Fi offerings, our customers in New York City will now have three different ways to access our broadband service with varying degrees of speed and mobility, making it the most complete and flexible broadband offering.
In conjunction with our recent mobile Internet launch, we are offering new packages, including a tier that provides 250 megabytes per month on our for the 4G/3G network for under $20 when bundled with our wireline service. In the coming months, availability of the service will expand further as we launch in Cleveland in early December and LA just after year end. In voice, we've launched VoiceZone in nearly our entire footprint including, as of a couple of weeks ago, New York City. VoiceZone is a web portal where subscribers can manage their home voicemail and phone features anywhere, anytime. It enables them to receive their voicemail as an e-mail attachment and has a number of innovative features including caller ID on the PC. 
In Charlotte, we've been very pleased with our signature home, a new bundled offering targeted at our high-end ARPU segments who want all of our best-in-class products and who demand a more personalized service experience. We're seeing a nice ARPU uplift of upgrading customers and we also are pleasantly surprised that substantial amount of the incremental revenue is coming from customers new to Time Warner Cable. The offering looks like a real winner and you can expect to see it arrive in much of our footprint including New York City in the coming weeks.
In the more value- and budget-oriented segments, we've heard loud and clear that customers would like more flexibility in video packaging, particularly in the availability of smaller packages. I want to tease you a bit here because we're not quite ready to make the announcement, but you can expect to see us introduce a video offering that is targeted at more value and budget-oriented segments in the very near future. 
Turning now to Commercial. In the SMB market, Time Warner Cable competes primarily with ILECs. In some cases, telcos are increasing DSL speeds to compete against our broadband speeds. In other cases, they're offering a low-price promotion to attract customers, but AT&T and Verizon are also incenting businesses to incorporate national wireless voice and data plans as a way to differentiate their bundles from cable. In the midmarket, Time Warner Cable offers a variety of voice and data products across metro networks that compete with both ILECs and CLECs. The telcos are now paying greater attention to protecting this installed base, had introduced their more complex enterprise-class products into the midmarket. In this competitive environment, we're very comfortable with our ability to compete and grow rapidly in both the SMB and midmarket.
On the product front, we've done a very good job in the past two years in building out a comprehensive Internet and phone solution set for small and medium businesses. This quarter, we filled a long-standing need to update our video solution for the hospitality vertical. Our new HD video for hospitality product enables us to deliver a consistent HD video and music lineup across our footprint while maintaining compatibility with a variety of interactive service providers in the space including Loginet. The service are delivered over either fiber or coax and is targeted initially at hotels with room counts above 100. In cell tower backhaul, we continued to do very well. We installed service to almost 500 radios in the third quarter to raise the total installed base to more than 5,000. In addition, we have contracts on a large number of radios that will keep our installation crews busy well into 2011.
Turning next to Advertising. As Rob indicated, we're having a terrific year in Advertising. Revenues are up 22% in the first nine months of the year and we're seeing strength in almost every category. Core Advertising growth, which excludes political, was very strong in Q3, posting growth at 20% year-over-year. I'd remind you that the strong political year we're experiencing currently won't repeat in 2011. Certainly, our strong performance reflects broader industry trends and the midterm elections. However, it also results from investments we made during the recent downturn and building new relationships and growing categories as well as improved execution. 
One area in which we're just now beginning to see the fruits of our labors is the use of data. We now have access to and are using anonymized data from set-tops to help advertisers make better decisions about where to place their spots. All of this data is collected and presented in a way that completely protects the privacy of individual subscribers. It's early doing, but I'm pleased to report that our Advertising customers are very excited about the new capability, and frankly we are, too.
With the industry nearing its objective of 25 million EBIF enabled households by year-end, Canoe is closer to its goal of a truly national ITV solution. Six cable networks are planning to employ its request for information capability in the coming months. We continue to be enthusiastic about the value that Canoe can unlock.
Before I conclude, let me say a few words on our identity refresh. You're probably aware that following our spinoff from Time Warner, we considered changing the name of the company. However, after conducting brand research, we recognized there's great value in both the name Time Warner Cable and our pioneer symbol. As a result, we've decided to keep them both. Although we've refreshed and updated the logo, fonts and colors, you'll start to see it over time in all of our communications, especially as you may have may seen it this morning in Rob's presentation slides or when you visited our website for the conference call. But please be assured that we're not buying hundreds and millions of dollars in media and rewrapping all of our trucks overnight. We'll do most of this in the normal course of business and you won't see a huge bulge on our marketing budget.
So in summary, we have performed well, in Residential, Commercial and Ad sales in the third quarter. We're adding some terrific new capabilities to our products which we expect to further enhance our competitiveness. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

The drivers of that -- let me go through them because they're all cost driven and they're all or at least several of them are kind of one-time in nature. Let's start with bad debt. You may remember that in 2009, with the economy being what it was, we actually increased our allowance for doubtful accounts. As we closed out 2009, we took a fresh look at that number and actually reversed it. So we have a tough year-over-year comparison on the bad debt front which won't repeat itself. Programming costs, we've talked about this before, but we expect the growth in -- it'll be the first full quarter under our new Disney deal. So that has an impact on programming costs. On casualty insurance, which is another kind of comparison issue, again, we had an adjustment in Q4 of '09 that will cause that to be a tough comparison, again, shouldn't repeat itself. And the last element is that we'll continue to spend on our Wireless business and a lot of the spend is back loaded, so we'll have more spending in Q4 than we did in the other quarters of the year. So I'm not sure I would draw any conclusions about growing forward margins from that."

I've been talking about that for a long time. So we have sought in our programming negotiations which are ongoing with all sorts of people to get more flexibility around that. Obviously, going the other way, in the Programming business, their cost tend to be somewhat fixed so if they're facing smaller audiences and/or a smaller subscription, that's a big problem for them. So it's natural for those companies to resist. So there's a balance in this and I would just leave it to say, we have negotiated some additional flexibility beyond what we had a few years ago that will allow us to begin to offer some smaller packages or lower prices. Probably not all the way where we would like to be, but we're moving in the right direction."

There's a lot of functionality that is coming to the product that hasn't existed to the set-top box before. And with devices like tablets, you create the ability to search in a way that's never been available on the set-top as well. So I'm wondering how far away are we from being able to integrate all that to the television set? Because a lot of this stuff today sort of has the -- sort of a PC product, maybe a mobile product and a television product, it seems like the big win and maybe I'm wrong. Disagree with me if you want, but the big win could be for the industry to bring all this to the television, it adds a whole level of interactibility and customization that hasn't been there before. So how far away are we from that? Do you think that's where we're headed?"

And I'll try to give you a short answer because I could talk about this for the whole rest of the time. But there's obviously a lot of new product introduction both from the CE industry and from what used to be the IT industry and sometimes they look the same. And what we need to do is make sure that our services on all the devices take advantage of the functionality. So I mentioned the idea of using an iPad as a remote which we've been working on for a while. There's a clip on YouTube that shows a demo of an early prototype. You are starting to see in the market and I think you're going to see much more robust way TV sets that directly offer IP connectivity. And as I said in my remarks, we want to create the infrastructure so that our video services can be delivered directly to those TV sets in the home. That's not really so dramatic, it's just like going from analog to digital, et cetera. Those TVs to the extent they start having more intelligence, and the first ones may not have a browser, but the later ones will. I think we'll be able to display a lot more interesting program interfaces, user interfaces. Some of that software may be moved back into the network instead of the DS device. But all of this means that consumers are going to get better experience and I think over time, without set-tops, which is an interesting factor also. So that's my attempt at a fairly short answer."

So in essence, the buyback kind of has to be in and around the range of $700 million to $800 million per quarter, i.e. 3% to 4% of the share count per quarter just to stay where you are on leverage.

Glenn, you mentioned a future in which more and more set-tops perhaps move into the television set.

Simple reason we have set-tops is that the consumer electronics devices in general are not capable of displaying all of our services without a set-top. So by and large, the consumer electronics devices are not too way capable. They can't do VOD, they can't do program guides, they can't un-encrypt encrypted services, so there's a piracy issue. Obviously, some of the SEC rules on cable cards have attempted to deal with the encryption problem. But we would be delighted to not have set-top boxes. The thing I left out, too, is the hard drive DVR is in the set-tops. I think the world we're going to -- we spent a lot of time with the big consumer electronics companies, the way we're going to is one where these devices will be more intelligent and more easily networked, so that we can envision a world with at least where people buy new TVs, where we might not have to set-tops. I think it may move to a gateway device because the old TVs will live for a very long time, so we'll need some sort of interface and some place for the hard drive. Quite frankly, moving the DVR functionality back into the network which we pioneered with Maestro and Cablevision has been working on, that's a better engineering solution. But given the stance of the company right owners, it might not be one that we can do on a widespread basis quickly. And so that's a little bit confused, but I think you're going to see, over time, fewer set-tops, lower CPE spending. And hopefully more of the intelligence move back into the network, as well as into a consumer home device. And by the way, this will all result in a much better consumer experience which is what we should really be focused on."

Welcome to Time Warner Cable's 2010 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we issued two press releases, one detailing our 2010 third quarter results, and the other announcing our share repurchase program and the declaration of our regular quarterly dividends.
Before we begin, there are several items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including operating income before depreciation and amortization or OIBDA. In addition, we refer to adjusted OIBDA and adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditures. Definitions and schedules setting out reconciliations of these historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release or our trending schedules. 
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.

We had a good third quarter, in which we grew revenues and adjusted OIBDA roughly 5% and 6%, respectively. ARPU growth was strong. In fact, total ARPU per customer relationship increased almost 7%. Our Commercial S",801,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a good third quarter, in which we grew revenues and adjusted OIBDA roughly 5% and 6%, respectively. ARPU growth was strong. In fact, total ARPU per customer relationship increased almost 7%. Our Commercial Services and Advertising businesses continued to accelerate with year-over-year revenue growth rates of approximately 22% and 23%, respectively. 
Consistent with our comments during the quarter, subscriber net adds grew weaker than we've seen before. These results reflect the weak economy, with continuing high rates of unemployment and housing vacancies, as well as a very competitive marketplace. The impact wasn't uniform. Some services fared better than others. Our high speed data product performed the best on a relative basis and our customers continued to choose faster speeds. 
In terms of the bottom line, we generated $1 of EPS in the quarter for the first time since becoming a public company. And through the first nine months of the year, we have generated more than $1.6 billion of free cash flow.
When we went public three and a half years ago, we had set out to build a company that is consistent, transparent and shareholder-friendly. We followed through in a series of steps, starting with our separation from Time Warner Inc. and our payment of a $10.9 billion special dividend. Since then, we've been steadfastly committed to a leverage target of 3.25x adjusted OIBDA and we've been consistent in our public statements that as we delevered below 3.25x, we would return capital to our shareholders. In keeping with this strategy, we announced regular dividend this last January with the yield at announcement of 3.7%. Despite strong appreciation of our stock price in the intervening nine months, our yield remains well above our cable and satellite years.
As a result of our continuing progress, we're now positioned to return even more capital to our shareholders. This morning, we announced that our board has authorized a $4 billion share repurchase program. This repurchase program, in conjunction with our regular dividend, once again reflects our confidence in the strength and stability of the company's free cash flows. 
In operations, we are redoubling our focus on the customer experience to further improve our competitive position. A number of very exciting products and services that have been in the incubation process are now poised for release. These new capabilities support our 4 Anys framework, that is the notion that our customers want access to any content any time, anywhere and on any device.
Consistent with the anywhere and anytime aspects, we have launched our Remote DVR Manager to much of our footprint including New York City and whole home DVRs available in some systems and will be broadly available by year-end. We're proud to be the first multichannel provider to offer ESPN to our customers via TV Everywhere capability. Last week, we debuted authenticated access to ESPN3 and the ESPN linear feed for customers who subscribe to a video tier that includes ESPN. In the near future, we plan to offer access to ESPN2, ESPNU and the new ESPN goal line and the ESPN Buzzer Beater through the same process. This gives our customers an unprecedented level of access from multiple locations and devices to great live sports content. We plan to add more content from a wide range of networks to our TV Everywhere capability in the near future.
In addition, we are on the cusp of harnessing the power of consumer electronics products in the home. In the not-too-distant future, our customers will have the opportunity to use their iPad as a remote control. And we're working on infrastructure that could enable customers to enjoy our entire video product on any IP-connected device in the home. 
On a different front, we've been very pleased with our signature home offering in Charlotte. Signature home is a feature-rich, triple-play offering targeted at high ARPU customers who want all of our best-in-class products and who demand a much more personalized service experience. It's been rolled out across much of our footprint in the coming weeks. In addition, we're planning to complement this high-end suite of services with a budget-oriented video offering, consistent with our belief that some customers would like a smaller package.
In summary, the company is doing well. We're introducing important new offerings that we think will give our customers control in ways that are simple and easy. We are performing well financially despite the economic and competitive climate, and our efforts are paying off in the generation of strong free cash flow. And all of these makes it possible for us to return a large amount of capital to our shareholders through regular dividends and the share repurchase program that we announced this morning.
Next, Rob will give you additional details on our financial performance.

As usual, I'll start with the third quarter highlights on Slide 3. Third quarter revenues grew over 5% year-over-year as residential subscription revenues increased 3.5% and Commercial and Advertising revenues each jumped about 22%. Despite the tough economic and competitive climate which negatively affected subscriber growth in the quarter, our ARPU per customer relationship rose 6.6% year-over-year to more than $109. 
Adjusted OIBDA grew almost 6% in the quarter, reflecting our strong revenue growth and improved margins. Through the first nine months of the year, adjusted OIBDA less CapEx increased almost 20% and free cash flow was up over 8%. EPS of $1 marked a record since becoming a public company. With three quarters of the year behind us, we are on track to meet or exceed all of the elements of our full year guidance. I'll provide some updates on the guidance as I walk through the financials. And last but certainly not least, as Glen discussed, we are very pleased that our board has authorized a $4 billion share repurchase program.
Before we review our operating results, let's turn to Slide 4 so I can provide some color on the share repurchase plan. As we've been saying, since our separation from Time Warner, our target leverage ratio is 3.25x. At quarter end, we were just under 3x and going forward, our strong free cash flow and OIBDA growth would reduce our leverage even further absent additional returns of capital to shareholders. So in the interest of managing to our leverage target, we are initiating a $4 billion share repurchase program to complement our regular dividend. We showed you a chart like the one on Slide 4 about nine months ago when we announced the initiation of our regular dividend. At that time, we pointed out that our initial dividend yield of 3.7% was much higher than the average dividend of dividend-paying S&P 500 companies, and was among the highest yields of companies initiating a dividend in the last five years. Similarly, as the chart shows, our buyback authorization is large. At $4 billion, the program provides us the capacity to repurchase up to almost 20% of our total market Cap at today's stock price. That's higher than our peers and larger than nearly 95% of the more than 600 share repurchase authorizations announced in the first nine months of this year. We're not announcing a timeframe for completing the repurchase program as the timing of our purchases will be dictated by market conditions, as well as other factors. We'll obviously be reporting our monthly share repurchase activity each quarter and that will provide you a good indicator of the pace of which we're buying.
So getting back to Q3 performance, let's look first at our Subscriber results. During the quarter, we continued to grow our high-speed data subscribers and take share from the telcos. We increased total HSD subs by 104,000 bringing our total HSD subscriber base to over 9.7 million, a 5.9% year-over-year increase. At quarter end, 35.6% of homes passed took our HSD products. We also continued to see a shift in the mix of our residential HSD subscriber base to our higher-speed tiers. Customers taking our Turbo offering increased by 123,000, and subscribers taking our Wideband or DOCSIS 3.0 tier grew by 4,000. About 13% of our residential HSD subscribers now take either the Turbo or DOCSIS 3.0 product. Commercial HSD net adds more than doubled year-over-year to 9,000. We added 34,000 Residential and Commercial digital phone customers during the quarter, bringing our total voice subscriber count to over 4.4 million, approximately 16.5% of homes passed and a 7% increase from the end of Q3 '09.
We added 12,000 Business Class Phone customers in the quarter for a total of 102,000, an increase of more than 75% since the end of Q3 '09. As we stated during the quarter, our video subscriber performance in particular was negatively affected by the challenging competitive and economic environment, and in particular, high unemployment, high housing vacancy rates and anemic new home information. For the quarter, we lost 155,000 residential and commercial video subscribers. The video sub declines were primarily driven by losses in analog Single Play video customers.
As a result of the video subscriber losses, total Primary Service Units declined by 17,000 for the quarter. The good news, however, is that year-over-year video sub performance and in turn, total PSU performance, did improve in each month of the quarter. August was better than July and September was better than August. So far in the fourth quarter, subscriber performance is looking better than in the third quarter. In fact, we've already added more voice customers in Q4 than we did in all of Q3. Overall though, PSU net adds continued to be below year ago levels. 
For the quarter, video and voice gross connects were down versus last year's third quarter while HSD connects were actually up year-over-year. Churn was flat to down year-over-year in each PSU category. Especially given the absence of new occupied homes to sell to, we continue to focus on migrating customers into bundles. As a result, we added 15,000 double play customers and 14,000 triple play customers. At quarter end, over 59% of our customers took more than one PSU, with more than a quarter of our subscribers taking all three PSUs. 
Turning to our financial results, let's start with revenues on the next slide. Third quarter revenues increased 5.2% year-over-year to $4.7 billion. Total subscription revenues, residential and commercial combined, grew 4.5%, driven by increased subscribers and a roughly 6% increase in subscription ARPU per customer relationship. Advertising revenues increased 22.5%. In dollar terms, total revenues were $236 million higher than in Q3 '09, with $144 million of that growth coming from our Residential Subscription business, $51 million coming from Commercial and $41 million coming from Advertising.
Let's focus on our Residential subscription revenues on Slide 7. Residential subscription revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year, driven by a healthy mix of price and volume increases. Residential HSD revenues were up 8.5% or $84 million from last year's third quarter, driven by sub growth, as well as a year-over-year increase of over 2% in Residential HSD ARPU. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year Residential HSD ARPU improvement as we benefited from price increases, and more subscribers taking premium tiers of service.
Residential video revenues increased $42 million, driven by price increases, and higher digital video and DVR revenues, partially offset by a decline in video subscribers and lower transactional VOD revenues. Our Movies On-Demand business grew 11.5% over last year's third quarter, reflecting increased buys and higher revenue per buy. But our overall transactional VOD revenues were way down by declines in adult and event revenues.
Residential video ARPU increased nearly 5% from Q3 '09. Residential voice revenues grew almost 4%, driven by subscriber growth, partially offset by a year-over-year ARPU decline of just over 2.5%, which was actually the smallest decline this year. On a sequential basis, residential voice ARPU was pretty much flat.
Now let's flip to Commercial revenues on the next slide. Commercial subscription revenue growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter to over 21.5%, remaining on pace to achieve the better than 20% full year commercial revenue growth that we discussed at the beginning of the year. The growth was balanced across Data, Business Class Phone and cell tower backhaul, with each contributing roughly 30% of the growth, the remainder came from video. Commercial data revenue increased almost 12.5%, driven by growth in shared Internet access, dedicated Internet access and Metro ethernet revenues. Business Class Phone revenues increased nearly 80%, driven by subscriber growth and cell tower backhaul revenues more than tripled versus Q3 '09.
Moving on to Advertising revenues. Our surge in ad sales business continued to drive a disproportionate share of our total revenue growth in the third quarter, rising 22.5% over last year. Advertising revenues per video subscriber increased about 27% to $5.89. The auto category accounted for a about a quarter of total ad sales and about a third of the year-over-year growth. The media 
and entertainment category contributed about 20% of the growth and political ad sales were responsible for roughly 15% of the growth. Year-to-date through the end of Q3, we've generated about $32 million of political ad dollars.
Through the first nine months of the year, our Advertising revenues have grown just over 22%. With continued strength in our core Advertising business, and the benefit of additional political spending, leading us to this week's elections, we're on pace to easily surpass our initial estimate of 15% growth for the full year.
Let's turn to adjusted OIBDA on Slide 10. Third quarter adjusted OIBDA grew 5.7% to $1.7 billion. Our margin improved 10 basis points year-over-year to 36.2%. Total third quarter operating expenses grew 5% compared to last year. Employee costs were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting higher headcount and compensation expenses, especially in our Commercial business, partially offset by lower pension expense. Programming expense increased only 3.5%. That's less than we had anticipated due to video sub losses and some items described in our press release which reduced year-over-year growth by about $20 million. Year-to-date programming costs have grown less than 5%, but we expect growth to accelerate in Q4 and full year programming costs growth should land in the 5.5% to 6% range. Third quarter programming cost per video subscriber increased 6.8% year-over-year.
Marketing expense of $156 million was higher than last year, but in line with the marketing spend over the last few quarters. Voice costs were up 4% due to growth in digital phone subscribers. As we previewed earlier in the year, we have begun the process of in-sourcing various voice support functions. We expected that about half of our voice subs will be migrated by the end of next year, with the balance moving over the following three years. The financial benefits of this move will begin to show up next year and over time, should be pretty meaningful. We continued to invest in our Wireless business during Q3, incurring about $15 million of wireless losses which reduced our adjusted OIBDA growth by almost a full percentage point and our margin by roughly 30 basis points. We are still expecting full year Wireless losses in the $50 million zone.
You'll recall that restructuring is excluded from adjusted OIBDA. Restructuring costs were $44 million through September 30, year-to-date and we anticipate another $15 million or so in the fourth quarter. Based on our year-to-date performance and our outlook for Q4, including higher year-over-year programming, bad debt and casualty insurance expense growth, and larger Wireless losses, we now expect the full year adjusted OIBDA growth will come in around 6%.
Turning to capital spending on Slide 11. Capital intensely declined for the fourth consecutive quarter, as third quarter CapEx came in at $676 million or 14.3% of revenues. Third quarter residential capital expenditures were down more than 15% year-over-year to $563 million, driven by declines in scalable infrastructure, CPE and support capital. Once again, in the quarter, we continued to invest more in our fast growing Commercial business. Commercial CapEx was $113 million, up about 24%, with about half the growth attributable to expanding our cell tower backhaul footprint. Through the first nine months of the year, CapEx was $2.1 billion or 15.3% of revenues, down from over 17% of revenues in the first nine months of 2009. As usual, we expect Q4 will be the highest CapEx quarter of the year. But we're very comfortable that capital expenditures for the full year will be less than $3 billion.
On to cash flow on the next slide. Adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditures for the third quarter was $1 billion, resulting in adjusted OIBDA less CapEx of nearly $3 billion for the first nine months of 2010, a nearly 20% year-over-year increase. Given our year-to-date performance, we continued to expect our full year adjusted OIBDA less CapEx will increase around 20% over 2009. Free cash flow for the quarter was $396 million, driving our nine month free cash flow to $1.6 billion or $4.50 per diluted share. Free cash flow was 8% higher than in the first nine months of 2009 as higher adjusted OIBDA less CapEx and lower pension contributions more than compensated for a jump in cash taxes of $333 million and an increase in cash interest of $159 million.
As you model Q4 free cash flow, remember that the recent Small Business Jobs Act extended bonus depreciation retroactive to the beginning of this year. That should reduce to zero, our fourth quarter Federal estimated tax payment. I'd also point out that we may make additional pension contributions in the fourth quarter.
Turning to the next slide. Diluted earnings per share were $1, an all-time high for Time Warner Cable since becoming a public company and 32% higher than the last year's third quarter. Through the first three quarters, diluted EPS was $2.55, up 19% over the same period last year. Given our EPS performance through the first nine months, we now expect to exceed the high end of the $3.25 to $3.50 per share range that we provided at the beginning of this year.
Finally, moving to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our net debt and preferred equity totaled $20.5 billion, a reduction of $1.1 billion from year-end 2009 despite our having paid out $432 million in regular dividends. Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 2.99x. 
Just yesterday, we entered into a new three-year $4 billion revolving credit facility which replaced the $5.875 billion facility that was set to mature in February 2011. We provide more information about the new facility in our 10-Q, but suffice it to say that we're very pleased with the terms. We now have no debt maturities until 2012.
So with that said, let me quickly summarize. We delivered another quarter of solid financial results, with accelerating commercial and advertising revenue growth, as well as stable residential revenue growth. Our free cash flow continued to grow at a healthy pace despite higher cash taxes and interest payments. As a result, we continued to reduce our leverage and create greater financial capacity, enabling us to launch our $4 billion share repurchase program. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Landel.

862598,113694924,85367,"Time Warner Cable Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Time Warner Cable Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good morning. From an operational perspective, we're performing well in all areas of our business, residential, commercial and advertising. Over the next few minutes, I'll share with you some of the progress we're making in each of these",1728,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning. From an operational perspective, we're performing well in all areas of our business, residential, commercial and advertising. Over the next few minutes, I'll share with you some of the progress we're making in each of these areas. 
We'll start with Residential. On the competitive front, the telephone companies continued to expand their number of homes passed, although in our footprint, the rate of increase, similar to last quarter, has continued to slow. We estimate that at the end of September, AT&T's U-verse product was available to approximately 23% of our homes passed, up from 22% a quarter earlier. Verizon FiOS offering continued to be available to about 10% of our passings. The competitive intensity in Q3 was about the same or slightly more aggressive than in the second quarter.
On the video side of the business, we continued to see very little expansion of multichannel video homes on an industry-wide basis. This is consistent with the ongoing weakness in the macroeconomic environment. Our third quarter video losses were driven primarily by lower connects. In particular, we have under indexed in low-end segments. Most of these households appeared to be going to satellite or leaving the pay TV category entirely. We also saw some increase in disconnects among subscribers who signed up during last year's over the year digital TV transition. By and large, similar to what we saw on the connect side, these subs win our two lowest value segments. On the other hand, we've been performing well in high-end, high-ARPU segments. And by the way, we haven't been able to identify any increase in video cord cutting related to over-the-top video. 
A couple of examples. First, as Rob mentioned, our video losses in the quarter were driven by Single Play video customers. And second, our video high-speed data Double Plays actually increased in the quarter. That's the opposite of what we'd expect to see of the remaining for cord cutting. And another example, we look at college towns like Austin, Texas and Columbus, Ohio in our footprint to examine the pieces that video cord cutting among students might have contributed to weaker connect volume this quarter. It turns out that college enrollment is flat this year compared to last and our video connect volumes were also flat. So we'll continue to monitor cord cutting but haven't found evidence where we might expect to see it.
Turning to broadband. We continued to compete very well in Q3. AT&T's promotional pricing of its six megabit per second DSL service at $19.95 a month appears to have reduced the exodus of DSL subs. However, on a footprint-adjusted basis, our 104,000 broadband net additions were around 50% higher than the two big telcos, demonstrating that we continued to take share in Q3. In voice, we continued to take share from the telcos in Q3 albeit at a slower rate than we would like. We recently have adjusted Triple Play bundled marketing and pricing in our East region to good effect. We actually seen year-over-year improvement in digital phone net adds in recent weeks.
With that as a backdrop, let me highlight several initiatives that we expect to further enhance the competitiveness of our products. First, I'd be remiss if I didn't update you on our high definition product. As we indicated last quarter, we completed the implementation of video switching in New York City, and as a result, we now have 156 HD channels in the city. Nationwide, our weighted average is now over 110. This demonstrates the ability of our infrastructure in meeting customer's needs. We've lost Remote DVR Manager across our footprint and it's now available to more than 3 million DVRs. And this week, there's a lot of excitement around our mobile Internet product as we launched our combined 4G/3G wireless service in New York City. It delivers speeds up to six megabits per second, 5x faster than 3G, making it one of the fastest mobile broadband networks available. With our wireline Time Warner cable Internet, mobile Internet and Wi-Fi offerings, our customers in New York City will now have three different ways to access our broadband service with varying degrees of speed and mobility, making it the most complete and flexible broadband offering.
In conjunction with our recent mobile Internet launch, we are offering new packages, including a tier that provides 250 megabytes per month on our for the 4G/3G network for under $20 when bundled with our wireline service. In the coming months, availability of the service will expand further as we launch in Cleveland in early December and LA just after year end. In voice, we've launched VoiceZone in nearly our entire footprint including, as of a couple of weeks ago, New York City. VoiceZone is a web portal where subscribers can manage their home voicemail and phone features anywhere, anytime. It enables them to receive their voicemail as an e-mail attachment and has a number of innovative features including caller ID on the PC. 
In Charlotte, we've been very pleased with our signature home, a new bundled offering targeted at our high-end ARPU segments who want all of our best-in-class products and who demand a more personalized service experience. We're seeing a nice ARPU uplift of upgrading customers and we also are pleasantly surprised that substantial amount of the incremental revenue is coming from customers new to Time Warner Cable. The offering looks like a real winner and you can expect to see it arrive in much of our footprint including New York City in the coming weeks.
In the more value- and budget-oriented segments, we've heard loud and clear that customers would like more flexibility in video packaging, particularly in the availability of smaller packages. I want to tease you a bit here because we're not quite ready to make the announcement, but you can expect to see us introduce a video offering that is targeted at more value and budget-oriented segments in the very near future. 
Turning now to Commercial. In the SMB market, Time Warner Cable competes primarily with ILECs. In some cases, telcos are increasing DSL speeds to compete against our broadband speeds. In other cases, they're offering a low-price promotion to attract customers, but AT&T and Verizon are also incenting businesses to incorporate national wireless voice and data plans as a way to differentiate their bundles from cable. In the midmarket, Time Warner Cable offers a variety of voice and data products across metro networks that compete with both ILECs and CLECs. The telcos are now paying greater attention to protecting this installed base, had introduced their more complex enterprise-class products into the midmarket. In this competitive environment, we're very comfortable with our ability to compete and grow rapidly in both the SMB and midmarket.
On the product front, we've done a very good job in the past two years in building out a comprehensive Internet and phone solution set for small and medium businesses. This quarter, we filled a long-standing need to update our video solution for the hospitality vertical. Our new HD video for hospitality product enables us to deliver a consistent HD video and music lineup across our footprint while maintaining compatibility with a variety of interactive service providers in the space including Loginet. The service are delivered over either fiber or coax and is targeted initially at hotels with room counts above 100. In cell tower backhaul, we continued to do very well. We installed service to almost 500 radios in the third quarter to raise the total installed base to more than 5,000. In addition, we have contracts on a large number of radios that will keep our installation crews busy well into 2011.
Turning next to Advertising. As Rob indicated, we're having a terrific year in Advertising. Revenues are up 22% in the first nine months of the year and we're seeing strength in almost every category. Core Advertising growth, which excludes political, was very strong in Q3, posting growth at 20% year-over-year. I'd remind you that the strong political year we're experiencing currently won't repeat in 2011. Certainly, our strong performance reflects broader industry trends and the midterm elections. However, it also results from investments we made during the recent downturn and building new relationships and growing categories as well as improved execution. 
One area in which we're just now beginning to see the fruits of our labors is the use of data. We now have access to and are using anonymized data from set-tops to help advertisers make better decisions about where to place their spots. All of this data is collected and presented in a way that completely protects the privacy of individual subscribers. It's early doing, but I'm pleased to report that our Advertising customers are very excited about the new capability, and frankly we are, too.
With the industry nearing its objective of 25 million EBIF enabled households by year-end, Canoe is closer to its goal of a truly national ITV solution. Six cable networks are planning to employ its request for information capability in the coming months. We continue to be enthusiastic about the value that Canoe can unlock.
Before I conclude, let me say a few words on our identity refresh. You're probably aware that following our spinoff from Time Warner, we considered changing the name of the company. However, after conducting brand research, we recognized there's great value in both the name Time Warner Cable and our pioneer symbol. As a result, we've decided to keep them both. Although we've refreshed and updated the logo, fonts and colors, you'll start to see it over time in all of our communications, especially as you may have may seen it this morning in Rob's presentation slides or when you visited our website for the conference call. But please be assured that we're not buying hundreds and millions of dollars in media and rewrapping all of our trucks overnight. We'll do most of this in the normal course of business and you won't see a huge bulge on our marketing budget.
So in summary, we have performed well, in Residential, Commercial and Ad sales in the third quarter. We're adding some terrific new capabilities to our products which we expect to further enhance our competitiveness. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call.

The drivers of that -- let me go through them because they're all cost driven and they're all or at least several of them are kind of one-time in nature. Let's start with bad debt. You may remember that in 2009, with the economy being what it was, we actually increased our allowance for doubtful accounts. As we closed out 2009, we took a fresh look at that number and actually reversed it. So we have a tough year-over-year comparison on the bad debt front which won't repeat itself. Programming costs, we've talked about this before, but we expect the growth in -- it'll be the first full quarter under our new Disney deal. So that has an impact on programming costs. On casualty insurance, which is another kind of comparison issue, again, we had an adjustment in Q4 of '09 that will cause that to be a tough comparison, again, shouldn't repeat itself. And the last element is that we'll continue to spend on our Wireless business and a lot of the spend is back loaded, so we'll have more spending in Q4 than we did in the other quarters of the year. So I'm not sure I would draw any conclusions about growing forward margins from that.

I've been talking about that for a long time. So we have sought in our programming negotiations which are ongoing with all sorts of people to get more flexibility around that. Obviously, going the other way, in the Programming business, their cost tend to be somewhat fixed so if they're facing smaller audiences and/or a smaller subscription, that's a big problem for them. So it's natural for those companies to resist. So there's a balance in this and I would just leave it to say, we have negotiated some additional flexibility beyond what we had a few years ago that will allow us to begin to offer some smaller packages or lower prices. Probably not all the way where we would like to be, but we're moving in the right direction.

There's a lot of functionality that is coming to the product that hasn't existed to the set-top box before. And with devices like tablets, you create the ability to search in a way that's never been available on the set-top as well. So I'm wondering how far away are we from being able to integrate all that to the television set? Because a lot of this stuff today sort of has the -- sort of a PC product, maybe a mobile product and a television product, it seems like the big win and maybe I'm wrong. Disagree with me if you want, but the big win could be for the industry to bring all this to the television, it adds a whole level of interactibility and customization that hasn't been there before. So how far away are we from that? Do you think that's where we're headed?

And I'll try to give you a short answer because I could talk about this for the whole rest of the time. But there's obviously a lot of new product introduction both from the CE industry and from what used to be the IT industry and sometimes they look the same. And what we need to do is make sure that our services on all the devices take advantage of the functionality. So I mentioned the idea of using an iPad as a remote which we've been working on for a while. There's a clip on YouTube that shows a demo of an early prototype. You are starting to see in the market and I think you're going to see much more robust way TV sets that directly offer IP connectivity. And as I said in my remarks, we want to create the infrastructure so that our video services can be delivered directly to those TV sets in the home. That's not really so dramatic, it's just like going from analog to digital, et cetera. Those TVs to the extent they start having more intelligence, and the first ones may not have a browser, but the later ones will. I think we'll be able to display a lot more interesting program interfaces, user interfaces. Some of that software may be moved back into the network instead of the DS device. But all of this means that consumers are going to get better experience and I think over time, without set-tops, which is an interesting factor also. So that's my attempt at a fairly short answer.

Simple reason we have set-tops is that the consumer electronics devices in general are not capable of displaying all of our services without a set-top. So by and large, the consumer electronics devices are not too way capable. They can't do VOD, they can't do program guides, they can't un-encrypt encrypted services, so there's a piracy issue. Obviously, some of the SEC rules on cable cards have attempted to deal with the encryption problem. But we would be delighted to not have set-top boxes. The thing I left out, too, is the hard drive DVR is in the set-tops. I think the world we're going to -- we spent a lot of time with the big consumer electronics companies, the way we're going to is one where these devices will be more intelligent and more easily networked, so that we can envision a world with at least where people buy new TVs, where we might not have to set-tops. I think it may move to a gateway device because the old TVs will live for a very long time, so we'll need some sort of interface and some place for the hard drive. Quite frankly, moving the DVR functionality back into the network which we pioneered with Maestro and Cablevision has been working on, that's a better engineering solution. But given the stance of the company right owners, it might not be one that we can do on a widespread basis quickly. And so that's a little bit confused, but I think you're going to see, over time, fewer set-tops, lower CPE spending. And hopefully more of the intelligence move back into the network, as well as into a consumer home device. And by the way, this will all result in a much better consumer experience which is what we should really be focused on.

862598,113694924,85486,"Time Warner Cable Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Time Warner Cable Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a good third quarter, in which we grew revenues and adjusted OIBDA roughly 5% and 6%, respectively. ARPU growth was strong. In fact, total ARPU per customer relationship increased almost 7%. Our Commercial S",800,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a good third quarter, in which we grew revenues and adjusted OIBDA roughly 5% and 6%, respectively. ARPU growth was strong. In fact, total ARPU per customer relationship increased almost 7%. Our Commercial Services and Advertising businesses continued to accelerate with year-over-year revenue growth rates of approximately 22% and 23%, respectively. 
Consistent with our comments during the quarter, subscriber net adds grew weaker than we've seen before. These results reflect the weak economy, with continuing high rates of unemployment and housing vacancies, as well as a very competitive marketplace. The impact wasn't uniform. Some services fared better than others. Our high speed data product performed the best on a relative basis and our customers continued to choose faster speeds. 
In terms of the bottom line, we generated $1 of EPS in the quarter for the first time since becoming a public company. And through the first nine months of the year, we have generated more than $1.6 billion of free cash flow.
When we went public three and a half years ago, we had set out to build a company that is consistent, transparent and shareholder-friendly. We followed through in a series of steps, starting with our separation from Time Warner Inc. and our payment of a $10.9 billion special dividend. Since then, we've been steadfastly committed to a leverage target of 3.25x adjusted OIBDA and we've been consistent in our public statements that as we delevered below 3.25x, we would return capital to our shareholders. In keeping with this strategy, we announced regular dividend this last January with the yield at announcement of 3.7%. Despite strong appreciation of our stock price in the intervening nine months, our yield remains well above our cable and satellite peers.
As a result of our continuing progress, we're now positioned to return even more capital to our shareholders. This morning, we announced that our board has authorized a $4 billion share repurchase program. This repurchase program, in conjunction with our regular dividend, once again reflects our confidence in the strength and stability of the company's free cash flows. 
In operations, we are redoubling our focus on the customer experience to further improve our competitive position. A number of very exciting products and services that have been in the incubation process are now poised for release. These new capabilities support our 4 Anys framework, that is the notion that our customers want access to any content, anytime, anywhere and on any device.
Consistent with the anywhere and anytime aspects, we have launched our Remote DVR Manager to much of our footprint including New York City and whole home DVRs available in some systems and will be broadly available by year-end. We're proud to be the first multichannel provider to offer ESPN to our customers via TV Everywhere capability. Last week, we debuted authenticated access to ESPN3 and the ESPN linear feed for customers who subscribe to a video tier that includes ESPN. In the near future, we plan to offer access to ESPN2, ESPNU and the new ESPN goal line and the ESPN Buzzer Beater through the same process. This gives our customers an unprecedented level of access from multiple locations and devices to great live sports content. We plan to add more content from a wide range of networks to our TV Everywhere capability in the near future.
In addition, we are on the cusp of harnessing the power of consumer electronics products in the home. In the not-too-distant future, our customers will have the opportunity to use their iPad as a remote control. And we're working on infrastructure that could enable customers to enjoy our entire video product on any IP-connected device in the home. 
On a different front, we've been very pleased with our signature home offering in Charlotte. Signature home is a feature-rich, triple-play offering targeted at high ARPU customers who want all of our best-in-class products and who demand a much more personalized service experience. It's been rolled out across much of our footprint in the coming weeks. In addition, we're planning to complement this high-end suite of services with a budget-oriented video offering, consistent with our belief that some customers would like a smaller package.
In summary, the company is doing well. We're introducing important new offerings that we think will give our customers control in ways that are simple and easy. We are performing well financially despite the economic and competitive climate, and our efforts are paying off in the generation of strong free cash flow. And all of this makes it possible for us to return a large amount of capital to our shareholders through regular dividends and the share repurchase program that we announced this morning.
Next, Rob will give you additional details on our financial performance."

As usual, I'll start with the third quarter highlights on Slide 3. Third quarter revenues grew over 5% year-over-year as residential subscription revenues increased 3.5% and Commercial and Advertising revenues each jumped about 22%. Despite the tough economic and competitive climate which negatively affected subscriber growth in the quarter, our ARPU per customer relationship rose 6.6% year-over-year to more than $109. 
Adjusted OIBDA grew almost 6% in the quarter, reflecting our strong revenue growth and improved margins. Through the first nine months of the year, adjusted OIBDA less CapEx increased almost 20% and free cash flow was up over 8%. EPS of $1 marked a record since becoming a public company. With three quarters of the year behind us, we are on track to meet or exceed all of the elements of our full year guidance. I'll provide some updates on the guidance as I walk through the financials. And last but certainly not least, as Glen discussed, we are very pleased that our board has authorized a $4 billion share repurchase program.
Before we review our operating results, let's turn to Slide 4 so I can provide some color on the share repurchase plan. As we've been saying, since our separation from Time Warner, our target leverage ratio is 3.25x. At quarter end, we were just under 3x and going forward, our strong free cash flow and OIBDA growth would reduce our leverage even further absent additional returns of capital to shareholders. So in the interest of managing to our leverage target, we are initiating a $4 billion share repurchase program to complement our regular dividends. We showed you a chart like the one on Slide 4 about nine months ago when we announced the initiation of our regular dividend. At that time, we pointed out that our initial dividend yield of 3.7% was much higher than the average dividend of dividend-paying S&P 500 companies, and was among the highest yields of companies initiating a dividend in the last five years. Similarly, as the chart shows, our buyback authorization is large. At $4 billion, the program provides us the capacity to repurchase up to almost 20% of our total market Cap at today's stock price. That's higher than our peers and larger than nearly 95% of the more than 600 share repurchase authorizations announced in the first nine months of this year. We're not announcing a timeframe for completing the repurchase program as the timing of our purchases will be dictated by market conditions, as well as other factors. We'll obviously be reporting our monthly share repurchase activity each quarter and that will provide you a good indicator of the pace at which we're buying.
So getting back to Q3 performance, let's look first at our Subscriber results. During the quarter, we continued to grow our high-speed data subscribers and take share from the telcos. We increased total HSD subs by 104,000 bringing our total HSD subscriber base to over 9.7 million, a 5.9% year-over-year increase. At quarter end, 35.6% of homes passed took our HSD products. We also continued to see a shift in the mix of our residential HSD subscriber base to our higher-speed tiers. Customers taking our Turbo offering increased by 123,000, and subscribers taking our Wideband or DOCSIS 3.0 tier grew by 4,000. About 13% of our residential HSD subscribers now take either the Turbo or DOCSIS 3.0 product. Commercial HSD net adds more than doubled year-over-year to 9,000. We added 34,000 Residential and Commercial digital phone customers during the quarter, bringing our total voice subscriber count to over 4.4 million, approximately 16.5% of homes passed and a 7% increase from the end of Q3 '09.
We added 12,000 Business Class Phone customers in the quarter for a total of 102,000, an increase of more than 75% since the end of Q3 '09. As we stated during the quarter, our video subscriber performance in particular was negatively affected by the challenging competitive and economic environment, and in particular, high unemployment, high housing vacancy rates and anemic new home formation. For the quarter, we lost 155,000 residential and commercial video subscribers. The video sub declines were primarily driven by losses in analog Single Play video customers.
As a result of the video subscriber losses, total Primary Service Units declined by 17,000 for the quarter. The good news, however, is that year-over-year video sub performance and in turn, total PSU performance, did improve in each month of the quarter. August was better than July and September was better than August. So far in the fourth quarter, subscriber performance is looking better than in the third quarter. In fact, we've already added more voice customers in Q4 than we did in all of Q3. Overall though, PSU net adds continued to be below year ago levels. 
For the quarter, video and voice gross connects were down versus last year's third quarter while HSD connects were actually up year-over-year. Churn was flat to down year-over-year in each PSU category. Especially given the absence of new occupied homes to sell to, we continue to focus on migrating customers into bundles. As a result, we added 15,000 double play customers and 14,000 triple play customers. At quarter end, over 59% of our customers took more than one PSU, with more than a quarter of our subscribers taking all three PSUs. 
Turning to our financial results, let's start with revenues on the next slide. Third quarter revenues increased 5.2% year-over-year to $4.7 billion. Total subscription revenues, residential and commercial combined, grew 4.5%, driven by increased subscribers and a roughly 6% increase in subscription ARPU per customer relationship. Advertising revenues increased 22.5%. In dollar terms, total revenues were $236 million higher than in Q3 '09, with $144 million of that growth coming from our Residential Subscription business, $51 million coming from Commercial and $41 million coming from Advertising.
Let's focus on our Residential subscription revenues on Slide 7. Residential subscription revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year, driven by a healthy mix of price and volume increases. Residential HSD revenues were up 8.5% or $84 million from last year's third quarter, driven by sub growth, as well as a year-over-year increase of over 2% in Residential HSD ARPU. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year Residential HSD ARPU improvement as we benefited from price increases, and more subscribers taking premium tiers of service.
Residential video revenues increased $42 million, driven by price increases, and higher digital video and DVR revenues, partially offset by a decline in video subscribers and lower transactional VOD revenues. Our Movies On-Demand business grew 11.5% over last year's third quarter, reflecting increased buys and higher revenue per buy. But our overall transactional VOD revenues were way down by declines in adult and event revenues.
Residential video ARPU increased nearly 5% from Q3 '09. Residential voice revenues grew almost 4%, driven by subscriber growth, partially offset by a year-over-year ARPU decline of just over 2.5%, which was actually the smallest decline this year. On a sequential basis, residential voice ARPU was pretty much flat.
Now let's flip to Commercial revenues on the next slide. Commercial subscription revenue growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter to over 21.5%, remaining on pace to achieve the better than 20% full year commercial revenue growth that we discussed at the beginning of the year. The growth was balanced across Data, Business Class Phone and cell tower backhaul, with each contributing roughly 30% of the growth, the remainder came from video. Commercial data revenue increased almost 12.5%, driven by growth in shared Internet access, dedicated Internet access and Metro ethernet revenues. Business Class Phone revenues increased nearly 80%, driven by subscriber growth and cell tower backhaul revenues more than tripled versus Q3 '09.
Moving on to Advertising revenues. Our surge in ad sales business continued to drive a disproportionate share of our total revenue growth in the third quarter, rising 22.5% over last year. Advertising revenues per video subscriber increased about 27% to $5.89. The auto category accounted for a about a quarter of total ad sales and about a third of the year-over-year growth. The media and entertainment category contributed about 20% of the growth and political ad sales were responsible for roughly 15% of the growth. Year-to-date through the end of Q3, we've generated about $32 million of political ad dollars.
Through the first nine months of the year, our Advertising revenues have grown just over 22%. With continued strength in our core Advertising business, and the benefit of additional political spending, leading up to this week's elections, we're on pace to easily surpass our initial estimate of 15% growth for the full year.
Let's turn to adjusted OIBDA on Slide 10. Third quarter adjusted OIBDA grew 5.7% to $1.7 billion. Our margin improved 10 basis points year-over-year to 36.2%. Total third quarter operating expenses grew 5% compared to last year. Employee costs were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting higher headcount and compensation expenses, especially in our Commercial business, partially offset by lower pension expense. Programming expense increased only 3.5%. That's less than we had anticipated due to video sub losses and some items described in our press release which reduced year-over-year growth by about $20 million. Year-to-date programming costs have grown less than 5%, but we expect growth to accelerate in Q4 and full year programming costs growth should land in the 5.5% to 6% range. Third quarter programming cost per video subscriber increased 6.8% year-over-year.
Marketing expense of $156 million was higher than last year, but in line with the marketing spend over the last few quarters. Voice costs were up 4% due to growth in digital phone subscribers. As we previewed earlier in the year, we have begun the process of in-sourcing various voice support functions. We expected that about half of our voice subs will be migrated by the end of next year, with the balance moving over the following three years. The financial benefits of this move will begin to show up next year and over time, should be pretty meaningful. We continued to invest in our Wireless business during Q3, incurring about $15 million of wireless losses which reduced our adjusted OIBDA growth by almost a full percentage point and our margin by roughly 30 basis points. We are still expecting full year Wireless losses in the $50 million zone.
You'll recall that restructuring is excluded from adjusted OIBDA. Restructuring costs were $44 million through September 30, year-to-date and we anticipate another $15 million or so in the fourth quarter. Based on our year-to-date performance and our outlook for Q4, including higher year-over-year programming, bad debt and casualty insurance expense growth, and larger Wireless losses, we now expect the full year adjusted OIBDA growth will come in around 6%.
Turning to capital spending on Slide 11. Capital intensely declined for the fourth consecutive quarter, as third quarter CapEx came in at $676 million or 14.3% of revenues. Third quarter residential capital expenditures were down more than 15% year-over-year to $563 million, driven by declines in scalable infrastructure, CPE and support capital. Once again, in the quarter, we continued to invest more in our fast growing Commercial business. Commercial CapEx was $113 million, up about 24%, with about half the growth attributable to expanding our cell tower backhaul footprint. Through the first nine months of the year, CapEx was $2.1 billion or 15.3% of revenues, down from over 17% of revenues in the first nine months of 2009. As usual, we expect Q4 will be the highest CapEx quarter of the year. But we're very comfortable that capital expenditures for the full year will be less than $3 billion.
On to cash flow on the next slide. Adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditures for the third quarter was $1 billion, resulting in adjusted OIBDA less CapEx of nearly $3 billion for the first nine months of 2010, a nearly 20% year-over-year increase. Given our year-to-date performance, we continued to expect our full year adjusted OIBDA less CapEx will increase around 20% over 2009. Free cash flow for the quarter was $396 million, driving our nine month free cash flow to $1.6 billion or $4.50 per diluted share. Free cash flow was 8% higher than in the first nine months of 2009 as higher adjusted OIBDA less CapEx and lower pension contributions more than compensated for a jump in cash taxes of $333 million and an increase in cash interest of $159 million.
As you model Q4 free cash flow, remember that the recent Small Business Jobs Act extended bonus depreciation retroactive to the beginning of this year. That should reduce to zero, our fourth quarter Federal estimated tax payment. I'd also point out that we may make additional pension contributions in the fourth quarter.
Turning to the next slide. Diluted earnings per share were $1, an all-time high for Time Warner Cable since becoming a public company and 32% higher than the last year's third quarter. Through the first three quarters, diluted EPS was $2.55, up 19% over the same period last year. Given our EPS performance through the first nine months, we now expect to exceed the high end of the $3.25 to $3.50 per share range that we provided at the beginning of this year.
Finally, moving to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our net debt and preferred equity totaled $20.5 billion, a reduction of $1.1 billion from year-end 2009 despite our having paid out $432 million in regular dividends. Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 2.99x. 
Just yesterday, we entered into a new three-year $4 billion revolving credit facility which replaced the $5.875 billion facility that was set to mature in February 2011. We provide more information about the new facility in our 10-Q, but suffice it to say that we're very pleased with the terms. We now have no debt maturities until 2012.
So with that said, let me quickly summarize. We delivered another quarter of solid financial results, with accelerating commercial and advertising revenue growth, as well as stable residential revenue growth. Our free cash flow continued to grow at a healthy pace despite higher cash taxes and interest payments. As a result, we continued to reduce our leverage and create greater financial capacity, enabling us to launch our $4 billion share repurchase program. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Landel."

From an operational perspective, we're performing well in all areas of our business, residential, commercial and advertising. Over the next few minutes, I'll share with you some of the progress we're making in each of these",1727,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning. From an operational perspective, we're performing well in all areas of our business, residential, commercial and advertising. Over the next few minutes, I'll share with you some of the progress we're making in each of these areas. 
We'll start with Residential. On the competitive front, the telephone companies continued to expand their number of homes passed, although in our footprint, the rate of increase, similar to last quarter, has continued to slow. We estimate that at the end of September, AT&T's U-verse product was available to approximately 23% of our homes passed, up from 22% a quarter earlier. Verizon FiOS offering continued to be available to about 10% of our passings. The competitive intensity in Q3 was about the same or slightly more aggressive than in the second quarter.
On the video side of the business, we continued to see very little expansion of multichannel video homes on an industry-wide basis. This is consistent with the ongoing weakness in the macroeconomic environment. Our third quarter video losses were driven primarily by lower connects. In particular, we have under indexed in low-end segments. Most of these households appeared to be going to satellite or leaving the pay TV category entirely. We also saw some increase in disconnects among subscribers who signed up during last year's over the year digital TV transition. By and large, similar to what we saw on the connect side, these subs win our two lowest value segments. On the other hand, we've been performing well in high-end, high-ARPU segments. And by the way, we haven't been able to identify any increase in video cord cutting related to over-the-top video. 
A couple of examples. First, as Rob mentioned, our video losses in the quarter were driven by Single Play video customers. And second, our video high-speed data Double Plays actually increased in the quarter. That's the opposite of what we'd expect to see if there were meaningful cord cutting. And another example, we look at college towns like Austin, Texas and Columbus, Ohio in our footprint to examine the pieces that video cord cutting among students might have contributed to weaker connect volume this quarter. It turns out that college enrollment is flat this year compared to last and our video connect volumes were also flat. So we'll continue to monitor cord cutting but haven't found evidence where we might expect to see it.
Turning to broadband. We continued to compete very well in Q3. AT&T's promotional pricing of its six megabit per second DSL service at $19.95 a month appears to have reduced the exodus of DSL subs. However, on a footprint-adjusted basis, our 104,000 broadband net additions were around 50% higher than the two big telcos, demonstrating that we continued to take share in Q3. In voice, we continued to take share from the telcos in Q3 albeit a slower rate than we would like. We recently have adjusted Triple Play bundled marketing and pricing in our East region to good effect. We actually seen year-over-year improvement in digital phone net adds in recent weeks.
With that as a backdrop, let me highlight several initiatives that we expect to further enhance the competitiveness of our products. First, I'd be remiss if I didn't update you on our high definition product. As we indicated last quarter, we completed the implementation of video switching in New York City, and as a result, we now have 156 HD channels in the city. Nationwide, our weighted average is now over 110. This demonstrates the ability of our infrastructure in meeting customer's needs. We've launched Remote DVR Manager across our footprint and it's now available to more than 3 million DVRs. And this week, there's a lot of excitement around our mobile Internet product as we launched our combined 4G/3G wireless service in New York City. It delivers speeds up to six megabits per second, 5x faster than 3G, making it one of the fastest mobile broadband networks available. With our wireline Time Warner cable Internet, mobile Internet and Wi-Fi offerings, our customers in New York City will now have three different ways to access our broadband service with varying degrees of speed and mobility, making it the most complete and flexible broadband offering.
In conjunction with our recent mobile Internet launch, we are offering new packages, including a tier that provides 250 megabytes per month on our for the 4G/3G network for under $20 when bundled with our wireline service. In the coming months, availability of the service will expand further as we launch in Cleveland in early December and LA just after year end. In voice, we've launched VoiceZone in nearly our entire footprint including, as of a couple of weeks ago, New York City. VoiceZone is a web portal where subscribers can manage their home voicemail and phone features anywhere, anytime. It enables them to receive their voicemail as an e-mail attachment and has a number of innovative features including caller ID on the PC. 
In Charlotte, we've been very pleased with our signature home, a new bundled offering targeted at our high-end ARPU segments who want all of our best-in-class products and who demand a more personalized service experience. We're seeing a nice ARPU uplift of upgrading customers and we also are pleasantly surprised the substantial amount of the incremental revenue is coming from customers new to Time Warner Cable. The offering looks like a real winner and you can expect to see it arrive in much of our footprint including New York City in the coming weeks.
In the more value- and budget-oriented segments, we've heard loud and clear that customers would like more flexibility in video packaging, particularly in the availability of smaller packages. I want to tease you a bit here because we're not quite ready to make the announcement, but you can expect to see us introduce a video offering that is targeted at more value and budget-oriented segments in the very near future. 
Turning now to Commercial. In the SMB market, Time Warner Cable competes primarily with ILECs. In some cases, telcos are increasing DSL speeds to compete against our broadband speeds. In other cases, they're offering a low-price promotion to attract customers, but AT&T and Verizon are also incenting businesses to incorporate national wireless voice and data plans as a way to differentiate their bundles from cable. In the midmarket, Time Warner Cable offers a variety of voice and data products across metro networks that compete with both ILECs and CLECs. The telcos are now paying greater attention to protecting this installed base, had introduced their more complex enterprise-class products into the midmarket. In this competitive environment, we're very comfortable with our ability to compete and grow rapidly in both the SMB and midmarket.
On the product front, we've done a very good job in the past two years in building out our confidence in Internet and phone solution set for small and medium businesses. This quarter, we filled a long-standing need to update our video solution for the hospitality vertical. Our new HD video for hospitality product enables us to deliver a consistent HD video and music lineup across our footprint while maintaining compatibility with a variety of interactive service providers in the space including Loginet. The service is delivered over either fiber or coax and is targeted initially at hotels with room counts above 100. In cell tower backhaul, we continued to do very well. We installed service to almost 500 radios in the third quarter to raise the total installed base to more than 5,000. In addition, we have contracts on a large number of radios that will keep our installation crews busy well into 2011.
Turning next to Advertising. As Rob indicated, we're having a terrific year in Advertising. Revenues are up 22% in the first nine months of the year and we're seeing strength in almost every category. Core Advertising growth, which excludes political, was very strong in Q3, posting growth at 20% year-over-year. I'd remind you that the strong political year we're experiencing currently won't repeat in 2011. Certainly, our strong performance reflects broader industry trends and the midterm elections. However, it also results from investments we made during the recent downturn and building new relationships and growing categories as well as improved execution. 
One area in which we're just now beginning to see the fruits of our labors is the use of data. We now have access to and are using anonymized data from set-tops to help advertisers make better decisions about where to place their spots. All of this data is collected and presented in a way that completely protects the privacy of individual subscribers. It's early doing, but I'm pleased to report that our Advertising customers are very excited about the new capability, and frankly we are, too.
With the industry nearing its objective of 25 million EBIF enabled households by year-end, Canoe is closer to its goal of a truly national ITV solution. Six cable networks are planning to employ its request for information capability in the coming months. We continue to be enthusiastic about the value that Canoe can unlock.
Before I conclude, let me say a few words on our identity refresh. You're probably aware that following our spinoff from Time Warner, we considered changing the name of the company. However, after conducting brand research, we recognized there's great value in both the name Time Warner Cable and our pioneer symbol. As a result, we've decided to keep them both. Although we've refreshed and updated the logo, fonts and colors, you'll start to see it over time in all of our communications, especially as you may have seen it this morning in Rob's presentation slides or when you visited our website for the conference call. But please be assured that we're not buying hundreds and millions of dollars in media and rewrapping all of our trucks overnight. We'll do most of this in the normal course of business and you won't see a huge bulge on our marketing budget.
So in summary, we have performed well, in Residential, Commercial and Ad sales in the third quarter. We're adding some terrific new capabilities to our products which we expect to further enhance our competitiveness. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call."

The drivers of that -- let me go through them because they're all cost driven and they're all or at least several of them are kind of one-time in nature. Let's start with bad debt. You may remember that in 2009, with the economy being what it was, we actually increased our allowance for doubtful accounts. As we closed out 2009, we took a fresh look at that number and actually reversed it. So we have a tough year-over-year comparison on the bad debt front which oughtn’t repeat itself. Programming costs, we've talked about this before, but we expect the growth in -- it'll be the first full quarter under our new Disney deal. So that has an impact on programming costs. On casualty insurance, which is another kind of comparison issue, again, we had an adjustment in Q4 of '09 that will cause that to be a tough comparison, again, shouldn't repeat itself. And the last element is that we're continuing to spend on our Wireless business and a lot of the spend is back loaded, so we'll have more spending in Q4 than we did in the other quarters of the year. So I'm not sure I would draw any conclusions about growing forward margins from that."

I've been talking about that for a long time. So we have sought in our programming negotiations which are ongoing with all sorts of people to get more flexibility around that. Obviously, going the other way, in the Programming business, their costs tend to be somewhat fixed so if they're facing smaller audiences and/or a smaller subscription, that's a big problem for them. So it's natural for those companies to resist. So there's a balance in this and I would just leave it to say, we have negotiated some additional flexibility beyond what we had a few years ago that will allow us to begin to offer some smaller packages or lower prices. Probably not all the way where we would like to be, but we're moving in the right direction."

There's a lot of functionality that is coming to the product that hasn't existed to the set-top box before. And with devices like tablets, you create the ability to search in a way that's never been available on the set-top as well. So I'm wondering how far away are we from being able to integrate all that to the television set? Because a lot of this stuff today sort of has the -- sort of a PC product, maybe a mobile product and a television product, it seems like the big win and maybe I'm wrong. Disagree with me if you want, but the big win could be for the industry to bring all this to the television. It adds a whole level of interact ability and customization that hasn't been there before.

And I'll try to give you a short answer because I could talk about this for the whole rest of the time. But there's obviously a lot of new product introduction both from the CE industry and from what used to be the IT industry and sometimes they look the same. And what we need to do is make sure that our services on all the devices take advantage of the functionality. So I mentioned the idea of using an iPad as a remote which we've been working on for a while. There's a clip on YouTube that shows a demo of an early prototype. You are starting to see in the market and I think you're going to see much more robust way, TV sets that directly offer IP connectivity. And as I said in my remarks, we want to create the infrastructure so that our video services can be delivered directly to those TV sets in the home. That's not really so dramatic, it's just like going from analog to digital, et cetera. Those TVs to the extent they start having more intelligence, and the first ones may not have a browser, but the later ones will. I think we'll be able to display a lot more interesting program interfaces, user interfaces. Some of that software may be moved back into the network instead of the DS device. But all of this means that consumers are going to get better experience and I think over time, without set-tops, which is an interesting factor also. So that's my attempt at a fairly short answer."

The simple reason we have set-tops is that the consumer electronics devices in general are not capable of displaying all of our services without a set-top. So by and large, the consumer electronics devices are not two way capable. They can't do VOD, they can't do program guides, they can't un-encrypt encrypted services, so it's a piracy issue. Obviously, some of the SEC rules on cable cards have attempted to deal with the encryption problem. But we would be delighted to not have set-top boxes. The thing I left out, too, is the hard drive DVR is in the set-tops. I think the world we're going to -- we spent a lot of time with the big consumer electronics companies, the way we're going to is one where these devices will be more intelligent and more easily networked, so that we can envision a world with at least where people buy new TVs, where we might not have to set-tops. I think it may move to a gateway device because the old TVs will live for a very long time, so we'll need some sort of interface and some place for the hard drive. Quite frankly, moving the DVR functionality back into the network which we pioneered with Maestro and Cablevision has been working on, that's a better engineering solution. But given the stance of the company right owners, it might not be one that we can do on a widespread basis quickly. And so that's a little bit confused, but I think you're going to see, over time, fewer set-tops, lower CPE spending. And hopefully more of the intelligence move back into the network, as well as into a consumer home device. And by the way, this will all result in a much better consumer experience which is what we should really be focused on."

We had a good third quarter, in which we grew revenues and adjusted OIBDA roughly 5% and 6%, respectively. ARPU growth was strong. In fact, total ARPU per customer relationship increased almost 7%. Our Commercial",801," Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a good third quarter, in which we grew revenues and adjusted OIBDA roughly 5% and 6%, respectively. ARPU growth was strong. In fact, total ARPU per customer relationship increased almost 7%. Our Commercial Services and Advertising businesses continued to accelerate with year-over-year revenue growth rates of approximately 22% and 23%, respectively.
 Consistent with our comments during the quarter, subscriber net adds grew weaker than we've seen before. These results reflect the weak economy, with continuing high rates of unemployment and housing vacancies, as well as a very competitive marketplace. The impact wasn't uniform. Some services fared better than others. Our high speed data product performed the best on a relative basis and our customers continued to choose faster speeds.
 In terms of the bottom line, we generated $1 of EPS in the quarter for the first time since becoming a public company. And through the first nine months of the year, we have generated more than $1.6 billion of free cash flow.
 When we went public three and a half years ago, we had set out to build a company that is consistent, transparent and shareholder-friendly. We followed through in a series of steps, starting with our separation from Time Warner Inc. and our payment of a $10.9 billion special dividend. Since then, we've been steadfastly committed to a leverage target of 3.25x adjusted OIBDA and we've been consistent in our public statements that as we delevered below 3.25x, we would return capital to our shareholders. In keeping with this strategy, we announced regular dividend this last January with the yield at announcement of 3.7%. Despite strong appreciation of our stock price in the intervening nine months, our yield remains well above our cable and satellite years.
 As a result of our continuing progress, we're now positioned to return even more capital to our shareholders. This morning, we announced that our board has authorized a $4 billion share repurchase program. This repurchase program, in conjunction with our regular dividend, once again reflects our confidence in the strength and stability of the company's free cash flows.
 In operations, we are redoubling our focus on the customer experience to further improve our competitive position. A number of very exciting products and services that have been in the incubation process are now poised for release. These new capabilities support our 4 Anys framework, that is the notion that our customers want access to any content any time, anywhere and on any device.
 Consistent with the anywhere and anytime aspects, we have launched our Remote DVR Manager to much of our footprint including New York City and whole home DVRs available in some systems and will be broadly available by year-end. We're proud to be the first multichannel provider to offer ESPN to our customers via TV Everywhere capability. Last week, we debuted authenticated access to ESPN3 and the ESPN linear feed for customers who subscribe to a video tier that includes ESPN. In the near future, we plan to offer access to ESPN2, ESPNU and the new ESPN goal line and the ESPN Buzzer Beater through the same process. This gives our customers an unprecedented level of access from multiple locations and devices to great live sports content. We plan to add more content from a wide range of networks to our TV Everywhere capability in the near future.
 In addition, we are on the cusp of harnessing the power of consumer electronics products in the home. In the not-too-distant future, our customers will have the opportunity to use their iPad as a remote control. And we're working on infrastructure that could enable customers to enjoy our entire video product on any IP-connected device in the home.
 On a different front, we've been very pleased with our signature home offering in Charlotte. Signature home is a feature-rich, triple-play offering targeted at high ARPU customers who want all of our best-in-class products and who demand a much more personalized service experience. It's been rolled out across much of our footprint in the coming weeks. In addition, we're planning to complement this high-end suite of services with a budget-oriented video offering, consistent with our belief that some customers would like a smaller package.
 In summary, the company is doing well. We're introducing important new offerings that we think will give our customers control in ways that are simple and easy. We are performing well financially despite the economic and competitive climate, and our efforts are paying off in the generation of strong free cash flow. And all of these makes it possible for us to return a large amount of capital to our shareholders through regular dividends and the share repurchase program that we announced this morning.
 Next, Rob will give you additional details on our financial performance.

As usual, I'll start with the third quarter highlights on Slide 3. Third quarter revenues grew over 5% year-over-year as residential subscription revenues increased 3.5% and Commercial and Advertising revenues each jumped about 22%. Despite the tough economic and competitive climate which negatively affected subscriber growth in the quarter, our ARPU per customer relationship rose 6.6% year-over-year to more than $109.
 Adjusted OIBDA grew almost 6% in the quarter, reflecting our strong revenue growth and improved margins. Through the first nine months of the year, adjusted OIBDA less CapEx increased almost 20% and free cash flow was up over 8%. EPS of $1 marked a record since becoming a public company. With three quarters of the year behind us, we are on track to meet or exceed all of the elements of our full year guidance. I'll provide some updates on the guidance as I walk through the financials. And last but certainly not least, as Glen discussed, we are very pleased that our board has authorized a $4 billion share repurchase program.
 Before we review our operating results, let's turn to Slide 4 so I can provide some color on the share repurchase plan. As we've been saying, since our separation from Time Warner, our target leverage ratio is 3.25x. At quarter end, we were just under 3x and going forward, our strong free cash flow and OIBDA growth would reduce our leverage even further absent additional returns of capital to shareholders. So in the interest of managing to our leverage target, we are initiating a $4 billion share repurchase program to complement our regular dividend. We showed you a chart like the one on Slide 4 about nine months ago when we announced the initiation of our regular dividend. At that time, we pointed out that our initial dividend yield of 3.7% was much higher than the average dividend of dividend-paying S&P 500 companies, and was among the highest yields of companies initiating a dividend in the last five years. Similarly, as the chart shows, our buyback authorization is large. At $4 billion, the program provides us the capacity to repurchase up to almost 20% of our total market Cap at today's stock price. That's higher than our peers and larger than nearly 95% of the more than 600 share repurchase authorizations announced in the first nine months of this year. We're not announcing a timeframe for completing the repurchase program as the timing of our purchases will be dictated by market conditions, as well as other factors. We'll obviously be reporting our monthly share repurchase activity each quarter and that will provide you a good indicator of the pace of which we're buying.
 So getting back to Q3 performance, let's look first at our Subscriber results. During the quarter, we continued to grow our high-speed data subscribers and take share from the telcos. We increased total HSD subs by 104,000 bringing our total HSD subscriber base to over 9.7 million, a 5.9% year-over-year increase. At quarter end, 35.6% of homes passed took our HSD products. We also continued to see a shift in the mix of our residential HSD subscriber base to our higher-speed tiers. Customers taking our Turbo offering increased by 123,000, and subscribers taking our Wideband or DOCSIS 3.0 tier grew by 4,000. About 13% of our residential HSD subscribers now take either the Turbo or DOCSIS 3.0 product. Commercial HSD net adds more than doubled year-over-year to 9,000. We added 34,000 Residential and Commercial digital phone customers during the quarter, bringing our total voice subscriber count to over 4.4 million, approximately 16.5% of homes passed and a 7% increase from the end of Q3 '09.
 We added 12,000 Business Class Phone customers in the quarter for a total of 102,000, an increase of more than 75% since the end of Q3 '09. As we stated during the quarter, our video subscriber performance in particular was negatively affected by the challenging competitive and economic environment, and in particular, high unemployment, high housing vacancy rates and anemic new home information. For the quarter, we lost 155,000 residential and commercial video subscribers. The video sub declines were primarily driven by losses in analog Single Play video customers.
 As a result of the video subscriber losses, total Primary Service Units declined by 17,000 for the quarter. The good news, however, is that year-over-year video sub performance and in turn, total PSU performance, did improve in each month of the quarter. August was better than July and September was better than August. So far in the fourth quarter, subscriber performance is looking better than in the third quarter. In fact, we've already added more voice customers in Q4 than we did in all of Q3. Overall though, PSU net adds continued to be below year ago levels.
 For the quarter, video and voice gross connects were down versus last year's third quarter while HSD connects were actually up year-over-year. Churn was flat to down year-over-year in each PSU category. Especially given the absence of new occupied homes to sell to, we continue to focus on migrating customers into bundles. As a result, we added 15,000 double play customers and 14,000 triple play customers. At quarter end, over 59% of our customers took more than one PSU, with more than a quarter of our subscribers taking all three PSUs.
 Turning to our financial results, let's start with revenues on the next slide. Third quarter revenues increased 5.2% year-over-year to $4.7 billion. Total subscription revenues, residential and commercial combined, grew 4.5%, driven by increased subscribers and a roughly 6% increase in subscription ARPU per customer relationship. Advertising revenues increased 22.5%. In dollar terms, total revenues were $236 million higher than in Q3 '09, with $144 million of that growth coming from our Residential Subscription business, $51 million coming from Commercial and $41 million coming from Advertising.
 Let's focus on our Residential subscription revenues on Slide 7. Residential subscription revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year, driven by a healthy mix of price and volume increases. Residential HSD revenues were up 8.5% or $84 million from last year's third quarter, driven by sub growth, as well as a year-over-year increase of over 2% in Residential HSD ARPU. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year Residential HSD ARPU improvement as we benefited from price increases, and more subscribers taking premium tiers of service.
 Residential video revenues increased $42 million, driven by price increases, and higher digital video and DVR revenues, partially offset by a decline in video subscribers and lower transactional VOD revenues. Our Movies On-Demand business grew 11.5% over last year's third quarter, reflecting increased buys and higher revenue per buy. But our overall transactional VOD revenues were way down by declines in adult and event revenues.
 Residential video ARPU increased nearly 5% from Q3 '09. Residential voice revenues grew almost 4%, driven by subscriber growth, partially offset by a year-over-year ARPU decline of just over 2.5%, which was actually the smallest decline this year. On a sequential basis, residential voice ARPU was pretty much flat.
 Now let's flip to Commercial revenues on the next slide. Commercial subscription revenue growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter to over 21.5%, remaining on pace to achieve the better than 20% full year commercial revenue growth that we discussed at the beginning of the year. The growth was balanced across Data, Business Class Phone and cell tower backhaul, with each contributing roughly 30% of the growth, the remainder came from video. Commercial data revenue increased almost 12.5%, driven by growth in shared Internet access, dedicated Internet access and Metro ethernet revenues. Business Class Phone revenues increased nearly 80%, driven by subscriber growth and cell tower backhaul revenues more than tripled versus Q3 '09.
 Moving on to Advertising revenues. Our surge in ad sales business continued to drive a disproportionate share of our total revenue growth in the third quarter, rising 22.5% over last year. Advertising revenues per video subscriber increased about 27% to $5.89. The auto category accounted for a about a quarter of total ad sales and about a third of the year-over-year growth. The media
 and entertainment category contributed about 20% of the growth and political ad sales were responsible for roughly 15% of the growth. Year-to-date through the end of Q3, we've generated about $32 million of political ad dollars.
 Through the first nine months of the year, our Advertising revenues have grown just over 22%. With continued strength in our core Advertising business, and the benefit of additional political spending, leading us to this week's elections, we're on pace to easily surpass our initial estimate of 15% growth for the full year.
 Let's turn to adjusted OIBDA on Slide 10. Third quarter adjusted OIBDA grew 5.7% to $1.7 billion. Our margin improved 10 basis points year-over-year to 36.2%. Total third quarter operating expenses grew 5% compared to last year. Employee costs were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting higher headcount and compensation expenses, especially in our Commercial business, partially offset by lower pension expense. Programming expense increased only 3.5%. That's less than we had anticipated due to video sub losses and some items described in our press release which reduced year-over-year growth by about $20 million. Year-to-date programming costs have grown less than 5%, but we expect growth to accelerate in Q4 and full year programming costs growth should land in the 5.5% to 6% range. Third quarter programming cost per video subscriber increased 6.8% year-over-year.
 Marketing expense of $156 million was higher than last year, but in line with the marketing spend over the last few quarters. Voice costs were up 4% due to growth in digital phone subscribers. As we previewed earlier in the year, we have begun the process of in-sourcing various voice support functions. We expected that about half of our voice subs will be migrated by the end of next year, with the balance moving over the following three years. The financial benefits of this move will begin to show up next year and over time, should be pretty meaningful. We continued to invest in our Wireless business during Q3, incurring about $15 million of wireless losses which reduced our adjusted OIBDA growth by almost a full percentage point and our margin by roughly 30 basis points. We are still expecting full year Wireless losses in the $50 million zone.
 You'll recall that restructuring is excluded from adjusted OIBDA. Restructuring costs were $44 million through September 30, year-to-date and we anticipate another $15 million or so in the fourth quarter. Based on our year-to-date performance and our outlook for Q4, including higher year-over-year programming, bad debt and casualty insurance expense growth, and larger Wireless losses, we now expect the full year adjusted OIBDA growth will come in around 6%.
 Turning to capital spending on Slide 11. Capital intensely declined for the fourth consecutive quarter, as third quarter CapEx came in at $676 million or 14.3% of revenues. Third quarter residential capital expenditures were down more than 15% year-over-year to $563 million, driven by declines in scalable infrastructure, CPE and support capital. Once again, in the quarter, we continued to invest more in our fast growing Commercial business. Commercial CapEx was $113 million, up about 24%, with about half the growth attributable to expanding our cell tower backhaul footprint. Through the first nine months of the year, CapEx was $2.1 billion or 15.3% of revenues, down from over 17% of revenues in the first nine months of 2009. As usual, we expect Q4 will be the highest CapEx quarter of the year. But we're very comfortable that capital expenditures for the full year will be less than $3 billion.
 On to cash flow on the next slide. Adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditures for the third quarter was $1 billion, resulting in adjusted OIBDA less CapEx of nearly $3 billion for the first nine months of 2010, a nearly 20% year-over-year increase. Given our year-to-date performance, we continued to expect our full year adjusted OIBDA less CapEx will increase around 20% over 2009. Free cash flow for the quarter was $396 million, driving our nine month free cash flow to $1.6 billion or $4.50 per diluted share. Free cash flow was 8% higher than in the first nine months of 2009 as higher adjusted OIBDA less CapEx and lower pension contributions more than compensated for a jump in cash taxes of $333 million and an increase in cash interest of $159 million.
 As you model Q4 free cash flow, remember that the recent Small Business Jobs Act extended bonus depreciation retroactive to the beginning of this year. That should reduce to zero, our fourth quarter Federal estimated tax payment. I'd also point out that we may make additional pension contributions in the fourth quarter.
 Turning to the next slide. Diluted earnings per share were $1, an all-time high for Time Warner Cable since becoming a public company and 32% higher than the last year's third quarter. Through the first three quarters, diluted EPS was $2.55, up 19% over the same period last year. Given our EPS performance through the first nine months, we now expect to exceed the high end of the $3.25 to $3.50 per share range that we provided at the beginning of this year.
 Finally, moving to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our net debt and preferred equity totaled $20.5 billion, a reduction of $1.1 billion from year-end 2009 despite our having paid out $432 million in regular dividends. Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 2.99x.
 Just yesterday, we entered into a new three-year $4 billion revolving credit facility which replaced the $5.875 billion facility that was set to mature in February 2011. We provide more information about the new facility in our 10-Q, but suffice it to say that we're very pleased with the terms. We now have no debt maturities until 2012.
 So with that said, let me quickly summarize. We delivered another quarter of solid financial results, with accelerating commercial and advertising revenue growth, as well as stable residential revenue growth. Our free cash flow continued to grow at a healthy pace despite higher cash taxes and interest payments. As a result, we continued to reduce our leverage and create greater financial capacity, enabling us to launch our $4 billion share repurchase program.
 With that, I'll turn it over to Landel.

From an operational perspective, we're performing well in all areas of our business, residential, commercial and advertising. Over the next few minutes, I'll share with you some of the progress we're making in each of these",1728," Thanks, Rob, and good morning. From an operational perspective, we're performing well in all areas of our business, residential, commercial and advertising. Over the next few minutes, I'll share with you some of the progress we're making in each of these areas.
 We'll start with Residential. On the competitive front, the telephone companies continued to expand their number of homes passed, although in our footprint, the rate of increase, similar to last quarter, has continued to slow. We estimate that at the end of September, AT&T's U-verse product was available to approximately 23% of our homes passed, up from 22% a quarter earlier. Verizon FiOS offering continued to be available to about 10% of our passings. The competitive intensity in Q3 was about the same or slightly more aggressive than in the second quarter.
 On the video side of the business, we continued to see very little expansion of multichannel video homes on an industry-wide basis. This is consistent with the ongoing weakness in the macroeconomic environment. Our third quarter video losses were driven primarily by lower connects. In particular, we have under indexed in low-end segments. Most of these households appeared to be going to satellite or leaving the pay TV category entirely. We also saw some increase in disconnects among subscribers who signed up during last year's over the year digital TV transition. By and large, similar to what we saw on the connect side, these subs win our two lowest value segments. On the other hand, we've been performing well in high-end, high-ARPU segments. And by the way, we haven't been able to identify any increase in video cord cutting related to over-the-top video.
 A couple of examples. First, as Rob mentioned, our video losses in the quarter were driven by Single Play video customers. And second, our video high-speed data Double Plays actually increased in the quarter. That's the opposite of what we'd expect to see of the remaining for cord cutting. And another example, we look at college towns like Austin, Texas and Columbus, Ohio in our footprint to examine the pieces that video cord cutting among students might have contributed to weaker connect volume this quarter. It turns out that college enrollment is flat this year compared to last and our video connect volumes were also flat. So we'll continue to monitor cord cutting but haven't found evidence where we might expect to see it.
 Turning to broadband. We continued to compete very well in Q3. AT&T's promotional pricing of its six megabit per second DSL service at $19.95 a month appears to have reduced the exodus of DSL subs. However, on a footprint-adjusted basis, our 104,000 broadband net additions were around 50% higher than the two big telcos, demonstrating that we continued to take share in Q3. In voice, we continued to take share from the telcos in Q3 albeit at a slower rate than we would like. We recently have adjusted Triple Play bundled marketing and pricing in our East region to good effect. We actually seen year-over-year improvement in digital phone net adds in recent weeks.
 With that as a backdrop, let me highlight several initiatives that we expect to further enhance the competitiveness of our products. First, I'd be remiss if I didn't update you on our high definition product. As we indicated last quarter, we completed the implementation of video switching in New York City, and as a result, we now have 156 HD channels in the city. Nationwide, our weighted average is now over 110. This demonstrates the ability of our infrastructure in meeting customer's needs. We've lost Remote DVR Manager across our footprint and it's now available to more than 3 million DVRs. And this week, there's a lot of excitement around our mobile Internet product as we launched our combined 4G/3G wireless service in New York City. It delivers speeds up to six megabits per second, 5x faster than 3G, making it one of the fastest mobile broadband networks available. With our wireline Time Warner cable Internet, mobile Internet and Wi-Fi offerings, our customers in New York City will now have three different ways to access our broadband service with varying degrees of speed and mobility, making it the most complete and flexible broadband offering.
 In conjunction with our recent mobile Internet launch, we are offering new packages, including a tier that provides 250 megabytes per month on our for the 4G/3G network for under $20 when bundled with our wireline service. In the coming months, availability of the service will expand further as we launch in Cleveland in early December and LA just after year end. In voice, we've launched VoiceZone in nearly our entire footprint including, as of a couple of weeks ago, New York City. VoiceZone is a web portal where subscribers can manage their home voicemail and phone features anywhere, anytime. It enables them to receive their voicemail as an e-mail attachment and has a number of innovative features including caller ID on the PC.
 In Charlotte, we've been very pleased with our signature home, a new bundled offering targeted at our high-end ARPU segments who want all of our best-in-class products and who demand a more personalized service experience. We're seeing a nice ARPU uplift of upgrading customers and we also are pleasantly surprised that substantial amount of the incremental revenue is coming from customers new to Time Warner Cable. The offering looks like a real winner and you can expect to see it arrive in much of our footprint including New York City in the coming weeks.
 In the more value- and budget-oriented segments, we've heard loud and clear that customers would like more flexibility in video packaging, particularly in the availability of smaller packages. I want to tease you a bit here because we're not quite ready to make the announcement, but you can expect to see us introduce a video offering that is targeted at more value and budget-oriented segments in the very near future.
 Turning now to Commercial. In the SMB market, Time Warner Cable competes primarily with ILECs. In some cases, telcos are increasing DSL speeds to compete against our broadband speeds. In other cases, they're offering a low-price promotion to attract customers, but AT&T and Verizon are also incenting businesses to incorporate national wireless voice and data plans as a way to differentiate their bundles from cable. In the midmarket, Time Warner Cable offers a variety of voice and data products across metro networks that compete with both ILECs and CLECs. The telcos are now paying greater attention to protecting this installed base, had introduced their more complex enterprise-class products into the midmarket. In this competitive environment, we're very comfortable with our ability to compete and grow rapidly in both the SMB and midmarket.
 On the product front, we've done a very good job in the past two years in building out a comprehensive Internet and phone solution set for small and medium businesses. This quarter, we filled a long-standing need to update our video solution for the hospitality vertical. Our new HD video for hospitality product enables us to deliver a consistent HD video and music lineup across our footprint while maintaining compatibility with a variety of interactive service providers in the space including Loginet. The service are delivered over either fiber or coax and is targeted initially at hotels with room counts above 100. In cell tower backhaul, we continued to do very well. We installed service to almost 500 radios in the third quarter to raise the total installed base to more than 5,000. In addition, we have contracts on a large number of radios that will keep our installation crews busy well into 2011.
 Turning next to Advertising. As Rob indicated, we're having a terrific year in Advertising. Revenues are up 22% in the first nine months of the year and we're seeing strength in almost every category. Core Advertising growth, which excludes political, was very strong in Q3, posting growth at 20% year-over-year. I'd remind you that the strong political year we're experiencing currently won't repeat in 2011. Certainly, our strong performance reflects broader industry trends and the midterm elections. However, it also results from investments we made during the recent downturn and building new relationships and growing categories as well as improved execution.
 One area in which we're just now beginning to see the fruits of our labors is the use of data. We now have access to and are using anonymized data from set-tops to help advertisers make better decisions about where to place their spots. All of this data is collected and presented in a way that completely protects the privacy of individual subscribers. It's early doing, but I'm pleased to report that our Advertising customers are very excited about the new capability, and frankly we are, too.
 With the industry nearing its objective of 25 million EBIF enabled households by year-end, Canoe is closer to its goal of a truly national ITV solution. Six cable networks are planning to employ its request for information capability in the coming months. We continue to be enthusiastic about the value that Canoe can unlock.
 Before I conclude, let me say a few words on our identity refresh. You're probably aware that following our spinoff from Time Warner, we considered changing the name of the company. However, after conducting brand research, we recognized there's great value in both the name Time Warner Cable and our pioneer symbol. As a result, we've decided to keep them both. Although we've refreshed and updated the logo, fonts and colors, you'll start to see it over time in all of our communications, especially as you may have may seen it this morning in Rob's presentation slides or when you visited our website for the conference call. But please be assured that we're not buying hundreds and millions of dollars in media and rewrapping all of our trucks overnight. We'll do most of this in the normal course of business and you won't see a huge bulge on our marketing budget.
 So in summary, we have performed well, in Residential, Commercial and Ad sales in the third quarter. We're adding some terrific new capabilities to our products which we expect to further enhance our competitiveness.
 Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for the Q&A portion of the call.

The drivers of that -- let me go through them because they're all cost driven and they're all or at least several of them are kind of one-time in nature. Let's start with bad debt. You may remember that in 2009, with the economy being what it was, we actually increased our allowance for doubtful accounts. As we closed out 2009, we took a fresh look at that number and actually reversed it. So we have a tough year-over-year comparison on the bad debt front which won't repeat itself. Programming costs, we've talked about this before, but we expect the growth in -- it'll be the first full quarter under our new Disney deal. So that has an impact on programming costs. On casualty insurance, which is another kind of comparison issue, again, we had an adjustment in Q4 of '09 that will cause that to be a tough comparison, again, shouldn't repeat itself. And the last element is that we'll continue to spend on our Wireless business and a lot of the spend is back loaded, so we'll have more spending in Q4 than we did in the other quarters of the year. So I'm not sure I would draw any conclusions about growing forward margins from that.

I've been talking about that for a long time. So we have sought in our programming negotiations which are ongoing with all sorts of people to get more flexibility around that. Obviously, going the other way, in the Programming business, their cost tend to be somewhat fixed so if they're facing smaller audiences and/or a smaller subscription, that's a big problem for them. So it's natural for those companies to resist. So there's a balance in this and I would just leave it to say, we have negotiated some additional flexibility beyond what we had a few years ago that will allow us to begin to offer some smaller packages or lower prices. Probably not all the way where we would like to be, but we're moving in the right direction.

There's a lot of functionality that is coming to the product that hasn't existed to the set-top box before. And with devices like tablets, you create the ability to search in a way that's never been available on the set-top as well. So I'm wondering how far away are we from being able to integrate all that to the television set? Because a lot of this stuff today sort of has the -- sort of a PC product, maybe a mobile product and a television product, it seems like the big win and maybe I'm wrong. Disagree with me if you want, but the big win could be for the industry to bring all this to the television, it adds a whole level of interactibility and customization that hasn't been there before. So how far away are we from that? Do you think that's where we're headed?

And I'll try to give you a short answer because I could talk about this for the whole rest of the time. But there's obviously a lot of new product introduction both from the CE industry and from what used to be the IT industry and sometimes they look the same. And what we need to do is make sure that our services on all the devices take advantage of the functionality. So I mentioned the idea of using an iPad as a remote which we've been working on for a while. There's a clip on YouTube that shows a demo of an early prototype. You are starting to see in the market and I think you're going to see much more robust way TV sets that directly offer IP connectivity. And as I said in my remarks, we want to create the infrastructure so that our video services can be delivered directly to those TV sets in the home. That's not really so dramatic, it's just like going from analog to digital, et cetera. Those TVs to the extent they start having more intelligence, and the first ones may not have a browser, but the later ones will. I think we'll be able to display a lot more interesting program interfaces, user interfaces. Some of that software may be moved back into the network instead of the DS device. But all of this means that consumers are going to get better experience and I think over time, without set-tops, which is an interesting factor also. So that's my attempt at a fairly short answer.

So in essence, the buyback kind of has to be in and around the range of $700 million to $800 million per quarter, i.e. 3% to 4% of the share count per quarter just to stay where you are on leverage. I'm wondering if that's a sort of good way to think about the potential pacing?

Is that concept becoming outdated? And perhaps, as you look to the future, can you discuss how either of those two concepts could impact longer-term CPE spending?

Simple reason we have set-tops is that the consumer electronics devices in general are not capable of displaying all of our services without a set-top. So by and large, the consumer electronics devices are not too way capable. They can't do VOD, they can't do program guides, they can't un-encrypt encrypted services, so there's a piracy issue. Obviously, some of the SEC rules on cable cards have attempted to deal with the encryption problem. But we would be delighted to not have set-top boxes. The thing I left out, too, is the hard drive DVR is in the set-tops. I think the world we're going to -- we spent a lot of time with the big consumer electronics companies, the way we're going to is one where these devices will be more intelligent and more easily networked, so that we can envision a world with at least where people buy new TVs, where we might not have to set-tops. I think it may move to a gateway device because the old TVs will live for a very long time, so we'll need some sort of interface and some place for the hard drive. Quite frankly, moving the DVR functionality back into the network which we pioneered with Maestro and Cablevision has been working on, that's a better engineering solution. But given the stance of the company right owners, it might not be one that we can do on a widespread basis quickly. And so that's a little bit confused, but I think you're going to see, over time, fewer set-tops, lower CPE spending. And hopefully more of the intelligence move back into the network, as well as into a consumer home device. And by the way, this will all result in a much better consumer experience which is what we should really be focused on.

And as I've said before, I'm not sure those are in the market anywhere yet, but I know they're going to be in the market very soon if they are not actually in the stores. So I think what you have is -- Apple is different to Google and they should all speak for themselves, but Google is very interesting. I think they're trying to extend their surge in software capability. And to the extent consumers want that, that should be an interesting thing and perhaps complementary to some of the things that we do. Apple presumes we want to sell devices compatible with their other devices and we'll see where that goes in a world where the CE companies themselves are offering that functionality.
