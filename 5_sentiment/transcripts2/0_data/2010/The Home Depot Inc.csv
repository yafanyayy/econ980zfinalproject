Sales for the fourth quarter were $14.6 billion, essentially flat to last year.

Sales for the fourth quarter were $14.6 billion, essentially flat to last year. Comps sales were positive 1.2% with our U.S. stores posting a negative 1.1% comp for the quarter and our International stores contributing a positive 2.3% comp.  Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.18. As Carol will detail, we had some unusual items impact our fourth quarter earnings, in particular, the write down of our remaining equity interest in HD Supply. Adjusting for the impact of HD Supply, earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.24.Our business improved more than we expected in the fourth quarter. Of our top 40 markets in the U.S., all but two showed improvement in the fourth quarter on a comp-sales basis. Every one of our regions showed comp sales improvement in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And our Northern division, our largest division with eight regions, had a positive comp for the quarter. We also saw sequential improvement in California and Florida with a return to positive comps in some of the markets there. Our business also performed very well in Canada in the fourth quarter with doubled digit positive comps. This was a function of four things: Better performance by the business, recovery from a rocky start last year with the new enterprise IT implementation, improving economic conditions and a government stimulus program designed to support homeowners updating their houses. And in Mexico, the business once again achieved positive comps for the quarter in the year despite a very tough economic environment. We also made solid progress on our key initiatives. Last month, we opened our 12th Rapid Deployment Center or RDC in Topeka, Kansas. RDC has now served over 65% of our U.S. store base and we're on track to reach our goal of serving 100% by the end of 2010. Craig and the merchandising team continue to develop and integrate our merchandising tools, and we can already see some of the benefits of improved Assortment Management and forecasting in our inventory and markdown control.As Matt Carey, our IT leader, has described, we are years behind other retailers in these areas, but we are on a path to catch up over the next five years. Given the success we've seen with our internal tools, we're not contemplating any third-party U.S.-based enterprise-wide system. Marvin and our store operations team made a significant statement last year by retraining all of our associates, everyone on customer service, launching our customer first program. Our net promoter score improved 800 basis points over the year and is now at an almost 70%. And we gained over 100 basis points of market share for the year, something we have not done in quite a while.So all of this gives us some cause for optimism in 2010. At the same time, we recognized that we have more work to do as a company. And that the economy is not out of the woods yet, particularly in our market. So we're not projecting robust growth. Private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP has stopped its dramatic and historic decline, but still remains well below the 60-year average. The housing industry remains at distressed levels, mortgage defaults continue to increase, unemployment remains high and our pro customers are still under pressure. Our expectation is that 2010 will be a transitional year. For the year, we are anticipating approximately 2.5% sales growth and 15% growth in earnings per share from continuing operations. We expect to see relatively flat growth in the first half of the year with more momentum in the second half.Calling the year transitional doesn't sound very exciting, but we've been waiting for this transition for a long time. We made the decision three years ago to focus on our core business and invest in our stores and associates during a difficult economic environment. We've returned to the core values of our business. And we're proud of the fact that even in the tough economic environment of 2009, we had record success sharing for our hourly associates.  In fact, for the second half of 2009, 93% of our stores qualified for success sharing.  Going forward, we will continue to invest in our associates and our business. And we will also continue to focus on disciplined capital allocation and increasing shareholder return. Today, the Board of Directors and I are pleased to announce our first dividend increase since the third quarter of 2006, reinforcing our confidence in the business and our commitment to our shareholders. And it is our intent to continue to increase our dividend every year. Further, it is also our intent to use our excess cash to repurchase shares, again, evidence of our disciplined approach. I want to thank our associates for all their hard work in 2009 and their commitment and dedication in the year ahead.  With that, let me turn the call over to Craig"

We're pleased with our continued progress in the business and performance in the fourth quarter. We saw significant improvement across many product categories and regions, as well as key performance metrics, including comp sales, transactions and big-ticket sales. Kitchen and bath, paint, flooring and plumbing delivered a positive comp. And we flat comps in building materials, garden and millwork. Lumber, hardware and electrical reported negative comps. Total customer transactions were $288 million in the fourth quarter, up 2.1% compared to last year.Transactions for ticket for $50 and below, roughly 20% of our business in the U.S., were positive 3.2%. This increase was driven by continued strength in basic DIY repair and maintenance products, such as plumbing, cleaning and lightbulbs. In addition, we saw strength in simple decor projects, which led to positive growth in categories like ceramic tile, carpet, interior paint, faucets and bath fixtures, which also contributed to our overall transaction growth in the quarter.Transactions for tickets of $900 and above, which also represent approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were down less than 1%, a significant improvement compared to the double-digit declines in previous quarters in 2009. This improvement was largely driven by a stronger than anticipated response to the outstanding values in categories such as appliances, water heaters and windows. We were also pleased with the positive trend in our installed sales.  Our total company average ticket for the fourth quarter was $50.01, down 1.7% from last year. Our comp average ticket declined by 1%.  The improving trend in total average ticket was driven by the improvement in big-ticket transactions as I mentioned earlier. The average ticket also benefited from strong sales in Canada resulting in part from the Canadian tax relief on a large selection of home improvement projects.  However, while our trends are getting better, we continue to experience pressure in big-ticket construction-related categories, such as dimensional lumber, concrete, gypsum, pneumatic tools and fasteners.We are executing our merchandising transformation to provide a great everyday value to our customers. From where we started, we are a third of the way through the implementation of our portfolio strategy and the continued use of merchandising tools allows us to enhance and optimize our performance. This, coupled with our Supply chain transformation to get the right product in the right place at the right time, was the foundation behind our solid quarter's performance.Success of our seasonal business is a great example of how we leveraged our merchandising and supply chain transformation during the quarter. The combination of better planning tools and solid execution drove strong performance against our plan in products such as snow removal, fireplace and decorative holiday.  We finished the year in a clean inventory position and seasonal goods while having spent less on markdowns compared to last year. Investments in our portfolio strategy, merchandising tools, supply chain development and customer service continued market share growth in the quarter. Our U.S. market share has grown over 100 basis points on a rolling 12-month basis, despite closing our Expo businesses in early 2009. Based on an independent third-party tracking of consumer activity, we gained unit share in six of our 13 departments during the quarter. As we look forward to 2010, we are well positioned across the entire store. We will meet our customers' needs in energy efficiency and conservation by offering them products, such as the best-rated CFL bulbs in the market or Watersense rated profit [ph] across our entire product line up. For indoor and outdoor projects requiring power tools, we offer the leading cordless brand for pros weight with DEWALT along with a strong exclusive power tool line up, including Milwaukee, Nikita, Rigid and Ryobi.  In decor, we provide our customers the number one paint in Behr Premium Ultra, as recently rated by a leading consumer magazine. Additionally, the Martha Stewart program has been expanded into patio, cleaning and paint.And finally, as customers get ready for spring, we have a fantastic lineup of seasonal product offerings to meet their lawn and garden needs, with leading exclusive brands of Honda and Toro Motors, Cub Cadet Tractors, Eco, Ryobi and Homelite portable power Products, and Proven Winners, the most recognized live goods brand by garden enthusiasts.  Over the past three years, we have redefined our merchandising strategy, which includes the repositioning of our brand, creation of new tools to drive efficiency and implemented new capabilities. And we're not done. There's more to come. As we look forward to 2010, we are well positioned to deliver quality and value for our customers.  And now I would like to turn the call over to Carol"

Our financial results for the quarter are distorted by a few factors that I'd like to discuss and get out of the way before I cover our results.First, we reported $41 million of earnings from discontinued operations",1451,"Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. Our financial results for the quarter are distorted by a few factors that I'd like to discuss and get out of the way before I cover our results.First, we reported $41 million of earnings from discontinued operations primarily related to our working capital settlement with HD Supply. For the purpose of today's discussion, we will focus our remarks on earnings from continuing operations.  Earnings from continuing operations were impacted by a $163 million write down of our investment in HD Supply, which is reflected in other expense. We hold a 12.5% equity investment in HD Supply but have written that investment down to zero as we believe it has been other than temporarily impaired.  Also as you may know, we had a reduction in force in the fourth quarter and announced plans to close three non-strategic locations. The financial impact of those actions was not significant. So with that, in the fourth quarter, sales were $14.6 billion, a 0.3% decrease from last year, reflecting fewer stores than one year ago. Comp or same-store sales were positive 1.2% for the quarter. A weaker U.S. dollar drove 130 basis points of comp growth. And positive comp sales in our Canadian and Mexican businesses drove 100 basis points of comp growth in the quarter.  This combined international comp growth of 2.3% was offset by negative comps in our U.S. stores of 1.1%. Total company comps were positive 1.2% in November, negative 0.2% in December, and positive 2.2% in January. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 0.3% in November, negative 2.3% in December and negative 1.5% in January.For the year, our sales declined 7.2% to $66.2 billion. Excluding the impact of sales related to the wind down of our Expo businesses, adjusted sales for the year declined 7.5% to $66 billion. For fiscal 2009, total company comp sales were negative 6.6% and comps for U.S. stores were negative 6.2%.  In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 34.4%, an increase of 45 basis points from last year. Our gross margin expansion was due to the following factors: First, our U.S. business reported 33 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter due primarily to lower markdowns than last year. Our holiday category alone contributed 21 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. Second, we realized 12 basis points of margin expansion from our Canadian business, as we didn't repeat certain promotions and we left the discretion we experienced last year when we implemented score or SAP. For the year, we experienced 22 basis points of gross margin expansion. Turning to operating expenses, four the quarter and the year, it is easiest to compare our year-over-year performance by looking at adjusted operating expenses as a percent of sales. And when I say adjusted operating expenses, we adjust expenses for strategic charges taken in 2008 and 2009. We detailed the financial impact of those charges in an exhibit to our press release, which sets forth reported and adjusted results for both years.  So on an adjusted basis, for the fourth quarter, operating expenses as a percent of sales were 29.4%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year. We leveraged expenses primarily because of positive same-store sales, but we also saw continued benefits from the changes we've implemented to improve spending efficiency across our business. On an adjusted basis for fiscal 2009, operating expenses as a percent of sales were 26.4%, an increase of 18 basis points from last year.For the year, we deleverage expenses by about three basis points for every point of negative comp, considerably better than we planned at the beginning of the year. Our income tax provision rate was 25.9% in the fourth quarter reflecting a $47 million benefit arising from global tax planning. Our effective tax rate was 34.2% for the year, which includes both the fourth quarter tax benefit and a favorable foreign tax settlement we reported in the second quarter of 2009.Earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.18 for the fourth quarter. Excluding the HD Supply write down, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.24 for the fourth quarter. For the year, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.55. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.66, down 6.7% from last year.Now moving to our operational metrics, during the quarter, we opened three new stores and closed one store for an ending store count of 2,244. At the end of the fourth quarter, selling square footage was 235 million, a 1.3% decrease from last year. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the fourth quarter were $245, up 1.7% from last year. For fiscal 2009, sales per square foot were $279.Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the year, retail inventory was $10.2 billion, down 4.5% from last year. On a per-store basis, inventory was down 3.3% to last year. Inventory turnover was 4.1x, up one-tenths the last year. This was our first annual increase in the inventory turnover since 2001, a true team effort. And we view this as solid performance as our in-stock position is at a record high level.We ended the quarter with $41 billion in assets, including $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. This is an increase of approximately $900 million in cash and short-term investments from the end of fiscal 2008, reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $5.4 billion, offset by $1.8 billion used to repay senior notes that came due in September and December, $1.5 billion of dividends paid, $966 million of capital expenditures and $213 million of share repurchases.In the fourth quarter, we used excess cash to repurchase $115 million or 4.1 million shares of outstanding stock. Considered on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 10.7%. On an adjusted basis, return on invested capital was 11.1%, 70 basis points higher than what we reported for the third quarter of fiscal 2009.As Craig mentioned, we performed well against our internal expectations in 2009. And as we look to 2010, we expect our performance to improve as macro economic conditions improve. We've detailed our guidance in our press release, so let me just hit the high points.  First, let me remind you that we guide off of GAAP. We based our working estimate on a number of external factors. And we're not expecting a robust recovery. For the year, we project that our sales will increase by approximately 2.5%, driven primarily by positive same-store sales.We plan to open just six stores in 2010. We expect sales growth to be flattish in the first half and stronger in the second half of the year, in line with economic forecast. We were pleased with how we started off 2010. Even with the extra winter storms, February sales are trending to our plan.  For fiscal 2010, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations to increase by approximately 15% to $1.79. Included in our earnings per share guidance is modest gross margin expansion and expense leverage. We continue to learn more about the fixed variable nature of our expenses. For fiscal 2010, you should expect expenses to grow at approximately 60% of our sales growth rate. And here, we're talking about adjusted expenses.  Finally, we have not included the impact of share repurchases in our earnings per share guidance. And we'll touch on share repurchases in just a moment.For fiscal 2010, we project cash flow from the business of roughly $5.4 billion. This forecast assumes we refinanced $1 billion of senior notes that come due in August of 2010.  We will use our cash to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders. Our capital spending plan for 2010 is $1,250,000,000 reflecting $180 million for new stores, $635 million for our existing U.S. stores and supply chain, $350 million for IT and $85 million for our non-U.S. businesses.We've just announced a 5% increase in our dividend and we'll use our cash to fund our dividend, which for the year, approximates $1.6 billion. We have $12.5 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. It is our intent to use excess cash to repurchase shares over the course of the year. Depending on the timing of our repurchases, we should see some earnings-per-share benefit arising from this activity in 2010.  The debt-financed portion of our repurchase program remains on hold, principally because we're early in our recovery. As our business gains momentum, we will revisit the debt-financed portion of our share repurchase program.  So thank you very much for your participation in today's call. And we're now ready for questions."

Carol, it's helpful to think about expense dollar growth at 60% of sales growth. Is that kind of implies 1.5% dollar growth for the coming year. I guess my question is can you give other than that if the comp comes in flat? Because obviously the performance over the past year's been far better than that. And would you think that from here on out you'd need 1.5 comp to   leverage expenses, given that embedded dollar growth? And just a little bit more color on what might drive you to exceed those expectations? Again given the strong performance you've already had and expense reductions that have already been taken."

As we look forward to 2010, there are a couple of things that you need to think about as you",316,"Well, first, thank you regarding your comments on our expense control. We have taken out over $1.3 billion of cost over the past two years. So thank you for that. As we look forward to 2010, there are a couple of things that you need to think about as you think about expenses. First as you know, payroll is our biggest expense, and we do have an activity-based model. As we build out our sales growth plan for 2010, we assume early on in the year, more of the sales growth will come from transactions and ticket. And then as the year progresses, we'll see more of the sales growth coming from ticket. Transactions drive payroll in the stores as you can appreciate. So clearly depending on the composition of these sales growth, we have some opportunities to leverage payroll. We do have some expense pressure coming at us in 2010 that we didn't have in 2009. For example, our medical costs are increasing by about 9% in 2010. We'll do everything we can do to mitigate that pressure, but we planned for that because we think that's what it may be. We have some other cost pressures coming at us. States are hungry for money. We know they're coming at us for more property taxes. We've got some computer maintenance costs coming at us because of all the IT investments that we've made. So we factored all those cost pressures coming in at us. But we can be pretty nimble on the expense structure as you've seen us. So we'll always strive to do better, but we're giving our best estimate of cost for 2010. And then one last comment, and I know I'm going on and on, but one last comment about expenses, is sales growth is better than the guidance that we have given you, that we should do better on the leverage."

So we are getting smarter about our approach to merchandising, it's driving margin expansion, we're pleased with the expansion that we reported this past couple of years.

If you look at lumber in the quarter, certainly, the lumber market did increase during the timeframe, both on framing lumber and panel, with significantly more driven on framing than in panel. But the total impact to our business in the quarter was six basis points. We have to remember, right now the supply is offset by lack of demand, if you will. So there's not a lot of demand out there obviously in the construction industry. And so what used to be a low-teens penetration for us is around the 7% penetration today. And it is really not a huge impact at this point, certainly in the quarter. And as we look forward, we'll continue to monitor and watch. But today, the rising costs really is due to smaller log decks that are out there because there's just not a ton of demand. There is wet forest in the South, which make it difficult to pull logs out. And then you have pulp and paper mills competing with sawmills for what product is available. So that's kind of helping to drive the cost side of the market.

Sales for the fourth quarter were $14.6 billion, essentially flat to last year. Comps sales were positive 1.2% with our U.S. stores posting a negative 1.1% comp for the quarter and our International stores contributing a positive 2.3% comp.  Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.18. As Carol will detail, we had some unusual items impact our fourth quarter earnings, in particular, the write down of our remaining equity interest in HD Supply. Adjusting for the impact of HD Supply, earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.24.Our business improved more than we expected in the fourth quarter. Of our top 40 markets in the U.S., all but two showed improvement in the fourth quarter on a comp-sales basis. Every one of our regions showed comp sales improvement in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And our Northern division, our largest division with eight regions, had a positive comp for the quarter. We also saw sequential improvement in California and Florida with a return to positive comps in some of the markets there. Our business also performed very well in Canada in the fourth quarter with doubled digit positive comps. This was a function of four things: Better performance by the business, recovery from a rocky start last year with the new enterprise IT implementation, improving economic conditions and a government stimulus program designed to support homeowners updating their houses. And in Mexico, the business once again achieved positive comps for the quarter in the year despite a very tough economic environment. We also made solid progress on our key initiatives. Last month, we opened our 12th Rapid Deployment Center or RDC in Topeka, Kansas. RDC has now served over 65% of our U.S. store base, and we're on track to reach our goal of serving 100% by the end of 2010. Craig and the merchandising team continue to develop and integrate our merchandising tools, and we can already see some of the benefits of improved Assortment Management and forecasting in our inventory and markdown control.As Matt Carey, our IT leader, has described, we are years behind other retailers in these areas, but we are on a path to catch up over the next five years. Given the success we've seen with our internal tools, we're not contemplating any third-party U.S.-based enterprise-wide system. Marvin and our store operations team made a significant statement last year by retraining all of our associates, everyone, on customer service, launching our customer first program. Our Net Promoter score improved 800 basis points over the year and is now at an almost 70%. And we gained over 100 basis points of market share for the year, something we have not done in quite a while.So all of this gives us some cause for optimism in 2010. At the same time, we recognized that we have more work to do as a company. And that the economy is not out of the woods yet, particularly in our market. So we're not projecting robust growth. Private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP has stopped its dramatic and historic decline, but still remains well below the 60-year average. The housing industry remains at distressed levels, mortgage defaults continue to increase, unemployment remains high and our pro customers are still under pressure. Our expectation is that 2010 will be a transitional year. For the year, we are anticipating approximately 2 1/2% sales growth and 15% growth in earnings per share from continuing operations. We expect to see relatively-flat growth in the first half of the year with more momentum in the second half.Calling the year transitional doesn't sound very exciting, but we've been waiting for this transition for a long time. We made the decision three years ago to focus on our core business and invest in our stores and associates during a difficult economic environment. We've returned to the core values of our business. And we're proud of the fact that even in the tough economic environment of 2009, we had record success sharing for all of the associates.  In fact, for the second half of 2009, 93% of our stores qualified for success sharing.  Going forward, we will continue to invest in our associates and our business. And we will also continue to focus on disciplined capital allocation and increasing shareholder return. Today, the Board of Directors and I are pleased to announce our first dividend increase since the third quarter of 2006, reinforcing our confidence in the business and our commitment to our shareholders. And it is our intent to continue to increase our dividend every year. Further, it is also our intent to use our excess cash to repurchase shares, again, evidence of our disciplined approach. I want to thank our associates for all their hard work in 2009 and their commitment and dedication in the year ahead.  With that, let me turn the call over to Craig"

We're pleased with our continued progress in the business and performance in the fourth quarter. We saw significant improvement across many product categories and regions, as well as key performance metrics, including comp sales, transactions and big-ticket sales. Kitchen and bath, paint, flooring and plumbing delivered a positive comp. And we flat comps in building materials, garden and millwork. Lumber, hardware and electrical reported negative comps. Total customer transactions were $288 million in the fourth quarter, up 2.1% compared to last year.Transactions for ticket for $50 and below, roughly 20% of our business in the U.S., were positive 3.2%. This increase was driven by continued strength in basic DIY repair and maintenance products, such as plumbing, cleaning and lightbulbs. In addition, we saw strength in simple decor projects, which led to positive growth in categories like ceramic tile, carpet, interior paint, faucets and bath fixtures, which also contributed to our overall transaction growth in the quarter.Transactions for tickets of $900 and above, which also represent approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were down less than 1%, a significant improvement compared to the double-digit declines in previous quarters in 2009. This improvement was largely driven by a stronger than anticipated response to the outstanding values in categories such as appliances, water heaters and windows. We were also pleased with the positive trend in our installed sales.  Our total company average ticket for the fourth quarter was $50.01, down 1.7% from last year. Our comp average ticket declined by 1%.  The improving trend in total average ticket was driven by the improvement in big-ticket transactions as I mentioned earlier. The average ticket also benefited from strong sales in Canada resulting in part from the Canadian tax relief on a large selection of home improvement projects.  However, while our trends are getting better, we continue to experience pressure in big-ticket construction-related categories, such as dimensional lumber, concrete, gypsum, pneumatic tools and fasteners.We are executing our merchandising transformation to provide a great everyday value to our customers. From where we started, we are a third of the way through the implementation of our portfolio strategy and the continued use of merchandising tools allows us to enhance and optimize our performance. This, coupled with our Supply chain transformation to get the right product in the right place at the right time, was the foundation behind our solid quarter's performance.Success of our seasonal business is a great example of how we leveraged our merchandising and supply chain transformation during the quarter. The combination of better planning tools and solid execution drove strong performance against our plan in products such as snow removal, fireplace and decorative holiday.  We finished the year in a clean inventory position and seasonal goods while having spent less on markdowns compared to last year. Investments in our portfolio strategy, merchandising tools, supply chain development and customer service continued market share growth in the quarter. Our U.S. market share has grown over 100 basis points on a rolling 12-month basis, despite closing our Expo businesses in early 2009. Based on an independent third-party tracking of consumer activity, we gained unit share in six of our 13 departments during the quarter. As we look forward to 2010, we are well positioned across the entire store. We will meet our customers' needs in energy efficiency and conservation by offering them products, such as the best-rated CFL bulbs on the market or WaterSense-rated profit [ph] across our entire product line up. For indoor and outdoor projects requiring power tools, we offer the leading cordless brand for pros with DEWALT, along with a strong exclusive power tool line up, including Milwaukee, Makita, RIDGID and Ryobi.  In décor, we provide our customers the number one paint in BEHR PREMIUM ULTRA (sic) [BEHR PREMIUM PLUS ULTRA] , as recently rated by a leading consumer magazine. Additionally, the Martha Stewart program has been expanded into patio, cleaning and paint.And finally, as customers get ready for spring, we have a fantastic line up of seasonal product offerings to meet their lawn and garden needs, with leading and exclusive brands of Honda and Toro Motors, Cub Cadet tractors, ECHO, Ryobi and Homelite portable power products, and Proven Winners, the most recognized live goods brand by garden enthusiasts.  Over the past three years, we have redefined our merchandising strategy, which includes the repositioning of our brand, creation of new tools to drive efficiency and implemented new capabilities. And we're not done. There's more to come. As we look forward to 2010, we are well positioned to deliver quality and value for our customers.  And now I would like to turn the call over to Carol"
278679,96454731,51235,"The Home Depot, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2010",2010-02-23,"Earnings Calls","The Home Depot, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. Our financial results for the quarter are distorted by a few factors that I'd like to discuss and get out of the way before I cover our results.First, we reported $41 million of earnings from discontinued operations",1451,"Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. Our financial results for the quarter are distorted by a few factors that I'd like to discuss and get out of the way before I cover our results.First, we reported $41 million of earnings from discontinued operations primarily related to our working capital settlement with HD Supply. For the purpose of today's discussion, we will focus our remarks on earnings from continuing operations.  Earnings from continuing operations were impacted by a $163 million write down of our investment in HD Supply, which is reflected in other expense. We hold a 12.5% equity investment in HD Supply but have written that investment down to zero as we believe it has been other than temporarily impaired.  Also as you may know, we had a reduction in force in the fourth quarter and announced plans to close three non-strategic locations. The financial impact of those actions was not significant. So with that, in the fourth quarter, sales were $14.6 billion, a 0.3% decrease from last year, reflecting fewer stores than one year ago. Comp or same-store sales were positive 1.2% for the quarter. A weaker U.S. dollar drove 130 basis points of comp growth. And positive comp sales in our Canadian and Mexican businesses drove 100 basis points of comp growth in the quarter.  This combined international comp growth of 2.3% was offset by negative comps in our U.S. stores of 1.1%. Total company comps were positive 1.2% in November, negative 0.2% in December, and positive 2.2% in January. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 0.3% in November, negative 2.3% in December and negative 1.5% in January.For the year, our sales declined 7.2% to $66.2 billion. Excluding the impact of sales related to the wind down of our Expo businesses, adjusted sales for the year declined 7.5% to $66 billion. For fiscal 2009, total company comp sales were negative 6.6% and comps for U.S. stores were negative 6.2%.  In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 34.4%, an increase of 45 basis points from last year. Our gross margin expansion was due to the following factors: First, our U.S. business reported 33 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter due primarily to lower markdowns than last year. Our holiday category alone contributed 21 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. Second, we realized 12 basis points of margin expansion from our Canadian business, as we didn't repeat certain promotions and we left the discretion we experienced last year when we implemented score or SAP. For the year, we experienced 22 basis points of gross margin expansion. Turning to operating expenses, four the quarter and the year, it is easiest to compare our year-over-year performance by looking at adjusted operating expenses as a percent of sales. And when I say adjusted operating expenses, we adjust expenses for strategic charges taken in 2008 and 2009. We detailed the financial impact of those charges in an exhibit to our press release, which sets forth reported and adjusted results for both years.  So on an adjusted basis, for the fourth quarter, operating expenses as a percent of sales were 29.4%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year. We leveraged expenses primarily because of positive same-store sales, but we also saw continued benefits from the changes we've implemented to improve spending efficiency across our business. On an adjusted basis for fiscal 2009, operating expenses as a percent of sales were 26.4%, an increase of 18 basis points from last year.For the year, we deleverage expenses by about three basis points for every point of negative comp, considerably better than we planned at the beginning of the year. Our income tax provision rate was 25.9% in the fourth quarter reflecting a $47 million benefit arising from global tax planning. Our effective tax rate was 34.2% for the year, which includes both the fourth quarter tax benefit and a favorable foreign tax settlement we reported in the second quarter of 2009.Earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.18 for the fourth quarter. Excluding the HD Supply write down, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.24 for the fourth quarter. For the year, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.55. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.66, down 6.7% from last year.Now moving to our operational metrics, during the quarter, we opened three new stores and closed one store for an ending store count of 2,244. At the end of the fourth quarter, selling square footage was 235 million, a 1.3% decrease from last year. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the fourth quarter were $245, up 1.7% from last year. For fiscal 2009, sales per square foot were $279.Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the year, retail inventory was $10.2 billion, down 4.5% from last year. On a per-store basis, inventory was down 3.3% to last year. Inventory turnover was 4.1x, up one-tenths the last year. This was our first annual increase in the inventory turnover since 2001, a true team effort. And we view this as solid performance as our in-stock position is at a record high level.We ended the quarter with $41 billion in assets, including $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. This is an increase of approximately $900 million in cash and short-term investments from the end of fiscal 2008, reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $5.4 billion, offset by $1.8 billion used to repay senior notes that came due in September and December, $1.5 billion of dividends paid, $966 million of capital expenditures and $213 million of share repurchases.In the fourth quarter, we used excess cash to repurchase $115 million or 4.1 million shares of outstanding stock. Considered on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 10.7%. On an adjusted basis, return on invested capital was 11.1%, 70 basis points higher than what we reported for the third quarter of fiscal 2009.As Craig mentioned, we performed well against our internal expectations in 2009. And as we look to 2010, we expect our performance to improve as macro economic conditions improve. We've detailed our guidance in our press release, so let me just hit the high points.  First, let me remind you that we guide off of GAAP. We based our working estimate on a number of external factors. And we're not expecting a robust recovery. For the year, we project that our sales will increase by approximately 2.5%, driven primarily by positive same-store sales.We plan to open just six stores in 2010. We expect sales growth to be flattish in the first half and stronger in the second half of the year, in line with economic forecast. We were pleased with how we started off 2010. Even with the extra winter storms, February sales are trending to our plan.  For fiscal 2010, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations to increase by approximately 15% to $1.79. Included in our earnings per share guidance is modest gross margin expansion and expense leverage. We continue to learn more about the fixed variable nature of our expenses. For fiscal 2010, you should expect expenses to grow at approximately 60% of our sales growth rate. And here, we're talking about adjusted expenses.  Finally, we have not included the impact of share repurchases in our earnings per share guidance. And we'll touch on share repurchases in just a moment.For fiscal 2010, we project cash flow from the business of roughly $5.4 billion. This forecast assumes we refinanced $1 billion of senior notes that come due in August of 2010.  We will use our cash to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders. Our capital spending plan for 2010 is $1,250,000,000 reflecting $180 million for new stores, $635 million for our existing U.S. stores and supply chain, $350 million for IT and $85 million for our non-U.S. businesses.We've just announced a 5% increase in our dividend and we'll use our cash to fund our dividend, which for the year, approximates $1.6 billion. We have $12.5 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. It is our intent to use excess cash to repurchase shares over the course of the year. Depending on the timing of our repurchases, we should see some earnings-per-share benefit arising from this activity in 2010.  The debt-financed portion of our repurchase program remains on hold, principally because we're early in our recovery. As our business gains momentum, we will revisit the debt-financed portion of our share repurchase program.  So thank you very much for your participation in today's call. And we're now ready for questions."

Carol, it's helpful to think about expense dollar growth at 60% of sales growth. Is that kind of implies 1.5% dollar growth for the coming year. I guess my question is can you give other than that if the comp comes in flat? Because obviously the performance over the past year's been far better than that. And would you think that from here on out you'd need 1.5 comp to   leverage expenses, given that embedded dollar growth? And just a little bit more color on what might drive you to exceed those expectations? Again given the strong performance you've already had and expense reductions that have already been taken."

As we look forward to 2010, there are a couple of things that you need to think about as you",316,"Well, first, thank you regarding your comments on our expense control. We have taken out over $1.3 billion of cost over the past two years. So thank you for that. As we look forward to 2010, there are a couple of things that you need to think about as you think about expenses. First as you know, payroll is our biggest expense, and we do have an activity-based model. As we build out our sales growth plan for 2010, we assume early on in the year, more of the sales growth will come from transactions and ticket. And then as the year progresses, we'll see more of the sales growth coming from ticket. Transactions drive payroll in the stores as you can appreciate. So clearly depending on the composition of these sales growth, we have some opportunities to leverage payroll. We do have some expense pressure coming at us in 2010 that we didn't have in 2009. For example, our medical costs are increasing by about 9% in 2010. We'll do everything we can do to mitigate that pressure, but we planned for that because we think that's what it may be. We have some other cost pressures coming at us. States are hungry for money. We know they're coming at us for more property taxes. We've got some computer maintenance costs coming at us because of all the IT investments that we've made. So we factored all those cost pressures coming in at us. But we can be pretty nimble on the expense structure as you've seen us. So we'll always strive to do better, but we're giving our best estimate of cost for 2010. And then one last comment, and I know I'm going on and on, but one last comment about expenses, is sales growth is better than the guidance that we have given you, that we should do better on the leverage."

As you think about the gross margin expansion, it's really coming from our focused-based portfolio approach and all the efforts that Craig and the merchants and the logistics team are doing to drive out cost. So we are getting smarter about our approach to merchandising, it's driving margin expansion, we're pleased with the expansion that we reported this past couple of years.

If you look at lumber in the quarter, certainly, the lumber market did increase during the timeframe, both on framing lumber and panel, with significantly more driven on framing than in panel. But the total impact to our business in the quarter was six basis points. We have to remember, right now the supply is offset by lack of demand, if you will. So there's not a lot of demand out there obviously in the construction industry. And so what used to be a low-teens penetration for us is around the 7% penetration today. And it is really not a huge impact at this point, certainly in the quarter. And as we look forward, we'll continue to monitor and watch. But today, the rising costs really is due to smaller log decks that are out there because there's just not a ton of demand. There is wet forest in the South, which make it difficult to pull logs out. And then you have pulp and paper mills competing with sawmills for what product is available. So that's kind of helping to drive the cost side of the market.

Sales for the fourth quarter were $14.6 billion, essentially flat to last year. Comps sales were positive 1.2% with our U.S. stores posting a negative 1.1% comp for the quarter and our International stores contributing a positive 2.3% comp.  Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.18. As Carol will detail, we had some unusual items impact our fourth quarter earnings, in particular, the write down of our remaining equity interest in HD Supply. Adjusting for the impact of HD Supply, earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.24.Our business improved more than we expected in the fourth quarter. Of our top 40 markets in the U.S., all but two showed improvement in the fourth quarter on a comp-sales basis. Every one of our regions showed comp sales improvement in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And our Northern division, our largest division with eight regions, had a positive comp for the quarter. We also saw sequential improvement in California and Florida with a return to positive comps in some of the markets there. Our business also performed very well in Canada in the fourth quarter with double digit positive comps. This was a function of four things: Better performance by the business, recovery from a rocky start last year with the new enterprise IT implementation, improving economic conditions and a government stimulus program designed to support homeowners updating their houses. And in Mexico, the business once again achieved positive comps for the quarter in the year despite a very tough economic environment. We also made solid progress on our key initiatives. Last month, we opened our 12th Rapid Deployment Center or RDC in Topeka, Kansas. RDC has now served over 65% of our U.S. store base, and we're on track to reach our goal of serving 100% by the end of 2010. Craig and the merchandising team continue to develop and integrate our merchandising tools, and we can already see some of the benefits of improved Assortment Management and forecasting in our inventory and markdown control.As Matt Carey, our IT leader, has described, we are years behind other retailers in these areas, but we are on a path to catch up over the next five years. Given the success we've seen with our internal tools, we're not contemplating any third-party U.S.-based enterprise-wide system. Marvin and our store operations team made a significant statement last year by retraining all of our associates, everyone, on customer service, launching our customer first program. Our Net Promoter score improved 800 basis points over the year and is now at an almost 70%. And we gained over 100 basis points of market share for the year, something we have not done in quite a while.So all of this gives us some cause for optimism in 2010. At the same time, we recognized that we have more work to do as a company. And that the economy is not out of the woods yet, particularly in our market. So we're not projecting robust growth. Private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP has stopped its dramatic and historic decline, but still remains well below the 60-year average. The housing industry remains at distressed levels, mortgage defaults continue to increase, unemployment remains high and our pro customers are still under pressure. Our expectation is that 2010 will be a transitional year. For the year, we are anticipating approximately 2 1/2% sales growth and 15% growth in earnings per share from continuing operations. We expect to see relatively-flat growth in the first half of the year with more momentum in the second half.Calling the year transitional doesn't sound very exciting, but we've been waiting for this transition for a long time. We made the decision three years ago to focus on our core business and invest in our stores and associates during a difficult economic environment. We've returned to the core values of our business. And we're proud of the fact that even in the tough economic environment of 2009, we had record success sharing for all of the associates.  In fact, for the second half of 2009, 93% of our stores qualified for success sharing.  Going forward, we will continue to invest in our associates and our business. And we will also continue to focus on disciplined capital allocation and increasing shareholder return. Today, the Board of Directors and I are pleased to announce our first dividend increase since the third quarter of 2006, reinforcing our confidence in the business and our commitment to our shareholders. And it is our intent to continue to increase our dividend every year. Further, it is also our intent to use our excess cash to repurchase shares, again, evidence of our disciplined approach. I want to thank our associates for all their hard work in 2009 and their commitment and dedication in the year ahead.  With that, let me turn the call over to Craig."

We're pleased with our continued progress in the business and performance in the fourth quarter. We saw a significant improvement across many product categories and regions, as well as key performance metrics, including comp sales, transactions and big-ticket sales. Kitchen and bath, paint, flooring and plumbing delivered a positive comp. And we flat comp in building materials, garden and millwork. Lumber, hardware and electrical reported negative comps. Total customer transactions were $288 million in the fourth quarter, up 2.1% compared to last year.Transactions for ticket for $50 and below, roughly 20% of our business in the U.S., were positive 3.2%. This increase was driven by continued strength in basic DIY repair and maintenance products, such as plumbing, cleaning and lightbulbs. In addition, we saw strength in simple decor projects, which led to positive growth in categories like ceramic tile, carpet, interior paint, closets and bath fixtures, which also contributed to our overall transaction growth in the quarter.Transactions for tickets of $900 and above, which also represent approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were down less than 1%, a significant improvement compared to the double-digit declines in previous quarters in 2009. This improvement was largely driven by a stronger than anticipated response to outstanding values in categories such as appliances, water heaters and windows. We were also pleased with the positive trend in our installed sales.  Our total company average ticket for the fourth quarter was $50.01, down 1.7% from last year. Our comp average ticket declined by 1%.  The improving trend in total average ticket was driven by the improvement in big-ticket transactions as I mentioned earlier. The average ticket also benefited from strong sales in Canada resulting in part from the Canadian tax relief in a large selection of home improvement products. However, while our trends are getting better, we continue to experience pressure in big-ticket construction-related categories, such as dimensional lumber, concrete, gypsum, pneumatic tools and fasteners.We are executing our merchandising transformation to provide a great everyday value to our customers. From where we started, we are a third of the way through the implementation of our portfolio strategy and the continued use of merchandising tools allows us to enhance and optimize our performance. This, coupled with our Supply chain transformation to get the right product in the right place at the right time, was the foundation behind our solid quarter's performance.The success of our Seasonal business is a great example of how we leveraged our merchandising and supply chain transformation during the quarter. The combination of better planning tools and solid execution drove strong performance against our plan in products such as snow removal, fireplace and decorative holiday.  We finished the year in a clean inventory position and seasonal goods while having spent less on markdowns compared to last year. Investments in our portfolio strategy, merchandising tools, supply chain development and customer service drove continued market share growth in the quarter. Our U.S. market share has grown over 100 basis points on a rolling 12-month basis, despite closing our Expo businesses in early 2009. Based on an independent third-party tracking of consumer activity, we gained unit share in six of our 13 departments during the quarter. As we look forward to 2010, we are well positioned across the entire store. We will meet our customers' needs in energy efficiency and conservation by offering them products, such as the best-rated CFL bulbs on the market or WaterSense-rated profit [ph] across our entire product line up. For indoor and outdoor projects requiring power tools, we offer the leading cordless brand for pros with DEWALT, along with a strong exclusive power tool line up, including Milwaukee, Makita, RIDGID and Ryobi.  In décor, we provide our customers the number one paint in BEHR PREMIUM ULTRA (sic) [BEHR PREMIUM PLUS ULTRA] , as recently rated by a leading consumer magazine. Additionally, the Martha Stewart program has been expanded into patio, cleaning and paint.And finally, as customers get ready for spring, we have a fantastic line up of seasonal product offerings to meet their lawn and garden needs, with leading and exclusive brands of Honda and Toro Motors, Cub Cadet tractors, ECHO, Ryobi and Homelite portable power products, and Proven Winners, the most recognized live goods brand by garden enthusiasts.  Over the past three years, we have redefined our merchandising strategy, which includes the repositioning of our brand, creation of new tools to drive efficiency and implemented new capabilities. And we're not done. There's more to come. As we look forward to 2010, we are well positioned to deliver quality and value for our customers.  And now I would like to turn the call over to Carol."
278679,96454731,51266,"The Home Depot, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2010",2010-02-23,"Earnings Calls","The Home Depot, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. Our financial results for the quarter are distorted by a few factors that I'd like to discuss and get out of the way before I cover our results.First, we reported $41 million of earnings from discontinued operations",1451,"Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. Our financial results for the quarter are distorted by a few factors that I'd like to discuss and get out of the way before I cover our results.First, we reported $41 million of earnings from discontinued operations primarily related to our working capital settlement with HD Supply. For the purpose of today's discussion, we will focus our remarks on earnings from continuing operations.  Earnings from continuing operations were impacted by a $163 million write down of our investment in HD Supply, which is reflected in other expense. We hold a 12.5% equity investment in HD Supply but have written that investment down to zero as we believe it has been other than temporarily impaired.  Also as you may know, we had a reduction in force in the fourth quarter and announced plans to close three non-strategic locations. The financial impact of those actions was not significant. So with that, in the fourth quarter, sales were $14.6 billion, a 0.3% decrease from last year, reflecting fewer stores than one year ago. Comp or same-store sales were positive 1.2% for the quarter. A weaker U.S. dollar drove 130 basis points of comp growth and positive comp sales in our Canadian and Mexican businesses drove 100 basis points of comp growth in the quarter.  This combined international comp growth of 2.3% was offset by negative comps in our U.S. stores of 1.1%. Total company comps were positive 1.2% in November, negative 0.2% in December, and positive 2.2% in January. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 0.3% in November, negative 2.3% in December and negative 1.5% in January.For the year, our sales declined 7.2% to $66.2 billion. Excluding the impact of sales related to the wind down of our Expo businesses, adjusted sales for the year declined 7.5% to $66 billion. For fiscal 2009, total company comp sales were negative 6.6% and comps for U.S. stores were negative 6.2%.  In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 34.4%, an increase of 45 basis points from last year. Our gross margin expansion was due to the following factors: First, our U.S. business reported 33 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter due primarily to lower markdowns than last year. Our holiday category alone contributed 21 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. Second, we realized 12 basis points of margin expansion from our Canadian business, as we didn't repeat certain promotions and we left the disruption we experienced last year when we implemented score for SAP. For the year, we experienced 22 basis points of gross margin expansion. Turning to operating expenses, for the quarter and the year, it is easiest to compare our year-over-year performance by looking at adjusted operating expenses as a percent of sales. And when I say adjusted operating expenses, we adjust expenses for strategic charges taken in 2008 and 2009. We detailed the financial impact of those charges in an exhibit to our press release, which sets forth reported and adjusted results for both years. So on an adjusted basis, for the fourth quarter, operating expenses as a percent of sales were 29.4%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year. We leveraged expenses primarily because of positive same-store sales, but we also saw continued benefits from the changes we've implemented to improve spending efficiency across our business. On an adjusted basis for fiscal 2009, operating expenses as a percent of sales were 26.4%, an increase of 18 basis points from last year.For the year, we deleverage expenses by about three basis points for every point of negative comp, considerably better than we planned at the beginning of the year. Our income tax provision rate was 25.9% in the fourth quarter reflecting a $47 million benefit arising from global tax planning. Our effective tax rate was 34.2% for the year, which includes both the fourth quarter tax benefit and a favorable foreign tax settlement we reported in the second quarter of 2009.Earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.18 for the fourth quarter. Excluding the HD Supply write down, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.24 for the fourth quarter. For the year, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.55. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.66, down 6.7% from last year.Now moving to our operational metrics, during the quarter, we opened three new stores and closed one store for an ending store count of 2,244. At the end of the fourth quarter, selling square footage was 235 million, a 1.3% decrease from last year. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the fourth quarter were $245, up 1.7% from last year. For fiscal 2009, sales per square foot were $279.Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the year, retail inventory was $10.2 billion, down 4.5% from last year. On a per-store basis, inventory was down 3.3% to last year. Inventory turnover was 4.1x, up one-tenths from last year. This was our first annual increase in the inventory turnover since 2001, a true team effort. And we view this as solid performance as our in-stock position is at a record high level.We ended the quarter with $41 billion in assets, including $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. This is an increase of approximately $900 million in cash and short-term investments from the end of fiscal 2008, reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $5.4 billion, offset by $1.8 billion used to repay senior notes that came due in September and December, $1.5 billion of dividends paid, $966 million of capital expenditures and $213 million of share repurchases.In the fourth quarter, we used excess cash to repurchase $115 million or 4.1 million shares of outstanding stock. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 10.7%. On an adjusted basis, return on invested capital was 11.1%, 70 basis points higher than what we reported for the third quarter of fiscal 2009.As Craig mentioned, we performed well against our internal expectations in 2009. And as we look to 2010, we expect our performance to improve as macro economic conditions improve. We've detailed our guidance in our press release, so let me just hit the high points.  First, let me remind you that we guide off of GAAP. We based our working estimate on a number of external factors. And we're not expecting a robust recovery. For the year, we project that our sales will increase by approximately 2.5%, driven primarily by positive same-store sales.We plan to open just six stores in 2010. We expect sales growth to be flattish in the first half and stronger in the second half of the year, in line with economic forecast. We were pleased with how we started off 2010. Even with the extra winter storms, February sales are trending to our plan.  For fiscal 2010, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations to increase by approximately 15% to $1.79. Included in our earnings per share guidance is modest gross margin expansion and expense leverage. We continue to learn more about the fixed variable nature of our expenses. For fiscal 2010, you should expect expenses to grow at approximately 60% of our sales growth rate. And here, we're talking about adjusted expenses.  Finally, we have not included the impact of share repurchases in our earnings per share guidance. And we'll touch on share repurchases in just a moment.For fiscal 2010, we project cash flow from the business of roughly $5.4 billion. This forecast assumes we refinanced $1 billion of senior notes that come due in August of 2010.  We will use our cash to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders. Our capital spending plan for 2010 is $1,250,000,000 reflecting $180 million for new stores, $635 million for our existing U.S. stores and supply chain, $350 million for IT and $85 million for our non-U.S. businesses.We've just announced a 5% increase in our dividend and we'll use our cash to fund our dividend, which for the year, approximates $1.6 billion. We have $12.5 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. It is our intent to use excess cash to repurchase shares over the course of the year. Depending on the timing of our repurchases, we should see some earnings-per-share benefit arising from this activity in 2010. The debt-financed portion of our repurchase program remains on hold, principally because we're early in our recovery. As our business gains momentum, we will revisit the debt-financed portion of our share repurchase program. So thank you very much for your participation in today's call. And we're now ready for questions."

Carol, it's helpful to think about expense dollar growth at 60% of sales growth. Is that kind of implies 1.5% dollar growth for the coming year. I guess my question is can you give better than that if the comp comes in flat? Because obviously the performance over the past years has been far better than that. And would you think that from here on out you'd need 1.5 comp to leverage expenses, given that embedded dollar growth? And just a little bit more color on what might drive you to exceed those expectations? Again given the strong performance you've already had and expense reductions that have already been taken."

We have taken out over $1.3 billion of cost over the past two years, so thank you for that. As we look forward to 2010, there are a couple of things that you need to think about as you",316,"Well, first, thank you regarding your comments on our expense control. We have taken out over $1.3 billion of cost over the past two years, so thank you for that. As we look forward to 2010, there are a couple of things that you need to think about as you think about expenses. First as you know, payroll is our biggest expense, and we do have an activity-based model. As we build out our sales growth plan for 2010, we assume early on in the year, more of the sales growth will come from transactions and ticket. And then as the year progresses, we'll see more of the sales growth coming from ticket. Transactions drive payroll in the stores as you can appreciate. So clearly depending on the composition of the sales growth, we have some opportunities to leverage payroll. We do have some expense pressure coming at us in 2010 that we didn't have in 2009. For example, our medical costs are increasing by about 9% in 2010. We'll do everything we can do to mitigate that pressure, but we planned for that because we think that's what it may be. We have some other cost pressures coming at us. States are hungry for money. We know they're coming at us for more property taxes. We've got some computer maintenance costs coming at us because of all the IT investments that we've made. So we factored all those cost pressures coming in at us. But we can be pretty nimble on the expense structure as you've seen us. So we'll always strive to do better, but we're giving our best estimate of cost for 2010. And then one last comment, and I know I'm going on and on, but one last comment about expenses, is sales growth is better than the guidance that we have given you, that we should do better on the leverage."

If you look at lumber in the quarter, certainly, the lumber market did increase during the timeframe, both on framing lumber and panel, with significantly more driven on framing than in panel. But the total impact to our business in the quarter was six basis points. We have to remember, right now the supply is offset by lack of demand, if you will. So there's not a lot of demand out there obviously in the construction industry. And so what used to be a low-teens penetration for us is around the 7% penetration today. And it is really not a huge impact at this point, certainly in the quarter. And as we look forward, we'll continue to monitor and watch. But today, the rising costs really is due to smaller log decks that are out there because there's just not a ton of demand. There is wet forest in the South, which make it difficult to pull logs out. And then you have pulp and paper mills competing with sawmills for what product is available. So that's kind of helping to drive the cost side of the market.

This represents the first quarter of positive comps for the U.S. since the fourth quarter of 2005.
From a geographic perspective, all but three of our top 40 U.S. markets positively comped in the first quarter, and all of our regions positively comped except the Gulf region which is still impacted by hurricane related comparisons. We also had a return to positive comps in Florida and California. Overall sales were better than we planned for the quarter, and we continue to focus on improving our underlying business performance. As Craig and Carol will describe in more detail, for the quarter, we levered our operating expenses in line with our targets; improved our gross margin rate through better assortment management; and improved inventory turns.
We also made significant progress on our key infrastructure initiatives. We opened our 13th rapid deployment center or RDC in Columbia, South Carolina. RDCs now serve 70% of our U.S. stores and we’re on track to reach our goal of serving 100% by the end of the year. It’s important that our supply chain team is on track on the network build-out. It’s even more important that they maintain that schedule as they also improve the performance at the existing facilities.
This spring season has seen some unusually erratic weather from record snow in the mid-Atlantic to unseasonably warm temperatures in April in New England. The flexibility and responsiveness of the supply chain were critical in meeting these changing needs. We improved our inventory turns in the quarter and improved our targeted in stock levels during a challenging season.
Craig and the merchandising team continued to integrate new merchandising tools as part of the overall merchandising transformation. For example, over the last three years we have steadily increased the portion of SKUs that are on centralized, automated replenishment. This year we began the process of upgrading the tools used for the centralized forecasting systems. These tools significantly improved the accuracy of the forecasting for seasonal products during the first quarter. Based on this success, we’ll be migrating centrally automated SKUs to the new forecasting tools by the end of the second quarter.
Marvin and the store operations team worked to continue to improve the customer service levels in our stores. Last year, as we described, we re-trained every associate in the company on our customer service expectations, what we call our Customer First program. This year we repeated and refreshed that training to emphasize that this isn’t a temporary program, but part of our ongoing commitment. We’ve seen consistent improvement in our net promoter score since we initiated Customer First, and it was particularly significant that we again saw an improvement in the first quarter, 600 basis points over last year, even as our transactions increased 4.2%.
On the international front, our Canadian business delivered a positive comp and significantly improved its overall business performance. Last year’s first quarter was negatively impacted by the major ERP implementation we undertook in Canada. That is now behind us. Our Mexican business also had another solid quarter, with single digit positive comps, and our team in Mexico is helping on a number of U.S., Hispanic focused efforts. For example, our head of marketing in Mexico helped lead our review of Hispanic marketing in the U.S. In China, our business performed to plan as we continue to refine our business model for that country. 
So there were a number of positives for us in the quarter, but there were also signs of caution. Over the last several years we’ve looked at private fixed residential investment, PFRI, as a percent of GDP as a useful benchmark. The most recent PFRI data showed a decline, reversing its pattern of improvement over the prior two quarters. The good news is that that obviously our results didn’t track with PFRI results. This may be an indicator that the PFRI data will have less correlation to results as the home improvement market recovers.
But we’re also mindful that a significant part of our growth in the first quarter came from seasonal consumer spending. Our data analytics did not show positive comp growth from our pro customers. The rate of decline was low single digit so there was improvement, but this core part of our business has still not returned to positive growth. To date, this is consistent with our expectation that average ticket will lag the growth in transactions.
As Carol will describe in more detail, we have increased our earnings per share and sales guidance for the year based on our outperformance to plan in the first quarter. I want to thank our associates for all their hard work in the first quarter. Based on this quarter’s results, over 95% of our stores would be eligible for [successionary], our profit sharing program for hourly associates.
With that, let me turn the call over to Craig.

We had a strong quarter compared to our expectations and we saw encouraging signs. First, a solid, broad based transaction performance across the store; second, the seasonal businesses performed well, leveraging the supply chain capabilities and merchandising tools developed over the last few years; and third, our core repair and maintenance business remains strong. As anticipated, the challenge in the first quarter continued to be big ticket, which remains under pressure from both the pro and discretionary spend. 
On a departmental business, every department posted positive comps for the quarter. Garden, lumber, paint, electrical and lighting outperformed the company’s average comp for the quarter. Plumbing, building materials, hardware, flooring, kitchen and bath and mill work, while positive, were under the company average comp for the quarter.
From a commodities standpoint, we did experience inflation in lumber and copper in the quarter which positively impacted U.S. comp sales by approximately 100 basis points. As you may be aware, structural panel and framing lumber prices are up substantially from a year ago due to supply constraints. 
Overall, total customer transactions were $323 million, up 4.2% compared to last year. This is our largest year-over-year increase since the fourth quarter of 2005. Our total comp transactions increased by 4.4%. The seasonal business was a key driver to this performance, and with the exception of kitchens, we saw transaction growth in all our businesses. Transactions for tickets [inaudible] $50, roughly 20% of the business in the U.S., were up 4.7% in the first quarter.
As we have seen for several quarters, the simple décor and general repair businesses have remained resilient and been contributors to transaction growth. General repair continues to perform well with categories like caulk, safety and security, roofing, pipe and fittings all exceeding the company average comp performance. Simple décor projects like paint, faucets and ceramic tile all had positive comps, and are examples of the continued strength that we see in these small project categories.
As I mentioned earlier, our seasonal businesses also performed well, and our enhanced supply chain and merchandising tools allowed us to meet the demand throughout the quarter. Landscape, live goods, fertilizer and chemicals all performed positively as customers were excited to get outdoors and take on simple DIY projects to spruce up their yards. Grills, portable power, walk behind mowers, patios, all posted double digit positive comps in the quarter. Our spring selling period represents a highly variable portion of our business, and our tools enabled us to have the right products in the right place at the right time.
For the last three years, Mark Holifield and his team have been working to optimize our supply chain and replenishment capabilities, resulting in shorter lead times and improved in stock rates. As Frank mentioned, we implemented an enhanced replenishment forecasting tool for all of our seasonal categories. The next step is to drive space planning integration. This effort will link our assortment maintenance, forecasting and Plan-O-Gramming tools to our replenishment system. 
While we’re pleased with our first quarter results, we have yet to see a clear recovery in our pro business or big ticket discretionary categories such as special order kitchens. These factors continue to pressure our comp average ticket during the quarter, which was down 1.3% to $52.01 in the U.S. retail. Our total company average ticket was flat to last year, and on a comp basis was up 0.4%. In the U.S. transactions for tickets $900 and above, which represent approximately 20% of sales, were down 1.4%.
While still negative, our pro business is showing signs of improvement. In fact, we saw positive growth in some highly penetrated pro categories such as fasteners, hand tools, power tool accessories, wire and wiring devices. Recently we began to see unit improvements in categories like plywood and concrete, yet still negative for the total quarter. 
We know the efforts we’ve taken to improve our customer service, assortment and store environment have been resonating with our customers. Through March, our U.S. market share is up 83 basis points on a rolling 12 month basis. And to give you two examples of where share growth is coming from based on an independent third party tracking of consumer activity, we saw 140 basis points of market share gain in paint and 150 basis points of market share gain in electrical.
As Frank mentioned at the beginning of this year, our expectation for 2010 is that this will be a transitional year. We expect to see greater improvement in transactions, prior to ticket recovery. We started the year off well and feel that we are well positioned to deliver on our commitment.
And now I would like to turn the call over to Carol.

278679,99886714,62002,"The Home Depot, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 18, 2010",2010-05-18,"Earnings Calls","The Home Depot, Inc.","Executives","Thank you Craig and hello everyone. In the first quarter, sales were $16.9 billion, a 4.3% increase from last year. Excluding the $221 million of sales related to the closing of our Expo businesses during the first quarter of 2009, sales increased 5.7%. C",915,"Thank you Craig and hello everyone. In the first quarter, sales were $16.9 billion, a 4.3% increase from last year. Excluding the $221 million of sales related to the closing of our Expo businesses during the first quarter of 2009, sales increased 5.7%. Comp or same-store sales were positive 4.8% for the quarter, with positive comps of 0.2% in February; positive 5.7% in March; and positive 7% in April. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 3.3% for the quarter, with U.S. comps of negative 1.2% in February; positive 3.9% in March; and positive 5.5% in April. 
In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34.4%, an increase of 67 basis points from last year. Our gross margin expansion was due to the following factors. First, our U.S. business reported 41 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, of which 12 basis points was driven by lower markdowns than last year as we saw benefits from better assortment management and fewer promotions. We also lapped markdowns taken last year as part of the closing of our Expo businesses, which negatively affected gross margin by 29 basis points in the first quarter of 2009.
Second, we realized 26 basis points of margin expansion from our international businesses, principally Canada, as we lapped the disruption we experienced last year when we implemented Score, or SAP. 
On a reported basis, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 102 basis points to 26.6%, but the comparison is distorted due to strategic charges taken in the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the strategic charges from last year’s results, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 48 basis points. Our operating leverage was primarily the result of positive same-store sales. Total expenses increased by a factor of 67% of our sales growth rate, slightly higher than our rule of thumb. But we planned for this, as we pulled forward some spring staffing and marketing expenditures. We also experienced higher bank card interchange fees due to a higher penetration of bank cards, our most expensive form of credit. We expect expense growth as a factor of sales growth to moderate throughout the balance of the year.
Interest and other expense for the first quarter totaled $189 million. This includes a $51 million pretax charge related to the revaluation of our HD supply guarantee. In connection with the sale of HD Supply in 2007, we guaranteed a $1 billion senior secure amortizing term loan. In March, we agreed to an 18 month extension of our guarantee, extending it to April, 2014. Accordingly, we revalued our guarantee and increased the fair value liability by $51 million, which had a negative impact to first quarter earnings per share of $0.02. 
Our income tax provision rate was 35% in the first quarter, reflecting certain favorable state tax settlements. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.5%. 
Earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.43, up 43.3% from last year. Excluding the $51 million charge taken in the first quarter of 2010, and the strategic charges taken in the first quarter of 2009, earnings per share increased 28.6% to $0.45 compared to last year’s adjusted earnings per share of $0.35. 
Now moving to our operational metrics, during the first quarter we opened one new store and closed one store, for an ending store count of 2,244. At the end of the first quarter, selling squarer footage was 235 million. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the first quarter were $288, up roughly 5.4% year-over-year.
Now turning to the balance sheet, inventory remains a good news story. At the end of the quarter, retail inventory was $11.5 billion, up $51 million from a year ago. On a per store basis, inventory was flat to last year. Inventory turns were 4.1 times, up from 3.9 times a year ago. 
We ended the quarter with $43.6 billion in assets, including $2.4 billion in cash and short term investments. This is an increase of approximately $1 billion in cash and short term investments from the end of fiscal 2009, reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $2.1 billion, offset by $508 million used for share repurchases; $399 million used for dividends; and $167 million of capital expenditures. We have approximately $9.7 billion of outstanding debt of which $1 billion comes due in August of 2010. At this point, it is our intent to refinance this debt maturity. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 11.5%, 150 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
As Frank mentioned, we performed well against our internal expectations for the first quarter. Based on our results, we are raising our guidance for fiscal 2010. Remember that we guide off of GAAP. We are calling for fiscal 2010 sales to increase approximately 3.5%, with earnings per share from continuing operations increasing approximately 21% to $1.88. Within this guidance, we now expect our operating margin to reach approximately 8.25% for the year. Finally, we are not including the impact of any additional share repurchases, outside of those executed in the first quarter, in our earnings per share guidance, but it is our intent to continue to use excess cash to repurchase shares throughout the remainder of fiscal 2010.
So thank you for your participation in today’s call, and Cindy we are now ready for questions.

So certainly having the right assortments in the right place, making adjustments, continually year-over-year using our assortment tool we believe has allowed us to help deliver that performance. And then likewise, we’re also seeing a benefit in that from a gross margin dollar productivity standpoint. And so those sales are delivering gross margin improvement, we have less markdowns in these categories. As we track sell through in them on a week-to-week basis, we’re taking less markdowns as you move through the season to really drive the inventory productivity. And so it’s really a benefit on both sides, Deb.

We leveraged payroll by 23 basis points in the quarter. That’s good. It could have been better. We pulled forward some staffing deliberately because we were having such great sales. If you look at all the other expenses, we’re pretty much in line what we expected in terms of leverage. Here’s where we didn’t lever. We pulled forward marketing dollars in terms of advertising. We had costs associated with our Martha Stewart rollout and some other marketing expenses, if you will, about $31 million of more expense year-over-year, so we didn’t lever that. 
Another area that was a cost pressure for us in the first quarter was higher interchange fees associated with bank cards. We had a really interesting phenomenon happen in the first quarter, where the penetration of our private label card dropped by 400 basis points from 26% to 22% and the penetration of bank cards increased by 300 basis points from 35% to 38%. Bank cards are our highest form of tender, so that cost us about $14 million in the quarter. But generally, if I go back to all of the other expenses, they performed as we expected.

As you will note, in the first quarter, well at the end of last year I should say, we increased our dividend by 5%, the first time since 2006. And Frank said that it is his intent to raise the dividend every year. So dividends are an important part of our capital distribution. Based on the guidance that we gave this morning, our payout is about 50% of our earnings. 
We will then use excess cash to return it to the shareholders through share repurchases. We started our share repurchase program in the first quarter, back in the market. There’s just a do-ability factor, so we bought back $500 million. We weren’t signaling anything. That’s how much we got done. We do have a lot of cash and it’s our intent to continue to use that cash appropriately by repurchasing shares.

So it was more about visibility, customer engagement and making sure we help customers solve project questions. So that provided visibility. So you don’t necessarily add associates, it’s just associates become more available and more visible.
We also talked about an initiative where we’re shifting labor from task to service. Last year we shifted the equivalent of almost four full time associates from jobs that customers didn’t see in the back room to on the sales floor, driving service. So you actually saw a net gain of service associates without a net gain in total associates. We also added in the first quarter approximately one part time associate to the floor with that shift from pass to service. You know Carol talked about how we pulled forward in the season additional staff. Because sales picked up, we had seasonal hiring. So I think you also saw that as an impact as well from the visibility of associates.

So there’s credit availability with our private label card. I think that’s important to point out.
What we are seeing is that many consumers are consolidating the number of cards that they have in their wallet. I know I have. And moving to cards that offer reward. Now as you may know, with the Card Act that was enacted earlier this year, the guiding proposition associated with our private label card changed. It used to be if you spent $299, it was no interest, no payments for six months every day. With the Card Act, it’s still no interest but it is minimum payments. So the value proposition has changed and for a consumer they may say hmm, this is one value proposition I can use my XYZ card and get mileage or points, etc., so we think there’s just been a change there. Now we like our private label card as you know because it is the lowest cost of tender from a credit card perspective in our stores. So we’ve got a number of ideas underway to create new value propositions to get the consumer to use our card. And we’ll be talking to you about those over the next few quarters.

Sales for the first quarter were $16.9 billion, up 4.3% from last year. Comp sales were positive 4.8%, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.43.Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 3.3%. This represen",851,"Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $16.9 billion, up 4.3% from last year. Comp sales were positive 4.8%, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.43.
Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 3.3%. This represents the first quarter of positive comps for the U.S. since the fourth quarter of 2005. From a geographic perspective, all but three of our top 40 U.S. markets positively comped in the first quarter, and all of our regions positively comped except the Gulf region, which is still impacted by hurricane-related comparisons. We also had a return to positive comps in Florida and California. Overall, sales were better than we planned for the quarter, and we continue to focus on improving our underlying business performance.
As Craig and Carol will describe in more detail, for the quarter, we levered our operating expenses in line with our targets, improved our gross margin rate through better assortment management and improved inventory turns. We also made significant progress on our key infrastructure initiatives. We opened our 13th Rapid Deployment Center, or RDC, in Columbia, South Carolina. RDC has now served 70% of our U.S. stores, and we're on track to reach our goal of serving 100% by the end of the year. It's important that our supply chain team is on track on the network build-out. It's even more important that they maintain that schedule as they also improve the performance of the existing facilities.
This spring season has seen some unusually erratic weather, from record snow in the Mid-Atlantic to unseasonably warm temperatures in April in New England. The flexibility and responsiveness of the supply chain were critical in meeting these changing needs. We improved our inventory turns in the quarter and improved our targeted in-stock levels during a challenging season.
Craig and the merchandising team continued to integrate new merchandising tools as part of the overall merchandising transformation. For example, over the last three years, we have steadily increased the portion of SKUs that are on centralized automated replenishment. This year, we began the process of upgrading the tools used for the centralized forecasting system. These tools significantly improve the accuracy of the forecasting for seasonal products during the first quarter. Based on this success, we'll be migrating centrally-automated SKUs to the new forecasting tools by the end of the second quarter.
Marvin and the store operations team worked to continue to improve the customer service levels in our stores. Last year, as we described, we retrained every associate in the company on our customer service expectations, what we call, our Customer First program. This year, we repeated and refreshed that training to emphasize that this isn't a temporary program but part of our ongoing commitment.
We've seen consistent improvement in our Net Promoter Score since we initiated Customer First. And it was particularly significant that we again saw an improvement in the first quarter, 600 basis points over last year even as our transactions increased 4.2%. 
On the international front, our Canadian business delivered a positive comp and significantly improved its overall business performance. Last year's first quarter was negatively impacted by the major ERP [enterprise resource planning] implementation we undertook in Canada. That is now behind us.
Our Mexican business also had another solid quarter with single-digit positive comps. And our team in Mexico is helping on a number of U.S. Hispanic-focused efforts. For example, our Head of Marketing in Mexico helped lead our review of Hispanic marketing in the U.S. In China, our business performed to plan as we continue to refine our business model for that country.
So there were a number of positives for us in the quarter. But there are also signs of caution. Over the last several years, we've looked at Private Fixed Residential Investment, PFRI, as a percent of GDP as a useful benchmark. The most recent PFRI data showed a decline, reversing its pattern of improvement over the prior two quarters. The good news is that, obviously, our results didn't track with PFRI results. This may be an indicator that the PFRI data will have less correlation to results as the home improvement market recovers. But we're also mindful that a significant part of our growth in the first quarter came from seasonal consumer spending. 
Our data analytics did not show positive comp growth for more Pro customers. The rate of decline was low single digit so there was improvement, but this core part of our business has still not returned to positive growth. To date, this is consistent with our expectation that average ticket will lag the growth in transactions.
As Carol will describe in more detail, we had increased our earnings per share and sales guidance for the year based on our outperformance to plan in the first quarter. I want to thank our associates for all their hard work in the first quarter. Based on this quarter's results, over 95% of our stores would be eligible for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for hourly associates.
With that, let me turn the call over to Craig."

First, a solid, broad-based transaction performance across the store. Second, the Seasonal businesses performed well, leveraging the supply chain capabilities and merchandising tools developed over the last few years. And third, our core Repair and Maintenance business remains strong. As anticipated, the challenge in the first quarter continued to be big ticket, which remains under pressure from both the Pro and discretionary spend. 
On a departmental basis, every department posted positive comps for the quarter. Garden, Lumber, Paint, Electrical and Lighting outperformed the company's average comp for the quarter. Plumbing, Building Materials, Hardware, Flooring, Kitchen and Bath and Millwork, while positive, were under the company average comp for the quarter.
From a commodity standpoint, we did experience inflation of lumber and copper in the quarter, which positively impacted U.S. comp sales by approximately 100 basis points. As you may be aware, structural panel and framing lumber prices are up substantially from a year ago due to supply constraints. 
Overall, total customer transactions were $323 million, up 4.2% compared to last year. This is our largest year-over-year increase since the fourth quarter of 2005. Our total comp transactions increased by 4.4%. The Seasonal business was a key driver to this performance. And with the exception of Kitchens, we saw transaction growth in all our businesses.
Transactions for tickets over $50, roughly 20% of the business in the U.S., were up 4.7% in the first quarter. As we have seen for several quarters, the Simple Décor and General Repair businesses have remained resilient and been contributors to transaction growth. 
General Repair continues to perform well with categories like Caulk, Safety & Security, Roofing, Pipe and Fittings, all exceeding the company average comp performance. Simple Décor projects like Paint, Faucets and Ceramic Tile, all had positive comps and are examples of the continued strength that we see in these small project categories.
As I mentioned earlier, our Seasonal businesses also performed well. And our enhanced supply chain and merchandising tools allowed us to meet the demand throughout the quarter. Landscape, Live Goods, Fertilizer and Chemicals, all performed positively as customers were excited to get outdoors and take on simple DIY projects to spruce up their yards. Grills, Portable Power, Walk Behind Mowers, Patios, all posted double-digit positive comps in the quarter. 
Our spring selling period represents a highly variable portion of our business. And our tools enabled us to have the right products in the right place at the right time. 
For the last three years, Mark Holifield and his team have been working to optimize our supply chain and replenishment capabilities, resulting in shorter lead times and improved in-stock rates. As Frank mentioned, we implemented an enhanced replenishment forecasting tool for all our seasonal categories. The next step is to drive space planning integration. This effort will link our assortment maintenance, forecasting and planogramming tools to our replenishment system.
While we're pleased with our first quarter results, we have yet to see a clear recovery in our Pro business or big-ticket discretionary categories, such as special order kitchens. These factors continue to pressure our comp average ticket during the quarter, which was down 1.3% to $52.01 in the U.S. retail. 
Our total company average ticket was flat to last year and on a comp basis was up 0.4%.  In the U.S., transactions per tickets $900 and above, which represents approximately 20% of sales, were down 1.4%.
While still negative, our Pro business is showing signs of improvement. In fact, we saw positive growth in some highly penetrated Pro categories such as Fasteners, Hand Tools, Power Tool Accessories, Wire and Wiring Devices. Recently, we began to see unit improvements in categories like Plywood and Concrete, yet still negative for the total quarter. 
We know the efforts we've taken to improve our customer service, assortment and store environment have been resonating with our customers. Through March, our U.S. market share is up 83 basis points on a rolling 12-month basis. And to give you two examples of where share growth is coming from based on independent third-party tracking of consumer activity, we saw 140 basis points of market share gain in Paint and 150 basis points of market share gain in Electrical.
As Frank mentioned at the beginning of this year, our expectation for 2010 is that this will be a transitional year. We expect to see greater improvement in transactions prior to ticket recovery. We started the year off well, and feel that we are well positioned to deliver on our commitment. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."
278679,99886714,62006,"The Home Depot, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 18, 2010",2010-05-18,"Earnings Calls","The Home Depot, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. In the first quarter, sales were $16.9 billion, a 4.3% increase from last year. Excluding the $221 million of sales related to the closing of our EXPO businesses during the first quarter of 2009, sales increased 5.7%",911,"Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. In the first quarter, sales were $16.9 billion, a 4.3% increase from last year. Excluding the $221 million of sales related to the closing of our EXPO businesses during the first quarter of 2009, sales increased 5.7%.
Comp or same-store sales were positive 4.8% for the quarter with positive comps of 0.2% in February, positive 5.7% in March and positive 7% in April. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 3.3% for the quarter with U.S. comps of negative 1.2% in February, positive 3.9% in March and positive 5.5% in April.
In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34.4%, an increase of 67 basis points from last year. Our growth margin expansion was due to the following factors: First, our U.S. business reported 41 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, of which 12 basis points was driven by lower markdowns than last year as we saw benefits from better assortment management and fewer promotions. We also lapped markdowns taken last year as part of the closing of our EXPO businesses, which negatively affected gross margin by 29 basis points in the first quarter of 2009.
Second, we realized the 26 basis points of margin expansion from our International businesses, principally Canada as we lapped the disruption we experienced last year when we implemented SCORE for SAP.
On a reported basis, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 102 basis points to 26.6%, but the comparison is distorted due to strategic charges taken in the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the strategic charges from last year's results, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 48 basis points. Our operating leverage was primarily the result of positive same-store sales.
Total expenses increased by a factor of 67% of our sales growth rate, slightly higher than our rule of thumb. But we plan for this as we pull forward some spring staffing and marketing expenditures.
We also experienced higher bank card interchange fees due to a higher penetration of bank cards, our most expensive form of credit. We expect expense growth as a factor of sales growth to moderate throughout the balance of the year.
Interest and other expense for the first quarter totaled $189 million. This includes a $51 million pretax charge related to the revaluation of our HD Supply guarantee. In connection with the sale of HD Supply in 2007, we guaranteed a $1 billion senior secured amortizing term loan. 
In March, we agreed to an 18-month extension of our guarantee, extending it to April 2014. Accordingly, we revalued our guarantee and increased the fair value liability by $51 million, which had a negative impact to first quarter earnings per share of $0.02.
Our income tax provision rate was 35% in the first quarter, reflecting certain favorable state tax settlements. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.5%.
Earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.43, up 43.3% from last year. Excluding the $51 million charge taken in the first quarter of 2010 and the strategic charges taken in the first quarter of 2009, earnings per share increased 28.6% to $0.45 compared to last year's adjusted earnings per share of $0.35.
Now moving to our operational metrics. During the first quarter, we opened one new store and closed one store, for an ending store count of 2,244. At the end of the first quarter, selling square footage was 235 million. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the first quarter were $288, up roughly 5.4% year-over-year.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Inventory remains a good news story. At the end of the quarter, retail inventory was $11.5 billion, up $51 million from a year ago. On a per store basis, inventory was flat to last year. Inventory turns were 4.1x, up from 3.9x a year ago.
We ended the quarter with $43.6 billion in assets, including $2.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. This is an increase of approximately $1 billion in cash and short-term investments from the end of fiscal 2009, reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $2.1 billion, offset by $508 million used for share repurchases, $399 million used for dividends and $167 million of capital expenditures.
We have approximately $9.7 billion of outstanding debt, of which $1 billion comes due in August of 2010. At this point, it is our intent to refinance this debt maturity. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt in equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 11.5%, 150 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
As Craig mentioned, we performed well against our internal expectations for the first quarter. Based on our results, we are raising our guidance for fiscal 2010. Remember, that we guide off of GAAP. We are calling for fiscal 2010 sales to increase approximately 3.5%, with earnings per share from continuing operations increasing approximately 21% to $1.88. Within this guidance, we now expect our operating margin to reach approximately 8.25% for the year.
Finally, we are not including the impact of any additional share repurchases outside of those executed in the first quarter in our earnings per share guidance. But it is our intent to continue to use excess cash to repurchase shares throughout the remainder of fiscal 2010.
So thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Cindy, we are now ready for questions."

So certainly having the right assortments in the right place, making the adjustments continually year-after-year using our assortment tool, we believe has allowed us to help deliver that performance. And then likewise, we're also seeing a benefit in that from a gross margin dollar productivity standpoint.

We had costs associated with our market store rollout and some other marketing expenses, if you will, about $31 million of more expense year-over-year. So we didn't lever that. Another area that was a cost pressure for us in the first quarter was higher interchange fees associated with bank card. We had a really interesting phenomena happen in the first quarter where the penetration of our private label card dropped by 400 basis points from 26% to 22%. And the penetration of bank cards increased by 300 basis points from 35% to 38%. Bank cards are our highest form of tender. So that costs us about $14 million in the quarter.

As you will note in the first quarter, well, at the end of last year, I should say. We increased our dividend by 5%, the first time since 2006. And Frank said that it is his intent to raise the dividend every year. So dividends are an important part of our capital distribution. Based on the guidance that we gave this morning, our payout is about 50% of our earnings. We will then use excess cash to return it to the shareholders through share repurchases. We started our share repurchase program in the first quarter back in the market. This is the doability factor. So we bought back 500 million. We weren't singling anything, that's how much we got done. We do have a lot of cash and it's our intent to continue to use that cash appropriately by repurchasing share.

The inflation overall as it relates to, let's say, lumber and copper was about 100 basis points during the quarter, of which about 70 basis points came from lumber. When you look at lumber overall, you're right. I mean, it moved dramatically in the quarter. Framing was up year-over-year, almost 62%, and panel was up almost over 45% year-over-year in the quarter. When the market runs at that rate, you have to move with it. And we moved pretty quickly with it. And then when you look at the fact that it's really not demand driven. So you're not seeing positive growth in units, that's really the element that's driving the total impact versus what you might expect.

I think it's important to note that 72% of all new account applications on our private label card are being approved and the line is around $5,000.

I think it's important to note that 72% of all new account applications on our private label card are being approved and the line is around $5,000. And for the existing cardholders, the line is about $6,000, and it's only 26% utilized. So there's credit availability with our private label card, I think that's important to point out. What we are seeing is that many consumers are consolidating the number of cards that they have in their wallet. I know, I have, and moving to cards that offer reward. Now as you may know, with the Card Act that was enacted earlier this year, the value proposition associated with our private label card changed. It used to be, if you spent $299, it was no interest, no payment for six months everyday. With the Card Act, it's still no interest but it is minimum payment. So the value proposition has changed. And for our consumer, they may say, ""Hmm, this is one value proposition I can use my xyz card and get mileage or points, et cetera."" So we think there's just been a change there. Now we like our private label card, as you know, because it is the lowest cost of tender, from a credit card perspective in our stores. So we've got a number of ideas underway to create new value propositions, to get the consumer to use our card. And we'll be talking to you about those over the next few quarters."

Sales for the first quarter were $16.9 billion, up 4.3% from last year. Comp sales were positive 4.8%, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.43.Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 3.3%. This represen",850,"Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $16.9 billion, up 4.3% from last year. Comp sales were positive 4.8%, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.43.
Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 3.3%. This represents the first quarter of positive comps for the U.S. since the fourth quarter of 2005. From a geographic perspective, all but three of our top 40 U.S. markets positively comped in the first quarter, and all of our regions positively comped except the Gulf region, which is still impacted by hurricane-related comparisons. We also had a return to positive comps in Florida and California. Overall, sales were better than we planned for the quarter, and we continue to focus on improving our underlying business performance.
As Craig and Carol will describe in more detail, for the quarter, we levered our operating expenses in line with our targets, improved our gross margin rate through better assortment management and improved inventory turns. We also made significant progress on our key infrastructure initiatives. We opened our 13th Rapid Deployment Center, or RDC, in Columbia, South Carolina. RDCs now serve 70% of our U.S. stores, and we're on track to reach our goal of serving 100% by the end of the year. It's important that our supply chain team is on track on the network build-out. It's even more important that they maintain that schedule as they also improve the performance of the existing facilities.
This spring season has seen some unusually erratic weather, from record snow in the Mid-Atlantic to unseasonably warm temperatures in April in New England. The flexibility and responsiveness of the supply chain were critical in meeting these changing needs. We improved our inventory turns in the quarter and improved our targeted in-stock levels during a challenging season.
Craig and the merchandising team continued to integrate new merchandising tools as part of the overall merchandising transformation. For example, over the last three years, we have steadily increased the portion of SKUs that are on centralized automated replenishment. This year, we began the process of upgrading the tools used for the centralized forecasting system. These tools significantly improve the accuracy of the forecasting for seasonal products during the first quarter. Based on this success, we'll be migrating centrally-automated SKUs to the new forecasting tools by the end of the second quarter.
Marvin and the store operations team worked to continue to improve the customer service levels in our stores. Last year, as we described, we retrained every associate in the company on our customer service expectations, what we call, our Customer First program. This year, we repeated and refreshed that training to emphasize that this isn't a temporary program but part of our ongoing commitment.
We've seen consistent improvement in our Net Promoter Score since we initiated Customer First. And it was particularly significant that we again saw an improvement in the first quarter, 600 basis points over last year even as our transactions increased 4.2%. 
On the international front, our Canadian business delivered a positive comp and significantly improved its overall business performance. Last year's first quarter was negatively impacted by the major ERP [enterprise resource planning] implementation we undertook in Canada. That is now behind us.
Our Mexican business also had another solid quarter with single-digit positive comps. And our team in Mexico is helping on a number of U.S. Hispanic-focused efforts. For example, our Head of Marketing in Mexico helped lead our review of Hispanic marketing in the U.S. In China, our business performed to plan as we continue to refine our business model for that country.
So there were a number of positives for us in the quarter. But there are also signs of caution. Over the last several years, we've looked at Private Fixed Residential Investment, PFRI, as a percent of GDP as a useful benchmark. The most recent PFRI data showed a decline, reversing its pattern of improvement over the prior two quarters. The good news is that, obviously, our results didn't track with PFRI results. This may be an indicator that the PFRI data will have less correlation to results as the home improvement market recovers. But we're also mindful that a significant part of our growth in the first quarter came from seasonal consumer spending. 
Our data analytics did not show positive comp growth for more Pro customers. The rate of decline was low single digit so there was improvement, but this core part of our business has still not returned to positive growth. To date, this is consistent with our expectation that average ticket will lag the growth in transactions.
As Carol will describe in more detail, we had increased our earnings per share and sales guidance for the year based on our outperformance to plan in the first quarter. I want to thank our associates for all their hard work in the first quarter. Based on this quarter's results, over 95% of our stores would be eligible for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for hourly associates.
With that, let me turn the call over to Craig."

Second, the Seasonal businesses performed well, leveraging",780,"Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter compared to our expectations, and we saw encouraging signs. First, a solid, broad-based transaction performance across the store. Second, the Seasonal businesses performed well, leveraging the supply chain capabilities and merchandising tools developed over the last few years. And third, our core Repair and Maintenance business remains strong. As anticipated, the challenge in the first quarter continued to be big ticket, which remains under pressure from both the Pro and discretionary spend. 
On a departmental basis, every department posted positive comps for the quarter. Garden, Lumber, Paint, Electrical and Lighting outperformed the company's average comp for the quarter. Plumbing, Building Materials, Hardware, Flooring, Kitchen and Bath and Millwork, while positive, were under the company average comp for the quarter.
From a commodity standpoint, we did experience inflation of lumber and copper in the quarter, which positively impacted U.S. comp sales by approximately 100 basis points. As you may be aware, structural panel and framing lumber prices are up substantially from a year ago due to supply constraints. 
Overall, total customer transactions were $323 million, up 4.2% compared to last year. This is our largest year-over-year increase since the fourth quarter of 2005. Our total comp transactions increased by 4.4%. The Seasonal business was a key driver to this performance. And with the exception of Kitchens, we saw transaction growth in all our businesses.
Transactions for tickets over $50, roughly 20% of the business in the U.S., were up 4.7% in the first quarter. As we have seen for several quarters, the Simple Décor and General Repair businesses have remained resilient and been contributors to transaction growth. 
General Repair continues to perform well with categories like Caulk, Safety & Security, Roofing, Pipe and Fittings, all exceeding the company average comp performance. Simple Décor projects like Paint, Faucets and Ceramic Tile, all had positive comps and are examples of the continued strength that we see in these small project categories.
As I mentioned earlier, our Seasonal businesses also performed well. And our enhanced supply chain and merchandising tools allowed us to meet the demand throughout the quarter. Landscape, Live Goods, Fertilizer and Chemicals, all performed positively as customers were excited to get outdoors and take on simple DIY projects to spruce up their yards. Grills, Portable Power, Walk Behind Mowers, Patios, all posted double-digit positive comps in the quarter. 
Our spring selling period represents a highly variable portion of our business. And our tools enabled us to have the right products in the right place at the right time. 
For the last three years, Mark Holifield and his team have been working to optimize our supply chain and replenishment capabilities, resulting in shorter lead times and improved in-stock rates. As Frank mentioned, we implemented an enhanced replenishment forecasting tool for all our seasonal categories. The next step is to drive space planning integration. This effort will link our assortment maintenance, forecasting and planogramming tools to our replenishment system.
While we're pleased with our first quarter results, we have yet to see a clear recovery in our Pro business or big-ticket discretionary categories, such as special order kitchens. These factors continue to pressure our comp average ticket during the quarter, which was down 1.3% to $52.01 in the U.S. retail. 
Our total company average ticket was flat to last year and on a comp basis was up 0.4%.  In the U.S., transactions per tickets $900 and above, which represents approximately 20% of sales, were down 1.4%.
While still negative, our Pro business is showing signs of improvement. In fact, we saw positive growth in some highly penetrated Pro categories such as Fasteners, Hand Tools, Power Tool Accessories, Wire and Wiring Devices. Recently, we began to see unit improvements in categories like Plywood and Concrete, yet still negative for the total quarter. 
We know the efforts we've taken to improve our customer service, assortment and store environment have been resonating with our customers. Through March, our U.S. market share is up 83 basis points on a rolling 12-month basis. And to give you two examples of where share growth is coming from based on independent third-party tracking of consumer activity, we saw 140 basis points of market share gain in Paint and 150 basis points of market share gain in Electrical.
As Frank mentioned at the beginning of this year, our expectation for 2010 is that this will be a transitional year. We expect to see greater improvement in transactions prior to ticket recovery. We started the year off well, and feel that we are well positioned to deliver on our commitment. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."
278679,99886714,62043,"The Home Depot, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 18, 2010",2010-05-18,"Earnings Calls","The Home Depot, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. In the first quarter, sales were $16.9 billion, a 4.3% increase from last year. Excluding the $221 million of sales related to the closing of our EXPO businesses during the first quarter of 2009, sales increased 5.7%",911,"Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. In the first quarter, sales were $16.9 billion, a 4.3% increase from last year. Excluding the $221 million of sales related to the closing of our EXPO businesses during the first quarter of 2009, sales increased 5.7%.
Comp or same-store sales were positive 4.8% for the quarter with positive comps of 0.2% in February, positive 5.7% in March and positive 7% in April. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 3.3% for the quarter with U.S. comps of negative 1.2% in February, positive 3.9% in March and positive 5.5% in April.
In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34.4%, an increase of 67 basis points from last year. Our growth margin expansion was due to the following factors: First, our U.S. business reported 41 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, of which 12 basis points was driven by lower markdowns than last year as we saw benefits from better assortment management and fewer promotions. We also lapped markdowns taken last year as part of the closing of our EXPO businesses, which negatively affected gross margin by 29 basis points in the first quarter of 2009.
Second, we realized the 26 basis points of margin expansion from our International businesses, principally Canada as we lapped the disruption we experienced last year when we implemented SCORE for SAP.
On a reported basis, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 102 basis points to 26.6%, but the comparison is distorted due to strategic charges taken in the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the strategic charges from last year's results, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 48 basis points. Our operating leverage was primarily the result of positive same-store sales.
Total expenses increased by a factor of 67% of our sales growth rate, slightly higher than our rule of thumb. But we plan for this as we pull forward some spring staffing and marketing expenditures.
We also experienced higher bank card interchange fees due to a higher penetration of bank cards, our most expensive form of credit. We expect expense growth as a factor of sales growth to moderate throughout the balance of the year.
Interest and other expense for the first quarter totaled $189 million. This includes a $51 million pretax charge related to the revaluation of our HD Supply guarantee. In connection with the sale of HD Supply in 2007, we guaranteed a $1 billion senior secured amortizing term loan. 
In March, we agreed to an 18-month extension of our guarantee, extending it to April 2014. Accordingly, we revalued our guarantee and increased the fair value liability by $51 million, which had a negative impact to first quarter earnings per share of $0.02.
Our income tax provision rate was 35% in the first quarter, reflecting certain favorable state tax settlements. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.5%.
Earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.43, up 43.3% from last year. Excluding the $51 million charge taken in the first quarter of 2010 and the strategic charges taken in the first quarter of 2009, earnings per share increased 28.6% to $0.45 compared to last year's adjusted earnings per share of $0.35.
Now moving to our operational metrics. During the first quarter, we opened one new store and closed one store, for an ending store count of 2,244. At the end of the first quarter, selling square footage was 235 million. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the first quarter were $288, up roughly 5.4% year-over-year.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Inventory remains a good news story. At the end of the quarter, retail inventory was $11.5 billion, up $51 million from a year ago. On a per store basis, inventory was flat to last year. Inventory turns were 4.1x, up from 3.9x a year ago.
We ended the quarter with $43.6 billion in assets, including $2.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. This is an increase of approximately $1 billion in cash and short-term investments from the end of fiscal 2009, reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $2.1 billion, offset by $508 million used for share repurchases, $399 million used for dividends and $167 million of capital expenditures.
We have approximately $9.7 billion of outstanding debt, of which $1 billion comes due in August of 2010. At this point, it is our intent to refinance this debt maturity. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt in equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 11.5%, 150 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
As Craig mentioned, we performed well against our internal expectations for the first quarter. Based on our results, we are raising our guidance for fiscal 2010. Remember, that we guide off of GAAP. We are calling for fiscal 2010 sales to increase approximately 3.5%, with earnings per share from continuing operations increasing approximately 21% to $1.88. Within this guidance, we now expect our operating margin to reach approximately 8.25% for the year.
Finally, we are not including the impact of any additional share repurchases outside of those executed in the first quarter in our earnings per share guidance. But it is our intent to continue to use excess cash to repurchase shares throughout the remainder of fiscal 2010.
So thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Cindy, we are now ready for questions."

We had costs associated with our market store rollout and some other marketing expenses, if you will, about $31 million of more expense year-over-year. So we didn't lever that. Another area that was a cost pressure for us in the first quarter was higher interchange fees associated with bank card. We had a really interesting phenomena happen in the first quarter where the penetration of our private label card dropped by 400 basis points from 26% to 22%. And the penetration of bank cards increased by 300 basis points from 35% to 38%. Bank cards are our highest form of tender. So that costs us about $14 million in the quarter.

As you will note in the first quarter, well, at the end of last year, I should say, we increased our dividend by 5%, the first time since 2006. And Frank said that it is his intent to raise the dividend every year. So dividends are an important part of our capital distribution. Based on the guidance that we gave this morning, our payout is about 50% of our earnings. We will then use excess cash to return it to the shareholders through share repurchases. We started our share repurchase program in the first quarter back in the market. This is the doability factor. So we bought back 500 million. We weren't singling anything, that's how much we got done. We do have a lot of cash and it's our intent to continue to use that cash appropriately by repurchasing share.

One was power hours, where we basically have a period of time of the day, where we stop tasking and we spend all the time focused on service. So it's more about visibility, customer engagement and making sure we help customers solve project questions. So that provided visibility. So you don't necessarily add associates. Associates just become more available and more visible. We also talked about an initiative, where we're shifting labor from task to service. Last year, we shifted the equivalent of almost four full-time associates from jobs that customers didn't see in the backroom down to sales while driving service. So you actually saw a net gain of service associates without a net gain in total associates. We also added in the first quarter approximately one part-time associate to the floor with that shift and pass to service. Carol talked about how we pull forward in the season additional staff because sales picked up, we had seasonal hiring. So I think you also saw that had an impact as well from a visibility of associates."

And for the existing cardholders, the line is about $6,000, and it's only 26% utilized. So there's credit availability with our private label card, I think that's important to point out. What we are seeing is that many consumers are consolidating the number of cards that they have in their wallet. I know, I have, and moving to cards that offer reward. Now as you may know, with the Card Act that was enacted earlier this year, the value proposition associated with our private label card changed. It used to be, if you spent $299, it was no interest, no payment for six months everyday. With the Card Act, it's still no interest but it is minimum payment. So the value proposition has changed. And for our consumer, they may say, ""Hmm, this is one value proposition I can use my xyz card and get mileage or points, et cetera."" So we think there's just been a change there. Now we like our private label card, as you know, because it is the lowest cost of tender, from a credit card perspective in our stores. So we've got a number of ideas underway to create new value propositions, to get the consumer to use our card. And we'll be talking to you about those over the next few quarters."

Comp sales were positive 1.7%, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.72. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 1%.
From a geographic perspective, 70% of our top 40 U.S. markets positively comped in the second quarter. Florida and California continued their positive growth paths with performance in line with the company average. We saw a retreat from some of the very strong numbers in the first quarter, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, where key markets like Portland and Seattle turned to negative comps. But on a year-over-year comparison for the second quarter, every market except the hurricane-impacted market of Houston improved.
As Craig will detail, one of the clear patterns of the first and second quarters was a shift in the timing of Outdoor Garden spend. We had something about bathtub effect in the first half in Garden. Strength in the first quarter was counterbalanced by weakness in the second quarter. But overall, in Garden, the first half came out about where we expected. 
And it's a similar picture for the company as a whole. We anticipated that second quarter comps would decline from the first quarter. They did. But for the half, we came in ahead of where we had planned. This gives us some confidence as we look into the back half. We have two quarters in a row of positive comps in the U.S. We have a continuing pattern of positive comp transactions in our stores. We're gaining share in key categories and basic execution across the business is sound. 
We are also continuing to invest in our core initiatives. We opened our 14th and 15th Rapid Deployment Centers, or RDCs, during the quarter in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Phoenix, Arizona, and we just opened our 16th RDC in Findlay, Ohio yesterday. RDCs now serve over 80% of our U.S. stores, and we remain on track to reach our goal of serving 100% by the end of the year.
This has been a huge undertaking that has involved the entire organization, and we think it's very positive sign that in the midst of this build out, the company is also improving its inventory turns. For the third quarter in a row, our inventory turns have improved. This is something we hadn't achieved in almost a decade. 
Craig and the merchandising team continue to develop and use new merchandising tools. The benefits of this are most clearly seen in our reduced markdowns for seasonal categories like Patio and Barbecue Grills, where better visibility into and planning for seasonal inventory has significantly reduced the markdowns necessary to effectively exit those categories.
Marvin and the store operations team are also continuing on the path of improving customer service. We've previously discussed our Customer First program. Marvin has now launched a version of that for our Pro [Professional] customers and a special version focused on our check-out process. And we continue to see improvement in our Net Promoter Scores.
On the international front, our Canadian business had flat comps for the quarter as it experienced some of the same impacts in the Western regions of Canada as the U.S. experienced in the Pacific Northwest. And our Mexican business had another quarter of positive comps, making it 27 quarters in a row of positive comp growth.
There are, however, reasons to be cautious across our business. We still see weakness in our Pro segment. We had anticipated that we would start to see growth in our Pro customers as we move into the second quarter. And based on that, we thought we'd see gradual improvement in our average ticket. We're now forecasting modest to flat improvement on the Pro side, which puts pressure on average ticket. We also are anticipating softer housing-related activity than we originally thought. Clearly, there was some pull-forward of activity from the homebuyer tax credits and foreclosures remain high. And of course, on a broader economic level, unemployment remains stubbornly high and wage growth, weak.
All of these factors counsel caution as we enter the back half of the year. As Carol will discuss in more detail, we are maintaining our earnings guidance for the year, but revising our sales guidance to reflect these concerns. Instead of significant sequential improvement from the first half to the back half, we now think that the two halves will be similar, after adjusting for commodity price inflation.
Our market has been through four extremely difficult years. Private Fixed Residential Investment as a percent of GDP remains at historically low levels. But as uncertain as the economic climate is, we are seeing our business return to sales growth and the hardest hit parts of the country start stabilize. So we will continue to invest and position our business for recovery. 
I want to thank our associates for their hard work in the second quarter. We are very proud of the fact that 97% of our stores will be eligible for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Craig."

As expected, second quarter comps showed some deceleration following a strong first quarter and seasonal pull forwards, but we're pleased with our overall performance. The departments that outperformed the company average comp were Lumber, Electrical and Lighting and Plumbing. Kitchens and Flooring performed at the company average comp. Hardware and Paint showed positive comps, while comps in Millwork, Seasonal and Building Materials were slightly negative for the quarter. Based on census data through June, our U.S. market share is up 28 basis points on a 12-month rolling basis.
We continue to see strengthened transactions, but have not yet turned the corner on average ticket. Comp transactions were up 1.7% in the quarter, but overall comp average ticket remained flat at $52.30.
Reflecting the economic environment, we continue to see negative growth in big ticket. Transactions for tickets of $900 and above, approximately 20% of U.S. sales were down 4.9% in the second quarter. This was driven by continued pressure on big-ticket discretionary spend projects as well as lower appliance sales, which negatively impacted the company's comp by 30 basis points in the quarter.
Transactions for tickets under $50 also saw roughly 20% of the business in the U.S. were up 2.4% year-over-year. The primary drivers of this were the continued strength in Repair and Maintenance projects and Simple Décor. In the second quarter, categories such as Cleaning, Plumbing, Repair, Roofing, Chemicals and Safety and Security lead the way.
Let me share with you some specifics around our Seasonal business in the quarter. We saw a positive comp growth across several Seasonal product categories such as Barbecue Grills, Portable Power Equipment and Landscape Lighting. This summer's record heat across much of the U.S. drove double-digit comps in products like air conditioners and fans. 
In contrast, the excessive heat kept many DIY gardeners indoors, and we saw a softer comp performance in Live Goods and Landscapes than anticipated. As an example, Live Goods went from high single digit positive comps in the first quarter to negative comps in the second quarter.
To put all of this in perspective, of the deceleration in U.S. comps that we saw from the first quarter to the second quarter, approximately 200 basis points are directly related to Outdoor categories, offset by 40 basis points of growth in air cooling.
Overall, we're very pleased with our performance year-to-date in our Seasonal business, and we feel good about our inventory position in Seasonal categories as we enter the third quarter. We continue to execute our portfolio of strategy and drive results from our investments in Merchandise category resets, new product introductions and the implementation of our everyday great value. 
Let me share a few examples of this. First, program resets in place for more than 13 weeks are exceeding our expectations. Enhanced discipline around planning and impact modeling have led to more productive resets and less disruption for our stores.
Second, we have added new products to strengthen portions of a categories line structure. In carpet, we launched the new Martha Stewart and Platinum Plus programs, which provide customers with lifetime stain warranties. Last week, these programs provided over a 100% lift in sales versus a year ago from the products that they replaced. 
Third, we've been working to provide everyday great values across all levels of price points. In Hand Tools, we improved our offerings in both the Opening and the Upper Price Point segments. In Tool Storage, we updated our Husky product in the Upper Price Points segments. And we introduced Ryobi Lithium One Plus Technology into Cordless Outdoor Power Equipment. With these introductions, each of these categories delivered positive comp performance in the second quarter. Lastly, we continue to drive excellent execution in inventory through better process, new forecasting tools and leveraging on our new supply chain capabilities.
Let me offer some details. Around process, we combined our import and domestic DCs, which have begun to yield benefits through a more simplified approach to product flow. We also completed the rollout of our Teradata DCM forecasting tool for centrally-replenished items. This enables us to make better inventory decisions and react more quickly to trends in the business at a store SKU level. 
And of course, you know about our RDCs, which among many other things, shorten effective lead time, eliminate vendor minimums and improve productivity on our ordering process. The benefits of these actions can be seen in our inventory turnover improvements and the fact that our in-stocks are at record high levels.
As we move towards the fall, we're excited about several new product launches in our holiday offering that will be set at the end of the third quarter. We also have several outstanding special buys planned, starting with our current Vanity Insanity Bath Event, going on now. Customers are responding very well to this event and you should come into our stores and check it off. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."

Please note that in 2010, Memorial Day weekend fell in our June, rather than our May reporting period. Our gross margin was 33.9% for the quarter, an increase of 41 basis points from last year. Our U.S. business contributed 36 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, driven primarily by the following factors. 
First, stronger sales in certain categories drove us to higher purchasing tiers and allowed us to earn more co-op and rebate dollars than last year. Second, we experienced lower markdowns than last year due to better management of our Seasonal categories as well as fewer promotions. Finally, our International businesses contributed five basis points of gross margin expansion due primarily to higher rebate and lower shrink than last year.
Operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 53 basis points to 23.4%. Adjusting for the strategic charges taken in the second quarter of 2009, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 43 basis points from last year.
Our operating leverage reflects positive same-store sales as well as lower expenses in the following areas. First, we saw 14 basis points of payroll leverage arising from the nature of our spring hiring. You will recall that we pull forward spring hiring into the first quarter. And this, coupled with a higher mix of seasonal and part-time workers contributed to the payroll leverage in the second quarter.
Second, we realized 13 basis points of leverage from lower depreciation expense, reflecting our smaller fixed asset base. Finally, we saw 14 basis points of leverage in our general and administrative expenses due primarily to the rationalization of our management structure and a resulting decrease in incentive compensation.
For 2010, we expected our expenses to increase by a factor of 50% of our sales growth rate. For the first six months of the year, we were on our expense rule of thumb as adjusted expenses increased by 1.8% compared to adjusted sales growth of 3.6%. We expect to see some expense relief in the back half of the year. So we now believe that our expenses for the year will grow at a factor of less than 50% of sales growth.
Interest and other expense for the second quarter totaled $148 million, down $13 million from last year, reflecting lower levels of outstanding indebtedness. Our income tax provision rate was 37.3% in the second quarter, reflecting the timing of state tax settlements. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.5%.
Earnings per share for the second quarter were $0.72, up 9.1% from last year and reflect $0.02 of benefit arising from our share repurchase program. 
Now moving to our operational metrics. During the second quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico and closed one store in China, for an ending store count of 2,244. At the end of the second quarter, selling square footage was $235 million, reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the second quarter was $328, up roughly 2% year-over-year.
Now turning to the balance sheet. We continue to effectively manage our inventory. At the end of the quarter, retail inventory was $10.8 billion, down $38 million from a year ago. On a per store basis, inventory decreased by 0.5%. Inventory turns were 4.4x, up from 4.3x a year ago.
We ended the quarter with $42.5 billion in assets, including $2.4 billion in cash. This is an increase of approximately $974 million in cash from the end of fiscal 2009, reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $3.4 billion, offset by $1.2 billion used for share repurchases, $793 million used for dividends and $407 million of capital expenditures.
Now on the capital structure front, a few items of note. First, in the second quarter, we repurchased $700 million or $21.4 million shares of outstanding stock. Second, during the quarter, we replaced our $3.25 billion commercial paper program with a new $2 billion commercial paper program that is 100% backstopped by a committed long-term bank line of credit. As of the end of the second quarter, we had no outstanding commercial paper.
Third, computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 11.5%, 220 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2009. And finally, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we repaid $1 billion of senior notes that came due on August 15 and expect to refinance them later this quarter.
As Frank mentioned, we executed well during the first half of the year. But economic recovery is progressing at a slower pace than we originally expected as illustrated by the Fed's recent change to its GDP outlook for 2010.
You will recall that our plan assumed we would see ticket growth in the back half of the year. We now think that ticket growth will not materialize and that our sales growth will come from transaction growth. We believe the back half of the year will resemble the first half of the year, which when backing up the commodity price inflation we experienced in the first half, suggest back half sales growth in the 2% area.
Based on our year-to-date results and our current expectations for the back half of the year, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2010. Remember that we guide off of GAAP. We are calling for fiscal 2010 sales to increase by approximately 2.6%, with earnings per share from continuing operations increasing by approximately 22.6% to $1.90. Within this guidance, we now expect our operating margin to be approximately 8.3% for the year.
This guidance includes the benefit of our year-to-date share repurchases, but doesn't include the impact at any additional share repurchases. It is our intent, however, to use excess cash to repurchase shares throughout the remainder of fiscal 2010. 
So thank you for your participation in today's call. And Yvonne, we are now ready to take questions."

We also seeing things like, likelihood to recommend, which is our version of intent to return. It is at record highs for the company as high as it's ever been in the eight years that I've been here. So we feel really good about it. As Frank mentioned, what we're going to do in the second half is put an increased emphasis on check out. We still noted that's one of our Achilles heel. From a service standpoint, we want to speed up our check-out process and make it more inviting for the customers, and we're also going to put a specific emphasis on Pro and service, because we know that when we provide quicker in and out service for our contractors, then we have a chance to grow market share."

And then you go, okay, we've seen continuing strength in transactions across the business, which is kind of a good sign across the business. And say, that we think that projects forward into the back half. And then, as Carol was saying, we're lightening our assumptions on ticket growth in large part because the Pros are a little slower to come back than we thought and that gets the equation of around the 2% sales growth and that's the thought process. I can tell you behind that, I mean we do a lot of things as you can imagine, we keep talking about Private Fixed Residential Investment and that's had a great correlation up until recently with our sales. The difficulty with that and you hit on it is a lot of the broader macro numbers actually change pretty quickly. So if you just look at kind of quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter, with our projections on PFRI were or what the expert projections on PFRI were, they have changed quite dramatically over the course in the last year.

We paid off of plan. Last year, we smashed our plan. This year, we're expecting to be on our plan, and so the dollars are down year-on-year. The other driver for the back half of the year has to do with vacation, sick and holiday. And given the nature of our staffing in our stores, we have less vacations to take and holiday expense forecasted for the back half of the year than we did last year."

But when we look at kind of the fundamentals of the business and what customers are doing right now, customers are remain focused on maintaining their homes. So Repair and Maintenance categories are pretty stable across the business. We have been keenly focused on making sure that we are providing the right offerings for our customers in those day-to-day activities as well as simple décor updates. So categories like Faucets and Paint and Simple Flooring Projects are where we're focused. And that is the foundation, as I mentioned, in my comments to our transactions and, really, keeping customers coming in to The Home Depot. As we look to the back half, we think that customers will remain there. They'll remain focus not only in their yards and acres, certainly some stress that their yards have been through in the second quarter, so there's an opportunity there.

Our cost of credit is capped at no more than 1.5% of credit sales, and currently, we're running slightly under that. But we are seeing something interesting in terms of the behavior of the cardholders, and that really relates to the change that happened earlier this year with the CARD Act [Credit CARD Act], where the everyday value proposition that we used to offer, which was, if you spend $299 on the card, it was no interest, no payments for six months, that's now changed to no interest, minimum payment for six months. And what we've seen is a decline in the penetration of usage of our private label card. Actually, in the second quarter, it declined almost 400 basis points to now just 21% of our sales. So as we think about this, private label is a great value proposition. It's the cheapest form of credit for us. We want more customers to use our card. So we do have a program inside our stores called Everyday Saving, which on certain everyday items, like light bulbs and trash bags and air filters, if they use our card, it's everyday 10% off. So we're doing a number of things to drive up penetration. But in terms of our cost, we don't anticipate any change. Now I could comment, if you'd like, on the Durbin Amendment to the financial reform bill. The Durbin Amendment speaks to interchange fees on debit cards. Debit is about 18% of total penetration for our business, and there's PIN debit and signature debit. PIN debit is cheap. Signature debit was expensive. It costs more than clearing a check. With the Durbin Amendment, the Federal Reserve has been given the right to determine what the fee should be on a reasonable and proportionate basis. We think that when those fees come out, there could be a benefit to our company next year beginning in July. And that benefit could be in the $30-million area, which we could then turn around and reduce retail prices or make investments in other areas."

Sales for the second quarter were $19.4 billion, up 1.8% from last year. Comp sales were positive 1.7%, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.72. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 1%. From a geograph",867,"Thank you Diane, and good morning everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $19.4 billion, up 1.8% from last year. Comp sales were positive 1.7%, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.72. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 1%. 
From a geographic perspective, 70% of our top 40 U.S. markets positively comped in the second quarter. Florida and California continued their positive growth paths with performance in line with the company average. We saw a retreat from some of the very strong numbers in the first quarter, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, where key markets like Portland and Seattle turned to negative comps. But on a year over year comparison for the second quarter, every market except the hurricane-impacted market of Houston improved. 
As Craig will detail, one of the clear patterns of the first and second quarters was a shift in the timing of outdoor garden [spending]. We had something of a bathtub effect in the first half in garden. Strength in the first quarter was counterbalanced by weakness in the second quarter, but overall in garden the first half came out about where we expected. 
And it’s a similar picture for the company as a whole. We anticipated that second quarter comps would decline from the first quarter. They did, but for the half we came in ahead of where we had planned. This gives us some confidence as we look into the back half. We have two quarters in a row of positive comps in the U.S. We have a continuing pattern of positive comp transactions in our stores. We’re gaining share in key categories, and basic execution across the business is sound. 
We are also continuing to invest in our core initiatives. We opened our 14th and 15th rapid deployment centers, or RDCs, during the quarter in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Phoenix, Arizona, and we just opened our 16th RDC in Findlay, Ohio yesterday. RDCs now serve over 80% of our U.S. stores, and we remain on track to reach our goal of serving 100% by the end of the year. 
This has been a huge undertaking that has involved the entire organization, and we think it’s a very positive sign that in the midst of this build out, the company is also improving its inventory turns. For the third quarter in a row, our inventory turns have improved. This is something we hadn’t achieved in almost a decade. 
Craig and the merchandising team continue to develop and use new merchandising tools. The benefits of this are most clearly seen in our reduced markdowns for seasonal categories like patio and barbecue grills, where better visibility into, and planning for, seasonal inventory has significantly reduced the markdowns necessary to effectively exit those categories. 
Marvin and the store operations team are also continuing on the path of improving customer service. We have previously discussed our customer FIRST program. Marvin has now launched a version of that for our pro customers and a special version focused on our checkout process, and we continue to see improvement in our net promoter scores.
On the international front, our Canadian business had flat comps for the quarter as it experienced some of the same impacts in the western regions of Canada as the U.S. experienced in the Pacific Northwest. And our Mexican business had another quarter of positive comps, making it 27 quarters in a row of positive comp growth.
There are, however, reasons to be cautious across our business. We still see weakness in our pro segment. We had anticipated that we would start to see growth in our pro customers as we moved into the second quarter, and based on that we thought we’d see gradual improvement in our average ticket. We’re now forecasting modest to flat improvement on the pro side, which puts pressure on average ticket. 
We also are anticipating softer housing related activity than we originally thought. Clearly, there was some pull-forward of activity from the home buyer tax credits and foreclosures remain high. And of course, on a broader economic level, unemployment remains stubbornly high and wage growth weak.
All of these factors counsel caution as we enter the back half of the year. As Carol will discuss in more detail, we are maintaining our earnings guidance for the year, but revising our sales guidance to reflect these concerns. Instead of significant sequential improvement from the first half to the back half, we now think that the two halves will be similar, after adjusting for commodity price inflation.
Our market has been through four extremely difficult years. Private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP remains at historically low levels, but as uncertain as the economic climate is, we are seeing our business return to sales growth and the hardest hit parts of the country start to stabilize. So we will continue to invest and position our business for recovery.
I want to thank our associates for their hard work in the second quarter. We are very proud of the fact that 97% of our stores will be eligible for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates.
With that, let me turn the call over to Craig.

As expected, second quarter comps showed some deceleration following a strong first quarter and seasonal pull-forward, but we’re pleased with our overall performance. 
The departments that outperformed the company average comp were lumber, electrical lighting, and plumbing. Kitchens and flooring performed at the company average comp. Hardware and paint showed positive comps, while comps in millwork, seasonal, and building materials were slightly negative for the quarter.
Based on census data through June, our U.S. market share is up 28 basis point on a 12-month rolling basis. 
We continue to see strength in transactions, but have not yet turned the corner on average ticket. Comp transactions were up 1.7% in the quarter, but overall comp average ticket remained flat at $52.30. 
Reflecting the economic environment, we continued to see negative growth in big ticket. Transactions for tickets of $900 and above, approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were down 4.9% in the second quarter. This was driven by continued pressure on big ticket discretionary spending projects, as well as lower appliance sales, which negatively impacted the company’s comp by 30 basis points in the quarter.
Transactions for tickets under $50, also roughly 20% of the business in the U.S., were up 2.4% year over year. The primary drivers of this were the continued strength in repair and maintenance projects and simple décor. In the second quarter, categories such as cleaning, plumbing repair, roofing, chemicals, and safety and security led the way. 
Let me share with you some specifics around our seasonal business in the quarter. We saw positive comp growth across several seasonal product categories, such as barbecue grills, portable power equipment, and landscape lighting. This summer’s record heat across much of the U.S. drove double-digit comps in products like air conditioners and fans. 
In contrast, the excessive heat kept many DIY gardeners indoors, and we saw softer comp performance in live goods and landscape than anticipated. As an example, live goods went from high single digit positive comps in the first quarter to negative comps in the second quarter.
To put all of this in perspective, of the deceleration in U.S. comps that we saw from the first quarter to the second quarter, approximately 200 basis points are directly related to outdoor categories, offset by 40 basis points of growth in air cooling.
Overall, we’re very pleased with our performance year to date in our seasonal business, and we feel good about our inventory position in seasonal categories as we enter the third quarter. We continue to execute our portfolio strategy and drive results from our investments in merchandise category resets, new product introductions, and the implementation of our everyday great value.
Let me share a few examples of this. First, program resets in place for more than 13 weeks are exceeding our expectations. Enhanced discipline around planning and impact modeling has led to more productive resets and less disruption for our stores. 
Second, we have added new products to strengthen portions of a category’s line structure. In carpet, we launched the new Martha Stewart and Platinum Plus programs, which provide customers with lifetime stain warrantees. Last week these programs provided over 100% lift in sales, versus a year ago from the products that they replaced. 
Third, we’ve been working to provide everyday great values across all levels of price points. In hand tools, we improved our offerings in both the opening and the upper price point segments. In tool storage, we updated our Husky product in the upper price point segments. And we introduced Ryobi’s Lithium One Plus technology into cordless outdoor power equipment. With these introductions, each of these categories delivered positive comp performance in the second quarter. 
Lastly, we continued to drive excellent execution in inventory through better process, new forecasting tools, and leveraging our new supply chain capabilities. Let me offer some details. 
Around process, we combined our import and domestic DCs, which have begun to yield benefits through a more simplified approach to product flow. We also completed the rollout of our Teradata DCM forecasting tool for centrally replenished items. This enables us to make better inventory decisions and react more quickly to trends in the business at a store SKU level. 
And of course, you know about our RDCs, which among many other things shorten effective lead time, eliminate vendor minimums, and improve productivity in our ordering process. The benefits of these actions can be seen in our inventory turnover improvements and the fact that our in-stocks are at record high levels.
As we move toward the fall, we’re excited about several new product launches in our holiday offering that will be set at the end of the third quarter. We also have several outstanding special buys planned, starting with our current “Vanity Insanity” bath event going on now. Customers are responding very well to this event, and you should come into our stores and check it out.
And with that, I’d like to turn the call over to Carol.

278679,111230646,75072,"The Home Depot, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2010",2010-08-17,"Earnings Calls","The Home Depot, Inc.","Executives","Thank you Craig, and hello everyone. In the second quarter, sales were $19.4 billion, a 1.8% increase from last year. Comps or same-store sales were positive 1.7% for the quarter, with positive comps of 0.6% in May, positive 3.9% in June, and positive 1%",1073,"Thank you Craig, and hello everyone. In the second quarter, sales were $19.4 billion, a 1.8% increase from last year. Comps or same-store sales were positive 1.7% for the quarter, with positive comps of 0.6% in May, positive 3.9% in June, and positive 1% in July. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 1% for the quarter, with U.S. comps as negative 0.9% in May, positive 3.7% in June, and positive 0.4% in July. Please note that in 2010, Memorial Day weekend fell in our June, rather than our May, reporting period.
Our gross margin was 33.9% for the quarter, an increase of 41 basis points from last year. Our U.S. business contributed 36 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, driven primarily by the following factors: First, stronger sales in certain categories drove us to higher purchasing tiers, and allowed us to earn more co-op and rebate dollars than last year. Second, we experienced lower markdowns than last year, due to better management of our seasonal categories, as well as fewer promotions. Finally, our international businesses contributed 5 basis points of gross margin expansion, due primarily to higher rebates and lower shrink than last year.
Operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 53 basis points to 23.4%. Adjusting for the strategic charges taken in the second quarter of 2009, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 43 basis points from last year. 
Our operating leverage reflects positive same-store sales as well as lower expenses in the following areas: First, we saw 14 basis points of payroll leverage arising from the nature of our spring hiring. You will recall that we pulled forward spring hiring into the first quarter and this, coupled with the higher mix of seasonal and part time workers, contributed to the payroll leverage in the second quarter. Second, we realized 13 basis points of leverage from lower depreciation expense, reflecting our smaller fixed asset base. Finally, we saw 14 basis points of leverage in our general and administrative expenses, due primarily to the rationalization of our management structure and a resulting decrease in incentive compensation.
For 2010, we expected our expenses to increase by a factor of 50% of our sales growth rate. For the first six months of the year, we were on our expense rule of thumb as adjusted expenses increased by 1.8% compared to adjusted sales growth of 3.6%. We expect to see some expense relief in the back half of the year, so we now believe that our expenses for the year will grow at a factor of less than 50% of sales growth.
Interest and other expense for the second quarter totaled $148 million, down $13 million from last year, reflecting lower levels of outstanding indebtedness. Our income tax provision rate was 37.3% in the second quarter, reflecting the timing of state tax settlements. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.5%. 
Earnings per share for the second quarter were $0.72, up 9.1% from last year, and reflect $0.02 of benefit arising from our share repurchase program. 
Now moving to our operational metrics, during the second quarter we opened one new store in Mexico and closed one store in China for an ending store count of 2,244. At the end of the second quarter, selling square footage was 235 million. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the second quarter were $328, up roughly 2% year over year.
Now turning to the balance sheet, we continue to effectively manage our inventory. At the end of the quarter, retail inventory was $10.8 billion, down $38 million from a year ago. On a per-store basis, inventory decreased by 0.5%. Inventory turns were 4.4 times, up from 4.3 times a year ago.
We ended the quarter with $42.5 billion in assets, including $2.4 billion in cash. This is an increase of approximately $974 million in cash from the end of fiscal 2009, reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $3.4 billion, offset by $1.2 billion used for share repurchases, $793 million used for dividends, and $407 million of capital expenditures. 
Now on the capital structure front, a few items of note. First, in the second quarter, we repurchased $700 million, or 21.4 million shares, of outstanding stock. Second, during the quarter we replaced our $3.25 billion commercial paper program with a new $2 billion commercial paper program that is 100% backstopped by committed, long-term bank line of credits. As of the end of the second quarter, we had no outstanding commercial paper. Third, computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 11.5%, 220 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2009. And finally, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we repaid $1 billion of senior notes that came due on August 15, and expect to refinance them later this quarter.
As Frank mentioned, we executed well during the first half of the year, but economic recovery is progressing at a slower pace than we originally expected, as illustrated by the Fed’s recent change to its GDP outlook for 2010. 
You will recall that our plan assumed we would see ticket growth in the back half of the year. We now think that ticket growth will not materialize, and that our sales growth will come from transaction growth. We believe the back half of the year will resemble the first half of the year, which, when backing out the commodity price inflation we experienced in the first half, suggests back-half sales growth in the 2% area.
Based on our year to date results, and our current expectations for the back half of the year, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2010. Remember that we guide off of GAAP. We are calling for fiscal 2010 sales to increase by approximately 2.6%, with earnings per share from continuing operations increasing by approximately 22.6% to $1.90. 
Within this guidance, we now expect our operating margin to be approximately 8.3% for the year. This guidance includes the benefit of our year to date share repurchases, but doesn’t include the impact of any additional share repurchases. It is our intent, however, to use excess cash to repurchase shares throughout the remainder of fiscal 2010.
So thank you for your participation in today’s call, and operator, we are now ready to take questions.

We are benefitted by having about a half a million customer surveys per month that we get in when customers log on and tell us what we think, and we’re in a great position because our customers are very passionate, so they tell us what they like and what they don’t like. As a result of that, we’ve had our net promoter score increase over 500 basis points in Q2, and that’s on top of a 1,000 basis point increase in Q2 of last year. We’re also seeing things like likelihood to recommend, which is our version of intent to return. It is at record highs for the company, as high as it’s ever been in the eight years that I’ve been here. So we feel really good about it. As Frank mentioned, what we’re going to do in the second half is put an increased emphasis on checkout. We still know that that’s one of our Achilles’ heels from a service standpoint. We want to speed up our checkout process and make it more inviting for the customers, and we’re also going to put a specific emphasis on pro and service, because we know that when we provide quicker in and out service for our contractors, then we have a chance to grow market share.

And if you take into account what Craig was saying, in terms of the shift, first quarter and second quarter, in garden, you go, okay, overall you start with first half came in ahead of where we expected. Second half was - but the geography of the half was not what we expected, and that was driven overwhelmingly by the shift in garden, pull-forward in the first quarter and a bit of a draining in the second quarter. And then you go, okay, we’ve seen continuing strength in transactions across the business, which is a good sign across the business, and say that we think that projects forward into the back half. And then as Carol was saying, you - we’re lightening our assumptions on ticket growth in large part because the pros are a little slower to come back than we thought, and that gets the equation of around the 2% sales growth.
And that’s the thought process. I can tell you behind that we do a lot of things as you can imagine, we keep talking about private fixed residential investment, and that’s had a great correlation up until recently with our sales. The difficulty with that, and you hit on it, is a lot of the broader macro numbers actually change pretty quickly. So if you just looked at quarter over quarter over quarter, what our projects on PFRI were, or what the expert projections on PFRI were, they have changed quite dramatically over the course of the last year. So that does make forecasting in this environment a little challenging.

But when we look at the fundamentals of the business and what customers are doing right now, customers are remaining focused on maintaining their homes, so repair and maintenance categories are pretty stable across the business. We have been keenly focused on making sure that we are providing the right offerings for our customers in those day to day activities as well as simple décor updates. So categories like faucets, and paint, and simple flooring projects are where we’re focused. And that is the foundation, as I mentioned in my comments, to our transactions and really keeping customers coming into the Home Depot. As we look to the back half we think that customers will remain there. They’ll remained focused not only in their yards. I think there’s certainly some stress that yards have been through in the second quarter, so there’s an opportunity there. But we also think that they’ll continue to focus on the maintenance and repair and simple updates around their home. So we feel like we’re well positioned for the back half against what we believe customers will actually be doing.

Our cost of credit is capped at no more than 1.5% of credit sales, and currently we’re running slightly under that. But we are seeing something interesting in terms of the behavior of the card holders, and that really relates to the change that happened earlier this year with the CARD Act, where the everyday value proposition that we used to offer, which was if you spent $299 on the card it was no interest, no payments for six months. That’s now changed to no interest, minimum payment for six months. And what we’ve seen is a decline in the penetration of usage of our private label card. Actually, in the second quarter it declined almost 400 basis points to now just 21% of our sales. 
So as we think about this, private label is a great value proposition. It’s the cheapest form of credit for us. We want more customers to use our card. So we do have a program inside our stores called “Everyday Savings”, which on certain everyday items like light bulbs, and trash bags, and air filters, if you use our card it’s every day 10% off. So we’re doing a number of things to drive up penetration, but in terms of our cost, we don’t anticipate any change. 
Now I could comment, if you’d like, on the Durbin Amendment to the financial reform bill. The Durbin Amendment speaks to interchange fees on debit cards. Debit is about 18% of total penetration for our business, and there is PIN debit and signature debit. PIN debit is cheap, signature debit is expensive. It cost more than clearing a check. With the Durbin Amendment the Federal Reserve has been given the right to determine what the fees should be on a reasonable and proportionate basis. We think that when those fees come out there could be a benefit to our company next year beginning in July, and that benefit could be in the $30 million area, which we could then turn around and reduce retail prices, or make investments in other areas.

And what we’re saying now is no, that’s really going to be transaction and not ticket. And the big difference there is pro, so I think don’t be thinking there’s some significant lift we’re anticipating from pro that’s going to be offset by some significant decrease in the consumer.

Sales for the second quarter were $19.4 billion, up 1.8% from last year. Comp sales were positive 1.7%, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.72. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 1%. From a geograph",867,"Thank you Diane, and good morning everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $19.4 billion, up 1.8% from last year. Comp sales were positive 1.7%, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.72. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 1%. 
From a geographic perspective, 70% of our top 40 U.S. markets positively comped in the second quarter. Florida and California continued their positive growth paths with performance in line with the company average. We saw a retreat from some of the very strong numbers in the first quarter, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, where key markets like Portland and Seattle turned to negative comps. But on a year over year comparison for the second quarter, every market except the hurricane-impacted market of Houston improved. 
As Craig will detail, one of the clear patterns of the first and second quarters was a shift in the timing of outdoor garden [spending]. We had something of a bathtub effect in the first half in garden. Strength in the first quarter was counterbalanced by weakness in the second quarter, but overall in garden the first half came out about where we expected. 
And it’s a similar picture for the company as a whole. We anticipated that second quarter comps would decline from the first quarter. They did, but for the half we came in ahead of where we had planned. This gives us some confidence as we look into the back half. We have two quarters in a row of positive comps in the U.S. We have a continuing pattern of positive comp transactions in our stores. We’re gaining share in key categories, and basic execution across the business is sound. 
We are also continuing to invest in our core initiatives. We opened our 14th and 15th rapid deployment centers, or RDCs, during the quarter in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Phoenix, Arizona, and we just opened our 16th RDC in Findlay, Ohio yesterday. RDCs now serve over 80% of our U.S. stores, and we remain on track to reach our goal of serving 100% by the end of the year. 
This has been a huge undertaking that has involved the entire organization, and we think it’s a very positive sign that in the midst of this build out, the company is also improving its inventory turns. For the third quarter in a row, our inventory turns have improved. This is something we hadn’t achieved in almost a decade. 
Craig and the merchandising team continue to develop and use new merchandising tools. The benefits of this are most clearly seen in our reduced markdowns for seasonal categories like patio and barbecue grills, where better visibility into, and planning for, seasonal inventory has significantly reduced the markdowns necessary to effectively exit those categories. 
Marvin and the store operations team are also continuing on the path of improving customer service. We have previously discussed our customer FIRST program. Marvin has now launched a version of that for our pro customers and a special version focused on our checkout process, and we continue to see improvement in our net promoter scores.
On the international front, our Canadian business had flat comps for the quarter as it experienced some of the same impacts in the western regions of Canada as the U.S. experienced in the Pacific Northwest. And our Mexican business had another quarter of positive comps, making it 27 quarters in a row of positive comp growth.
There are, however, reasons to be cautious across our business. We still see weakness in our pro segment. We had anticipated that we would start to see growth in our pro customers as we moved into the second quarter, and based on that we thought we’d see gradual improvement in our average ticket. We’re now forecasting modest to flat improvement on the pro side, which puts pressure on average ticket. 
We also are anticipating softer housing related activity than we originally thought. Clearly, there was some pull-forward of activity from the home buyer tax credits and foreclosures remain high. And of course, on a broader economic level, unemployment remains stubbornly high and wage growth weak.
All of these factors counsel caution as we enter the back half of the year. As Carol will discuss in more detail, we are maintaining our earnings guidance for the year, but revising our sales guidance to reflect these concerns. Instead of significant sequential improvement from the first half to the back half, we now think that the two halves will be similar, after adjusting for commodity price inflation.
Our market has been through four extremely difficult years. Private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP remains at historically low levels, but as uncertain as the economic climate is, we are seeing our business return to sales growth and the hardest hit parts of the country start to stabilize. So we will continue to invest and position our business for recovery.
I want to thank our associates for their hard work in the second quarter. We are very proud of the fact that 97% of our stores will be eligible for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates.
With that, let me turn the call over to Craig.

As expected, second quarter comps showed some deceleration following a strong first quarter and seasonal pull-forward, but we’re pleased with our overall performance. 
The departments that outperformed the company average comp were lumber, electrical lighting, and plumbing. Kitchens and flooring performed at the company average comp. Hardware and paint showed positive comps, while comps in millwork, seasonal, and building materials were slightly negative for the quarter.
Based on census data through June, our U.S. market share is up 28 basis point on a 12-month rolling basis. 
We continue to see strength in transactions, but have not yet turned the corner on average ticket. Comp transactions were up 1.7% in the quarter, but overall comp average ticket remained flat at $52.30. 
Reflecting the economic environment, we continued to see negative growth in big ticket. Transactions for tickets of $900 and above, approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were down 4.9% in the second quarter. This was driven by continued pressure on big ticket discretionary spending projects, as well as lower appliance sales, which negatively impacted the company’s comp by 30 basis points in the quarter.
Transactions for tickets under $50, also roughly 20% of the business in the U.S., were up 2.4% year over year. The primary drivers of this were the continued strength in repair and maintenance projects and simple décor. In the second quarter, categories such as cleaning, plumbing repair, roofing, chemicals, and safety and security led the way. 
Let me share with you some specifics around our seasonal business in the quarter. We saw positive comp growth across several seasonal product categories, such as barbecue grills, portable power equipment, and landscape lighting. This summer’s record heat across much of the U.S. drove double-digit comps in products like air conditioners and fans. 
In contrast, the excessive heat kept many DIY gardeners indoors, and we saw softer comp performance in live goods and landscape than anticipated. As an example, live goods went from high single digit positive comps in the first quarter to negative comps in the second quarter.
To put all of this in perspective, of the deceleration in U.S. comps that we saw from the first quarter to the second quarter, approximately 200 basis points are directly related to outdoor categories, offset by 40 basis points of growth in air cooling.
Overall, we’re very pleased with our performance year to date in our seasonal business, and we feel good about our inventory position in seasonal categories as we enter the third quarter. We continue to execute our portfolio strategy and drive results from our investments in merchandise category resets, new product introductions, and the implementation of our everyday great value.
Let me share a few examples of this. First, program resets in place for more than 13 weeks are exceeding our expectations. Enhanced discipline around planning and impact modeling has led to more productive resets and less disruption for our stores. 
Second, we have added new products to strengthen portions of a category’s line structure. In carpet, we launched the new Martha Stewart and Platinum Plus programs, which provide customers with lifetime stain warrantees. Last week these programs provided over 100% lift in sales, versus a year ago from the products that they replaced. 
Third, we’ve been working to provide everyday great values across all levels of price points. In hand tools, we improved our offerings in both the opening and the upper price point segments. In tool storage, we updated our Husky product in the upper price point segments. And we introduced Ryobi’s Lithium One Plus technology into cordless outdoor power equipment. With these introductions, each of these categories delivered positive comp performance in the second quarter. 
Lastly, we continued to drive excellent execution in inventory through better process, new forecasting tools, and leveraging our new supply chain capabilities. Let me offer some details. 
Around process, we combined our import and domestic DCs, which have begun to yield benefits through a more simplified approach to product flow. We also completed the rollout of our Teradata DCM forecasting tool for centrally replenished items. This enables us to make better inventory decisions and react more quickly to trends in the business at a store SKU level. 
And of course, you know about our RDCs, which among many other things shorten effective lead time, eliminate vendor minimums, and improve productivity in our ordering process. The benefits of these actions can be seen in our inventory turnover improvements and the fact that our in-stocks are at record high levels.
As we move toward the fall, we’re excited about several new product launches in our holiday offering that will be set at the end of the third quarter. We also have several outstanding special buys planned, starting with our current “Vanity Insanity” bath event going on now. Customers are responding very well to this event, and you should come into our stores and check it out.
And with that, I’d like to turn the call over to Carol.

278679,111230646,75078,"The Home Depot, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2010",2010-08-17,"Earnings Calls","The Home Depot, Inc.","Executives","Thank you Craig, and hello everyone. In the second quarter, sales were $19.4 billion, a 1.8% increase from last year. Comps or same-store sales were positive 1.7% for the quarter, with positive comps of 0.6% in May, positive 3.9% in June, and positive 1%",1073,"Thank you Craig, and hello everyone. In the second quarter, sales were $19.4 billion, a 1.8% increase from last year. Comps or same-store sales were positive 1.7% for the quarter, with positive comps of 0.6% in May, positive 3.9% in June, and positive 1% in July. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 1% for the quarter, with U.S. comps as negative 0.9% in May, positive 3.7% in June, and positive 0.4% in July. Please note that in 2010, Memorial Day weekend fell in our June, rather than our May, reporting period.
Our gross margin was 33.9% for the quarter, an increase of 41 basis points from last year. Our U.S. business contributed 36 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, driven primarily by the following factors: First, stronger sales in certain categories drove us to higher purchasing tiers, and allowed us to earn more co-op and rebate dollars than last year. Second, we experienced lower markdowns than last year, due to better management of our seasonal categories, as well as fewer promotions. Finally, our international businesses contributed 5 basis points of gross margin expansion, due primarily to higher rebates and lower shrink than last year.
Operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 53 basis points to 23.4%. Adjusting for the strategic charges taken in the second quarter of 2009, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 43 basis points from last year. 
Our operating leverage reflects positive same-store sales as well as lower expenses in the following areas: First, we saw 14 basis points of payroll leverage arising from the nature of our spring hiring. You will recall that we pulled forward spring hiring into the first quarter and this, coupled with the higher mix of seasonal and part time workers, contributed to the payroll leverage in the second quarter. Second, we realized 13 basis points of leverage from lower depreciation expense, reflecting our smaller fixed asset base. Finally, we saw 14 basis points of leverage in our general and administrative expenses, due primarily to the rationalization of our management structure and a resulting decrease in incentive compensation.
For 2010, we expected our expenses to increase by a factor of 50% of our sales growth rate. For the first six months of the year, we were on our expense rule of thumb as adjusted expenses increased by 1.8% compared to adjusted sales growth of 3.6%. We expect to see some expense relief in the back half of the year, so we now believe that our expenses for the year will grow at a factor of less than 50% of sales growth.
Interest and other expense for the second quarter totaled $148 million, down $13 million from last year, reflecting lower levels of outstanding indebtedness. Our income tax provision rate was 37.3% in the second quarter, reflecting the timing of state tax settlements. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.5%. 
Earnings per share for the second quarter were $0.72, up 9.1% from last year, and reflect $0.02 of benefit arising from our share repurchase program. 
Now moving to our operational metrics, during the second quarter we opened one new store in Mexico and closed one store in China for an ending store count of 2,244. At the end of the second quarter, selling square footage was 235 million. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the second quarter were $328, up roughly 2% year over year.
Now turning to the balance sheet, we continue to effectively manage our inventory. At the end of the quarter, retail inventory was $10.8 billion, down $38 million from a year ago. On a per-store basis, inventory decreased by 0.5%. Inventory turns were 4.4 times, up from 4.3 times a year ago.
We ended the quarter with $42.5 billion in assets, including $2.4 billion in cash. This is an increase of approximately $974 million in cash from the end of fiscal 2009, reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $3.4 billion, offset by $1.2 billion used for share repurchases, $793 million used for dividends, and $407 million of capital expenditures. 
Now on the capital structure front, a few items of note. First, in the second quarter, we repurchased $700 million, or 21.4 million shares, of outstanding stock. Second, during the quarter we replaced our $3.25 billion commercial paper program with a new $2 billion commercial paper program that is 100% backstopped by committed, long-term bank line of credits. As of the end of the second quarter, we had no outstanding commercial paper. Third, computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 11.5%, 220 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2009. And finally, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we repaid $1 billion of senior notes that came due on August 15, and expect to refinance them later this quarter.
As Frank mentioned, we executed well during the first half of the year, but economic recovery is progressing at a slower pace than we originally expected, as illustrated by the Fed’s recent change to its GDP outlook for 2010. 
You will recall that our plan assumed we would see ticket growth in the back half of the year. We now think that ticket growth will not materialize, and that our sales growth will come from transaction growth. We believe the back half of the year will resemble the first half of the year, which, when backing out the commodity price inflation we experienced in the first half, suggests back-half sales growth in the 2% area.
Based on our year to date results, and our current expectations for the back half of the year, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2010. Remember that we guide off of GAAP. We are calling for fiscal 2010 sales to increase by approximately 2.6%, with earnings per share from continuing operations increasing by approximately 22.6% to $1.90. 
Within this guidance, we now expect our operating margin to be approximately 8.3% for the year. This guidance includes the benefit of our year to date share repurchases, but doesn’t include the impact of any additional share repurchases. It is our intent, however, to use excess cash to repurchase shares throughout the remainder of fiscal 2010.
So thank you for your participation in today’s call, and operator, we are now ready to take questions.

As a result of that, we’ve had our net promoter score increase over 500 basis points in Q2, and that’s on top of a 1,000 basis point increase in Q2 of last year. We’re also seeing things like likelihood to recommend, which is our version of intent to return. It is at record highs for the company, as high as it’s ever been in the eight years that I’ve been here. So we feel really good about it. As Frank mentioned, what we’re going to do in the second half is put an increased emphasis on checkout. We still know that that’s one of our Achilles’ heels from a service standpoint. We want to speed up our checkout process and make it more inviting for the customers, and we’re also going to put a specific emphasis on pro and service, because we know that when we provide quicker in and out service for our contractors, then we have a chance to grow market share.

And if you take into account what Craig was saying, in terms of the shift, first quarter and second quarter, in garden, you go, okay, overall you start with first half came in ahead of where we expected. Second half was - but the geography of the half was not what we expected, and that was driven overwhelmingly by the shift in garden, pull-forward in the first quarter and a bit of a draining in the second quarter. And then you go, okay, we’ve seen continuing strength in transactions across the business, which is a good sign across the business, and say that we think that projects forward into the back half. And then as Carol was saying, you - we’re lightening our assumptions on ticket growth in large part because the pros are a little slower to come back than we thought, and that gets the equation of around the 2% sales growth.
And that’s the thought process. I can tell you behind that we do a lot of things as you can imagine, we keep talking about private fixed residential investment, and that’s had a great correlation up until recently with our sales. The difficulty with that, and you hit on it, is a lot of the broader macro numbers actually change pretty quickly. So if you just looked at quarter over quarter over quarter, what our projects on PFRI were, or what the expert projections on PFRI were, they have changed quite dramatically over the course of the last year. So that does make forecasting in this environment a little challenging.

As we improve the accuracy of the measurement one of the things we found was a double-digit decline in the pro business as you exited the back half of 2008 and through 2009, gradually improving to where we’re now in the low negative single digit on pro sales in our stores. We had anticipated in the back half a more significant recovery, in large part for exactly the reason you said.

But when we look at the fundamentals of the business and what customers are doing right now, customers are remaining focused on maintaining their homes, so repair and maintenance categories are pretty stable across the business. We have been keenly focused on making sure that we are providing the right offerings for our customers in those day to day activities as well as simple décor updates. So categories like faucets, and paint, and simple flooring projects are where we’re focused. And that is the foundation, as I mentioned in my comments, to our transactions and really keeping customers coming into the Home Depot. As we look to the back half we think that customers will remain there. They’ll remained focused not only in their yards. I think there’s certainly some stress that yards have been through in the second quarter, so there’s an opportunity there. But we also think that they’ll continue to focus on the maintenance and repair and simple updates around their home. So we feel like we’re well positioned for the back half against what we believe customers will actually be doing.

Our cost of credit is capped at no more than 1.5% of credit sales, and currently we’re running slightly under that. But we are seeing something interesting in terms of the behavior of the card holders, and that really relates to the change that happened earlier this year with the CARD Act, where the everyday value proposition that we used to offer, which was if you spent $299 on the card it was no interest, no payments for six months. That’s now changed to no interest, minimum payment for six months. And what we’ve seen is a decline in the penetration of usage of our private label card. Actually, in the second quarter it declined almost 400 basis points to now just 21% of our sales. 
So as we think about this, private label is a great value proposition. It’s the cheapest form of credit for us. We want more customers to use our card. So we do have a program inside our stores called “Everyday Savings”, which on certain everyday items like light bulbs, and trash bags, and air filters, if you use our card it’s every day 10% off. So we’re doing a number of things to drive up penetration, but in terms of our cost, we don’t anticipate any change. 
Now I could comment, if you’d like, on the Durbin Amendment to the financial reform bill. The Durbin Amendment speaks to interchange fees on debit cards. Debit is about 18% of total penetration for our business, and there is PIN debit and signature debit. PIN debit is cheap, signature debit is expensive. It cost more than clearing a check. With the Durbin Amendment the Federal Reserve has been given the right to determine what the fees should be on a reasonable and proportionate basis. We think that when those fees come out there could be a benefit to our company next year beginning in July, and that benefit could be in the $30 million area, which we could then turn around and reduce retail prices, or make investments in other areas.

Sales for the second quarter were $19.4 billion, up 1.8% from last year. Comp sales were positive 1.7%, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.72. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 1%.From a geograp",860,"Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $19.4 billion, up 1.8% from last year. Comp sales were positive 1.7%, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.72. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 1%.
From a geographic perspective, 70% of our top 40 U.S. markets positively comped in the second quarter. Florida and California continued their positive growth paths with performance in line with the company average. We saw a retreat from some of the very strong numbers in the first quarter, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, where key markets like Portland and Seattle turned to negative comps. But on a year-over-year comparison for the second quarter, every market except the hurricane-impacted market of Houston improved.
As Craig will detail, one of the clear patterns of the first and second quarters was a shift in the timing of Outdoor Garden spend. We had something about bathtub effect in the first half in Garden. Strength in the first quarter was counterbalanced by weakness in the second quarter. But overall, in Garden, the first half came out about where we expected. 
And it's a similar picture for the company as a whole. We anticipated that second quarter comps would decline from the first quarter. They did. But for the half, we came in ahead of where we had planned. This gives us some confidence as we look into the back half. We have two quarters in a row of positive comps in the U.S. We have a continuing pattern of positive comp transactions in our stores. We're gaining share in key categories and basic execution across the business is sound. 
We are also continuing to invest in our core initiatives. We opened our 14th and 15th Rapid Deployment Centers, or RDCs, during the quarter in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Phoenix, Arizona, and we just opened our 16th RDC in Findlay, Ohio yesterday. RDCs now serve over 80% of our U.S. stores, and we remain on track to reach our goal of serving 100% by the end of the year.
This has been a huge undertaking that has involved the entire organization, and we think it's very positive sign that in the midst of this build out, the company is also improving its inventory turns. For the third quarter in a row, our inventory turns have improved. This is something we hadn't achieved in almost a decade. 
Craig and the merchandising team continue to develop and use new merchandising tools. The benefits of this are most clearly seen in our reduced markdowns for seasonal categories like Patio and Barbecue Grills, where better visibility into and planning for seasonal inventory has significantly reduced the markdowns necessary to effectively exit those categories.
Marvin and the store operations team are also continuing on the path of improving customer service. We've previously discussed our Customer First program. Marvin has now launched a version of that for our Pro [Professional] customers and a special version focused on our check-out process. And we continue to see improvement in our Net Promoter Scores.
On the international front, our Canadian business had flat comps for the quarter as it experienced some of the same impacts in the Western regions of Canada as the U.S. experienced in the Pacific Northwest. And our Mexican business had another quarter of positive comps, making it 27 quarters in a row of positive comp growth.
There are, however, reasons to be cautious across our business. We still see weakness in our Pro segment. We had anticipated that we would start to see growth in our Pro customers as we move into the second quarter. And based on that, we thought we'd see gradual improvement in our average ticket. We're now forecasting modest to flat improvement on the Pro side, which puts pressure on average ticket. We also are anticipating softer housing-related activity than we originally thought. Clearly, there was some pull-forward of activity from the homebuyer tax credits and foreclosures remain high. And of course, on a broader economic level, unemployment remains stubbornly high and wage growth, weak.
All of these factors counsel caution as we enter the back half of the year. As Carol will discuss in more detail, we are maintaining our earnings guidance for the year, but revising our sales guidance to reflect these concerns. Instead of significant sequential improvement from the first half to the back half, we now think that the two halves will be similar, after adjusting for commodity price inflation.
Our market has been through four extremely difficult years. Private Fixed Residential Investment as a percent of GDP remains at historically low levels. But as uncertain as the economic climate is, we are seeing our business return to sales growth and the hardest hit parts of the country start stabilize. So we will continue to invest and position our business for recovery. 
I want to thank our associates for their hard work in the second quarter. We are very proud of the fact that 97% of our stores will be eligible for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Craig."
278679,111230646,75361,"The Home Depot, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2010",2010-08-17,"Earnings Calls","The Home Depot, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone.

As expected, second quarter comps showed some deceleration following a strong first quarter and seasonal pull forwards, but we're pleased with our overall performance. The departments that outperformed the company average comp were Lumber, Electrical and Lighting and Plumbing. Kitchens and Flooring performed at the company average comp. Hardware and Paint showed positive comps, while comps in Millwork, Seasonal and Building Materials were slightly negative for the quarter. Based on census data through June, our U.S. market share is up 28 basis points on a 12-month rolling basis.
We continue to see strengthened transactions, but have not yet turned the corner on average ticket. Comp transactions were up 1.7% in the quarter, but overall comp average ticket remained flat at $52.30.
Reflecting the economic environment, we continue to see negative growth in big ticket. Transactions for tickets of $900 and above, approximately 20% of U.S. sales were down 4.9% in the second quarter. This was driven by continued pressure on big-ticket discretionary spend projects as well as lower appliance sales, which negatively impacted the company's comp by 30 basis points in the quarter.
Transactions for tickets under $50 also saw roughly 20% of the business in the U.S. were up 2.4% year-over-year. The primary drivers of this were the continued strength in Repair and Maintenance projects and Simple Décor. In the second quarter, categories such as Cleaning, Plumbing, Repair, Roofing, Chemicals and Safety and Security lead the way.
Let me share with you some specifics around our Seasonal business in the quarter. We saw a positive comp growth across several Seasonal product categories such as Barbecue Grills, Portable Power Equipment and Landscape Lighting. This summer's record heat across much of the U.S. drove double-digit comps in products like air conditioners and fans. 
In contrast, the excessive heat kept many DIY gardeners indoors, and we saw a softer comp performance in Live Goods and Landscapes than anticipated. As an example, Live Goods went from high single digit positive comps in the first quarter to negative comps in the second quarter.
To put all of this in perspective, of the deceleration in U.S. comps that we saw from the first quarter to the second quarter, approximately 200 basis points are directly related to Outdoor categories, offset by 40 basis points of growth in air cooling.
Overall, we're very pleased with our performance year-to-date in our Seasonal business, and we feel good about our inventory position in Seasonal categories as we enter the third quarter. We continue to execute our portfolio of strategy and drive results from our investments in Merchandise category resets, new product introductions and the implementation of our everyday great value. 
Let me share a few examples for this. First, program resets in place for more than 13 weeks are exceeding our expectations. Enhanced discipline around planning and impact modeling have led to more productive resets and less disruption for our stores.
Second, we have added new products to strengthen portions of a categories line structure. In carpet, we launched the new Martha Stewart and Platinum Plus programs, which provide customers with lifetime stain warranties. Last week, these programs provided over a 100% lift in sales versus a year ago from the products that they replaced. 
Third, we've been working to provide everyday great values across all levels of price points. In Hand Tools, we improved our offerings in both the Opening and the Upper Price Point segments. In Tool Storage, we updated our Husky product in the Upper Price Points segments. And we introduced Ryobi Lithium One Plus Technology into Cordless Outdoor Power Equipment. With these introductions, each of these categories delivered positive comp performance in the second quarter. Lastly, we continue to drive excellent execution in inventory through better process, new forecasting tools and leveraging on our new supply chain capabilities.
Let me offer some details. Around process, we combined our import and domestic DCs, which have begun to yield benefits through a more simplified approach to product flow. We also completed the rollout of our Teradata DCM forecasting tool for centrally-replenished items. This enables us to make better inventory decisions and react more quickly to trends in the business at a store SKU level. 
And of course, you know about our RDCs, which among many other things, shorten effective lead time, eliminate vendor minimums and improve productivity on our ordering process. The benefits of these actions can be seen in our inventory turnover improvements and the fact that our in-stocks are at record high levels.
As we move towards the fall, we're excited about several new product launches in our holiday offering that will be set at the end of the third quarter. We also have several outstanding special buys planned, starting with our current Vanity Insanity Bath Event, going on now. Customers are responding very well to this event and you should come into our stores and check it out. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."

In the second quarter, sales were $19.4 billion, a 1.8% increase from last year. Comps or same-store sales were positive 1.7% for the quarter, with positive comps of 0.6% in May, positive 3.9% in June and positive 1%",1067,"Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. In the second quarter, sales were $19.4 billion, a 1.8% increase from last year. Comps or same-store sales were positive 1.7% for the quarter, with positive comps of 0.6% in May, positive 3.9% in June and positive 1% in July. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 1% for the quarter, with U.S. comps of negative 0.9% in May, positive 3.7% in June and positive 0.4% in July.
Please note that in 2010, Memorial Day weekend fell in our June, rather than our May reporting period. Our gross margin was 33.9% for the quarter, an increase of 41 basis points from last year. Our U.S. business contributed 36 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, driven primarily by the following factors. 
First, stronger sales in certain categories drove us to higher purchasing tiers and allowed us to earn more co-op and rebate dollars than last year. Second, we experienced lower markdowns than last year due to better management of our Seasonal categories as well as fewer promotions. Finally, our International businesses contributed five basis points of gross margin expansion due primarily to higher rebate and lower shrink than last year.
Operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 53 basis points to 23.4%. Adjusting for the strategic charges taken in the second quarter of 2009, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 43 basis points from last year.
Our operating leverage reflects positive same-store sales as well as lower expenses in the following areas. First, we saw 14 basis points of payroll leverage arising from the nature of our spring hiring. You will recall that we pull forward spring hiring into the first quarter. And this, coupled with a higher mix of seasonal and part-time workers contributed to the payroll leverage in the second quarter.
Second, we realized 13 basis points of leverage from lower depreciation expense, reflecting our smaller fixed asset base. Finally, we saw 14 basis points of leverage in our general and administrative expenses due primarily to the rationalization of our management structure and a resulting decrease in incentive compensation.
For 2010, we expected our expenses to increase by a factor of 50% of our sales growth rate. For the first six months of the year, we were on our expense rule of thumb as adjusted expenses increased by 1.8% compared to adjusted sales growth of 3.6%. We expect to see some expense relief in the back half of the year. So we now believe that our expenses for the year will grow at a factor of less than 50% of sales growth.
Interest and other expense for the second quarter totaled $148 million, down $13 million from last year, reflecting lower levels of outstanding indebtedness. Our income tax provision rate was 37.3% in the second quarter, reflecting the timing of state tax settlements. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.5%.
Earnings per share for the second quarter were $0.72, up 9.1% from last year and reflect $0.02 of benefit arising from our share repurchase program. 
Now moving to our operational metrics. During the second quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico and closed one store in China, for an ending store count of 2,244. At the end of the second quarter, selling square footage was $235 million. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the second quarter was $328, up roughly 2% year-over-year.
Now turning to the balance sheet. We continue to effectively manage our inventory. At the end of the quarter, retail inventory was $10.8 billion, down $38 million from a year ago. On a per store basis, inventory decreased by 0.5%. Inventory turns were 4.4x, up from 4.3x a year ago.
We ended the quarter with $42.5 billion in assets, including $2.4 billion in cash. This is an increase of approximately $974 million in cash from the end of fiscal 2009, reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $3.4 billion, offset by $1.2 billion used for share repurchases, $793 million used for dividends and $407 million of capital expenditures.
Now on the capital structure front, a few items of note. First, in the second quarter, we repurchased $700 million or 21.4 million shares of outstanding stock. Second, during the quarter, we replaced our $3.25 billion commercial paper program with a new $2 billion commercial paper program that is 100% backstopped by a committed long-term bank line of credit. As of the end of the second quarter, we had no outstanding commercial paper.
Third, computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 11.5%, 220 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2009. And finally, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we repaid $1 billion of senior notes that came due on August 15 and expect to refinance them later this quarter.
As Frank mentioned, we executed well during the first half of the year. But economic recovery is progressing at a slower pace than we originally expected as illustrated by the Fed's recent change to its GDP outlook for 2010.
You will recall that our plan assumed we would see ticket growth in the back half of the year. We now think that ticket growth will not materialize and that our sales growth will come from transaction growth. We believe the back half of the year will resemble the first half of the year, which when backing up the commodity price inflation we experienced in the first half, suggest back half sales growth in the 2% area.
Based on our year-to-date results and our current expectations for the back half of the year, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2010. Remember that we guide off of GAAP. We are calling for fiscal 2010 sales to increase by approximately 2.6%, with earnings per share from continuing operations increasing by approximately 22.6% to $1.90. Within this guidance, we now expect our operating margin to be approximately 8.3% for the year.
This guidance includes the benefit of our year-to-date share repurchases, but doesn't include the impact at any additional share repurchases. It is our intent, however, to use excess cash to repurchase shares throughout the remainder of fiscal 2010. 
So thank you for your participation in today's call. And Yvonne, we are now ready to take questions."

And say, that we think that projects forward into the back half. And then, as Carol was saying, we're lightening our assumptions on ticket growth in large part because the Pros are a little slower to come back than we thought and that gets the equation of around the 2% sales growth and that's the thought process. I can tell you behind that, I mean we do a lot of things as you can imagine, we keep talking about Private Fixed Residential Investment and that's had a great correlation up until recently with our sales. The difficulty with that and you hit on it is a lot of the broader macro numbers actually change pretty quickly.

Our cost of credit is capped at no more than 1.5% of credit sales, and currently, we're running slightly under that. But we are seeing something interesting in terms of the behavior of the cardholders, and that really relates to the change that happened earlier this year with the CARD Act [Credit CARD Act], where the everyday value proposition that we used to offer, which was, if you spent $299 on the card, it was no interest, no payments for six months, that's now changed to no interest, minimum payment for six months. And what we've seen is a decline in the penetration of usage of our private label card. Actually, in the second quarter, it declined almost 400 basis points to now just 21% of our sales. So as we think about this, private label is a great value proposition. It's the cheapest form of credit for us. We want more customers to use our card. So we do have a program inside our stores called Everyday Saving, which on certain everyday items, like light bulbs and trash bags and air filters, if they use our card, it's everyday 10% off. So we're doing a number of things to drive up penetration. But in terms of our cost, we don't anticipate any change. Now I could comment, if you'd like, on the Durbin Amendment to the financial reform bill. The Durbin Amendment speaks to interchange fees on debit cards. Debit is about 18% of total penetration for our business, and there's PIN debit and signature debit. PIN debit is cheap. Signature debit was expensive. It costs more than clearing a check. With the Durbin Amendment, the Federal Reserve has been given the right to determine what the fee should be on a reasonable and proportionate basis. We think that when those fees come out, there could be a benefit to our company next year beginning in July. And that benefit could be in the $30-million area, which we could then turn around and reduce retail prices or make investments in other areas."

Sales for the third quarter were $16.6 billion, up 1.4% from last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.51. This is the fourth quarter in a row of positive comps for our business and the third quarter in a",845,"Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $16.6 billion, up 1.4% from last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.51. This is the fourth quarter in a row of positive comps for our business and the third quarter in a row of positive comps for the U.S., which had a comp of 1.5%.
In the U.S., over 80% of our top 40 markets positively comped. Compared to prior quarters, the variability of performance has narrowed, so that we see less dramatic swings on the positive and on the negative side. For example, in the third quarter of 2009, the spread between the best and worst of our top 40 markets was about 35 percentage points. This year, that spread is cut almost in half to about 18 points.
Our Gulf region is now exiting its year-over-year storm comparisons, so its negative comps have turned slightly positive. We saw strength in key markets, particularly in our Central and Mid-Atlantic regions, and we continue to see positive results in Florida and California. So from an overall perspective, we see a stabilizing business. And as the business stabilizes, we continue to improve our operational performance. We are exercising good control over our expenses, but we're also investing in the business to drive improvements across customer service, merchandising and our supply chain.
Let me give one recent example. Our technology and operations teams have developed and implemented a new technology for our store associates. We call it the First Phone [ph] because its core purpose is to reduce tasking time for our associates, so that they can instead focus on customer service. It is a handheld device that provides several functions: Inventory management, product location, SKU category and class performance analytics; a phone, a walkie-talkie and a mobile checkout. What makes the First Phone [ph] worth discussing are two general points: It was developed through close cooperation with our store operations and IT teams, perhaps the best collaboration we've ever had on a project like this. And we see it as the foundational element of improving our service for our DIY and Pro customers, putting knowledge and communication closer at hand to our associates on the floor at the store.
Similarly, we are continuing the development of our new merchandising tools. As an indicator of that, we had another quarter of improved inventory turns for the company. Our rollout of Rapid Deployment Centers, or RDCs, remains on track to reach 100% of our U.S. store base by the end of the year, and we are continuing the significant ongoing complementary work designed to get additional leverage from our supply chain.
Beyond the supply chain, we're building out a new set of analytical tools for our merchants across assortment planning, pricing and customer analytics. We'll discuss those at some greater length at our upcoming investor and analyst conference in December. But just as we have a goal to better enable our associates to deliver great customer service, we also have a goal to better enable our merchants to drive category growth in our business, and in both instances, technology as a critical enabler.
As Craig will detail, we've seen continued growth in our transactions. This quarter marks the fourth straight quarter of comp transactions growth. This provides some evidence that our market is steadying as customers focus on basic repair and maintenance activities. Average ticket continues to be a challenge just as the macro housing environment remains under pressure. We have often referenced private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP as an indicator of the overall health of the housing-related market. This past quarter saw another tick down and another record 60-year low as the ratio is now 2.2%. While our comp performance has disconnected from this metric, at least directionally, we still think this presents a picture of continued pressure in our market.
On the international front, our Mexican business continues to deliver positive comps. This is the 28th quarter in a row of positive comps. Not only is our Mexican business an important source of growth for the company, but also increasingly an important source of talent. For example, we have a district manager in Texas who began as a store manager in Mexico, and we have comparable examples of the Mexican team being a source of talent throughout our organization. 
Our Canadian business, as expected, experienced weakness in the quarter, with a negative comp of 5.6% in local currency as we began to anniversary the impacts of the Canadian government's Home Renovation Tax Credit. The difficult year-over-year comparisons will continue through the fourth quarter.
At the end of the third quarter, 76% of our stores are eligible for Success Sharing, our bonus program for our hourly associates. Our associates are working hard to improve our business. We're proud of the progress we're making while recognizing that we're just at the start of a long-term process. And we look forward to discussing our longer-term plans with you in December.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Craig."

The third quarter represented our fourth quarter in a row of positive comp growth. We saw positive comps in eight departments during the quarter, and we're pleased with the sequential comp improvement we saw in the U.S. from the second to the third quarter. The departments that outperformed the company's average comp were Lumber, Garden, Electrical and Lighting. Flooring and Hardware performed in line with the company comp. Plumbing, Paint, and Kitchen and Bath showed positive comps while comps in Millwork and Building Materials were negative for the quarter.
As measured by consumer surveys, we gained consumer U.S. market share in units in nine out of our 13 departments during the quarter. Our strategy remains focused on driving value and innovation in our stores, and we see customers responding favorably to our efforts through increased transactions. Comp transactions were up 2.2% in the quarter. As expected, we have not yet turned the corner on average ticket. Comp average ticket was down 0.8% or $0.43 to $51.46 for the quarter.
Smaller ticket purchases were stronger in the quarter while the big ticket purchases remained under pressure. Transactions for tickets under $50, roughly 20% of our business in the U.S., were up 2.7% year-over-year. Transactions for tickets of $900 and above, also approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were down 3.4% in the third quarter. The main drivers behind our small ticket performance were our Maintenance and Repair, Seasonal and Outdoor Project businesses. As we shared in past quarters, Maintenance and Repair continues to be an area of strength as customers spend money to maintain the investments in their homes. For example, categories such as sealers, plumbing repair, fasteners, water heaters and cleaning all had strong comp performance in the third quarter.
The Seasonal business came late in the quarter, as record heat across much of the U.S. in August and September kept many DIY gardeners indoors. In contrast, October presented an opportunity for fall planting and lawn repair. We took advantage of this opportunity and used the flexibility that we've built into our business through tools and process to delay our holiday set and continue to drive our Outdoor business through the end of October. We saw specific strength in seed, chemicals and live goods. For example, our Live Goods business swung from a low single digit negative comp in the second quarter to a positive comp in the third quarter, driven by a double-digit comp in the month of October. Additionally, we saw strength in outdoor project categories such as landscape, fencing, exterior paint and windows during the quarter.
Finally, we saw a continued momentum in paint, hardware, tools, electrical and plumbing in the third quarter. We've been working hard to improve our offering in these areas with a focus on our maintenance and repair customers, and our efforts are paying off.
On the other hand, we continue to see pressure in big ticket. The largest drivers of this big-ticket pressure in the third quarter were softness in building materials and discretionary spend areas, like kitchens, as well as tough comparison in roofing as we lapped last year's heavy storms.
We continue to execute our portfolio strategy and drive results from our investments in merchandising category resets, new product introductions and the implementation of everyday great value. Let me share a few examples of this. During the quarter, we had an outstanding bath event called Vanity Insanity. We saw great results and terrific project selling from our associates during this event. We also introduced exciting new products such as additional LED bulbs in our EcoSmart brand, which can save customers up to 80% on their electric bills or lighting bills. Water savings products have also resonated well with our customers, such as our Glacier Bay dual flush toilets and HydroRight Dual-Flush Conversion Kit. And for our Decor customers, we introduced Martha Stewart kitchens, which is off to a fast start in our stores. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we are well positioned to drive sales with a great seasonal lineup of heaters, fireplaces and snow removal equipment. We will also be rolling out several new product introductions, including expansion of our client tools for professional electricians, USG's lightweight drywall that is 30% lighter than regular drywall panels and a new line of Epoxy Grout, from Custom Building Products, that do not require sealing. 
Additionally, we leaned into the holiday season this year and increased our buys. Holiday decor is an inexpensive way for our customers to update and feel good about their homes. We have enhanced our offering with the Martha Stewart coordinated decor items and launched the EcoSmart LED lighting, which features exclusive new technology, including fully water resistant, continuous-on lights, so that if one breaks or comes loose, the rest stay lit. We also have outstanding values in our gift centers this year, as well as an incredible Black Friday line up. The early results from these categories have been strong, and we're confident that it will continue to drive customers to Home Depot stores. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."
278679,112820408,88373,"The Home Depot, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2010",2010-11-16,"Earnings Calls","The Home Depot, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. In the third quarter, sales were $16.6 billion, a 1.4% increase from last year.

In the third quarter, sales were $16.6 billion, a 1.4% increase from last year. Comps to our same-store sales were positive 1.4% for the quarter, with positive comps of 0.7% in August, positive 1.1% in September and positive 2.9% in October. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 1.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 0.6% in August, flat comps in September and positive comps of 3.5% in October.
Our gross margin was 34.3% for the quarter, an increase of 26 basis points from last year. Our U.S. business contributed 20 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter driven by the following factors: First, five basis points of expansion came from lower deferred interest due to a lower penetration of private label credit card sales. Second, approximately five basis points of expansion was due to commodity price inflation. Finally, through our portfolio approach and leveraging our newly developed analytics, we enjoyed another 10 basis points of net gross margin expansion, with some departments like Hardware and Plumbing reporting margin growth and some departments like Kitchen and Bath reporting margin contraction.
Our International businesses, principally Canada, contributed six basis points of gross margin expansion in the quarter, due primarily to a change in the mix of products sold. Operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 74 basis points to 25.5% and total operating expense dollars were $61 million less than last year.
Our operating leverage reflects positive same-store sales as well as lower expense in the following areas: First, depreciation expense was $28 million under last year due to a lower asset base arising from fully depreciated assets. Second, medical expense was $20 million under last year due to a number of items, including a lower number of enrollees. Third, we settled several real estate matters for a net $20 million benefit. And finally, we had a number of other expenses under last year, offset by expense increases in categories like credit card discount. These items net to a $7 million increase in expense from last year.
At the end of the second quarter, we told you that we expected to see strong expense leverage in the back half of the year. Year-to-date, on an adjusted basis, our expense growth equaled approximately 30% of the growth in our sales. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect continued expense leverage such that for the year, expenses will grow at less than 30% of the growth in our sales.
Interest and other expense for the third quarter totaled $142 million, down $22 million from last year, reflecting lower levels of outstanding indebtedness. Our income tax provision rate was 36.1% in the third quarter. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.5%.  Earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.51, up 24.4% from last year and reflects about $0.02 of benefit arising from our share repurchases.
Now, moving to our operational metrics. At the end of the third quarter, we were operating 2,244 stores and selling square footage was 235 million. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the third quarter were $281, up roughly 1.7%.
Now, turning to the balance sheet, we continue to effectively manage our inventory. At the end of the quarter, inventory was approximately $11 billion, up $176 million from a year ago. About half of that increase is attributable to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Inventory turns were 4.3x, up from 4.2x a year ago. We ended the quarter with $41.7 billion in assets, including $1.4 billion in cash. Year-to-date, this reflects cash generated by the business of approximately $3.9 billion, offset by $2 billion used for share repurchases, $1.2 billion used for dividends and approximately $700 million of capital expenditures. Note that for fiscal 2010, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $1.1 billion.
Now on the capital structure front, a few items of note. First, in the third quarter, we repurchased $800 million or 26.3 million shares of outstanding stock. Second, during the quarter, we repaid $1 billion of senior notes that came due on August 15 and subsequently, refinanced them on September 7 for a weighted average maturity of 20 years, with an average coupon of approximately 4.7%. Finally, computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 12%, 250 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2009.
Given that we've got nine months of performance behind us, we're going to tighten up the sales and earnings guidance we gave to you at the end of the second quarter. Looking ahead, we are projecting positive comp sales in the low single-digit area in Q4. Remember that we guide off of GAAP. We are calling for fiscal 2010 sales to increase by approximately 2.2%, with earnings per share from continuing operations increasing by approximately 25% to $1.94. Within this guidance, we expect our operating margin to be approximately 8.4% for the year. 
This guidance includes the benefit of our year-to-date share repurchases but doesn't include the impact of any additional share repurchases. It is our intent however to use excess cash to repurchase shares throughout the remainder of fiscal 2010. We look forward to covering our business prospects, including our thoughts on 2011 at our investor conference on December 8.

As we look at our private label credit card, we saw about a 300 basis point contraction in terms of the penetration of our private label card dropping from about 26% last year to about 23% this year. And of that 300 basis point contraction, about 150 basis points was in the deferred financing fees. In other words, for any purchases over $299, where everyday we offer a deferred financing option. So what we are seeing is a change in how consumers are using credit, and we think a lot of it is a headset change because of the CARD Act, which as you know, Matt, was enacted back in February. Before the CARD Act, our everyday value proposition was if you spent $299 in our stores, it was no interest, no payments for six months. It's now no interest, minimum payment. The customers are looking at that minimum payment and albeit it's a small payment, but they're looking at that minimum payment and saying, ""I'm not sure that value proposition works for me anymore."" And so they're switching out to the bank cards, and we've seen an increase in our bank card penetration accordingly. But if you step back from it, if you look at the savings rates in the country, you know that the savings rates now are over 4% and historically, the savings rates in the country are around 2%, so consumers have definitely deleveraged. We continue to look at our private label card as a way of driving sales. The approval rates for our card is north of 74%, so that's pretty good. The average line that's being approved is over $5,000. The average line for existing cardholders is close to $6,000, specifically 25% utilization. So it goes back to this sort of savings mentality that we see with consumers in our country, they're just delevering. So that's a long-winded answer to your question, but hopefully, that's helpful."

278679,112820408,88423,"The Home Depot, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2010",2010-11-16,"Earnings Calls","The Home Depot, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $16.6 billion, up 1.4% from last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.51. This is the fourth quarter in a row of positive comps for our business and the third quarter in a",845,"Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $16.6 billion, up 1.4% from last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.51. This is the fourth quarter in a row of positive comps for our business and the third quarter in a row of positive comps for the U.S., which had a comp of 1.5%.
In the U.S., over 80% of our top 40 markets positively comped. Compared to prior quarters, the variability of performance has narrowed, so that we see less dramatic swings on the positive and on the negative side. For example, in the third quarter of 2009, the spread between the best and worst of our top 40 markets was about 35 percentage points. This year, that spread is cut almost in half to about 18 points.
Our Gulf region is now exiting its year-over-year storm comparisons, so its negative comps have turned slightly positive. We saw strength in key markets, particularly in our Central and Mid-Atlantic regions, and we continue to see positive results in Florida and California. So from an overall perspective, we see a stabilizing business. And as the business stabilizes, we continue to improve our operational performance. We are exercising good control over our expenses, but we're also investing in the business to drive improvements across customer service, merchandising and our supply chain.
Let me give one recent example. Our technology and operations teams have developed and implemented a new technology for our store associates. We call it the First Phone [ph] because its core purpose is to reduce tasking time for our associates, so that they can instead focus on customer service. It is a handheld device that provides several functions: Inventory management, product location, SKU category and class performance analytics, a phone, a walkie-talkie and a mobile checkout. What makes the First Phone [ph] worth discussing are two general points: It was developed through close cooperation with our store operations and IT teams, perhaps the best collaboration we've ever had on a project like this. And we see it as the foundational element of improving our service for our DIY and Pro customers, putting knowledge and communication closer at hand to our associates on the floor at the store.
Similarly, we are continuing the development of our new merchandising tools. As an indicator of that, we had another quarter of improved inventory turns for the company. Our rollout of Rapid Deployment Centers, or RDCs, remains on track to reach 100% of our U.S. store base by the end of the year, and we are continuing the significant ongoing complementary work designed to get additional leverage from our supply chain.
Beyond the supply chain, we're building out a new set of analytical tools for our merchants across assortment planning, pricing and customer analytics. We'll discuss those at some greater length at our upcoming investor and analyst conference in December. But just as we have a goal to better enable our associates to deliver great customer service, we also have a goal to better enable our merchants to drive category growth in our business, and in both instances, technology is a critical enabler.
As Craig will detail, we've seen continued growth in our transactions. This quarter marks the fourth straight quarter of comp transactions growth. This provides some evidence that our market is steadying as customers focus on basic repair and maintenance activities. Average ticket continues to be a challenge just as the macro housing environment remains under pressure. We have often referenced private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP as an indicator of the overall health of the housing-related market. This past quarter saw another tick down and another record 60-year low as the ratio is now 2.2%. While our comp performance has disconnected from this metric, at least directionally, we still think this presents a picture of continued pressure in our market.
On the international front, our Mexican business continues to deliver positive comps. This is the 28th quarter in a row of positive comps. Not only is our Mexican business an important source of growth for the company, but also increasingly an important source of talent. For example, we have a district manager in Texas who began as a store manager in Mexico, and we have comparable examples of the Mexican team being a source of talent throughout our organization. 
Our Canadian business, as expected, experienced weakness in the quarter, with a negative comp of 5.6% in local currency as we began to anniversary the impacts of the Canadian government's Home Renovation Tax Credit. The difficult year-over-year comparisons will continue through the fourth quarter.
At the end of the third quarter, 76% of our stores are eligible for Success Sharing, our bonus program for our hourly associates. Our associates are working hard to improve our business. We're proud of the progress we're making while recognizing that we're just at the start of a long-term process. And we look forward to discussing our longer-term plans with you in December.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Craig."
278679,112820408,88423,"The Home Depot, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2010",2010-11-16,"Earnings Calls","The Home Depot, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone.

The third quarter represented our fourth quarter in a row of positive comp growth. We saw positive comps in eight departments during the quarter, and we're pleased with the sequential comp improvement we saw in the U.S. from the second to the third quarter. The departments that outperformed the company's average comp were Lumber, Garden, Electrical and Lighting. Flooring and Hardware performed in line with the company comp. Plumbing, Paint, and Kitchen and Bath showed positive comps while comps in Millwork and Building Materials were negative for the quarter.
As measured by consumer surveys, we gained consumer U.S. market share in units in nine out of our 13 departments during the quarter. Our strategy remains focused on driving value and innovation in our stores, and we see customers responding favorably to our efforts through increased transactions. Comp transactions were up 2.2% in the quarter. As expected, we have not yet turned the corner on average ticket. Comp average ticket was down 0.8% or $0.43 to $51.46 for the quarter.
Smaller ticket purchases were stronger in the quarter while the big ticket purchases remained under pressure. Transactions for tickets under $50, roughly 20% of our business in the U.S., were up 2.7% year-over-year. Transactions for tickets of $900 and above, also approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were down 3.4% in the third quarter. The main drivers behind our small ticket performance were our Maintenance and Repair, Seasonal and Outdoor Project businesses. As we’ve shared in past quarters, Maintenance and Repair continues to be an area of strength as customers spend money to maintain the investments in their homes. For example, categories such as sealers, plumbing repair, fasteners, water heaters and cleaning all had strong comp performance in the third quarter.
The Seasonal business came late in the quarter, as record heat across much of the U.S. in August and September kept many DIY gardeners indoors. In contrast, October presented an opportunity for fall planting and lawn repair. We took advantage of this opportunity and used the flexibility that we've built into our business through tools and process to delay our holiday sets and continue to drive our Outdoor business through the end of October. We saw specific strength in seed, chemicals and live goods. For example, our Live Goods business swung from a low-single digit negative comp in the second quarter to a positive comp in the third quarter, driven by a double-digit comp in the month of October. Additionally, we saw strength in outdoor project categories such as landscape, fencing, exterior paint and windows during the quarter.
Finally, we saw a continued momentum in paint, hardware, tools, electrical and plumbing in the third quarter. We've been working hard to improve our offering in these areas with a focus on our maintenance and repair customers, and our efforts are paying off.
On the other hand, we continue to see pressure in big ticket. The largest drivers of this big-ticket pressure in the third quarter were softness in building materials and discretionary spend areas, like kitchens, as well as tough compares in roofing as we lapped last year's heavy storms.
We continue to execute our portfolio strategy and drive results from our investments in merchandising category resets, new product introductions and the implementation of everyday great value. Let me share a few examples of this. During the quarter, we had an outstanding bath event called Vanity Insanity. We saw great results and terrific project selling from our associates during this event. We also introduced exciting new products such as additional LED bulbs in our EcoSmart brand, which can save customers up to 80% on their electric bills or lighting bills. Water savings products have also resonated well with our customers, such as our Glacier Bay dual flush toilets and HydroRight Dual-Flush Conversion Kit. And for our Decor customers, we introduced Martha Stewart kitchens, which is off to a fast start in our stores. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we are well positioned to drive sales with a great seasonal lineup of heaters, fireplaces and snow removal equipment. We will also be rolling out several new product introductions, including expansion of our Klein tools for professional electricians, USG's lightweight drywall that is 30% lighter than regular drywall panels and a new line of Epoxy Grouts, from Custom Building Products, that do not require sealing. 
Additionally, we leaned into the holiday season this year and increased our buys. Holiday decor is an inexpensive way for our customers to update and feel good about their homes. We have enhanced our offering with the Martha Stewart coordinated decor items and launched the EcoSmart LED lighting, which features exclusive new technology, including fully water resistant, continuous-on lights, so that if one breaks or comes loose, the rest stay lit. We also have outstanding values in our gift centers this year, as well as an incredible Black Friday line up. The early results from these categories have been strong, and we're confident that we’ll continue to drive customers to Home Depot stores. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."
278679,112820408,88423,"The Home Depot, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2010",2010-11-16,"Earnings Calls","The Home Depot, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. In the third quarter, sales were $16.6 billion, a 1.4% increase from last year. Comps to our same-store sales were positive 1.4% for the quarter, with positive comps of 0.7% in August, positive 1.1% in September and",923,"Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. In the third quarter, sales were $16.6 billion, a 1.4% increase from last year. Comps to our same-store sales were positive 1.4% for the quarter, with positive comps of 0.7% in August, positive 1.1% in September and positive 2.9% in October. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 1.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 0.6% in August, flat comps in September and positive comps of 3.5% in October.
Our gross margin was 34.3% for the quarter, an increase of 26 basis points from last year. Our U.S. business contributed 20 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter driven by the following factors: First, five basis points of expansion came from lower deferred interest due to a lower penetration of private label credit card sales. Second, approximately five basis points of expansion was due to commodity price inflation. Finally, through our portfolio approach and leveraging our newly developed analytics, we enjoyed another 10 basis points of net gross margin expansion, with some departments like Hardware and Plumbing reporting margin growth and some departments like Kitchen and Bath reporting margin contraction.
Our International businesses, principally Canada, contributed six basis points of gross margin expansion in the quarter, due primarily to a change in the mix of products sold. Operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 74 basis points to 25.5% and total operating expense dollars were $61 million less than last year.
Our operating leverage reflects positive same-store sales as well as lower expense in the following areas: First, depreciation expense was $28 million under last year due to a lower asset base arising from fully depreciated assets. Second, medical expense was $20 million under last year due to a number of items, including a lower number of enrollees. Third, we settled several real estate matters for a net $20 million benefit. And finally, we had a number of other expenses under last year, offset by expense increases in categories like credit card discounts. These items net to a $7 million increase in expense from last year.
At the end of the second quarter, we told you that we expected to see strong expense leverage in the back half of the year. Year-to-date, on an adjusted basis, our expense growth equaled approximately 30% of the growth in our sales. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect continued expense leverage such that for the year, expenses will grow at less than 30% of the growth in our sales.
Interest and other expense for the third quarter totaled $142 million, down $22 million from last year, reflecting lower levels of outstanding indebtedness. Our income tax provision rate was 36.1% in the third quarter. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.5%. Earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.51, up 24.4% from last year and reflects about two pennies of benefit arising from our share repurchases.
Now, moving to our operational metrics. At the end of the third quarter, we were operating 2,244 stores and selling square footage was 235 million. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the third quarter were $281, up roughly 1.7%.
Now, turning to the balance sheet, we continue to effectively manage our inventory. At the end of the quarter, inventory was approximately $11 billion, up $176 million from a year ago. About half of that increase is attributable to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Inventory turns were 4.3x, up from 4.2x a year ago. We ended the quarter with $41.7 billion in assets, including $1.4 billion in cash. Year-to-date, this reflects cash generated by the business of approximately $3.9 billion, offset by $2 billion used for share repurchases, $1.2 billion used for dividends and approximately $700 million of capital expenditures. Note that for fiscal 2010, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $1.1 billion.
Now on the capital structure front, a few items of note. First, in the third quarter, we repurchased $800 million or 26.3 million shares of outstanding stock. Second, during the quarter, we repaid $1 billion of senior notes that came due on August 15 and subsequently, refinanced them on September 7 for a weighted average maturity of 20 years, with an average coupon of approximately 4.7%. Finally, computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 12%, 250 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2009.
Given that we've got nine months of performance behind us, we're going to tighten up the sales and earnings guidance we gave you at the end of the second quarter. Looking ahead, we are projecting positive comp sales in the low-single digit area in Q4. Remember that we guide off of GAAP. We are calling for fiscal 2010 sales to increase by approximately 2.2%, with earnings per share from continuing operations increasing by approximately 25% to $1.94. Within this guidance, we expect our operating margin to be approximately 8.4% for the year. 
This guidance includes the benefit of our year-to-date share repurchases but doesn't include the impact of any additional share repurchases. It is our intent however to use excess cash to repurchase shares throughout the remainder of fiscal 2010. We look forward to covering our business prospects, including our thoughts on 2011 at our investor conference on December 8. 
We thank you for your participation in today's call, and we'll be happy to take your questions. So Abdullah, we are now ready for questions."

And of that 300 basis poin",327,"Yes. Well, it's interesting. As we look at our private label credit card, we saw about a 300-basis point contraction in terms of the penetration of our private label card dropping from about 26% last year to about 23% this year. And of that 300 basis point contraction, about 150 basis points was in the deferred financing fees. In other words, for any purchases over $299, where every day we offer a deferred financing option. So what we are seeing is a change in how consumers are using credit, and we think a lot of it is a headset change because of the CARD Act, which as you know, Matt, was enacted back in February. Before the CARD Act, our everyday value proposition was if you spent $299 in our stores, it was no interest, no payments for six months. It's now no interest, minimum payment. The customers are looking at that minimum payment and albeit it's a small payment, but they're looking at that minimum payment and saying, ""I'm not sure that value proposition works for me anymore."" And so they're switching out to bank cards, and we've seen an increase in our bank card penetration accordingly. But if you step back from it, if you look at the savings rates in the country, you know that the savings rates now are over 4% and historically, the savings rates in the country are around 2%, so consumers have definitely deleveraged. We continue to look at our private label card as a way of driving sales. The approval rates for our card is north of 74%, so that's pretty good. The average line that's being approved is over $5,000. The average line for existing cardholders is close to $6,000, but there’s only 25% utilization. So it goes back to this sort of savings mentality that we see with consumers in our country, they're just delevering. So that's a long-winded answer to your question, but hopefully, that's helpful."

We do work with our suppliers, and it's been historically something we've done to create great special buys where we can leverage the productivity in the factories, pass those savings onto our customers. So we feel really good about the buys that we've made for the holiday gift season, the Black Friday events. As I mentioned, so I think we feel that we're well positioned to compete in the marketplace. We do believe that we've gained ground in things like holiday decor and the seasonal businesses around fireplace and snow removal in the northern sector of the country over the past couple of years.
