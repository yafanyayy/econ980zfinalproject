Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2010 sales and earnings results. Now before we get started, I'd like to thank those of you who attended our recent New York City investor meeting. I hope one of your key takeaways from that meeting is that Constellation is evolving as a fundamentally different company that is better positioned than ever to deliver value. We are focused on executing a strategy into the foreseeable future that delivers this value to organic growth, enhanced profitability, free cash flow and ROIC.The third quarter is evidence of the fact that we continue to make progress against our strategic goals of generating cash, paying down debt and reducing cost. During the quarter, we advanced our portfolio transformation with the announcement of our agreement to sell our UK Cider business to C&C Group for approximately $70 million U.S. The Gaymer Cider Company was originally acquired in 1998 with the Matthew Clark business. This transaction is consistent with our strategic focus on premium, higher-growth, higher-margin, wine, beer and spirits brands.The deal is on track to close by mid-January and we expect to use the proceeds to further reduce our borrowings. During the quarter, we also progressed with transition activities associated with our U.S. distributor consolidation effort, which now encompasses in 22 states, representing approximately 60% of our total U.S. wine and spirits volume. As you know, the initial distributor transition commenced September 1, with the second quarter benefiting from the implementation of this program. At that time, actions were taken to ensure maximum levels of customer service between distributors and the retail customers during the transition period.Now these actions had the planned effect of moving a portion of third quarter sales into the second quarter and resulted in some inventory build after distributors. During the third quarter, consumer takeaway was softer than expected at the beginning of the quarter, but is improving as our new selling model and promotional efforts take effect. As a result, at the end of the third quarter, distributor inventories were higher than historically targeted levels. However, as you can see from the latest IRI data through December, our U.S. wine trends have improved from where they were early in the third quarter as our promotional activities have returned to more normal levels.From an overall marketplace perspective, in the IRI channels, growth in the U.S. wine market remains healthy at about 4% on a dollar basis according to recent 12-week data with the greater than $8 price segment growing in the high single-digit range. The on-premise channel remains challenging, although we believe it is stabilizing and the mass merchandise club channel is outperforming the food and drug channels. Despite the fact that many of our planned promotional activities were not implemented until late in the quarter, many of our leading well-known brands continue to perform well in the marketplace throughout the third quarter, including Robert Mondavi Private Selection and brands like Rex Goliath and Kim Crawford. And we recently received some noteworthy portfolio awards. Two of our wines were selected to be served at President Barack Obama's prestigious Nobel Prize banquet in Oslo and included the 2003 Inniskillin Gold Oak Aged Vidal Icewine and the 2005 Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. In addition, wine.com recently released their top brand list for 2009 showcasing the top wines sold through their website. Five Constellation wines. Five made that list including Robert Mondavi, Kim Crawford, Simi, Hogue and Clos du Bois.Our third quarter spirits net sales results are not representative of strong underlying performance because SVEDKA Vodka shipments this quarter are being compared against last year's third quarter, which was impacted by some unique circumstances. The last shortages related to new bottling changes for SVEDKA in last year's second quarter drove strong shipments in last year's third quarter, creating the difficult comparison. Despite this issue, SVEDKA posted another strong quarter of double-digit depletion growth with our year-to-date net sales increasing more than 40%. We continue to build SVEDKA's on-premise brand awareness by leveraging new distributor roots to market. We are growing our national accounts in on- and off-premise channels and are expanding in other core markets outside the U.S. Now moving to the Canadian Wine business. The overall business continued to be impacted by economically-driven negative mix trend. However, positive sales results were recorded by Naked Grape during the quarter, which is one of the leading premium brands in our wine portfolio. As you know, Vincor is a sponsor of the upcoming Winter Olympic Games scheduled for mid-February in Vancouver. We expect to fully capitalize on the brand-building opportunities that we have planned in connection with this event.And now moving to our International businesses. The challenges impacting the operating environment in Australia and the U.K. have not subsided. However, as you know, we continue to execute the previously announced restructuring of our businesses in these geographies in order to align them with the realities of their respective markets. This includes continuing to focus on cost reductions, decreasing net working capital investment and consolidating our overall footprint in these markets in order to increase efficiencies. In the short term, we are optimistic about our marketplace performance, especially in the U.K. during the holiday selling season.In early November, we announced that we were working towards the potential combination of portions of our U.K. and Australian operations with the Australian Vintage Limited in an effort to improve this prospects of these businesses going forward. I have nothing to report at this time as we continue working to bring this transaction to a successful conclusion. Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. As you know, we recently received notice of legal action by Modelo pertaining to the funding of the JV partners of an immaterial amount of incremental promotional and marketing dollars for the upcoming calendar year 2010. Previously, Modelo provided this incremental spending and had agreed to do so, once again, for the 2010 business plan year. My point in addressing this issue is to remind everyone that the Crown joint venture is not a party to this legal action. Crown's 2010 business plan has already been agreed upon by Modelo and Constellation and the JV will go forward with a focus on growing the business through the entire term of this contract. We intend to continue working closely with Crown to support the joint venture as it continues to operate its business and deliver products in a manner designed to meet or exceed the expectations of consumers, distributors and retail customers. Now moving to Crown's operational results for the third quarter. During the quarter, sales and operating income for the Crown joint venture continued to be impacted by economically-driven challenges in the on-premise and convenience store channels. Operating income, in particular was unfavorably impacted, not only by the volume declines but by the timing of national media programming for Major League Baseball and the National Football League, which occurred in the third quarter. However, depletion trends outpaced shipments in the quarter due in part to the favorable impact of this media program and resulted in temporary wholesaler inventory reduction.Crown is also realizing stabilizing trends in import category share gains in the grocery channel, where it is performing in line with the U.S. beer industry and outperforming the Imported Beer category. We believe this is the result of targeted marketing efforts in programming against this key channel. Recent IRI data, coinciding with the end of our third quarter, confirms improved performance across the Crown portfolio. For fiscal 2010, we continue to estimate a decrease in Crown depletions in the mid-single-digit range, with profits expected to decline in the high-single-digit range.What gives us confidence that we can achieve these goals? Crown continues to execute well at retail with solid promotional activity, marketing program and the rollout of new products and packaging. Expanded distribution has helped to increase selection, retail impact and price point options for consumers. These efforts have resulted in over 60,000 new points of distribution since August 1. And we continue to expand the rollout of Modelo Especial and Negra Modelo draft in key markets throughout the U.S. Modelo Especial, the number three import in the U.S., continues to be one of the few major super premium brands, experiencing double-digit market growth. Now before I turn the call over to Bob, many of you have seen the press release we issued earlier this week mentioning that José Fernandez, who was our CEO for Constellation Wines North America, has passed away after a courageous battle with cancer. He was a great leader who will be missed by everyone across our organization. As you know, Jay Wright, President of our North American Wine Organization, who many of you met at our recent New York investor meeting, will continue to lead the business as we have cultivated strong management continuity in the face of José's passing.In closing, despite the impact from the U.S. distributor consolidation activities on this quarter's results, we feel confident regarding our ability to harvest the ultimate benefit from the execution of the strategic initiative, a profitable organic growth. As I've indicated, the transition may not be particularly smooth as you've seen from our performance in both second and third quarter. However, we believe it's absolutely the right strategy to pursue for the long-term growth and profitability of our business. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial discussion of our third quarter business results. Bob?"

Our Q3 comparable EPS came in at $0.54 versus $0.60 in the previous year. The quarter witnessed quite a few unfavorable timing impacts across most product categories. U.S. wine was impacted by the shift of sales from Q",1840,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our Q3 comparable EPS came in at $0.54 versus $0.60 in the previous year. The quarter witnessed quite a few unfavorable timing impacts across most product categories. U.S. wine was impacted by the shift of sales from Q3 to Q2. Spirits sales growth was impacted by a previous-year glass shortage for SVEDKA. And Crown's profits were impacted by unfavorable sales timing and marketing expense timing in the quarter. In addition to these quarterly timing-related items, North American wine depletions did not begin to improve until late in the quarter. Our international business continued to experience gross margin pressures and Crown's Beer business continued to be impacted by the economy. We believe the negative timing events will correct themselves this year, and we also believe we have strategies in place to improve the more fundamental challenges facing the business. We have continued taking steps to strengthen our organic business model, and we are seeing good progress in a number of areas. As we continue to reduce costs, which has helped offset the impact of consumer shift to lower-margin products in this challenging economic environment; focus on generating free cash flow, as we are targeting to be in the high end of our full year free cash flow guidance range; reduce debt and interest expense; and work with our consolidated distributor base in the U.S. to drive improvement in our organic sales and mix trends.We saw good promotions and displays for our brands during the holiday season and began to see some improving depletion and marketplace trends in U.S. wine and beer as the quarter progressed. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter was 35%. We also project a full year rate of approximately 35% versus our previous targeted full year rate of 38%. The Q3 rate drove about $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS favorability in the quarter when we look back in relation to the previous full year tax rate projection of 38%. Now let's look at our Q3 P&L performance in more detail, but my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Let's go to the net sales line. As you can see from our news release on Page 13, our consolidated reported net sales decreased 4%, primarily due to the divestiture of our Value Spirits business, partially offset by the positive impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations. On an organic constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and FOREX, net sales were even with the prior year.My commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Our worldwide branded wine organic net sales, which appear on Page 12 of the release, were even versus the last year. This included a 3% decrease from North America, offset by an increase of 12% in Europe and 2% in Australia and New Zealand. North American sales were impacted by continuing economic challenges, higher levels of promotional spending and the shift of sales to the second quarter from the third quarter, as part of the U.S. distributor transition activities.We estimate this shift represented approximately $40 million to $50 million in net sales and about $0.05 to $0.07 of EPS. For Europe, sales benefited from increased volumes for our value-priced product offerings in the U.K. and an easier comparison versus Q3 last year. Spirits organic net sales decreased 2% for the quarter. Rob has already discussed the difficult comparison item we faced in the quarter. Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis using information on Page 14 of the release. For Q3, our consolidated gross margin was 35.4% versus 40% in the prior-year quarter. This reflects lower sales driven by the shift of U.S. sales from Q3 to Q2, higher promotion costs in the U.S., higher Australian COGS due to the flow-through of the more-expensive calendar 2008 harvest and negative sales mix in the U.K. and Australia. On a year-to-date basis, gross margins are down 2.3 percentage points, much less than the Q3 figure, again reflecting the many unfavorable timing aspects of Q3. The higher promotion cost in the U.S. represented a proactive effort to shift more promotion dollars into the second half of the year as we transition to our new distributor partners. Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was 16.1% of net sales compared to 18.8% a year ago. The reduction was primarily driven by our global initiative, lower marketing expense and elimination of our spirit SG&A commensurate with the sale of the Value Spirits business.Consolidated operating income decreased 13% to $190 million and operating margin decreased 1.9 percentage points to 19.3%. Given some of the shifts between Q2 and Q3 that I've discussed, it's important to look at our Q3 year-to-date operating margin of 18.1%, which is up 1.1 percentage points versus Q3 year-to-date last year. Our appropriate stewardship of SG&A spend more than offset the reduction in our gross profit margin on a year-to-date basis. I'd like now to turn to our segment operating income results on Page 11 of the release to provide highlights of our Q3 operating income change. Wine segment operating income decreased $22 million to $218 million. The decrease is primarily due to the Q2 sales shifts, higher promotion cost in the U.S., divestiture of the Value Spirits business and the decrease in international business profit margins through the negative mix and higher grape cost for Australian wine. These items were partially offset by savings from our SG&A reduction initiatives. For the quarter, corporate and other expenses totaled $28 million versus $22 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by costs related to Project Fusion, a multi-year program design to strengthen our global business systems and processes, as well as our efforts to improve our U.K. and Australian businesses, including the possibility of combining portions of these businesses with the Australian Vintage Limited.On Page 14, you can see consolidated equity investment earnings totaled $60 million versus $76 million last year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $46 million versus $62 million. The remainder of equity earnings in Q3 fiscal 2010 and Q3 fiscal '09 are primarily generated by Opus One. For the third quarter, Crown generated net sales of $499 million, a decrease of 10%; and operating income of $91 million, a decrease of 26%. Economic challenges continue to drive soft performance in the convenience and on-premise channels and consumer movement to lower price beer. Q3 witnessed some unfavorable sales timing, which we expect to emerge in Q4 as depletion trend improved and outpaced shipments during the quarter.Crown continues to execute a targeted promotional marketing support and new package introductions to drive share improvement in the Grocery Channel Import category. Operating income for Crown was impacted by lower net sales, marketing expense timing related to national media for Corona Extra and Corona Light and a contractual cost increase. Interest expense for the quarter was $64 million, down 18% versus last year. The decrease was primarily driven by our significant debt reduction actions during the last 12 months. Let's take a look at our debt position. At the end of November, our debt totaled $4.1 billion, which represents a $336 million decrease from our debt level at the end of 2009.The decrease primarily reflects proceeds received from the sale of the Value Spirits business and positive free cash flow. Our average interest rate for the quarter was around 6.2%. Our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of November was 4.2x versus 4.3x at the end of fiscal 2009. Proceeds from the pending sale of our U.K. Cider business combined with targeted free cash flow generation in Q4 should reduce this ratio to the high three-time range by the end of fiscal 2010. We feel that our strong cash flow, reduced leverage, improved credit profile and much improved credit markets make this quarter an appropriate time to offer to extend our revolving credit facility. We will also like to initiate this process in the very near term. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 35%, which reflects the favorable outcome of various tax items. The rate for Q3 fiscal 2009 was 39%. As mentioned earlier, we now project our full-year comparable basis tax rate to approximate 35%, which is much improved versus the previous guidance of 38%. Now let's turn to cash flow on Page 10 of the news release. For purposes of this discussion, free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the nine months of fiscal 2010, we generated free cash flow of $100 million versus $235 million in the prior year. The lower cash generation was due primarily to higher taxes paid, including approximately $65 million related to the sale of the Value Spirits business. In addition, timing of sales in the quarter resulted at higher U.S. receivable balance. This higher receivable balance was more than offset by inventory reductions from lower fiscal 2010 grape harvest cost in Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. versus the prior year, and less interest pay. As a reminder, free cash flow for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 reflected a benefit of approximately $85 million in pretax proceeds related to the favorable settlement of certain foreign currency hedges. For fiscal 2010, we now expect CapEx to be in the range of $130 million to $150 million versus our previous $150 million to $170 million projection. The reduction in planned CapEx spending is contributing to free cash flow targeted at the upper end of our $230 million to $270 million guidance range. Moving to our P&L outlook for full-year fiscal 2010. We still expect comparable basis EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 with reduced full-year expected tax rate of approximately 35%. Our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition-related integration cost, restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on Page 17. During Q3, we recognized approximately $60 million of impairment and other charges related to Ruffino, an Italian wine company in which we had a 40% ownership interest. This includes a $25 million non-cash impairment for this equity-method investment as financial performance of this business continues to decline due in part to the strengthening of the euro versus the U.S. dollar.In addition, a $35 million charge was recorded as the 10% shareholder of Ruffino gave notice of its intent to exercise, a put option to Constellation at a contracted option price determined at the 2004 acquisition date. This put essentially represents the deferred purchase price from the 2004 investment that we expect to pay in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Before we take your questions, I would like to note we are working to leverage the benefit of our distributor-consolidation initiative and leverage our P&L to expense management business and increase operational efficiency. We plan to use free cash flow to further delever and reduce interest expense. All of this activity should drive improvement in our organic business model and ROIC. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

So we're pretty optimistic that things are working pretty well at this stage on the wine side. And then the beer side, as much as Bob said, we had some very good media. The media, I think, drove some pretty strong sales particularly in grocery. We're seeing some stabilization on the on-premise side. I'd say the convenience sector still remains highly challenged. So on beer, I would say that wow, we're generally pleased and optimistic with the performance. We're, nevertheless, still believing that we'll be down from a depletion perspective mid-single digits for the year.

And fundamentally, there isn't trading down and that the higher-priced segments are now growing much faster than the lower-priced segments with, say, the super-premium-plus category growing high-single digits again. Now that said, I still would say that within categories, there is some trading down going on. And I say category, it means price segment. So if you look at, say, the $10 to $15 segment, within that, there would be some trading down towards the lower end of that segment versus the higher end or if you look in even the higher-end segments, you'll see some trading down. But fundamentally, there's trading up; although within segments, there's trading down. And therefore, there can be some negative mix shift, which isn't the case, there is some negative mix shift in the business. And even within categories, some of the lower-priced products are selling better than the higher-priced products. And of course, margin tends to go with the price points."

And in the past, you've talked about the fact that you don't feel that at times, the value of the Crown JV is reflected in the value of the share price and I guess, with this lawsuit, maybe it puts a bit of a cloud on that?"

Obviously, there is a disagreement between us and Modelo on the point that is being litigated in the lawsuit, but I would say that as a general proposition that both partners recognize that we had to get along and we have to work together as it relates to the overall operations of Crown to maximize its success. So no, we can't ignore the fact that there is a dispute over something very specific which is being litigated but we're all reasonable people, and we all understand that we have to get along and operate with respect to ensuring that the operations of the business are maximized.

Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2010 sales and earnings results. Now before we get started, I'd like to thank those of you who attended our recent New York City investor meeting. I hope one of your key takeaways from that meeting is that Constellation is evolving as a fundamentally different company that is better positioned than ever to deliver value. We are focused on executing a strategy into the foreseeable future that delivers this value to organic growth, enhanced profitability, free cash flow and ROIC.The third quarter is evidence of the fact that we continue to make progress against our strategic goals of generating cash, paying down debt and reducing cost. During the quarter, we advanced our portfolio transformation with the announcement of our agreement to sell our UK Cider business to C&C Group for approximately $70 million U.S. The Gaymer Cider Company was originally acquired in 1998 with the Matthew Clark business. This transaction is consistent with our strategic focus on premium, higher-growth, higher-margin, wine, beer and spirits brands.The deal is on track to close by mid-January and we expect to use the proceeds to further reduce our borrowings. During the quarter, we also progressed with transition activities associated with our U.S. distributor consolidation effort, which now encompasses in 22 states, representing approximately 60% of our total U.S. wine and spirits volume. As you know, the initial distributor transition commenced September 1, with the second quarter benefiting from the implementation of this program. At that time, actions were taken to ensure maximum levels of customer service between distributors and the retail customers during the transition period.Now these actions had the planned effect of moving a portion of third quarter sales into the second quarter and resulted in some inventory build after distributors. During the third quarter, consumer takeaway was softer than expected at the beginning of the quarter, but is improving as our new selling model and promotional efforts take effect. As a result, at the end of the third quarter, distributor inventories were higher than historically targeted levels. However, as you can see from the latest IRI data through December, our U.S. wine trends have improved from where they were early in the third quarter as our promotional activities have returned to more normal levels.From an overall marketplace perspective, in the IRI channels, growth in the U.S. wine market remains healthy at about 4% on a dollar basis according to recent 12-week data with the greater than $8 price segment growing in the high single-digit range. The on-premise channel remains challenging, although we believe it is stabilizing and the mass merchandise club channel is outperforming the food and drug channels. Despite the fact that many of our planned promotional activities were not implemented until late in the quarter, many of our leading well-known brands continue to perform well in the marketplace throughout the third quarter, including Robert Mondavi Private Selection and brands like Rex Goliath and Kim Crawford. And we recently received some noteworthy portfolio awards. Two of our wines were selected to be served at President Barack Obama's prestigious Nobel Prize banquet in Oslo and included the 2003 Inniskillin Gold Oak Aged Vidal Icewine and the 2005 Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. In addition, wine.com recently released their top brand list for 2009 showcasing the top wines sold through their website. Five Constellation wines. Five made that list including Robert Mondavi, Kim Crawford, Simi, Hogue and Clos du Bois.Our third quarter spirits net sales results are not representative of strong underlying performance because SVEDKA Vodka shipments this quarter are being compared against last year's third quarter, which was impacted by some unique circumstances. The last shortages related to new bottling changes for SVEDKA in last year's second quarter drove strong shipments in last year's third quarter, creating the difficult comparison. Despite this issue, SVEDKA posted another strong quarter of double-digit depletion growth with our year-to-date net sales increasing more than 40%. We continue to build SVEDKA's on-premise brand awareness by leveraging new distributor roots to market. We are growing our national accounts in on- and off-premise channels and are expanding in other core markets outside the U.S. Now moving to the Canadian Wine business. The overall business continued to be impacted by economically-driven negative mix trend. However, positive sales results were recorded by Naked Grape during the quarter, which is one of the leading premium brands in our wine portfolio. As you know, Vincor is a sponsor of the upcoming Winter Olympic Games scheduled for mid-February in Vancouver. We expect to fully capitalize on the brand-building opportunities that we have planned in connection with this event.And now moving to our International businesses. The challenges impacting the operating environment in Australia and the U.K. have not subsided. However, as you know, we continue to execute the previously announced restructuring of our businesses in these geographies in order to align them with the realities of their respective markets. This includes continuing to focus on cost reductions, decreasing net working capital investment and consolidating our overall footprint in these markets in order to increase efficiencies. In the short term, we are optimistic about our marketplace performance, especially in the U.K. during the holiday selling season.In early November, we announced that we were working towards the potential combination of portions of our U.K. and Australian operations with the Australian Vintage Limited in an effort to improve this prospects of these businesses going forward. I have nothing to report at this time as we continue working to bring this transaction to a successful conclusion. Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. As you know, we recently received notice of legal action by Modelo pertaining to the funding of the JV partners of an immaterial amount of incremental promotional and marketing dollars for the upcoming calendar year 2010. Previously, Modelo provided this incremental spending and had agreed to do so, once again, for the 2010 business plan year. My point in addressing this issue is to remind everyone that the Crown joint venture is not a party to this legal action. Crown's 2010 business plan has already been agreed upon by Modelo and Constellation and the JV will go forward with a focus on growing the business through the entire term of this contract. We intend to continue working closely with Crown to support the joint venture as it continues to operate its business and deliver products in a manner designed to meet or exceed the expectations of consumers, distributors and retail customers. Now moving to Crown's operational results for the third quarter. During the quarter, sales and operating income for the Crown joint venture continued to be impacted by economically-driven challenges in the on-premise and convenience store channels. Operating income, in particular was unfavorably impacted, not only by the volume declines but by the timing of national media programming for Major League Baseball and the National Football League, which occurred in the third quarter. However, depletion trends outpaced shipments in the quarter due in part to the favorable impact of this media program and resulted in temporary wholesaler inventory reduction.Crown is also realizing stabilizing trends in import category share gains in the grocery channel, where it is performing in line with the U.S. beer industry and outperforming the Imported Beer category. We believe this is the result of targeted marketing efforts in programming against this key channel. Recent IRI data, coinciding with the end of our third quarter, confirms improved performance across the Crown portfolio. For fiscal 2010, we continue to estimate a decrease in Crown depletions in the mid-single-digit range, with profits expected to decline in the high-single-digit range.What gives us confidence that we can achieve these goals? Crown continues to execute well at retail with solid promotional activity, marketing program and the rollout of new products and packaging. Expanded distribution has helped to increase selection, retail impact and price point options for consumers. These efforts have resulted in over 60,000 new points of distribution since August 1. And we continue to expand the rollout of Modelo Especial and Negra Modelo draft in key markets throughout the U.S. Modelo Especial, the number three import in the U.S., continues to be one of the few major super premium brands, experiencing double-digit market growth. Now before I turn the call over to Bob, many of you have seen the press release we issued earlier this week mentioning that José Fernandez, who was our CEO for Constellation Wines North America, has passed away after a courageous battle with cancer. He was a great leader who will be missed by everyone across our organization. As you know, Jay Wright, President of our North American Wine Organization, who many of you met at our recent New York investor meeting, will continue to lead the business as we have cultivated strong management continuity in the face of José's passing.In closing, despite the impact from the U.S. distributor consolidation activities on this quarter's results, we feel confident regarding our ability to harvest the ultimate benefit from the execution of the strategic initiative, a profitable organic growth. As I've indicated, the transition may not be particularly smooth as you've seen from our performance in both second and third quarter. However, we believe it's absolutely the right strategy to pursue for the long-term growth and profitability of our business. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial discussion of our third quarter business results. Bob?"

Our Q3 comparable EPS came in at $0.54 versus $0.60 in the previous year. The quarter witnessed quite a few unfavorable timing impacts across most product categories. U.S. wine was impacted by the shift of sales from Q",1840,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our Q3 comparable EPS came in at $0.54 versus $0.60 in the previous year. The quarter witnessed quite a few unfavorable timing impacts across most product categories. U.S. wine was impacted by the shift of sales from Q3 to Q2. Spirits sales growth was impacted by a previous-year glass shortage for SVEDKA. And Crown's profits were impacted by unfavorable sales timing and marketing expense timing in the quarter. In addition to these quarterly timing-related items, North American wine depletions did not begin to improve until late in the quarter. Our international business continued to experience gross margin pressures and Crown's Beer business continued to be impacted by the economy. We believe the negative timing events will correct themselves this year, and we also believe we have strategies in place to improve the more fundamental challenges facing the business. We have continued taking steps to strengthen our organic business model, and we are seeing good progress in a number of areas. As we continue to reduce costs, which has helped offset the impact of consumer shift to lower-margin products in this challenging economic environment; focus on generating free cash flow, as we are targeting to be in the high end of our full year free cash flow guidance range; reduce debt and interest expense; and work with our consolidated distributor base in the U.S. to drive improvement in our organic sales and mix trends.We saw good promotions and displays for our brands during the holiday season and began to see some improving depletion and marketplace trends in U.S. wine and beer as the quarter progressed. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter was 35%. We also project a full year rate of approximately 35% versus our previous targeted full year rate of 38%. The Q3 rate drove about $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS favorability in the quarter when we look back in relation to the previous full year tax rate projection of 38%. Now let's look at our Q3 P&L performance in more detail, but my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Let's go to the net sales line. As you can see from our news release on Page 13, our consolidated reported net sales decreased 4%, primarily due to the divestiture of our Value Spirits business, partially offset by the positive impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations. On an organic constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and FOREX, net sales were even with the prior year.My commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Our worldwide branded wine organic net sales, which appear on Page 12 of the release, were even versus the last year. This included a 3% decrease from North America, offset by an increase of 12% in Europe and 2% in Australia and New Zealand. North American sales were impacted by continuing economic challenges, higher levels of promotional spending and the shift of sales to the second quarter from the third quarter, as part of the U.S. distributor transition activities.We estimate this shift represented approximately $40 million to $50 million in net sales and about $0.05 to $0.07 of EPS. For Europe, sales benefited from increased volumes for our value-priced product offerings in the U.K. and an easier comparison versus Q3 last year. Spirits organic net sales decreased 2% for the quarter. Rob has already discussed the difficult comparison item we faced in the quarter. Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis using information on Page 14 of the release. For Q3, our consolidated gross margin was 35.4% versus 40% in the prior-year quarter. This reflects lower sales driven by the shift of U.S. sales from Q3 to Q2, higher promotion costs in the U.S., higher Australian COGS due to the flow-through of the more-expensive calendar 2008 harvest and negative sales mix in the U.K. and Australia. On a year-to-date basis, gross margins are down 2.3 percentage points, much less than the Q3 figure, again reflecting the many unfavorable timing aspects of Q3. The higher promotion cost in the U.S. represented a proactive effort to shift more promotion dollars into the second half of the year as we transition to our new distributor partners. Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was 16.1% of net sales compared to 18.8% a year ago. The reduction was primarily driven by our global initiative, lower marketing expense and elimination of our spirit SG&A commensurate with the sale of the Value Spirits business.Consolidated operating income decreased 13% to $190 million and operating margin decreased 1.9 percentage points to 19.3%. Given some of the shifts between Q2 and Q3 that I've discussed, it's important to look at our Q3 year-to-date operating margin of 18.1%, which is up 1.1 percentage points versus Q3 year-to-date last year. Our appropriate stewardship of SG&A spend more than offset the reduction in our gross profit margin on a year-to-date basis. I'd like now to turn to our segment operating income results on Page 11 of the release to provide highlights of our Q3 operating income change. Wine segment operating income decreased $22 million to $218 million. The decrease is primarily due to the Q2 sales shifts, higher promotion cost in the U.S., divestiture of the Value Spirits business and the decrease in international business profit margins through the negative mix and higher grape cost for Australian wine. These items were partially offset by savings from our SG&A reduction initiatives. For the quarter, corporate and other expenses totaled $28 million versus $22 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by costs related to Project Fusion, a multi-year program design to strengthen our global business systems and processes, as well as our efforts to improve our U.K. and Australian businesses, including the possibility of combining portions of these businesses with the Australian Vintage Limited.On Page 14, you can see consolidated equity investment earnings totaled $60 million versus $76 million last year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $46 million versus $62 million. The remainder of equity earnings in Q3 fiscal 2010 and Q3 fiscal '09 are primarily generated by Opus One. For the third quarter, Crown generated net sales of $499 million, a decrease of 10%; and operating income of $91 million, a decrease of 26%. Economic challenges continue to drive soft performance in the convenience and on-premise channels and consumer movement to lower price beer. Q3 witnessed some unfavorable sales timing, which we expect to emerge in Q4 as depletion trend improved and outpaced shipments during the quarter.Crown continues to execute a targeted promotional marketing support and new package introductions to drive share improvement in the Grocery Channel Import category. Operating income for Crown was impacted by lower net sales, marketing expense timing related to national media for Corona Extra and Corona Light and a contractual cost increase. Interest expense for the quarter was $64 million, down 18% versus last year. The decrease was primarily driven by our significant debt reduction actions during the last 12 months. Let's take a look at our debt position. At the end of November, our debt totaled $4.1 billion, which represents a $336 million decrease from our debt level at the end of 2009.The decrease primarily reflects proceeds received from the sale of the Value Spirits business and positive free cash flow. Our average interest rate for the quarter was around 6.2%. Our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of November was 4.2x versus 4.3x at the end of fiscal 2009. Proceeds from the pending sale of our U.K. Cider business combined with targeted free cash flow generation in Q4 should reduce this ratio to the high three-time range by the end of fiscal 2010. We feel that our strong cash flow, reduced leverage, improved credit profile and much improved credit markets make this quarter an appropriate time to offer to extend our revolving credit facility. We will also like to initiate this process in the very near term. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 35%, which reflects the favorable outcome of various tax items. The rate for Q3 fiscal 2009 was 39%. As mentioned earlier, we now project our full-year comparable basis tax rate to approximate 35%, which is much improved versus the previous guidance of 38%. Now let's turn to cash flow on Page 10 of the news release. For purposes of this discussion, free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the nine months of fiscal 2010, we generated free cash flow of $100 million versus $235 million in the prior year. The lower cash generation was due primarily to higher taxes paid, including approximately $65 million related to the sale of the Value Spirits business. In addition, timing of sales in the quarter resulted at higher U.S. receivable balance. This higher receivable balance was more than offset by inventory reductions from lower fiscal 2010 grape harvest cost in Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. versus the prior year, and less interest pay. As a reminder, free cash flow for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 reflected a benefit of approximately $85 million in pretax proceeds related to the favorable settlement of certain foreign currency hedges. For fiscal 2010, we now expect CapEx to be in the range of $130 million to $150 million versus our previous $150 million to $170 million projection. The reduction in planned CapEx spending is contributing to free cash flow targeted at the upper end of our $230 million to $270 million guidance range. Moving to our P&L outlook for full-year fiscal 2010. We still expect comparable basis EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 with reduced full-year expected tax rate of approximately 35%. Our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition-related integration cost, restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on Page 17. During Q3, we recognized approximately $60 million of impairment and other charges related to Ruffino, an Italian wine company in which we had a 40% ownership interest. This includes a $25 million non-cash impairment for this equity-method investment as financial performance of this business continues to decline due in part to the strengthening of the euro versus the U.S. dollar.In addition, a $35 million charge was recorded as the 10% shareholder of Ruffino gave notice of its intent to exercise, a put option to Constellation at a contracted option price determined at the 2004 acquisition date. This put essentially represents the deferred purchase price from the 2004 investment that we expect to pay in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Before we take your questions, I would like to note we are working to leverage the benefit of our distributor-consolidation initiative and leverage our P&L to expense management business and increase operational efficiency. We plan to use free cash flow to further delever and reduce interest expense. All of this activity should drive improvement in our organic business model and ROIC. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

The industry in general, although it is performing well, I would say it's been fairly consistent as opposed to there being an uptick. Now in our business, on the wine side, yes, we're seeing some improved performance. I think that, that's generally as a result of the fact that a lot of our efforts, for instance our distributor consolidation, the increase in our promotional activities in the third quarter, these things are now kicking in. And we really started to see some of the positive impact on that in late third quarter and we've seen some of the positive impact of that into December and the holiday season. So we're pretty optimistic that things are working pretty well at this stage on the wine side. And then the beer side, as much as Bob said, we had some very good media. The media, I think, drove some pretty strong sales particularly in grocery. We're seeing some stabilization on the on-premise side. I'd say the convenience sector still remains highly challenged. So on beer, I would say that wow, we're generally pleased and optimistic with the performance. We're, nevertheless, still believing that we'll be down from a depletion perspective mid-single digits for the year. Because in general, that segment, the Import segment -- although we're way outperforming the competitors, that segment still remains pretty challenged in the Beer business."

Our full year free cash flow is targeted to be at the upper end of our guidance range. We reduced debt by more than $335 million since the beginning of our fiscal year. We continued our portfolio transformation efforts with the proposed sale of our Cider business, the proceeds of which we expect to be used to further reduce our debt. We are experiencing improving depletion trends in our U.S. Wine, Spirits and Beer business. And lastly, we continue to progress with our distributor consolidation initiative. Our plan is to continue execution of our strategic initiatives throughout the final quarter of the year. And finally, we will be providing guidance for our fiscal year 2011 during our next quarterly conference call scheduled for early April. So thank you again everybody for joining our call."

Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2010 sales and earnings results. Now before we get started, I'd like to thank those of you who attended our recent New York City investor meeting. I hope one of your key takeaways from that meeting is that Constellation is evolving as a fundamentally different company that is better positioned than ever to deliver value. We are focused on executing a strategy into the foreseeable future that delivers this value to organic growth, enhanced profitability, free cash flow and ROIC.The third quarter is evidence of the fact that we continue to make progress against our strategic goals of generating cash, paying down debt and reducing cost. During the quarter, we advanced our portfolio transformation with the announcement of our agreement to sell our UK Cider business to C&C Group for approximately $70 million U.S. The Gaymer Cider Company was originally acquired in 1998 with the Matthew Clark business. This transaction is consistent with our strategic focus on premium, higher-growth, higher-margin, wine, beer and spirits brands.The deal is on track to close by mid-January and we expect to use the proceeds to further reduce our borrowings. During the quarter, we also progressed with transition activities associated with our U.S. distributor consolidation effort, which now encompasses in 22 states, representing approximately 60% of our total U.S. wine and spirits volume. As you know, the initial distributor transition commenced September 1, with the second quarter benefiting from the implementation of this program. At that time, actions were taken to ensure maximum levels of customer service between distributors and the retail customers during the transition period.Now these actions had the planned effect of moving a portion of third quarter sales into the second quarter and resulted in some inventory build after distributors. During the third quarter, consumer takeaway was softer than expected at the beginning of the quarter, but is improving as our new selling model and promotional efforts take effect. As a result, at the end of the third quarter, distributor inventories were higher than historically targeted levels. However, as you can see from the latest IRI data through December, our U.S. wine trends have improved from where they were early in the third quarter as our promotional activities have returned to more normal levels.From an overall marketplace perspective, in the IRI channels, growth in the U.S. wine market remains healthy at about 4% on a dollar basis according to recent 12-week data with the greater than $8 price segment growing in the high single-digit range. The on-premise channel remains challenging, although we believe it is stabilizing and the mass merchandise club channel is outperforming the food and drug channels. Despite the fact that many of our planned promotional activities were not implemented until late in the quarter, many of our leading well-known brands continue to perform well in the marketplace throughout the third quarter, including Robert Mondavi Private Selection and brands like Rex Goliath and Kim Crawford. And we recently received some noteworthy portfolio awards. Two of our wines were selected to be served at President Barack Obama's prestigious Nobel Prize banquet in Oslo and included the 2003 Inniskillin Gold Oak Aged Vidal Icewine and the 2005 Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. In addition, wine.com recently released their top brand list for 2009 showcasing the top wines sold through their website. Five Constellation wines. Five made that list including Robert Mondavi, Kim Crawford, Simi, Hogue and Clos du Bois.Our third quarter spirits net sales results are not representative of strong underlying performance because SVEDKA Vodka shipments this quarter are being compared against last year's third quarter, which was impacted by some unique circumstances. The last shortages related to new bottling changes for SVEDKA in last year's second quarter drove strong shipments in last year's third quarter, creating the difficult comparison. Despite this issue, SVEDKA posted another strong quarter of double-digit depletion growth with our year-to-date net sales increasing more than 40%. We continue to build SVEDKA's on-premise brand awareness by leveraging new distributor roots to market. We are growing our national accounts in on- and off-premise channels and are expanding in other core markets outside the U.S. Now moving to the Canadian Wine business. The overall business continued to be impacted by economically-driven negative mix trend. However, positive sales results were recorded by Naked Grape during the quarter, which is one of the leading premium brands in our wine portfolio. As you know, Vincor is a sponsor of the upcoming Winter Olympic Games scheduled for mid-February in Vancouver. We expect to fully capitalize on the brand-building opportunities that we have planned in connection with this event.And now moving to our International businesses. The challenges impacting the operating environment in Australia and the U.K. have not subsided. However, as you know, we continue to execute the previously announced restructuring of our businesses in these geographies in order to align them with the realities of their respective markets. This includes continuing to focus on cost reductions, decreasing net working capital investment and consolidating our overall footprint in these markets in order to increase efficiencies. In the short term, we are optimistic about our marketplace performance, especially in the U.K. during the holiday selling season.In early November, we announced that we were working towards the potential combination of portions of our U.K. and Australian operations with the Australian Vintage Limited in an effort to improve this prospects of these businesses going forward. I have nothing to report at this time as we continue working to bring this transaction to a successful conclusion. Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. As you know, we recently received notice of legal action by Modelo pertaining to the funding of the JV partners of an immaterial amount of incremental promotional and marketing dollars for the upcoming calendar year 2010. Previously, Modelo provided this incremental spending and had agreed to do so, once again, for the 2010 business plan year. My point in addressing this issue is to remind everyone that the Crown joint venture is not a party to this legal action. Crown's 2010 business plan has already been agreed upon by Modelo and Constellation and the JV will go forward with a focus on growing the business through the entire term of this contract. We intend to continue working closely with Crown to support the joint venture as it continues to operate its business and deliver products in a manner designed to meet or exceed the expectations of consumers, distributors and retail customers. Now moving to Crown's operational results for the third quarter. During the quarter, sales and operating income for the Crown joint venture continued to be impacted by economically-driven challenges in the on-premise and convenience store channels. Operating income, in particular was unfavorably impacted, not only by the volume declines but by the timing of national media programming for Major League Baseball and the National Football League, which occurred in the third quarter. However, depletion trends outpaced shipments in the quarter due in part to the favorable impact of this media program and resulted in temporary wholesaler inventory reduction.Crown is also realizing stabilizing trends in import category share gains in the grocery channel, where it is performing in line with the U.S. beer industry and outperforming the Imported Beer category. We believe this is the result of targeted marketing efforts in programming against this key channel. Recent IRI data, coinciding with the end of our third quarter, confirms improved performance across the Crown portfolio. For fiscal 2010, we continue to estimate a decrease in Crown depletions in the mid-single-digit range, with profits expected to decline in the high-single-digit range.What gives us confidence that we can achieve these goals? Crown continues to execute well at retail with solid promotional activity, marketing program and the rollout of new products and packaging. Expanded distribution has helped to increase selection, retail impact and price point options for consumers. These efforts have resulted in over 60,000 new points of distribution since August 1. And we continue to expand the rollout of Modelo Especial and Negra Modelo draft in key markets throughout the U.S. Modelo Especial, the number three import in the U.S., continues to be one of the few major super premium brands, experiencing double-digit market growth. Now before I turn the call over to Bob, many of you have seen the press release we issued earlier this week mentioning that José Fernandez, who was our CEO for Constellation Wines North America, has passed away after a courageous battle with cancer. He was a great leader who will be missed by everyone across our organization. As you know, Jay Wright, President of our North American Wine Organization, who many of you met at our recent New York investor meeting, will continue to lead the business as we have cultivated strong management continuity in the face of José's passing.In closing, despite the impact from the U.S. distributor consolidation activities on this quarter's results, we feel confident regarding our ability to harvest the ultimate benefit from the execution of the strategic initiative, a profitable organic growth. As I've indicated, the transition may not be particularly smooth as you've seen from our performance in both second and third quarter. However, we believe it's absolutely the right strategy to pursue for the long-term growth and profitability of our business. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial discussion of our third quarter business results. Bob?"

U.S. wine was impacted by the shift of sales from Q",1840,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our Q3 comparable EPS came in at $0.54 versus $0.60 in the previous year. The quarter witnessed quite a few unfavorable timing impacts across most product categories. U.S. wine was impacted by the shift of sales from Q3 to Q2. Spirits sales growth was impacted by a previous-year glass shortage for SVEDKA. And Crown's profits were impacted by unfavorable sales timing and marketing expense timing in the quarter. In addition to these quarterly timing-related items, North American wine depletions did not begin to improve until late in the quarter. Our international business continued to experience gross margin pressures and Crown's Beer business continued to be impacted by the economy. We believe the negative timing events will correct themselves this year, and we also believe we have strategies in place to improve the more fundamental challenges facing the business. We have continued taking steps to strengthen our organic business model, and we are seeing good progress in a number of areas. As we continue to reduce costs, which has helped offset the impact of consumer shift to lower-margin products in this challenging economic environment; focus on generating free cash flow, as we are targeting to be in the high end of our full year free cash flow guidance range; reduce debt and interest expense; and work with our consolidated distributor base in the U.S. to drive improvement in our organic sales and mix trends.We saw good promotions and displays for our brands during the holiday season and began to see some improving depletion and marketplace trends in U.S. wine and beer as the quarter progressed. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter was 35%. We also project a full year rate of approximately 35% versus our previous targeted full year rate of 38%. The Q3 rate drove about $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS favorability in the quarter when we look back in relation to the previous full year tax rate projection of 38%. Now let's look at our Q3 P&L performance in more detail, but my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Let's go to the net sales line. As you can see from our news release on Page 13, our consolidated reported net sales decreased 4%, primarily due to the divestiture of our Value Spirits business, partially offset by the positive impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations. On an organic constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and FOREX, net sales were even with the prior year.My commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Our worldwide branded wine organic net sales, which appear on Page 12 of the release, were even versus the last year. This included a 3% decrease from North America, offset by an increase of 12% in Europe and 2% in Australia and New Zealand. North American sales were impacted by continuing economic challenges, higher levels of promotional spending and the shift of sales to the second quarter from the third quarter, as part of the U.S. distributor transition activities.We estimate this shift represented approximately $40 million to $50 million in net sales and about $0.05 to $0.07 of EPS. For Europe, sales benefited from increased volumes for our value-priced product offerings in the U.K. and an easier comparison versus Q3 last year. Spirits organic net sales decreased 2% for the quarter. Rob has already discussed the difficult comparison item we faced in the quarter. Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis using information on Page 14 of the release. For Q3, our consolidated gross margin was 35.4% versus 40% in the prior-year quarter. This reflects lower sales driven by the shift of U.S. sales from Q3 to Q2, higher promotion costs in the U.S., higher Australian COGS due to the flow-through of the more-expensive calendar 2008 harvest and negative sales mix in the U.K. and Australia. On a year-to-date basis, gross margins are down 2.3 percentage points, much less than the Q3 figure, again reflecting the many unfavorable timing aspects of Q3. The higher promotion cost in the U.S. represented a proactive effort to shift more promotion dollars into the second half of the year as we transition to our new distributor partners. Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was 16.1% of net sales compared to 18.8% a year ago. The reduction was primarily driven by our global initiative, lower marketing expense and elimination of our spirit SG&A commensurate with the sale of the Value Spirits business.Consolidated operating income decreased 13% to $190 million and operating margin decreased 1.9 percentage points to 19.3%. Given some of the shifts between Q2 and Q3 that I've discussed, it's important to look at our Q3 year-to-date operating margin of 18.1%, which is up 1.1 percentage points versus Q3 year-to-date last year. Our appropriate stewardship of SG&A spend more than offset the reduction in our gross profit margin on a year-to-date basis. I'd like now to turn to our segment operating income results on Page 11 of the release to provide highlights of our Q3 operating income change. Wine segment operating income decreased $22 million to $218 million. The decrease is primarily due to the Q2 sales shifts, higher promotion cost in the U.S., divestiture of the Value Spirits business and the decrease in international business profit margins through the negative mix and higher grape cost for Australian wine. These items were partially offset by savings from our SG&A reduction initiatives. For the quarter, corporate and other expenses totaled $28 million versus $22 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by costs related to Project Fusion, a multi-year program design to strengthen our global business systems and processes, as well as our efforts to improve our U.K. and Australian businesses, including the possibility of combining portions of these businesses with the Australian Vintage Limited.On Page 14, you can see consolidated equity investment earnings totaled $60 million versus $76 million last year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $46 million versus $62 million. The remainder of equity earnings in Q3 fiscal 2010 and Q3 fiscal '09 are primarily generated by Opus One. For the third quarter, Crown generated net sales of $499 million, a decrease of 10%; and operating income of $91 million, a decrease of 26%. Economic challenges continue to drive soft performance in the convenience and on-premise channels and consumer movement to lower price beer. Q3 witnessed some unfavorable sales timing, which we expect to emerge in Q4 as depletion trend improved and outpaced shipments during the quarter.Crown continues to execute a targeted promotional marketing support and new package introductions to drive share improvement in the Grocery Channel Import category. Operating income for Crown was impacted by lower net sales, marketing expense timing related to national media for Corona Extra and Corona Light and a contractual cost increase. Interest expense for the quarter was $64 million, down 18% versus last year. The decrease was primarily driven by our significant debt reduction actions during the last 12 months. Let's take a look at our debt position. At the end of November, our debt totaled $4.1 billion, which represents a $336 million decrease from our debt level at the end of 2009.The decrease primarily reflects proceeds received from the sale of the Value Spirits business and positive free cash flow. Our average interest rate for the quarter was around 6.2%. Our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of November was 4.2x versus 4.3x at the end of fiscal 2009. Proceeds from the pending sale of our U.K. Cider business combined with targeted free cash flow generation in Q4 should reduce this ratio to the high three-time range by the end of fiscal 2010. We feel that our strong cash flow, reduced leverage, improved credit profile and much improved credit markets make this quarter an appropriate time to offer to extend our revolving credit facility. We will also like to initiate this process in the very near term. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 35%, which reflects the favorable outcome of various tax items. The rate for Q3 fiscal 2009 was 39%. As mentioned earlier, we now project our full-year comparable basis tax rate to approximate 35%, which is much improved versus the previous guidance of 38%. Now let's turn to cash flow on Page 10 of the news release. For purposes of this discussion, free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the nine months of fiscal 2010, we generated free cash flow of $100 million versus $235 million in the prior year. The lower cash generation was due primarily to higher taxes paid, including approximately $65 million related to the sale of the Value Spirits business. In addition, timing of sales in the quarter resulted at higher U.S. receivable balance. This higher receivable balance was more than offset by inventory reductions from lower fiscal 2010 grape harvest cost in Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. versus the prior year, and less interest pay. As a reminder, free cash flow for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 reflected a benefit of approximately $85 million in pretax proceeds related to the favorable settlement of certain foreign currency hedges. For fiscal 2010, we now expect CapEx to be in the range of $130 million to $150 million versus our previous $150 million to $170 million projection. The reduction in planned CapEx spending is contributing to free cash flow targeted at the upper end of our $230 million to $270 million guidance range. Moving to our P&L outlook for full-year fiscal 2010. We still expect comparable basis EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 with reduced full-year expected tax rate of approximately 35%. Our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition-related integration cost, restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on Page 17. During Q3, we recognized approximately $60 million of impairment and other charges related to Ruffino, an Italian wine company in which we had a 40% ownership interest. This includes a $25 million non-cash impairment for this equity-method investment as financial performance of this business continues to decline due in part to the strengthening of the euro versus the U.S. dollar.In addition, a $35 million charge was recorded as the 10% shareholder of Ruffino gave notice of its intent to exercise, a put option to Constellation at a contracted option price determined at the 2004 acquisition date. This put essentially represents the deferred purchase price from the 2004 investment that we expect to pay in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Before we take your questions, I would like to note we are working to leverage the benefit of our distributor-consolidation initiative and leverage our P&L to expense management business and increase operational efficiency. We plan to use free cash flow to further delever and reduce interest expense. All of this activity should drive improvement in our organic business model and ROIC. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

The media, I think, drove some pretty strong sales, particularly in grocery. We're seeing some stabilization on the On-premise side. I'd say the convenience sector still remains highly challenged. So on beer, I would say that wow, we're generally pleased and optimistic with the performance. We're nevertheless still believing that we'll be down from a depletion perspective, mid-single digits for the year. Because in general, that segment, the Import segment, although we're way outperforming the competitors, that segment still remains pretty challenged in the Beer business."

Or if you look at even the higher-end segments, you'll see some trading down. But fundamentally, there's trading up. Although within segments, there's trading down. And therefore, there can be some negative mix shift, which isn't the case. There is some negative mix shift in the business.

There's no -- I'm not even clear, I'm only thinking by calling it quits. No, we can't do that. As you know, the contract -- initial term runs through the end of 2016. And we have certainly no reason to believe or expect that anything different will occur other than the business will continue to be operated and generate the kind of results that it has historically. As a result, of course, historically, it's been a very strong performer with the downturn in the economy. The import business has been negatively impacted. I would say that the economy improved. There's upside in that business, in particular, being a bit more cyclical than some of our businesses. So there is no impact on the business, that is Crown and there is no impact really on the JV agreement or the term related to this loss here which is I said is over what would be an immaterial amount of dollars."

Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2010 sales and earnings results. Now before we get started, I'd like to thank those of you who attended our recent New York City investor meeting. I hope one of your key takeaways from that meeting is that Constellation is evolving as a fundamentally different company that is better positioned than ever to deliver value. We are focused on executing a strategy into the foreseeable future that delivers this value to organic growth, enhanced profitability, free cash flow and ROIC.The third quarter is evidence of the fact that we continue to make progress against our strategic goals of generating cash, paying down debt and reducing cost. During the quarter, we advanced our portfolio transformation with the announcement of our agreement to sell our UK Cider business to C&C Group for approximately $70 million U.S. The Gaymer Cider Company was originally acquired in 1998 with the Matthew Clark business. This transaction is consistent with our strategic focus on premium, higher-growth, higher-margin, wine, beer and spirits brands.The deal is on track to close by mid-January and we expect to use the proceeds to further reduce our borrowings. During the quarter, we also progressed with transition activities associated with our U.S. distributor consolidation effort, which now encompasses in 22 states, representing approximately 60% of our total U.S. wine and spirits volume. As you know, the initial distributor transition commenced September 1, with the second quarter benefiting from the implementation of this program. At that time, actions were taken to ensure maximum levels of customer service between distributors and the retail customers during the transition period.Now these actions had the planned effect of moving a portion of third quarter sales into the second quarter and resulted in some inventory build after distributors. During the third quarter, consumer takeaway was softer than expected at the beginning of the quarter, but is improving as our new selling model and promotional efforts take effect. As a result, at the end of the third quarter, distributor inventories were higher than historically targeted levels. However, as you can see from the latest IRI data through December, our U.S. wine trends have improved from where they were early in the third quarter as our promotional activities have returned to more normal levels.From an overall marketplace perspective, in the IRI channels, growth in the U.S. wine market remains healthy at about 4% on a dollar basis according to recent 12-week data with the greater than $8 price segment growing in the high single-digit range. The on-premise channel remains challenging, although we believe it is stabilizing and the mass merchandise club channel is outperforming the food and drug channels. Despite the fact that many of our planned promotional activities were not implemented until late in the quarter, many of our leading well-known brands continue to perform well in the marketplace throughout the third quarter, including Robert Mondavi Private Selection and brands like Rex Goliath and Kim Crawford. And we recently received some noteworthy portfolio awards. Two of our wines were selected to be served at President Barack Obama's prestigious Nobel Prize banquet in Oslo and included the 2003 Inniskillin Gold Oak Aged Vidal Icewine and the 2005 Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. In addition, wine.com recently released their top brand list for 2009 showcasing the top wines sold through their website. Five Constellation wines. Five made that list including Robert Mondavi, Kim Crawford, Simi, Hogue and Clos du Bois.Our third quarter spirits net sales results are not representative of strong underlying performance because SVEDKA Vodka shipments this quarter are being compared against last year's third quarter, which was impacted by some unique circumstances. The last shortages related to new bottling changes for SVEDKA in last year's second quarter drove strong shipments in last year's third quarter, creating the difficult comparison. Despite this issue, SVEDKA posted another strong quarter of double-digit depletion growth with our year-to-date net sales increasing more than 40%. We continue to build SVEDKA's on-premise brand awareness by leveraging new distributor roots to market. We are growing our national accounts in on- and off-premise channels and are expanding in other core markets outside the U.S. Now moving to the Canadian Wine business. The overall business continued to be impacted by economically-driven negative mix trend. However, positive sales results were recorded by Naked Grape during the quarter, which is one of the leading premium brands in our wine portfolio. As you know, Vincor is a sponsor of the upcoming Winter Olympic Games scheduled for mid-February in Vancouver. We expect to fully capitalize on the brand-building opportunities that we have planned in connection with this event.And now moving to our International businesses. The challenges impacting the operating environment in Australia and the U.K. have not subsided. However, as you know, we continue to execute the previously announced restructuring of our businesses in these geographies in order to align them with the realities of their respective markets. This includes continuing to focus on cost reductions, decreasing net working capital investment and consolidating our overall footprint in these markets in order to increase efficiencies. In the short term, we are optimistic about our marketplace performance, especially in the U.K. during the holiday selling season.In early November, we announced that we were working towards the potential combination of portions of our U.K. and Australian operations with the Australian Vintage Limited in an effort to improve this prospects of these businesses going forward. I have nothing to report at this time as we continue working to bring this transaction to a successful conclusion. Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. As you know, we recently received notice of legal action by Modelo pertaining to the funding of the JV partners of an immaterial amount of incremental promotional and marketing dollars for the upcoming calendar year 2010. Previously, Modelo provided this incremental spending and had agreed to do so, once again, for the 2010 business plan year. My point in addressing this issue is to remind everyone that the Crown joint venture is not a party to this legal action. Crown's 2010 business plan has already been agreed upon by Modelo and Constellation and the JV will go forward with a focus on growing the business through the entire term of this contract. We intend to continue working closely with Crown to support the joint venture as it continues to operate its business and deliver products in a manner designed to meet or exceed the expectations of consumers, distributors and retail customers. Now moving to Crown's operational results for the third quarter. During the quarter, sales and operating income for the Crown joint venture continued to be impacted by economically-driven challenges in the on-premise and convenience store channels. Operating income, in particular was unfavorably impacted, not only by the volume declines but by the timing of national media programming for Major League Baseball and the National Football League, which occurred in the third quarter. However, depletion trends outpaced shipments in the quarter due in part to the favorable impact of this media program and resulted in temporary wholesaler inventory reduction.Crown is also realizing stabilizing trends in import category share gains in the grocery channel, where it is performing in line with the U.S. beer industry and outperforming the Imported Beer category. We believe this is the result of targeted marketing efforts in programming against this key channel. Recent IRI data, coinciding with the end of our third quarter, confirms improved performance across the Crown portfolio. For fiscal 2010, we continue to estimate a decrease in Crown depletions in the mid-single-digit range, with profits expected to decline in the high-single-digit range.What gives us confidence that we can achieve these goals? Crown continues to execute well at retail with solid promotional activity, marketing program and the rollout of new products and packaging. Expanded distribution has helped to increase selection, retail impact and price point options for consumers. These efforts have resulted in over 60,000 new points of distribution since August 1. And we continue to expand the rollout of Modelo Especial and Negra Modelo draft in key markets throughout the U.S. Modelo Especial, the number three import in the U.S., continues to be one of the few major super premium brands, experiencing double-digit market growth. Now before I turn the call over to Bob, many of you have seen the press release we issued earlier this week mentioning that José Fernandez, who was our CEO for Constellation Wines North America, has passed away after a courageous battle with cancer. He was a great leader who will be missed by everyone across our organization. As you know, Jay Wright, President of our North American Wine Organization, who many of you met at our recent New York investor meeting, will continue to lead the business as we have cultivated strong management continuity in the face of José's passing.In closing, despite the impact from the U.S. distributor consolidation activities on this quarter's results, we feel confident regarding our ability to harvest the ultimate benefit from the execution of the strategic initiative, a profitable organic growth. As I've indicated, the transition may not be particularly smooth as you've seen from our performance in both second and third quarter. However, we believe it's absolutely the right strategy to pursue for the long-term growth and profitability of our business. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial discussion of our third quarter business results. Bob?"

The quarter witnessed quite a few unfavorable timing impacts across most product categories. U.S. wine was impacted by the shift of sales from Q3 to Q2. Spirits sales growth was impacted by a previous-year glass shortage for SVEDKA. And Crown's profits were impacted by unfavorable sales timing and marketing expense timing in the quarter. In addition to these quarterly timing-related items, North American wine depletions did not begin to improve until late in the quarter. Our international business continued to experience gross margin pressures and Crown's Beer business continued to be impacted by the economy. We believe the negative timing events will correct themselves this year, and we also believe we have strategies in place to improve the more fundamental challenges facing the business. We have continued taking steps to strengthen our organic business model, and we are seeing good progress in a number of areas. As we continue to reduce costs, which has helped offset the impact of consumer shift to lower-margin products in this challenging economic environment; focus on generating free cash flow, as we are targeting to be in the high end of our full year free cash flow guidance range; reduce debt and interest expense; and work with our consolidated distributor base in the U.S. to drive improvement in our organic sales and mix trends.We saw good promotions and displays for our brands during the holiday season and began to see some improving depletion and marketplace trends in U.S. wine and beer as the quarter progressed. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter was 35%. We also project a full year rate of approximately 35% versus our previous targeted full year rate of 38%. The Q3 rate drove about $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS favorability in the quarter when we look back in relation to the previous full year tax rate projection of 38%. Now let's look at our Q3 P&L performance in more detail, but my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Let's go to the net sales line. As you can see from our news release on Page 13, our consolidated reported net sales decreased 4%, primarily due to the divestiture of our Value Spirits business, partially offset by the positive impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations. On an organic constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and FOREX, net sales were even with the prior year.My commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Our worldwide branded wine organic net sales, which appear on Page 12 of the release, were even versus the last year. This included a 3% decrease from North America, offset by an increase of 12% in Europe and 2% in Australia and New Zealand. North American sales were impacted by continuing economic challenges, higher levels of promotional spending and the shift of sales to the second quarter from the third quarter, as part of the U.S. distributor transition activities.We estimate this shift represented approximately $40 million to $50 million in net sales and about $0.05 to $0.07 of EPS. For Europe, sales benefited from increased volumes for our value-priced product offerings in the U.K. and an easier comparison versus Q3 last year. Spirits organic net sales decreased 2% for the quarter. Rob has already discussed the difficult comparison item we faced in the quarter. Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis using information on Page 14 of the release. For Q3, our consolidated gross margin was 35.4% versus 40% in the prior-year quarter. This reflects lower sales driven by the shift of U.S. sales from Q3 to Q2, higher promotion costs in the U.S., higher Australian COGS due to the flow-through of the more-expensive calendar 2008 harvest and negative sales mix in the U.K. and Australia. On a year-to-date basis, gross margins are down 2.3 percentage points, much less than the Q3 figure, again reflecting the many unfavorable timing aspects of Q3. The higher promotion cost in the U.S. represented a proactive effort to shift more promotion dollars into the second half of the year as we transition to our new distributor partners. Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was 16.1% of net sales compared to 18.8% a year ago. The reduction was primarily driven by our global initiative, lower marketing expense and elimination of our spirit SG&A commensurate with the sale of the Value Spirits business.Consolidated operating income decreased 13% to $190 million and operating margin decreased 1.9 percentage points to 19.3%. Given some of the shifts between Q2 and Q3 that I've discussed, it's important to look at our Q3 year-to-date operating margin of 18.1%, which is up 1.1 percentage points versus Q3 year-to-date last year. Our appropriate stewardship of SG&A spend more than offset the reduction in our gross profit margin on a year-to-date basis. I'd like now to turn to our segment operating income results on Page 11 of the release to provide highlights of our Q3 operating income change. Wine segment operating income decreased $22 million to $218 million. The decrease is primarily due to the Q2 sales shifts, higher promotion cost in the U.S., divestiture of the Value Spirits business and the decrease in international business profit margins through the negative mix and higher grape cost for Australian wine. These items were partially offset by savings from our SG&A reduction initiatives. For the quarter, corporate and other expenses totaled $28 million versus $22 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by costs related to Project Fusion, a multi-year program design to strengthen our global business systems and processes, as well as our efforts to improve our U.K. and Australian businesses, including the possibility of combining portions of these businesses with the Australian Vintage Limited.On Page 14, you can see consolidated equity investment earnings totaled $60 million versus $76 million last year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $46 million versus $62 million. The remainder of equity earnings in Q3 fiscal 2010 and Q3 fiscal '09 are primarily generated by Opus One. For the third quarter, Crown generated net sales of $499 million, a decrease of 10%; and operating income of $91 million, a decrease of 26%. Economic challenges continue to drive soft performance in the convenience and on-premise channels and consumer movement to lower price beer. Q3 witnessed some unfavorable sales timing, which we expect to emerge in Q4 as depletion trend improved and outpaced shipments during the quarter.Crown continues to execute a targeted promotional marketing support and new package introductions to drive share improvement in the Grocery Channel Import category. Operating income for Crown was impacted by lower net sales, marketing expense timing related to national media for Corona Extra and Corona Light and a contractual cost increase. Interest expense for the quarter was $64 million, down 18% versus last year. The decrease was primarily driven by our significant debt reduction actions during the last 12 months. Let's take a look at our debt position. At the end of November, our debt totaled $4.1 billion, which represents a $336 million decrease from our debt level at the end of 2009.The decrease primarily reflects proceeds received from the sale of the Value Spirits business and positive free cash flow. Our average interest rate for the quarter was around 6.2%. Our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of November was 4.2x versus 4.3x at the end of fiscal 2009. Proceeds from the pending sale of our U.K. Cider business combined with targeted free cash flow generation in Q4 should reduce this ratio to the high three-time range by the end of fiscal 2010. We feel that our strong cash flow, reduced leverage, improved credit profile and much improved credit markets make this quarter an appropriate time to offer to extend our revolving credit facility. We will also like to initiate this process in the very near term. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 35%, which reflects the favorable outcome of various tax items. The rate for Q3 fiscal 2009 was 39%. As mentioned earlier, we now project our full-year comparable basis tax rate to approximate 35%, which is much improved versus the previous guidance of 38%. Now let's turn to cash flow on Page 10 of the news release. For purposes of this discussion, free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the nine months of fiscal 2010, we generated free cash flow of $100 million versus $235 million in the prior year. The lower cash generation was due primarily to higher taxes paid, including approximately $65 million related to the sale of the Value Spirits business. In addition, timing of sales in the quarter resulted at higher U.S. receivable balance. This higher receivable balance was more than offset by inventory reductions from lower fiscal 2010 grape harvest cost in Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. versus the prior year, and less interest pay. As a reminder, free cash flow for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 reflected a benefit of approximately $85 million in pretax proceeds related to the favorable settlement of certain foreign currency hedges. For fiscal 2010, we now expect CapEx to be in the range of $130 million to $150 million versus our previous $150 million to $170 million projection. The reduction in planned CapEx spending is contributing to free cash flow targeted at the upper end of our $230 million to $270 million guidance range. Moving to our P&L outlook for full-year fiscal 2010. We still expect comparable basis EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 with reduced full-year expected tax rate of approximately 35%. Our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition-related integration cost, restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on Page 17. During Q3, we recognized approximately $60 million of impairment and other charges related to Ruffino, an Italian wine company in which we had a 40% ownership interest. This includes a $25 million non-cash impairment for this equity-method investment as financial performance of this business continues to decline due in part to the strengthening of the euro versus the U.S. dollar.In addition, a $35 million charge was recorded as the 10% shareholder of Ruffino gave notice of its intent to exercise, a put option to Constellation at a contracted option price determined at the 2004 acquisition date. This put essentially represents the deferred purchase price from the 2004 investment that we expect to pay in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Before we take your questions, I would like to note we are working to leverage the benefit of our distributor-consolidation initiative and leverage our P&L to expense management business and increase operational efficiency. We plan to use free cash flow to further delever and reduce interest expense. All of this activity should drive improvement in our organic business model and ROIC. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

Now in our business, on the Wine side, yes, we're seeing some improved performance.

And we really started to see some of the positive impact on that in late third quarter. And we've seen some of the positive impact of that into December and the holiday season. So we're pretty optimistic that things are working pretty well at this stage on the Wine side. And then the Beer side, it's much as Bob said. We had some very good media. The media, I think, drove some pretty strong sales, particularly in grocery. We're seeing some stabilization on the On-premise side. I'd say the convenience sector still remains highly challenged. So on beer, I would say that wow, we're generally pleased and optimistic with the performance. We're nevertheless still believing that we'll be down from a depletion perspective, mid-single digits for the year.

We continued our portfolio transformation efforts with the proposed sale of our Cider business, the proceeds of which we expect to be used to further reduce our debt. We are experiencing improving depletion trends in our U.S. Wine, Spirits and Beer business. And lastly, we continue to progress with our distributor consolidation initiative.

Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2010 sales and earnings results. Now before we get started, I'd like to thank those of you who attended our recent New York City investor meeting. I hope one of your key takeaways from that meeting is that Constellation is evolving as a fundamentally different company that is better positioned than ever to deliver value. We are focused on executing a strategy into the foreseeable future that delivers this value to organic growth, enhanced profitability, free cash flow and ROIC.The third quarter is evidence of the fact that we continue to make progress against our strategic goals of generating cash, paying down debt and reducing cost. During the quarter, we advanced our portfolio transformation with the announcement of our agreement to sell our UK Cider business to C&C Group for approximately $70 million U.S. The Gaymer Cider Company was originally acquired in 1998 with the Matthew Clark business. This transaction is consistent with our strategic focus on premium, higher-growth, higher-margin, wine, beer and spirits brands.The deal is on track to close by mid-January and we expect to use the proceeds to further reduce our borrowings. During the quarter, we also progressed with transition activities associated with our U.S. distributor consolidation effort, which now encompasses in 22 states, representing approximately 60% of our total U.S. wine and spirits volume. As you know, the initial distributor transition commenced September 1, with the second quarter benefiting from the implementation of this program. At that time, actions were taken to ensure maximum levels of customer service between distributors and the retail customers during the transition period.Now these actions had the planned effect of moving a portion of third quarter sales into the second quarter and resulted in some inventory build after distributors. During the third quarter, consumer takeaway was softer than expected at the beginning of the quarter, but is improving as our new selling model and promotional efforts take effect. As a result, at the end of the third quarter, distributor inventories were higher than historically targeted levels. However, as you can see from the latest IRI data through December, our U.S. wine trends have improved from where they were early in the third quarter as our promotional activities have returned to more normal levels.From an overall marketplace perspective, in the IRI channels, growth in the U.S. wine market remains healthy at about 4% on a dollar basis according to recent 12-week data with the greater than $8 price segment growing in the high single-digit range. The on-premise channel remains challenging, although we believe it is stabilizing and the mass merchandise club channel is outperforming the food and drug channels. Despite the fact that many of our planned promotional activities were not implemented until late in the quarter, many of our leading well-known brands continue to perform well in the marketplace throughout the third quarter, including Robert Mondavi Private Selection and brands like Rex Goliath and Kim Crawford. And we recently received some noteworthy portfolio awards. Two of our wines were selected to be served at President Barack Obama's prestigious Nobel Prize banquet in Oslo and included the 2003 Inniskillin Gold Oak Aged Vidal Icewine and the 2005 Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. In addition, wine.com recently released their top brand list for 2009 showcasing the top wines sold through their website. Five Constellation wines. Five made that list including Robert Mondavi, Kim Crawford, Simi, Hogue and Clos du Bois.Our third quarter spirits net sales results are not representative of strong underlying performance because SVEDKA Vodka shipments this quarter are being compared against last year's third quarter, which was impacted by some unique circumstances. The last shortages related to new bottling changes for SVEDKA in last year's second quarter drove strong shipments in last year's third quarter, creating the difficult comparison. Despite this issue, SVEDKA posted another strong quarter of double-digit depletion growth with our year-to-date net sales increasing more than 40%. We continue to build SVEDKA's on-premise brand awareness by leveraging new distributor roots to market. We are growing our national accounts in on- and off-premise channels and are expanding in other core markets outside the U.S. Now moving to the Canadian Wine business. The overall business continued to be impacted by economically-driven negative mix trend. However, positive sales results were recorded by Naked Grape during the quarter, which is one of the leading premium brands in our wine portfolio. As you know, Vincor is a sponsor of the upcoming Winter Olympic Games scheduled for mid-February in Vancouver. We expect to fully capitalize on the brand-building opportunities that we have planned in connection with this event.And now moving to our International businesses. The challenges impacting the operating environment in Australia and the U.K. have not subsided. However, as you know, we continue to execute the previously announced restructuring of our businesses in these geographies in order to align them with the realities of their respective markets. This includes continuing to focus on cost reductions, decreasing net working capital investment and consolidating our overall footprint in these markets in order to increase efficiencies. In the short term, we are optimistic about our marketplace performance, especially in the U.K. during the holiday selling season.In early November, we announced that we were working towards the potential combination of portions of our U.K. and Australian operations with the Australian Vintage Limited in an effort to improve these prospects of these businesses going forward. I have nothing to report at this time as we continue working to bring this transaction to a successful conclusion. Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. As you know, we recently received notice of legal action by Modelo pertaining to the funding of the JV partners of an immaterial amount of incremental promotional and marketing dollars for the upcoming calendar year 2010. Previously, Modelo provided this incremental spending and had agreed to do so, once again, for the 2010 business plan year. My point in addressing this issue is to remind everyone that the Crown joint venture is not a party to this legal action. Crown's 2010 business plan has already been agreed upon by Modelo and Constellation and the JV will go forward with a focus on growing the business through the entire term of this contract. We intend to continue working closely with Crown to support the joint venture as it continues to operate its business and deliver products in a manner designed to meet or exceed the expectations of consumers, distributors and retail customers. Now moving to Crown's operational results for the third quarter. During the quarter, sales and operating income for the Crown joint venture continued to be impacted by economically-driven challenges in the on-premise and convenience store channels. Operating income, in particular was unfavorably impacted, not only by the volume declines but by the timing of national media programming for Major League Baseball and the National Football League, which occurred in the third quarter. However, depletion trends outpaced shipments in the quarter due in part to the favorable impact of this media program and resulted in temporary wholesaler inventory reduction.Crown is also realizing stabilizing trends in import category share gains in the grocery channel, where it is performing in line with the U.S. beer industry and outperforming the Imported Beer category. We believe this is the result of targeted marketing efforts in programming against this key channel. Recent IRI data, coinciding with the end of our third quarter, confirms improved performance across the Crown portfolio. For fiscal 2010, we continue to estimate a decrease in Crown depletions in the mid-single-digit range, with profits expected to decline in the high-single-digit range.What gives us confidence that we can achieve these goals? Crown continues to execute well at retail with solid promotional activity, marketing program and the rollout of new products and packaging. Expanded distribution has helped to increase selection, retail impact and price point options for consumers. These efforts have resulted in over 60,000 new points of distribution since August 1. And we continue to expand the rollout of Modelo Especial and Negra Modelo draft in key markets throughout the U.S. Modelo Especial, the number three import in the U.S., continues to be one of the few major super premium brands, experiencing double-digit market growth. Now before I turn the call over to Bob, many of you have seen the press release we issued earlier this week mentioning that José Fernandez, who was our CEO for Constellation Wines North America, has passed away after a courageous battle with cancer. He was a great leader who will be missed by everyone across our organization. As you know, Jay Wright, President of our North American Wine Organization, who many of you met at our recent New York investor meeting, will continue to lead the business as we have cultivated strong management continuity in the face of José's passing.In closing, despite the impact from the U.S. distributor consolidation activities on this quarter's results, we feel confident regarding our ability to harvest the ultimate benefit from the execution of the strategic initiative, a profitable organic growth. As I've indicated, the transition may not be particularly smooth as you've seen from our performance in both second and third quarter. However, we believe it's absolutely the right strategy to pursue for the long-term growth and profitability of our business. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial discussion of our third quarter business results. Bob?"

Our Q3 comparable EPS came in at $0.54 versus $0.60 in the previous year. The quarter witnessed quite a few unfavorable timing impacts across most product categories. U.S. wine was impacted by the shift of sales from Q",1840,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our Q3 comparable EPS came in at $0.54 versus $0.60 in the previous year. The quarter witnessed quite a few unfavorable timing impacts across most product categories. U.S. wine was impacted by the shift of sales from Q3 to Q2. Spirits sales growth was impacted by a previous-year glass shortage for SVEDKA. And Crown's profits were impacted by unfavorable sales timing and marketing expense timing in the quarter. In addition to these quarterly timing-related items, North American wine depletions did not begin to improve until late in the quarter. Our international business continued to experience gross margin pressures and Crown's Beer business continued to be impacted by the economy. We believe the negative timing events will correct themselves this year, and we also believe we have strategies in place to improve the more fundamental challenges facing the business. We have continued taking steps to strengthen our organic business model, and we are seeing good progress in a number of areas. As we continue to reduce costs, which has helped offset the impact of consumer shift to lower-margin products in this challenging economic environment; focus on generating free cash flow, as we are targeting to be in the high end of our full year free cash flow guidance range; reduce debt and interest expense; and work with our consolidated distributor base in the U.S. to drive improvement in our organic sales and mix trends.We saw good promotions and displays for our brands during the holiday season and began to see some improving depletion and marketplace trends in U.S. wine and beer as the quarter progressed. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter was 35%. We also project a full year rate of approximately 35% versus our previous targeted full year rate of 38%. The Q3 rate drove about $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS favorability in the quarter when we look back in relation to the previous full year tax rate projection of 38%. Now let's look at our Q3 P&L performance in more detail, but my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Let's go to the net sales line. As you can see from our news release on Page 13, our consolidated reported net sales decreased 4%, primarily due to the divestiture of our Value Spirits business, partially offset by the positive impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations. On an organic constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and FOREX, net sales were even with the prior year.My commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Our worldwide branded wine organic net sales, which appear on Page 12 of the release, were even versus the last year. This included a 3% decrease from North America, offset by an increase of 12% in Europe and 2% in Australia and New Zealand. North American sales were impacted by continuing economic challenges, higher levels of promotional spending and the shift of sales to the second quarter from the third quarter, as part of the U.S. distributor transition activities.We estimate this shift represented approximately $40 million to $50 million in net sales and about $0.05 to $0.07 of EPS. For Europe, sales benefited from increased volumes for our value-priced product offerings in the U.K. and an easier comparison versus Q3 last year. Spirits organic net sales decreased 2% for the quarter. Rob has already discussed the difficult comparison item we faced in the quarter. Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis using information on Page 14 of the release. For Q3, our consolidated gross margin was 35.4% versus 40% in the prior-year quarter. This reflects lower sales driven by the shift of U.S. sales from Q3 to Q2, higher promotion costs in the U.S., higher Australian COGS due to the flow-through of the more-expensive calendar 2008 harvest and negative sales mix in the U.K. and Australia. On a year-to-date basis, gross margins are down 2.3 percentage points, much less than the Q3 figure, again reflecting the many unfavorable timing aspects of Q3. The higher promotion cost in the U.S. represented a proactive effort to shift more promotion dollars into the second half of the year as we transition to our new distributor partners. Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was 16.1% of net sales compared to 18.8% a year ago. The reduction was primarily driven by our global initiative, lower marketing expense and elimination of our spirit SG&A commensurate with the sale of the Value Spirits business.Consolidated operating income decreased 13% to $190 million and operating margin decreased 1.9 percentage points to 19.3%. Given some of the shifts between Q2 and Q3 that I've discussed, it's important to look at our Q3 year-to-date operating margin of 18.1%, which is up 1.1 percentage points versus Q3 year-to-date last year. Our appropriate stewardship of SG&A spend more than offset the reduction in our gross profit margin on a year-to-date basis. I'd like now to turn to our segment operating income results on Page 11 of the release to provide highlights of our Q3 operating income change. Wine segment operating income decreased $22 million to $218 million. The decrease is primarily due to the Q2 sales shifts, higher promotion cost in the U.S., divestiture of the Value Spirits business and the decrease in international business profit margins through the negative mix and higher grape cost for Australian wine. These items were partially offset by savings from our SG&A reduction initiatives. For the quarter, corporate and other expenses totaled $28 million versus $22 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by costs related to Project Fusion, a multi-year program design to strengthen our global business systems and processes, as well as our efforts to improve our U.K. and Australian businesses, including the possibility of combining portions of these businesses with the Australian Vintage Limited.On Page 14, you can see consolidated equity investment earnings totaled $60 million versus $76 million last year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $46 million versus $62 million. The remainder of equity earnings in Q3 fiscal 2010 and Q3 fiscal '09 are primarily generated by Opus One. For the third quarter, Crown generated net sales of $499 million, a decrease of 10%; and operating income of $91 million, a decrease of 26%. Economic challenges continue to drive soft performance in the convenience and on-premise channels and consumer movement to lower price beer. Q3 witnessed some unfavorable sales timing, which we expect to emerge in Q4 as depletion trend improved and outpaced shipments during the quarter.Crown continues to execute a targeted promotional marketing support and new package introductions to drive share improvement in the Grocery Channel Import category. Operating income for Crown was impacted by lower net sales, marketing expense timing related to national media for Corona Extra and Corona Light and a contractual cost increase. Interest expense for the quarter was $64 million, down 18% versus last year. The decrease was primarily driven by our significant debt reduction actions during the last 12 months. Let's take a look at our debt position. At the end of November, our debt totaled $4.1 billion, which represents a $336 million decrease from our debt level at the end of 2009.The decrease primarily reflects proceeds received from the sale of the Value Spirits business and positive free cash flow. Our average interest rate for the quarter was around 6.2%. Our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of November was 4.2x versus 4.3x at the end of fiscal 2009. Proceeds from the pending sale of our U.K. Cider business combined with targeted free cash flow generation in Q4 should reduce this ratio to the high three-time range by the end of fiscal 2010. We feel that our strong cash flow, reduced leverage, improved credit profile and much improved credit markets make this quarter an appropriate time to offer to extend our revolving credit facility. We will also like to initiate this process in the very near term. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 35%, which reflects the favorable outcome of various tax items. The rate for Q3 fiscal 2009 was 39%. As mentioned earlier, we now project our full-year comparable basis tax rate to approximate 35%, which is much improved versus the previous guidance of 38%. Now let's turn to cash flow on Page 10 of the news release. For purposes of this discussion, free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the nine months of fiscal 2010, we generated free cash flow of $100 million versus $235 million in the prior year. The lower cash generation was due primarily to higher taxes paid, including approximately $65 million related to the sale of the Value Spirits business. In addition, timing of sales in the quarter resulted at higher U.S. receivable balance. This higher receivable balance was more than offset by inventory reductions from lower fiscal 2010 grape harvest cost in Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. versus the prior year, and less interest pay. As a reminder, free cash flow for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 reflected a benefit of approximately $85 million in pretax proceeds related to the favorable settlement of certain foreign currency hedges. For fiscal 2010, we now expect CapEx to be in the range of $130 million to $150 million versus our previous $150 million to $170 million projection. The reduction in planned CapEx spending is contributing to free cash flow targeted at the upper end of our $230 million to $270 million guidance range. Moving to our P&L outlook for full-year fiscal 2010. We still expect comparable basis EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 with reduced full-year expected tax rate of approximately 35%. Our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition-related integration cost, restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on Page 17. During Q3, we recognized approximately $60 million of impairment and other charges related to Ruffino, an Italian wine company in which we had a 40% ownership interest. This includes a $25 million non-cash impairment for this equity-method investment as financial performance of this business continues to decline due in part to the strengthening of the euro versus the U.S. dollar.In addition, a $35 million charge was recorded as the 10% shareholder of Ruffino gave notice of its intent to exercise, a put option to Constellation at a contracted option price determined at the 2004 acquisition date. This put essentially represents the deferred purchase price from the 2004 investment that we expect to pay in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Before we take your questions, I would like to note we are working to leverage the benefit of our distributor-consolidation initiative and leverage our P&L to expense management business and increase operational efficiency. We plan to use free cash flow to further de-lever and reduce interest expense. All of this activity should drive improvement in our organic business model and ROIC. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

So with -- on premise still being weak and the convenience stores still being weak, is it just kind of consumers buying in here at lower prices and your lower-priced brands doing better? Or you feel you're really seeing some difference here versus last quarter?"

First of all, that comment was relative to our business, not the industry in general. The industry in general, although it is performing well, I would say it's been fairly consistent, as opposed to there being an uptick. Now in our business,",244,"Yes, Lauren. First of all, that comment was relative to our business, not the industry in general. The industry in general, although it is performing well, I would say it's been fairly consistent, as opposed to there being an uptick. Now in our business, on the Wine side, yes, we're seeing some improved performance. I think that that's generally as a result of the fact that a lot of our efforts, for instance our distributor consolidation, the increase in our promotional activities in the third quarter, these things are now kicking in. And we really started to see some of the positive impact on that in late third quarter. And we've seen some of the positive impact of that into December and the holiday season. So we're pretty optimistic that things are working pretty well at this stage on the Wine side. And then the Beer side, it's much as Bob said. We had some very good media. The media, I think, drove some pretty strong sales, particularly in grocery. We're seeing some stabilization on the On-premise side. I'd say the convenience sector still remains highly challenged. So on beer, I would say that wow, we're generally pleased and optimistic with the performance. We're nevertheless still believing that we'll be down from a depletion perspective, mid-single digits for the year. Because in general, that segment, the Import segment, although we're way outperforming the competitors, that segment still remains pretty challenged in the Beer business."

Or if you look at even the higher-end segments, you'll see some trading down. But fundamentally, there's trading up. Although within segments, there's trading down. And therefore, there can be some negative mix shift, which isn't the case. There is some negative mix shift in the business.

No, we won't, we can't do that. As you know, the contract initial term runs through the end of 2016. And we have certainly no reason to believe or expect that anything different will occur other than the business will continue to be operated and generate the kind of results that it has historically. As to results, of course, historically, it's been a very strong performer with the downturn in the economy. The Import business has been negatively impacted. I would say that the economy improved. There's upside in that business, in particular, being a bit more cyclical than some of our businesses. So there is no impact on the business that is Crown, and there is no impact really on the JV agreement or the term related to this loss here which, as I said, is over what would be an immaterial amount of dollars."

Now before we get started, I'd like to thank t",1595,"Thanks, Patty. Good morning, everybody, and happy new year. I hope that everybody had a great holiday season. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2010 sales and earnings results. Now before we get started, I'd like to thank those of you who attended our recent New York City investor meeting. I hope one of your key takeaways from that meeting is that Constellation is evolving as a fundamentally different company that is better positioned than ever to deliver value. We are focused on executing a strategy into the foreseeable future that delivers this value to organic growth, enhanced profitability, free cash flow and ROIC.The third quarter is evidence of the fact that we continue to make progress against our strategic goals of generating cash, paying down debt and reducing cost. During the quarter, we advanced our portfolio transformation with the announcement of our agreement to sell our UK Cider business to C&C Group for approximately $70 million U.S. The Gaymer Cider Company was originally acquired in 1998 with the Matthew Clark business. This transaction is consistent with our strategic focus on premium, higher-growth, higher-margin, wine, beer and spirits brands.The deal is on track to close by mid-January and we expect to use the proceeds to further reduce our borrowings. During the quarter, we also progressed with transition activities associated with our U.S. distributor consolidation effort, which now encompasses in 22 states, representing approximately 60% of our total U.S. wine and spirits volume. As you know, the initial distributor transition commenced September 1, with the second quarter benefiting from the implementation of this program. At that time, actions were taken to ensure maximum levels of customer service between distributors and the retail customers during the transition period.Now these actions had the planned effect of moving a portion of third quarter sales into the second quarter and resulted in some inventory build after distributors. During the third quarter, consumer takeaway was softer than expected at the beginning of the quarter, but is improving as our new selling model and promotional efforts take effect. As a result, at the end of the third quarter, distributor inventories were higher than historically targeted levels. However, as you can see from the latest IRI data through December, our U.S. wine trends have improved from where they were early in the third quarter as our promotional activities have returned to more normal levels.From an overall marketplace perspective, in the IRI channels, growth in the U.S. wine market remains healthy at about 4% on a dollar basis according to recent 12-week data with the greater than $8 price segment growing in the high single-digit range. The on-premise channel remains challenging, although we believe it is stabilizing and the mass merchandise club channel is outperforming the food and drug channels. Despite the fact that many of our planned promotional activities were not implemented until late in the quarter, many of our leading well-known brands continue to perform well in the marketplace throughout the third quarter, including Robert Mondavi Private Selection and brands like Rex Goliath and Kim Crawford. And we recently received some noteworthy portfolio awards. Two of our wines were selected to be served at President Barack Obama's prestigious Nobel Prize banquet in Oslo and included the 2003 Inniskillin Gold Oak Aged Vidal Icewine and the 2005 Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. In addition, wine.com recently released their top brand list for 2009 showcasing the top wines sold through their website. Five Constellation wines. Five made that list including Robert Mondavi, Kim Crawford, Simi, Hogue and Clos du Bois.Our third quarter spirits net sales results are not representative of strong underlying performance because SVEDKA Vodka shipments this quarter are being compared against last year's third quarter, which was impacted by some unique circumstances. The last shortages related to new bottling changes for SVEDKA in last year's second quarter drove strong shipments in last year's third quarter, creating the difficult comparison. Despite this issue, SVEDKA posted another strong quarter of double-digit depletion growth with our year-to-date net sales increasing more than 40%. We continue to build SVEDKA's on-premise brand awareness by leveraging new distributor roots to market. We are growing our national accounts in on- and off-premise channels and are expanding in other core markets outside the U.S. Now moving to the Canadian Wine business. The overall business continued to be impacted by economically-driven negative mix trend. However, positive sales results were recorded by Naked Grape during the quarter, which is one of the leading premium brands in our wine portfolio. As you know, Vincor is a sponsor of the upcoming Winter Olympic Games scheduled for mid-February in Vancouver. We expect to fully capitalize on the brand-building opportunities that we have planned in connection with this event.And now moving to our International businesses. The challenges impacting the operating environment in Australia and the U.K. have not subsided. However, as you know, we continue to execute the previously announced restructuring of our businesses in these geographies in order to align them with the realities of their respective markets. This includes continuing to focus on cost reductions, decreasing net working capital investment and consolidating our overall footprint in these markets in order to increase efficiencies. In the short term, we are optimistic about our marketplace performance, especially in the U.K. during the holiday selling season.In early November, we announced that we were working towards the potential combination of portions of our U.K. and Australian operations with the Australian Vintage Limited in an effort to improve these prospects of these businesses going forward. I have nothing to report at this time as we continue working to bring this transaction to a successful conclusion. Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. As you know, we recently received notice of legal action by Modelo pertaining to the funding of the JV partners of an immaterial amount of incremental promotional and marketing dollars for the upcoming calendar year 2010. Previously, Modelo provided this incremental spending and had agreed to do so, once again, for the 2010 business plan year. My point in addressing this issue is to remind everyone that the Crown joint venture is not a party to this legal action. Crown's 2010 business plan has already been agreed upon by Modelo and Constellation and the JV will go forward with a focus on growing the business through the entire term of this contract. We intend to continue working closely with Crown to support the joint venture as it continues to operate its business and deliver products in a manner designed to meet or exceed the expectations of consumers, distributors and retail customers. Now moving to Crown's operational results for the third quarter. During the quarter, sales and operating income for the Crown joint venture continued to be impacted by economically-driven challenges in the on-premise and convenience store channels. Operating income, in particular was unfavorably impacted, not only by the volume declines but by the timing of national media programming for Major League Baseball and the National Football League, which occurred in the third quarter. However, depletion trends outpaced shipments in the quarter due in part to the favorable impact of this media program and resulted in temporary wholesaler inventory reduction.Crown is also realizing stabilizing trends in import category share gains in the grocery channel, where it is performing in line with the U.S. beer industry and outperforming the Imported Beer category. We believe this is the result of targeted marketing efforts in programming against this key channel. Recent IRI data, coinciding with the end of our third quarter, confirms improved performance across the Crown portfolio. For fiscal 2010, we continue to estimate a decrease in Crown depletions in the mid-single-digit range, with profits expected to decline in the high-single-digit range.What gives us confidence that we can achieve these goals? Crown continues to execute well at retail with solid promotional activity, marketing program and the rollout of new products and packaging. Expanded distribution has helped to increase selection, retail impact and price point options for consumers. These efforts have resulted in over 60,000 new points of distribution since August 1. And we continue to expand the rollout of Modelo Especial and Negra Modelo draft in key markets throughout the U.S. Modelo Especial, the number three import in the U.S., continues to be one of the few major super premium brands, experiencing double-digit market growth. Now before I turn the call over to Bob, many of you have seen the press release we issued earlier this week mentioning that José Fernandez, who was our CEO for Constellation Wines North America, has passed away after a courageous battle with cancer. He was a great leader who will be missed by everyone across our organization. As you know, Jay Wright, President of our North American Wine Organization, who many of you met at our recent New York investor meeting, will continue to lead the business as we have cultivated strong management continuity in the face of José's passing.In closing, despite the impact from the U.S. distributor consolidation activities on this quarter's results, we feel confident regarding our ability to harvest the ultimate benefit from the execution of the strategic initiative, a profitable organic growth. As I've indicated, the transition may not be particularly smooth as you've seen from our performance in both second and third quarter. However, we believe it's absolutely the right strategy to pursue for the long-term growth and profitability of our business. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial discussion of our third quarter business results. Bob?"

Our Q3 comparable EPS came in at $0.54 versus $0.60 in the previous year. The quarter witnessed quite a few unfavorable timing impacts across most product categories. U.S. wine was impacted by the shift of sales from Q",1840,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our Q3 comparable EPS came in at $0.54 versus $0.60 in the previous year. The quarter witnessed quite a few unfavorable timing impacts across most product categories. U.S. wine was impacted by the shift of sales from Q3 to Q2. Spirits sales growth was impacted by a previous-year glass shortage for SVEDKA. And Crown's profits were impacted by unfavorable sales timing and marketing expense timing in the quarter. In addition to these quarterly timing-related items, North American wine depletions did not begin to improve until late in the quarter. Our international business continued to experience gross margin pressures and Crown's Beer business continued to be impacted by the economy. We believe the negative timing events will correct themselves this year, and we also believe we have strategies in place to improve the more fundamental challenges facing the business. We have continued taking steps to strengthen our organic business model, and we are seeing good progress in a number of areas. As we continue to reduce costs, which has helped offset the impact of consumer shift to lower-margin products in this challenging economic environment; focus on generating free cash flow, as we are targeting to be in the high end of our full year free cash flow guidance range; reduce debt and interest expense; and work with our consolidated distributor base in the U.S. to drive improvement in our organic sales and mix trends.We saw good promotions and displays for our brands during the holiday season and began to see some improving depletion and marketplace trends in U.S. wine and beer as the quarter progressed. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter was 35%. We also project a full year rate of approximately 35% versus our previous targeted full year rate of 38%. The Q3 rate drove about $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS favorability in the quarter when we look back in relation to the previous full year tax rate projection of 38%. Now let's look at our Q3 P&L performance in more detail, but my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Let's go to the net sales line. As you can see from our news release on Page 13, our consolidated reported net sales decreased 4%, primarily due to the divestiture of our Value Spirits business, partially offset by the positive impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations. On an organic constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and FOREX, net sales were even with the prior year.My commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Our worldwide branded wine organic net sales, which appear on Page 12 of the release, were even versus the last year. This included a 3% decrease from North America, offset by an increase of 12% in Europe and 2% in Australia and New Zealand. North American sales were impacted by continuing economic challenges, higher levels of promotional spending and the shift of sales to the second quarter from the third quarter, as part of the U.S. distributor transition activities.We estimate this shift represented approximately $40 million to $50 million in net sales and about $0.05 to $0.07 of EPS. For Europe, sales benefited from increased volumes for our value-priced product offerings in the U.K. and an easier comparison versus Q3 last year. Spirits organic net sales decreased 2% for the quarter. Rob has already discussed the difficult comparison item we faced in the quarter. Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis using information on Page 14 of the release. For Q3, our consolidated gross margin was 35.4% versus 40% in the prior-year quarter. This reflects lower sales driven by the shift of U.S. sales from Q3 to Q2, higher promotion costs in the U.S., higher Australian COGS due to the flow-through of the more-expensive calendar 2008 harvest and negative sales mix in the U.K. and Australia. On a year-to-date basis, gross margins are down 2.3 percentage points, much less than the Q3 figure, again reflecting the many unfavorable timing aspects of Q3. The higher promotion cost in the U.S. represented a proactive effort to shift more promotion dollars into the second half of the year as we transition to our new distributor partners. Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was 16.1% of net sales compared to 18.8% a year ago. The reduction was primarily driven by our global initiative, lower marketing expense and elimination of our spirit SG&A commensurate with the sale of the Value Spirits business.Consolidated operating income decreased 13% to $190 million and operating margin decreased 1.9 percentage points to 19.3%. Given some of the shifts between Q2 and Q3 that I've discussed, it's important to look at our Q3 year-to-date operating margin of 18.1%, which is up 1.1 percentage points versus Q3 year-to-date last year. Our appropriate stewardship of SG&A spend more than offset the reduction in our gross profit margin on a year-to-date basis. I'd like now to turn to our segment operating income results on Page 11 of the release to provide highlights of our Q3 operating income change. Wine segment operating income decreased $22 million to $218 million. The decrease is primarily due to the Q2 sales shifts, higher promotion cost in the U.S., divestiture of the Value Spirits business and the decrease in international business profit margins through the negative mix and higher grape cost for Australian wine. These items were partially offset by savings from our SG&A reduction initiatives. For the quarter, corporate and other expenses totaled $28 million versus $22 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by costs related to Project Fusion, a multi-year program design to strengthen our global business systems and processes, as well as our efforts to improve our U.K. and Australian businesses, including the possibility of combining portions of these businesses with the Australian Vintage Limited.On Page 14, you can see consolidated equity investment earnings totaled $60 million versus $76 million last year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $46 million versus $62 million. The remainder of equity earnings in Q3 fiscal 2010 and Q3 fiscal '09 are primarily generated by Opus One. For the third quarter, Crown generated net sales of $499 million, a decrease of 10%; and operating income of $91 million, a decrease of 26%. Economic challenges continue to drive soft performance in the convenience and on-premise channels and consumer movement to lower price beer. Q3 witnessed some unfavorable sales timing, which we expect to emerge in Q4 as depletion trend improved and outpaced shipments during the quarter.Crown continues to execute a targeted promotional marketing support and new package introductions to drive share improvement in the Grocery Channel Import category. Operating income for Crown was impacted by lower net sales, marketing expense timing related to national media for Corona Extra and Corona Light and a contractual cost increase. Interest expense for the quarter was $64 million, down 18% versus last year. The decrease was primarily driven by our significant debt reduction actions during the last 12 months. Let's take a look at our debt position. At the end of November, our debt totaled $4.1 billion, which represents a $336 million decrease from our debt level at the end of 2009.The decrease primarily reflects proceeds received from the sale of the Value Spirits business and positive free cash flow. Our average interest rate for the quarter was around 6.2%. Our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of November was 4.2x versus 4.3x at the end of fiscal 2009. Proceeds from the pending sale of our U.K. Cider business combined with targeted free cash flow generation in Q4 should reduce this ratio to the high three-time range by the end of fiscal 2010. We feel that our strong cash flow, reduced leverage, improved credit profile and much improved credit markets make this quarter an appropriate time to offer to extend our revolving credit facility. We will also like to initiate this process in the very near term. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 35%, which reflects the favorable outcome of various tax items. The rate for Q3 fiscal 2009 was 39%. As mentioned earlier, we now project our full-year comparable basis tax rate to approximate 35%, which is much improved versus the previous guidance of 38%. Now let's turn to cash flow on Page 10 of the news release. For purposes of this discussion, free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the nine months of fiscal 2010, we generated free cash flow of $100 million versus $235 million in the prior year. The lower cash generation was due primarily to higher taxes paid, including approximately $65 million related to the sale of the Value Spirits business. In addition, timing of sales in the quarter resulted at higher U.S. receivable balance. This higher receivable balance was more than offset by inventory reductions from lower fiscal 2010 grape harvest cost in Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. versus the prior year, and less interest pay. As a reminder, free cash flow for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 reflected a benefit of approximately $85 million in pretax proceeds related to the favorable settlement of certain foreign currency hedges. For fiscal 2010, we now expect CapEx to be in the range of $130 million to $150 million versus our previous $150 million to $170 million projection. The reduction in planned CapEx spending is contributing to free cash flow targeted at the upper end of our $230 million to $270 million guidance range. Moving to our P&L outlook for full-year fiscal 2010. We still expect comparable basis EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 with reduced full-year expected tax rate of approximately 35%. Our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition-related integration cost, restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on Page 17. During Q3, we recognized approximately $60 million of impairment and other charges related to Ruffino, an Italian wine company in which we had a 40% ownership interest. This includes a $25 million non-cash impairment for this equity-method investment as financial performance of this business continues to decline due in part to the strengthening of the euro versus the U.S. dollar.In addition, a $35 million charge was recorded as the 10% shareholder of Ruffino gave notice of its intent to exercise, a put option to Constellation at a contracted option price determined at the 2004 acquisition date. This put essentially represents the deferred purchase price from the 2004 investment that we expect to pay in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Before we take your questions, I would like to note we are working to leverage the benefit of our distributor-consolidation initiative and leverage our P&L to expense management business and increase operational efficiency. We plan to use free cash flow to further de-lever and reduce interest expense. All of this activity should drive improvement in our organic business model and ROIC. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

And we really started to see some of the positive impact on that in late third quarter. And we've seen some of the positive impact of that into December and the holiday season. So we're pretty optimistic that things are working pretty well at this stage on the Wine side. And then the Beer side, it's much as Bob said. We had some very good media. The media, I think, drove some pretty strong sales, particularly in grocery. We're seeing some stabilization on the On-premise side. I'd say the convenience sector still remains highly challenged. So on beer, I would say that wow, we're generally pleased and optimistic with the performance. We're nevertheless still believing that we'll be down from a depletion perspective, mid-single digits for the year.

We have several items to review this morning, including our fiscal 2010 results and our guidance for fiscal 2011. In February, we reached the conclusion of a very dynamic year, one in which we executed against our strategic goals despite lingering economic challenges around the world that affected our key markets.  We accomplished a great deal through fiscal 2010, continuing the disciplined work of transforming our portfolio, our operations and our financial model. We continued our portfolio transformation efforts as we began the fiscal year with the sale of our Value Spirits business, which resulted in cash proceeds of $276 million, and then we successfully integrated the remaining Spirits business into our North American Wine business.And we ended the fiscal year with the sale of our U.K. Cider business, the Gaymer Cider Company to C&C Group for approximately $70 million. These transactions, combined with strong free cash flow generation, helped drive a $600 million decrease in our debt levels. We continued our effort to improve our prospects for our U.K. and Australian businesses by tightening the portfolio focus, increasing efficiencies, reducing costs and improving cash flow generation. We significantly improved our cost structure, not only through our global cost reduction initiative but through supply chain initiatives and tightened controls on SG&A spending. We improved productivity and created efficiencies to global SKU rationalization efforts and consolidation of our global footprint.We progressed in our efforts to create an integrated technology platform, which has been designed to improve the accessibility and visibility of global data. This initiative is already creating value by reducing costs and improving efficiencies and is designed to ultimately enhance performance in key areas, such as supply chain, global procurement, customer service and information management and analysis. We implemented our new go-to-market sales and marketing structure in the U.S., which was successfully integrated into a single organization.  This resulted in synergy benefits and improved efficiency and effectiveness with our trade partners. From a strategic perspective, we have undertaken one of our most important initiatives with the launch of our U.S. consolidation effort. Presently, this program gives five distributors the rights to sell Constellation's portfolio of Wine and Spirits exclusively in the respective markets in 22 states, and currently represents approximately 60% of our total U.S. Wine and Spirits volume. Since the initial transition in September 2009, these distributors have allocated more than 1,000 dedicated distributor salespeople to focus exclusively on selling Constellation's product portfolio. As you know, the initial distributor transition commenced September 1, 2009, with the second quarter of fiscal 2010 benefiting from the implementation of this program. At that time, actions were taken to ensure maximum service levels between distributors and the retail customers during the transition period. These actions had the planned effect of moving a portion of third quarter sales into the second quarter and resulted into some inventory build at distributors. During the third quarter, consumer takeaway was softer than expected at the beginning of the quarter, but improved as our new selling model and promotional efforts began to take effect. However, at the end of the third quarter, distributor inventories were higher than targeted levels.In the fourth quarter, we made a proactive, tactical decision to work with our distributors in decreasing their higher-than-average inventories to more moderate levels. Now how did we accomplish that? We did not require distributors to purchase product at contracted levels, in return they agreed to invest in additional marketing and promotional programs behind our brands in the marketplace. As expected, these actions unfavorably impacted our U.S. Wine business during the fourth quarter by approximately $60 million to $70 million in net sales and about $0.07 to $0.09 in diluted EPS and created negative leverage on the remainder of the P&L. However, we believe it was an appropriate tradeoff in order to better position to distributors for success in the future as they work with us to drive profitable organic growth.Going forward, we are refocusing our energies from managing transition activities to improving depletions and consumer takeaway. Our ultimate goal is to grow our U.S. Wine business in line with the total industry growth trends, and we expect to achieve this goal in 2011. This translates to an estimated volume growth rate of approximately 1% for the U.S. Wine industry, inclusive of all channels, both on- and off-premise. As we've discussed, the on-premise channel is tempering the overall growth rate for the Wine category, while the Grocery, Mass Merchant and Club channels are growing at faster rates. For instance, current growth in the SymphonyIRI channel remains healthy at about 5% on a dollar basis according to recent 12-week IRI data that corresponds to the end of our fiscal year.In particular, the Premium segment where wine sells for greater than $5 a bottle at retail continues to grow in IRI channels at a rate of mid to high single digits. And within these price segments, many of our leading well-known brands continue to perform well in the marketplace, including for instance Rex Goliath, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Clos du Bois, Estancia, Toasted Head, Simi, Franciscan and Kim Crawford. Remember about 40% of our U.S. Wine volume is currently sold in several states that are not included in the transition process. It is in these states that our depletion trends are generally better than those undergoing transition.From a marketing perspective, we are currently in the process of launching several new products or line extensions as part of our strategy to fill portfolio gaps and drive profitable organic growth. For instance, as we focus on gaining share in the rapidly growing Argentinean Malbec segment, we are preparing to roll out the new Black Box Malbec varietal. We will also be re-launching our Diseno brand with a new package and marketing positioning. We will soon begin shipping our new Bluestone [ph] Riesling wine. This actually will establish a presence for us in the rapidly growing German Riesling segment. Constellation will begin its participation in the emerging organic wine niche, with the Mendocino Vineyards brand, which is made using organic grapes. And we're in the process of a national rollout of a sparkling wine under the Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi umbrella.I just returned from the Wine Spirits Wholesaler Conference were Constellation was awarded nine Impact 2009 Hot Brand Awards for several of our well-known brands, including SVEDKA, Black Box, Kim Crawford, Rex Goliath, Corona Light and Modelo Especial, just to name a few. Our Canadian Wine business posted positive net sales results for the year, primarily driven by the Premium Wine portfolio, including Jackson-Triggs, Naked Grape and the Quebec Import business. As you know, Vincor Canada was the official wine supplier for the 2010 Winter Olympic Games. This sponsorship provided unprecedented exposure for our Canadian  brands and showcased the Canadian Wine industry to the world. Although the full business impacted this sponsorship is yet to be realized, I'm pleased to report at this time that an incremental 20,000 cases of our Canadian brands were sold at Olympic venues and surrounding areas during the games. In addition, our participating Canadian brands were showcased through Canadian and international media, including the TODAY Show, A Taste of Canada with Kathy Lee Gifford and Wine Spectator. In the Spirits segment, SVEDKA Vodka had another great year and generated phenomenal sales growth of almost 40% versus last year, which translates to more than three million cases sold in fiscal 2010. SVEDKA is the fastest growing major U.S. Spirits brand and now has become the fourth largest vodka brand in the entire United States. And we just launched SVEDKA’s first national TV advertising campaign which began airing March 1. Black Velvet is the second largest Canadian second whiskey brand in the U.S. and grew more than two million cases in fiscal year 2010. It also posted solid results for the year, with sales increasing in the low to mid single-digit range.Now from an international perspective, earlier this week we announced that we have ended our discussion with Australia Vintage Limited pertaining to a potential combination of our businesses. Despite our mutual best efforts, we were unable to accomplish our goals and we have decided to focus individually on our respective businesses. As a result, we will continue to restructure our businesses in Australia and the U.K. in order to align them with the realities of the respective markets. We will be more aggressive in taking out costs, minimizing our net working capital investment, increasing efficiencies and selling assets. Our primary goal is to generate cash and improve gross profit.Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. During the company's fiscal year 2010, the Crown joint venture generated $2.3 billion in net sales and $444 million of operating income. Crown continues to have the leading market share in the import category in the U.S., with five of the Modelo brands represented in the top 20 import brands. Corona remains the number one import beer, and Modelo Especial is currently the third largest import brand in the United States today. Speaking of Modelo Especial, it is one of the few major super premium brand in calendar 2009 that experienced double-digit market growth. This is a major accomplishment, considering that 2009 was particularly a challenging year for the U.S. Beer industry in general, with growth trends softening as the year progressed. Many major domestic brands lost volume and share to craft beers and sub-premiums. As we've previously indicated, volumes for Crown's businesses have been impacted by the economy, particularly in the convenience and on-premise channels. However, the Crown portfolio outperformed the import category and grew share throughout the year. These results were driven in part in the grocery channel as Crown introduced new packagings, executed targeted promotions in support of the business with enhanced strategic media activity.For fiscal 2011, Crown is focused on further enhancing the integration of sales and marketing efforts by optimizing promotional activity and media support during peak seasonal periods when consumers buy the most. Some of these activities will be visible in the marketplace including the following: A summer consumer sweepstakes program that will begin immediately following the Cinco de Mayo holiday and run through the 4th of July. This program will be supported with television advertising. Crown will partner with Sports Illustrated during soccer's upcoming World Cup event, which will begin in June in South Africa. World Cup magazine issues will be promoting Modelo Especial, specifically for the convenience and on-premise channels. Corona will also be one of the three major beer sponsors of World Cup TV.Crown has expanded by the rollout of Modelo Especial with Negro Modelo draft to nearly 50% of the U.S. with positive results, and will continue expanding distribution throughout the remainder of the year. Crown is also seeing success with new SKUs recently introduced into the convenience channel, including Corona and Corona Light 24-ounce cans. And going into Cinco de Mayo holiday and the key summer season, we believe Crown is well positioned to maximize execution at retail.Before I turn the call over to Bob, I want to discuss our guidance for fiscal 2011. As you can see, our comparable EPS estimate for fiscal 2011 is projected to be in the range of $1.53 to $1.68 and reflects our belief that challenges from persistent and uncertain economic conditions will continue to impact the results, especially with regard to the Crown Imports business. However, we expect to begin to realize the benefits of our U.S. distribution, distributor consolidation efforts as the year progresses. Meanwhile, our strong free cash flow enables us to create value in the form of an accelerated share buyback while continuing our debt reduction efforts. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial discussion of our business results."

We sold the Value",2303,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2010 was a year of dramatic change, operationally, culturally and financially. From an operational perspective, we took positive steps during the year to strengthen our organic business model. We sold the Value Spirits business and moved our two scale Spirits brands into our U.S. Wine business and eliminated our Spirits SG&A. We then consolidated the majority of our U.S. distributor network while also reducing the infrastructure of our U.S. Wine business from three selling units down to one. This also resulted in reduced SG&A.We now have a single scale U.S. business, focused on a streamlined Premium Wine and Spirits portfolio going to a consolidated, focused and aligned distributor network. Culturally, we are focused on profitable organic growth of our premium scale brands, primarily Wine. This means increased focused on brand building and sales execution, especially in North America. This also represents our next logical business phase, as we move beyond a previously decentralized organization, which had been very focused on acquisitions, toward a more centralized organization, more focused on profitable organic sales growth.In our U.K. Australia business, we have a renewed focus on profits, driving synergies and generating cash flow. Financially, we reduced costs to help offset the negative impact of the current economy and generated strong free cash flow to help drive another year of debt reduction and reduced interest expense. Our full year fiscal 2010 comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $1.69 versus $1.60 in the previous year. Our results included the impact of challenging economic conditions, especially on Crown's performance; U.S. Wine sales force restructuring; U.S. distributor consolidation; and continuing difficult operating environment for our U.K. Australia business. On the more positive side, we reduced costs, which helped offset some unfavorable mix impact driven by the challenging economy. We extended our revolving credit facility and a portion of our term debt. We generated strong free cash flow, as we exceeded the upper end of our guidance range. We significantly reduced debt and interest expense, and we realized tax benefits for the year.Now let's look at our fiscal 2010 P&L performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Let's go to our net sales line. As you can see from our news release on Page 15, our consolidated net sales decreased 8% for the year, primarily due to the divestiture of our Value Spirits business and the unfavorable impact of our year-over-year currency rate fluctuations. On an organic constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and forex rate changes, net sales increased 1%. My commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant-currency basis. Our worldwide branded wine organic net sales, which appear on Page 14 of the release, decreased 1%. This included a 3% decrease for North America, partially offset by increases of  7% in Europe and 4% in Australia-New Zealand. North American sales were impacted by continuing economic challenges and U.S. distributor and sales force transitions. In connection with our recently implemented distributor contracts, sales to newly contracted distributors for an initial period are based on a pre-determined plan. Our sales force and distributor transitions resulted in a fall-off of depletions and consumer takeaway during fiscal 2010. As a result, distributors have generally been taking in more inventory than may have been depleting.While we were proactive during the fourth quarter in working with distributors to help reduce our inventory levels as outlined by Rob, the distributors ended fiscal 2010 with higher inventory levels than they ended fiscal 2009. For Europe, sales benefited from the growth of our value-priced product offerings in the U.K. Sales for Australia-New Zealand increased due to New Zealand product growth in the region. Spirits organic net sales increased by an impressive 19% for the year.Now let's look at our profit on a comparable basis using the information on Page 17 of the release. For the year, our consolidated gross margin was 35% versus 37.1% for the prior year. This reflects the higher Australian COGS due to the flow-through of the more expensive calendar 2008 harvest, and growth of the lower margin U.K. Australia businesses. Although they remained profitable, our U.K. Australia businesses experienced another year of reduced profits. Our consolidated SG&A for the year decreased $136 million and came in at 18.3% of net sales compared to 20.6% a year ago. The margin reduction was primarily driven by our global cost reduction efforts, elimination of our Spirits SG&A with the sale of the Value Spirits business and lower marketing expense. Consolidated operating income decreased 7% to $560 million and operating margin remained essentially flat at 16.6%. From a margin perspective, our stewardship of SG&A spend effectively offset the reduction in our gross profit margin for the year. I'd now like to turn to our segment operating income results on Page 13 of the release to provide highlights of our full year operating income change. Wine segment operating income decreased $37 million to $655 million. The decrease is primarily due to the divestiture of the Value Spirits business, decrease in U.S. branded wine sales and a decrease in U.K. Australia gross margin due to the negative mix and higher grape cost for Australian wine, partially offset by savings from our global cost reduction initiatives. For the year, corporate and other expenses totaled $95 million versus $87 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher stock-based compensation expense and costs related to Project Fusion, our multi-year program designed to strengthen our global business systems and processes.Consolidated equity investment earnings totaled $239 million versus $270 million last year. Equity and earnings include $222 million from Crown. For the year, Crown generated net sales of $2.3 billion, a decrease of 6% and operating income of $444 million, a decrease of 12%. Economic challenges have impacted the entire Beer industry, driving lower volumes and consumer movement to lower priced beer. Operating income for Crown was impacted by the lower volume, negative mix and the contractual cost increase.Interest expense for the year was $255 million, down 18% versus last year. The decrease was primarily driven by our significant debt reduction actions during the past 12 months. Now let's take a look at our debt position. At the end of February, our debt totaled $3.8 billion, which represent $600 million decrease from our debt level at the end of fiscal 2009. The decrease primarily reflects proceeds received from the sale of Value Spirits and Cider businesses combined with our strong free cash flow generation. Our average interest rate for the year was a little bit above 6%.Our debt-to-comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of fiscal 2010 was 4.0 versus a 4.3 ratio at the end of '09. Our strong free cash flow, reduced leverage and improved credit profile positioned us to take advantage of improved credit markets and complete certain refinancing activities during the fourth quarter. Let me summarize these actions. These activities included the amendment of our senior credit facility to extend $650 million of our revolver from June 2011 to June 2013. In addition, $192 million of pre-existing revolver remains in place at historical pricing through June 2011. We also extended the maturity of our $300 million of our $1.2 billion term loan from June 2013 to June 2015. The margin applicable to the extended revolving facility and term loan increased by 125 basis points. In addition, we redeemed our $250 million 8.8% sub-notes that were due in January 2012 without any penalty. I'm quite pleased with the result. We were able to maintain a low cost of capital, extend the term of our facilities, maintain appropriate financial flexibility, improve our covenants and reduce overall interest expense. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 30%, which reflects the favorable outcome of tax items from various jurisdictions. Favorable tax outcomes during the fourth quarter helped drive a negative 11% tax rate for Q4.Looking a little closer at Q4 results, the favorable tax rate helped offset the financial impact of soft Q4 net sales performance. For the fourth quarter, organic constant currency net sales decreased 2%. Branded Wine organic constant currency net sales decreased 6% versus the prior-year quarter. This included a 12% decrease in North America, a 23% increase in Europe and flat performance in Australia-New Zealand. The increase in Europe was primarily due to volume growth and favorable comparison versus the disappointing fourth quarter last year. The decrease in North America reflects the impacts of working with U.S. distributors to lower their inventory levels in Q4, as discussed by Rob earlier.Lower sales in North America drove a $22 million decrease in Wine segment operating income. The lower sales in North America, coupled with high growth in the U.K., drove negative mix, an 140 basis point gross margin decrease and reduced operating leverage as SG&A as a percent of net sales increased 220 basis points. During the fourth quarter and in conjunction with our annual impairment testing, the company recorded $103 million non-cash impairment charges, primarily related to trademark assets for the Australian business. Now let's turn to cash flow on Page 13 of the news release.For purposes of this discussion, free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activity less CapEx. For fiscal 2010, we generated free cash flow of $295 million, exceeding the high end of our most recent guidance range, but less than the $378 million produced in the prior year. While there were various year-over-year fluctuations in the cash flow details, the lower FY '10 cash generation was due in part to a $65 million tax payment related to the sale of the Value Spirits business. Working capital benefited from inventory reductions from lower grape harvest costs in Australia and New Zealand, and CapEx came in at $108 million versus $129 million in the prior year.As a reminder, free cash flow for fiscal 2009 reflected a benefit of approximately $55 million in after-tax proceeds related to the favorable settlement of certain foreign currency hedges. For fiscal 2011, we're targeting free cash flow to be in the range of $350 million to $400 million. This includes CapEx in the range of $110 million to $130 million. The targeted improvement of free cash flow versus 2010 is expected to be driven in part by anticipated lower tax payments, lower interest and lower restructuring activities versus the prior year.In March 2010, we received $60 million from Sazerac as they paid off an old receivable related to their purchase of our Value Spirits business. This cash benefit will be included in the investing section of the FY ’11 cash statement, and therefore is not included in our free cash flow estimate. Due to our continued strong free cash flow generation and successful deleveraging and refinancing efforts, we believe we can redeploy a portion of free cash flow to repurchase stock while we continue to reduce debt. In connection with this strategy, the Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the company's stock. Our intent is to implement an accelerated share buyback transaction when appropriate. Now let's move to our P&L outlook for the full year.Given the uncertain global economic conditions, we're forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.53 to $1.68 for fiscal '11. Our reported sales will be unfavorably impacted by the divestiture of our U.K. Cider business, which contributed about $100 million in net sales for fiscal 2010. On an organic constant-currency basis, we are targeting flattish net sales for fiscal 2011. On a consolidated basis, we expect operating income to be down slightly, due to the impact of divested businesses and continuing profit pressures for Australian and U.K. operations.Crown volumes are expected to be down low single digits due to continued impacts from the economy. Negative mix and a planned small contractual cost increase are also expected to impact Crown profits. As a result, we’re targeting equity earnings for Crown to be down mid-single digits from fiscal 2010.Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $210 million to $220 million. The healthy improvement being driven by our significant debt reduction, the prepayment of the 8.8% sub-notes with the lower cost revolver fund, and the roll-off of unfavorable interest rate hedges at the end of fiscal 2010. The comparable basis tax rate is expected to increase to 35%, and we’re assuming weighted average diluted shares to increase to approximately $224 million. These items will essentially offset the benefit of lower interest expense.Looking at Q1 fiscal 2011, we expect results to be impacted by higher marketing expense at Crown Imports versus the prior-year first quarter, as it ramps up on the marketing activities that Rob highlighted in his comments. Our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring charges and unusual items which are detailed on Page 19 of the news release. It also excludes any impact from the share repurchase program. We expect the share buyback to be accretive to EPS, and we will update our full year guidance when the transaction is complete. For fiscal 2011, we expect to incur diluted EPS charges of about $0.17 for restructuring and other one-time charges related to the previously announced cost reduction initiatives, and we continue efforts to increase efficiencies and improve ROIC.Before we take your questions, I'd like to reiterate that over the long term, we're focused on working to leverage the benefits of our new U.S. business structure and distributor consolidation initiative in increasing operational and cost efficiencies to drive improvement in our organic business model and ROIC. In addition, we plan to use free cash flow to further reduce debt and interest expense, and at the same time return cash to shareholders in the form of a share repurchase. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

As to your second question on the Wine industry in the United States, I would say that calendar year 2010, we're actually looking for about similar growth rates overall in all channels to calendar year 2009. So in 2009, the business – the Wine business was probably flat to up slightly. And in 2010, we're not projecting anything much different than that. Again, probably flat to up maybe 1%. And I'd like to emphasize that, that is in all channels; all channels meaning on-premise and off-premise, and within off-premise, the Grocery channel or the Mass Merchandise channel, the Club channel.

And yes, some restaurants chains have been reporting some improved traffic, but I think that overall, we don't really see huge improvements from an industry perspective in on-premise at the current time. I think that to the extent that some restaurant chains are reporting more positive trends, it may be that they're going to be down a little bit less. But there's still a lot of restaurant closures occurring that are offsetting any positive trends. There's definitely, if you look at who is projecting anything that you could call positive, it's really sort of the, I'm going to call it value end of the restaurant of chain business. So obviously, some restaurant chains may be reporting that they're more optimistic going into this year, but overall we don't see a big change in the on-premise as we move into 2010. If the economy improves and unemployment abates, that may change. But at the moment, I would say that there's been some pretty significant trends of people staying at home, eating at home, not going out as much.

And we reduced significantly distributor inventory during that period in a number of markets, but primarily in that 60%, as you indicated. I wouldn't call it a forecasting issue as you suggested. In fact, we decided that as long as we were going to get some benefit out of taking inventory levels down in the fourth quarter, that it was in our best interest, and we did get some benefit in that we negotiated some additional investment from the distributors behind our brands in exchange for the inventory reduction level -- in exchange for the inventory reduction. In general, I would also point out that our inventory to distributors are not particularly high from an industry perspective. They run somewhere, even currently in the 60- to 90-day range which I would say is consistent with distributor inventories as a general proposition across the United States and significantly below many suppliers. So it was really all about the fact that in the fourth quarter, we thought that there was an opportunity to do something that we thought would benefit our distributors in exchange for more investment behind our brands to drive results in the future.

And as we went into this harvest, although it was a big harvest, it was primarily large in what we call the North Central Valley. And that's where most of the -- let me put it this way, other than the North Central Valley, the crop was pretty average in size, and in some cases even smaller. Now that said, bulk wine supplies even in North Central Valley-type products were pretty low as we went into this harvest. And therefore, when all was said and done and given the fact that we were probably tipping towards under supply, and therefore shortages especially in some of the key varieties like Chardonnay, which continues to grow pretty heavily, I would say that even though the crop was big, we still end up in a fairly balanced state as we go forward.

We see great momentum behind SVEDKA as we've ended our fiscal 2010. And we see great momentum behind it as we enter 2011. We really are seeing no slowdown at all in the momentum behind the brand. The consumer is deciding what they want, and SVEDKA is clearly meeting all consumer needs in that particular category at the time. So I'm sure that not only will there be – will Diageo have a product but I think that there'll be other products. And if anything, it’ll grow that price segment in the category overall as people pour more money into this mid-priced vodka category. So it could actually be very favorable to us to have more entrants into the category. But as I said, there’s already a lot and always has been a lot of vodkas priced in that price range.

I think that looking at the industry, I think that we'll continue to see continued trading up in the industry with the higher price points growing at a faster rate than the lower price points. Right now, we do see some acceleration in the everyday wines up to $5, and I would expect that to continue as well. Last year, they went from being in decline to some pretty significant growth. That said, there was also some pretty big pricing taken in the under $5 category, and I would expect perhaps that to slowdown that growth a bit as we grow into this year. Now despite the fact that we also see sort of some continued positive mix shift and higher priced categories growing at a faster rate in general than lower-priced category, there still within categories, I would say seems to be some tendency to go to the lower end of those categories. And there's still quite a bit of discounted going on, which is driving the fact that some of the categories, like call it the luxury category, $15 to $20, why that category is growing, continues to grow nicely because you've got some of the above $20 discounting into that category, which is driving the category growth. So it's kind of a good news, bad news kind of a thing, okay. Good news is consumers are continuing to trade up as a general proposition in Wine. The bad news is, is that’s being fueled by some fairly heavy discounting of more expensive wine, so that negatively impacts margin at the higher price point. So as I said, kind of a good news, bad news kind of a story. Overall, things are pretty healthy. Overall, there will be some growth we anticipate in the industry overall. Overall, we do expect some positive mix shift for the industry. And then in the negative side is that, that mix shift could be offset by some continued heavy discounting in the marketplace. So that's kind of where things shake out."

So the way I look at it is EBIT is going to be down slightly, because we said of Crown international wine, and remember, we sold the cider business, which although didn't have very high margins, did have positive EBIT. And then we kind of said year-over-year, if you – you’ve already done it. If you take taxes, interest and shares into account, they all sort of, kind of offset each other.

We have several items to review this morning, including our fiscal 2010 results and our guidance for fiscal 2011. In February, we reached the conclusion of a very dynamic year, one in which we executed against our strategic goals despite lingering economic challenges around the world that affected our key markets.  We accomplished a great deal through fiscal 2010, continuing the disciplined work of transforming our portfolio, our operations and our financial model. We continued our portfolio transformation efforts as we began the fiscal year with the sale of our Value Spirits business, which resulted in cash proceeds of $276 million, and then we successfully integrated the remaining Spirits business into our North American Wine business.And we ended the fiscal year with the sale of our U.K. Cider business, the Gaymer Cider Company to C&C Group for approximately $70 million. These transactions, combined with strong free cash flow generation, helped drive a $600 million decrease in our debt levels. We continued our effort to improve our prospects for our U.K. and Australian businesses by tightening the portfolio focus, increasing efficiencies, reducing costs and improving cash flow generation. We significantly improved our cost structure, not only through our global cost reduction initiative but through supply chain initiatives and tightened controls on SG&A spending. We improved productivity and created efficiencies to global SKU rationalization efforts and consolidation of our global footprint.We progressed in our efforts to create an integrated technology platform, which has been designed to improve the accessibility and visibility of global data. This initiative is already creating value by reducing costs and improving efficiencies and is designed to ultimately enhance performance in key areas, such as supply chain, global procurement, customer service and information management and analysis. We implemented our new go-to-market sales and marketing structure in the U.S., which was successfully integrated into a single organization.  This resulted in synergy benefits and improved efficiency and effectiveness with our trade partners. From a strategic perspective, we have undertaken one of our most important initiatives with the launch of our U.S. consolidation effort. Presently, this program gives five distributors the rights to sell Constellation's portfolio of Wine and Spirits exclusively in the respective markets in 22 states, and currently represents approximately 60% of our total U.S. Wine and Spirits volume. Since the initial transition in September 2009, these distributors have allocated more than 1,000 dedicated distributor salespeople to focus exclusively on selling Constellation's product portfolio. As you know, the initial distributor transition commenced September 1, 2009, with the second quarter of fiscal 2010 benefiting from the implementation of this program. At that time, actions were taken to ensure maximum service levels between distributors and the retail customers during the transition period. These actions had the planned effect of moving a portion of third quarter sales into the second quarter and resulted into some inventory build at distributors. During the third quarter, consumer takeaway was softer than expected at the beginning of the quarter, but improved as our new selling model and promotional efforts began to take effect. However, at the end of the third quarter, distributor inventories were higher than targeted levels.In the fourth quarter, we made a proactive, tactical decision to work with our distributors in decreasing their higher-than-average inventories to more moderate levels. Now how did we accomplish that? We did not require distributors to purchase product at contracted levels, and in return they agreed to invest in additional marketing and promotional programs behind our brands in the marketplace. As expected, these actions unfavorably impacted our U.S. Wine business during the fourth quarter by approximately $60 million to $70 million in net sales and about $0.07 to $0.09 in diluted EPS and created negative leverage on the remainder of the P&L. However, we believe it was an appropriate tradeoff in order to better position to distributors for success in the future as they work with us to drive profitable organic growth.Going forward, we are refocusing our energies from managing transition activities to improving depletions and consumer takeaway. Our ultimate goal is to grow our U.S. Wine business in line with the total industry growth trends, and we expect to achieve this goal in 2011. This translates to an estimated volume growth rate of approximately 1% for the U.S. Wine industry inclusive of all channels, both on- and off-premise. As we've discussed, the on-premise channel is tempering the overall growth rate for the Wine category, while the Grocery, Mass Merchant and Club channels are growing at faster rates. For instance, current growth in the SymphonyIRI channel remains healthy at about 5% on a dollar basis according to recent 12-week IRI data that corresponds to the end of our fiscal year.In particular, the Premium segment where wine sells for greater than $5 a bottle at retail continues to grow in IRI channels at a rate of mid to high single digits. And within these price segments, many of our leading well-known brands continue to perform well in the marketplace, including for instance Rex Goliath, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Clos du Bois, Estancia, Toasted Head, Simi, Franciscan and Kim Crawford. Remember about 40% of our U.S. Wine volume is currently sold in several states that are not included in the transition process. It is in these states that our depletion trends are generally better than those undergoing transition.From a marketing perspective, we are currently in the process of launching several new products or line extensions as part of our strategy to fill portfolio gaps and drive profitable organic growth. For instance, as we focus on gaining share in the rapidly growing Argentinean Malbec segment, we are preparing to roll out the new Black Box Malbec varietal. We will also be re-launching our Diseno brand with a new package and marketing positioning. We will soon begin shipping our new Bluestone [ph] Riesling wine. This actually will establish a presence for us in the rapidly growing German Riesling segment. Constellation will begin its participation in the emerging organic wine niche with the Mendocino Vineyards brand, which is made using organic grapes. And we're in the process of a national rollout of a sparkling wine under the Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi umbrella.I just returned from the Wine and Spirits Wholesaler Conference, where Constellation was awarded nine Impact 2009 Hot Brand Awards for several of our well-known brands, including SVEDKA, Black Box, Kim Crawford, Rex Goliath, Corona Light and Modelo Especial, just to name a few. Our Canadian Wine business posted positive net sales results for the year, primarily driven by the Premium Wine portfolio, including Jackson-Triggs, Naked Grape and the Quebec Import business. As you know, Vincor Canada was the official wine supplier for the 2010 Winter Olympic Games. This sponsorship provided unprecedented exposure for our Canadian  brands and showcased the Canadian Wine industry to the world. Although the full business impacted this sponsorship is yet to be realized, I'm pleased to report at this time that an incremental 20,000 cases of our Canadian brands were sold at Olympic venues and surrounding areas during the games. In addition, our participating Canadian brands were showcased through Canadian and international media, including the TODAY Show, A Taste of Canada with Kathy Lee Gifford and Wine Spectator. In the Spirits segment, SVEDKA Vodka had another great year and generated phenomenal sales growth of almost 40% versus last year, which translates to more than three million cases sold in fiscal 2010. SVEDKA is the fastest growing major U.S. Spirits brand and now has become the fourth largest vodka brand in the entire United States. And we just launched SVEDKA's first national TV advertising campaign which began airing March 1. Black Velvet is the second largest Canadian second whiskey brand in the U.S. and grew more than two million cases in fiscal year 2010. It also posted solid results for the year, with sales increasing in the low to mid single-digit range.Now from an international perspective, earlier this week we announced that we have ended our discussion with Australia Vintage Limited pertaining to a potential combination of our businesses. Despite our mutual best efforts, we were unable to accomplish our goals and we have decided to focus individually on our respective businesses. As a result, we will continue to restructure our businesses in Australia and the U.K. in order to align them with the realities of the respective markets. We will be more aggressive in taking out costs, minimizing our net working capital investment, increasing efficiencies and selling assets. Our primary goal is to generate cash and improve gross profit.Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. During the company's fiscal year 2010, the Crown joint venture generated $2.3 billion in net sales and $444 million of operating income. Crown continues to have the leading market share in the import category in the U.S., with five of the Modelo brands represented in the top 20 import brands. Corona remains the number one import beer, and Modelo Especial is currently the third largest import brand in the United States today. Speaking of Modelo Especial, it is one of the few major super premium brand in calendar 2009 that experienced double-digit market growth. This is a major accomplishment, considering that 2009 was particularly a challenging year for the U.S. Beer industry in general, with growth trends softening as the year progressed. Many major domestic brands lost volume and share to craft beers and sub-premiums. As we've previously indicated, volumes for Crown's businesses have been impacted by the economy, particularly in the convenience and on-premise channels. However, the Crown portfolio outperformed the import category and grew share throughout the year. These results were driven in part in the grocery channel as Crown introduced new packagings, executed targeted promotions in support of the business with enhanced strategic media activity.For fiscal 2011, Crown is focused on further enhancing the integration of sales and marketing efforts by optimizing promotional activity and media support during peak seasonal periods when consumers buy the most. Some of these activities will be visible in the marketplace including the following: A summer consumer sweepstakes program that will begin immediately following the Cinco de Mayo holiday and run through the 4th of July. This program will be supported with television advertising. Crown will partner with Sports Illustrated during soccer's upcoming World Cup event, which will begin in June in South Africa. World Cup magazine issues will be promoting Modelo Especial, specifically for the convenience and on-premise channels. Corona will also be one of the three major beer sponsors of World Cup TV.Crown has expanded by the rollout of Modelo Especial with Negro Modelo draft to nearly 50% of the U.S. with positive results, and will continue expanding distribution throughout the remainder of the year. Crown is also seeing success with new SKUs recently introduced into the convenience channel, including Corona and Corona Light 24-ounce cans. And going into Cinco de Mayo holiday and the key summer season, we believe Crown is well positioned to maximize execution at retail.Before I turn the call over to Bob, I want to discuss our guidance for fiscal 2011. As you can see, our comparable EPS estimate for fiscal 2011 is projected to be in the range of $1.53 to $1.68 and reflects our belief that challenges from persistent and uncertain economic conditions will continue to impact the results, especially with regard to the Crown Imports business. However, we expect to begin to realize the benefits of our U.S. distribution, distributor consolidation efforts as the year progresses. Meanwhile, our strong free cash flow enables us to create value in the form of an accelerated share buyback while continuing our debt reduction efforts. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial discussion of our business results."

We sold the Value",2303,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2010 was a year of dramatic change, operationally, culturally and financially. From an operational perspective, we took positive steps during the year to strengthen our organic business model. We sold the Value Spirits business and moved our two scale Spirits brands into our U.S. Wine business and eliminated our Spirits SG&A. We then consolidated the majority of our U.S. distributor network while also reducing the infrastructure of our U.S. Wine business from three selling units down to one. This also resulted in reduced SG&A.We now have a single scale U.S. business, focused on a streamlined Premium Wine and Spirits portfolio going to a consolidated, focused and aligned distributor network. Culturally, we are focused on profitable organic growth of our premium scale brands, primarily Wine. This means increased focused on brand building and sales execution, especially in North America. This also represents our next logical business phase, as we move beyond a previously decentralized organization, which had been very focused on acquisitions, toward a more centralized organization, more focused on profitable organic sales growth.In our U.K. Australian business, we have a renewed focus on profits, driving synergies and generating cash flow. Financially, we reduced costs to help offset the negative impact of the current economy and generated strong free cash flow to help drive another year of debt reduction and reduced interest expense. Our full year fiscal 2010 comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $1.69 versus $1.60 in the previous year. Our results included the impact of challenging economic conditions, especially on Crown's performance; U.S. Wine sales force restructuring; U.S. distributor consolidation; and continuing difficult operating environment for our U.K. Australian business. On the more positive side, we reduced costs, which helped offset some unfavorable mix impact driven by the challenging economy. We extended our revolving credit facility and a portion of our term debt. We generated strong free cash flow, as we exceeded the upper end of our guidance range. We significantly reduced debt and interest expense, and we realized tax benefits for the year.Now let's look at our fiscal 2010 P&L performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Let's go to our net sales line. As you can see from our news release on Page 15, our consolidated net sales decreased 8% for the year, primarily due to the divestiture of our Value Spirits business and the unfavorable impact of our year-over-year currency rate fluctuations. On an organic constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and forex rate changes, net sales increased 1%. My commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant-currency basis. Our worldwide branded wine organic net sales, which appear on Page 14 of the release, decreased 1%. This included a 3% decrease for North America, partially offset by increases of 7% in Europe and 4% in Australia-New Zealand. North American sales were impacted by continuing economic challenges and U.S. distributor and sales force transitions. In connection with our recently implemented distributor contracts, sales to newly contracted distributors for an initial period are based on a pre-determined plan. Our sales force and distributor transitions resulted in a fall-off of depletions and consumer takeaway during fiscal 2010. As a result, distributors have generally been taking in more inventory than they have been depleting.While we were proactive during the fourth quarter in working with distributors to help reduce our inventory levels, as outlined by Rob, the distributors ended fiscal 2010 with higher inventory levels than they ended fiscal 2009. For Europe, sales benefited from the growth of our value-priced product offerings in the U.K. Sales for Australia-New Zealand increased due to New Zealand product growth in the region. Spirits organic net sales increased by an impressive 19% for the year.Now let's look at our profit on a comparable basis, using the information on Page 17 of the release. For the year, our consolidated gross margin was 35% versus 37.1% for the prior year. This reflects the higher Australian COGS due to the flow-through of the more expensive calendar 2008 harvest, and growth of the lower margin U.K. Australian businesses. Although they remained profitable, our U.K. Australian businesses experienced another year of reduced profits. Our consolidated SG&A for the year decreased $136 million and came in at 18.3% of net sales compared to 20.6% a year ago. The margin reduction was primarily driven by our global cost reduction efforts, elimination of our Spirits SG&A with the sale of the Value Spirits business and lower marketing expense. Consolidated operating income decreased 7% to $560 million and operating margin remained essentially flat at 16.6%. From a margin perspective, our stewardship of SG&A spend effectively offset the reduction in our gross profit margin for the year. I'd now like to turn to our segment operating income results on Page 13 of the release to provide highlights of our full year operating income change. Wine segment operating income decreased $37 million to $655 million. The decrease is primarily due to the divestiture of the Value Spirits business, decrease in U.S. branded wine sales and a decrease in U.K. Australian gross margin due to the negative mix and higher grape cost for Australian wine, partially offset by savings from our global cost reduction initiatives. For the year, corporate and other expenses totaled $95 million versus $87 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher stock-based compensation expense and costs related to Project Fusion, our multi-year program designed to strengthen our global business systems and processes.Consolidated equity investment earnings totaled $239 million versus $270 million last year. Equity and earnings include $222 million from Crown. For the year, Crown generated net sales of $2.3 billion, a decrease of 6% and operating income of $444 million, a decrease of 12%. Economic challenges have impacted the entire Beer industry, driving lower volumes and consumer movement to lower priced beer. Operating income for Crown was impacted by the lower volume, negative mix and the contractual cost increase.Interest expense for the year was $265 million, down 18% versus last year. The decrease was primarily driven by our significant debt reduction actions during the past 12 months. Now let's take a look at our debt position. At the end of February, our debt totaled $3.8 billion, which represents $600 million decrease from our debt level at the end of fiscal 2009. The decrease primarily reflects proceeds received from the sale of Value Spirits and Cider businesses combined with our strong free cash flow generation. Our average interest rate for the year was a little bit above 6%.Our debt-to-comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of fiscal 2010 was 4.0 versus a 4.3 ratio at the end of '09. Our strong free cash flow, reduced leverage and improved credit profile positioned us to take advantage of improved credit markets and complete certain refinancing activities during the fourth quarter. Let me summarize these actions. These activities included the amendment of our senior credit facility to extend $650 million of our revolver from June 2011 to June 2013. In addition, $192 million of pre-existing revolver remains in place at historical pricing through June 2011. We also extended the maturity of our $300 million of our $1.2 billion term loan from June 2013 to June 2015. The margin applicable to the extended revolving facility and term loan increased by 125 basis points. In addition, we redeemed our $250 million 8.8% sub-notes that were due in January 2012 without any penalty. I'm quite pleased with the result. We were able to maintain a low cost of capital, extend the term of our facilities, maintain appropriate financial flexibility, improve our covenants and reduce overall interest expense. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 30%, which reflects the favorable outcome of tax items from various jurisdictions. Favorable tax outcomes during the fourth quarter helped drive a negative 11% tax rate for Q4.Looking a little closer at Q4 results, the favorable tax rate helped offset the financial impact of soft Q4 net sales performance. For the fourth quarter, organic constant currency net sales decreased 2%. Branded Wine organic constant currency net sales decreased 6% versus the prior-year quarter. This included a 12% decrease in North America, a 23% increase in Europe and flat performance in Australia-New Zealand. The increase in Europe was primarily due to volume growth and favorable comparison versus the disappointing fourth quarter last year. The decrease in North America reflects the impacts of working with U.S. distributors to lower their inventory levels in Q4, as discussed by Rob earlier.Lower sales in North America drove a $22 million decrease in Wine segment operating income. The lower sales in North America, coupled with high growth in the U.K., drove negative mix, an 140 basis point gross margin decrease and reduced operating leverage as SG&A as a percent of net sales increased 220 basis points. During the fourth quarter and in conjunction with our annual impairment testing, the company recorded $103 million non-cash impairment charges, primarily related to trademark assets for the Australian business. Now let's turn to cash flow on Page 13 of the news release.For purposes of this discussion, free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activity less CapEx. For fiscal 2010, we generated free cash flow of $295 million, exceeding the high end of our most recent guidance range, but less than the $378 million produced in the prior year. While there were various year-over-year fluctuations in the cash flow details, the lower FY '10 cash generation was due in part to a $65 million tax payment related to the sale of the Value Spirits business. Working capital benefited from inventory reductions from lower grape harvest costs in Australia and New Zealand, and CapEx came in at $108 million versus $129 million in the prior year.As a reminder, free cash flow for fiscal 2009 reflected a benefit of approximately $55 million in after-tax proceeds related to the favorable settlement of certain foreign currency hedges. For fiscal 2011, we're targeting free cash flow to be in the range of $350 million to $400 million. This includes CapEx in the range of $110 million to $130 million. The targeted improvement of free cash flow versus 2010 is expected to be driven in part by anticipated lower tax payments, lower interest and lower restructuring activities versus the prior year.In March 2010, we received $60 million from Sazerac as they paid off an old receivable related to their purchase of our Value Spirits business. This cash benefit will be included in the investing section of the FY '11 cash statement, and therefore is not included in our free cash flow estimate. Due to our continued strong free cash flow generation and successful deleveraging and refinancing efforts, we believe we can redeploy a portion of free cash flow to repurchase stock while we continue to reduce debt. In connection with this strategy, the Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the company's stock. Our intent is to implement an accelerated share buyback transaction when appropriate. Now let's move to our P&L outlook for the full year.Given the uncertain global economic conditions, we're forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.53 to $1.68 for fiscal '11. Our reported sales will be unfavorably impacted by the divestiture of our U.K. Cider business, which contributed about $100 million in net sales for fiscal 2010. On an organic constant-currency basis, we are targeting flattish net sales for fiscal 2011. On a consolidated basis, we expect operating income to be down slightly, due to the impact of divested businesses and continuing profit pressures for Australian and U.K. operations.Crown volumes are expected to be down low single digits due to continued impacts from the economy. Negative mix and a planned small contractual cost increase are also expected to impact Crown profits. As a result, we're targeting equity earnings for Crown to be down mid-single digits from fiscal 2010.Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $210 million to $220 million. The healthy improvement being driven by our significant debt reduction, the prepayment of the 8.8% sub-notes with the lower cost revolver fund, and the roll-off of unfavorable interest rate hedges at the end of fiscal 2010. The comparable basis tax rate is expected to increase to 35%, and we're assuming weighted average diluted shares to increase to approximately $224 million. These items will essentially offset the benefit of lower interest expense.Looking at Q1 fiscal 2011, we expect results to be impacted by higher marketing expense at Crown Imports versus the prior-year first quarter, as it ramps up on the marketing activities that Rob highlighted in his comments. Our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring charges and unusual items which are detailed on Page 19 of the news release. It also excludes any impact from the share repurchase program. We expect the share buyback to be accretive to EPS, and we will update our full year guidance when the transaction is complete. For fiscal 2011, we expect to incur diluted EPS charges of about $0.17 for restructuring and other one-time charges related to the previously announced cost reduction initiatives, and we continue efforts to increase efficiencies and improve ROIC.Before we take your questions, I'd like to reiterate that over the long term, we're focused on working to leverage the benefits of our new U.S. business structure and distributor consolidation initiative in increasing operational and cost efficiencies to drive improvement in our organic business model and ROIC. In addition, we plan to use free cash flow to further reduce debt and interest expense, and at the same time return cash to shareholders in the form of a share repurchase. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

As to your second question on the Wine industry in the United States, I would say that calendar year 2010, we're actually looking for about similar growth rates overall in all channels to calendar year 2009. So in 2009, the business - the Wine business was probably flat to up slightly. And in 2010, we're not projecting anything much different than that. Again, probably flat to up maybe 1%. And I'd like to emphasize that, that is in all channels; all channels meaning on-premise and off-premise, and within off-premise, the Grocery channel or the Mass Merchandise channel, the Club channel.

It's pretty much as we've said, all throughout the year. We put inventory in, in the second quarter in anticipation of our consolidation efforts, when we normally put it into the third quarter. Third quarter I would say due to economic conditions, consumer takeaway was a bit less than we anticipated, and therefore inventory levels ended up a bit higher than we anticipated. And then, of course, in the fourth quarter, we felt that we had the room to adjust, and we did take advantage of that. And we reduced significantly distributor inventory during that period in a number of markets, but primarily in that 60%, as you indicated. I wouldn't call it a forecasting issue as you suggested. In fact, we decided that as long as we were going to get some benefit out of taking inventory levels down in the fourth quarter, that it was in our best interest, and we did get some benefit in that we negotiated some additional investment from the distributors behind our brands in exchange for the inventory reduction level -- in exchange for the inventory reduction. In general, I would also point out that our inventory to distributors are not particularly high from an industry perspective. They run somewhere, even currently in the 60- to 90-day range which I would say is consistent with distributor inventories as a general proposition across the United States and significantly below many suppliers. So it was really all about the fact that in the fourth quarter, we thought that there was an opportunity to do something that we thought would benefit our distributors in exchange for more investment behind our brands to drive results in the future. So that's really what went on, Lindsay."

That said, okay, the California - the supply situation in California is pretty well-balanced at the current time. As we went into this harvest, from the previous harvest, I would say that the industry was tipped on the side of under supply. And as we went into this harvest, although it was a big harvest, it was primarily large in what we call the North Central Valley. And that's where most of the -- let me put it this way, other than the North Central Valley, the crop was pretty average in size, and in some cases even smaller. Now that said, bulk wine supplies even in North Central Valley-type products were pretty low as we went into this harvest. And therefore, when all was said and done and given the fact that we were probably tipping towards under supply, and therefore shortages especially in some of the key varieties like Chardonnay, which continues to grow pretty heavily, I would say that even though the crop was big, we still end up in a fairly balanced state as we go forward. And I definitely wouldn't characterize it as oversupply; if anything it was an under supply and moved more towards balance."

It's growing very rapidly. There's a lot of, actually a lot of imitators out there in the market, and a lot of vodkas that are priced in that category. So one more, I would say really doesn't matter much, doesn't really particularly concern us. We've always got our eye competition, and that is why we have initiated a new advertising campaign with regard to SVEDKA. It's on TV this year. And we're doing a lot of things to continue to build the strength of what already is a very, very strong brand. So I would say that imitation is the strongest form of flattery, that's about as much as I would say about it. One more vodka priced at that price point, at I said doesn't particularly concern us. We see great momentum behind SVEDKA as we've ended our fiscal 2010. And we see great momentum behind it as we enter 2011. We really are seeing no slowdown at all in the momentum behind the brand. The consumer is deciding what they want, and SVEDKA is clearly meeting all consumer needs in that particular category at the time. So I'm sure that not only will there be - will Diageo have a product but I think that there'll be other products. And if anything, it'll grow that price segment in the category overall as people pour more money into this mid-priced vodka category. So it could actually be very favorable to us to have more entrants into the category. But as I said, there's already a lot and always has been a lot of vodkas priced in that price range.

I think that looking at the industry, I think that we'll continue to see continued trading up in the industry with the higher price points growing at a faster rate than the lower price points. Right now, we do see some acceleration in the everyday wines up to $5, and I would expect that to continue as well. Last year, they went from being in decline to some pretty significant growth. That said, there was also some pretty big pricing taken in the under $5 category, and I would expect perhaps that to slowdown that growth a bit as we grow into this year. Now despite the fact that we also see sort of some continued positive mix shift and higher priced categories growing at a faster rate in general than lower-priced category, there still within categories, I would say seems to be some tendency to go to the lower end of those categories. And there's still quite a bit of discounted going on, which is driving the fact that some of the categories, like call it the luxury category, $15 to $20, why that category is growing, continues to grow nicely because you've got some of the above $20 discounting into that category, which is driving the category growth. So it's kind of a good news, bad news kind of a thing, okay. Good news is consumers are continuing to trade up as a general proposition in Wine. The bad news is, is that's being fueled by some fairly heavy discounting of more expensive wine, so that negatively impacts margin at the higher price point. So as I said, kind of a good news, bad news kind of a story. Overall, things are pretty healthy. Overall, there will be some growth we anticipate in the industry overall. Overall, we do expect some positive mix shift for the industry. And then in the negative side is that, that mix shift could be offset by some continued heavy discounting in the marketplace.

But given modest growth in the Wine business and the reduction of interest expense, why would you be down from that $1.57 with a normalized tax rate?"

If you equalize the tax rate for this year, you're at $1.57, okay. But then you wouldn't touch next year's tax rate because you're using 35% in both years. But, yes, so the way - right. So the way I look at it is EBIT is going to be down slightly, because we said of Crown international wine, and remember, we sold the cider business, which although didn't have very high margins, did have positive EBIT. And then we kind of said year-over-year, if you - you've already done it. If you take taxes, interest and shares into account, they all sort of, kind of offset each other. So you can think about it EBIT year-over-year is you're losing about $0.09 a share, and that's the $1.69 to the $1.60."

We're up to a good start for the year with results that were generally in line with our expectations. I believe the highlight of the first quarter relates to the fact that we are beginning to realize the benefits from our consolidation of our U.S. distribution network in key markets and the implementation of our new go-to-market strategy. Remember, it was during last year's first quarter that we began to scale back promotional activities for our U.S. Wine and Spirits business in advance of the initiation of our U.S. distributor consolidation program and sales force restructuring efforts.
And we did not increase promotions to more normalized levels until the end of last year's third quarter in advance of our holiday selling season. Nonetheless, in the market, promotional activity has remained strong throughout this period, especially in the Premium Plus category. Now having completed the most significant phase of our U.S. distributor transition, during this year's first quarter, we increased promotional activities and brand investments, launched new products and begin to improve our in-store execution at retail.
Some examples of these activities include: Continuation of what we call the biggest holiday ever promotion during Easter; new product launches, including the introduction of blüfeld German riesling, Arbor Mist White Pear pinot grigio, Black Box malbec and Woodbridge sparkling wines; brand investment in SVEDKA; relaunch of Ravenswood ""No More Wimpy Wines"" campaign using digital media. And collectively, these efforts drove improved marketplace depletion growth in the mid-single-digit range for our U.S. Wine business. And as I mentioned last quarter, we are refocusing our energies toward improving depletion and consumer takeaway, and we made measurable progress towards this goal.
We expect to grow our U.S. Wine business in line with total industry growth trends and are working diligently to achieve this target as we progress through fiscal 2011. Current growth in the IRI channel remains healthy at about 5% on a dollar basis according to recent 12-week IRI data. In particular, the Super-Premium Plus segment, where wine sales for greater than $8 a bottle at retail is currently growing at double-digit rates. And within these price segments, many of our leading well-known brands continued to perform well in the marketplace including Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Blackstone, Clos du Bois, Estancia, Toasted Head, Simi, Franciscan, Wild Horse and Kim Crawford. 
In fact, with our streamlined portfolio, our top 15 U.S. wine brands represent the vast majority of our U.S. wine profitability, and as these brands that are growing at a pace faster than the market due to our U.S. distributor consolidation effort and our renewed focus on building and promoting our brands.
During the quarter, Constellation gained international recognition; it's having some of the best and most powerful brands in the industry. The 2010 Power 100 List recognizes the world's most powerful wine and spirits brands. This year's list includes several of our brands with SVEDKA as one of the most powerful vodka brand and Black Velvet as one of the most powerful whiskey brand, Robert Mondavi and Hardy as two of the most powerful wine brands and Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy as one of the most powerful brandy brands. 
In addition, Beverage Information Group recently recognized Constellation with three Fast Track Awards for our Black Box, Kim Crawford and SVEDKA brands. In early June, Constellation participated in the inaugural Ultimate Wine Challenge in New York City, which is a professional tasting event of nearly 500 wines representing 15 countries and 43 appellations. The Chairman's trophy was awarded to the best wines in 23 different wine category. Constellation won trophies for Nobilo Sauvignon Blanc 2009, Hogue Cellars Genesis Riesling '08, Simi Cabernet Sauvignon 2006, Clos du Bois Pinot Noir 2007 and Ravenswood Napa Valley Zinfandel 2007.
Moving to our Canadian business, the accolades also continue. In early June, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which is the largest purchaser of beverage alcohol in the world, awarded Vincor Supplier of the Year across all beverage alcohol categories. In addition, they received the Best New Product Launch and Best Image Program awards for their new Open wine brand. These results indicate that our brand strength and reputation are continuing to grow in today's competitive marketplace, which validates our strategic imperative emphasizing premiumization, brand building and organic sales growth.
Now from an operating perspective, our Canadian Wine business posted positive net sales results for the quarter, primarily driven by the premium wine portfolio, including Jackson-Triggs and Inniskillin. In our Spirits business, during the first quarter, SVEDKA Vodka posted sales growth of 40% versus last year and continued to gain market share. As I mentioned earlier, SVEDKA was recognized on the 2010 Power 100 List as one of the world's most powerful spirits brands, but was also honored as the highest rated single new category entrant and earned a 2010 Business Star Performance award. As you know, SVEDKA is the fastest-growing major U.S. spirits brand and has now become the fourth largest vodka brand in the United States.
And during the quarter, we launched SVEDKA's first national TV advertising campaign which began airing March 1. Black Velvet also posted strong results in the first quarter, with sales increasing low-double digits. 
Now moving to our International business. The 2010 great progress in Australia is now complete, and it appears that the current harvest estimate is about 1.5 million tons, a 12% decrease from the 2009 harvest of approximately 1.7 million tons. While this harvest intake is closer to current demand, a surplus remains from prior year's oversupply. Current marketplace dynamics in the U.K. and Australia remains unchanged. Therefore, we continue to aggressively restructure our business in these markets through cost reductions, minimization of working capital investment and asset sales. Our primary goal is to generate cash, increase efficiencies and improve gross profits. The U.K. and Australian business combined represent less than 5% of our total consolidated EBIT in 2010. 
Now moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. During the first quarter, sales and operating income for the Crown joint venture continued to be impacted by economically driven challenges for the U.S. beer industry in general. These challenging trends that were pervasive throughout 2009 have continued into 2010 with major premium domestic brands losing volume and share to craft beers, sub-premiums and now, imports. And within the Import category, Crown has recently fared better than most, but I'll discuss this in greater detail in a moment.
Crown's first quarter operating income was unfavorably impacted not only by volume declines and unfavorable mix, but by the timing of marketing and promotional activity such as programming for the Cinco de Mayo holiday, distribution of value-added coupons in select markets, World Cup Soccer advertising and the ""Win A Beach Getaway"" sweepstakes. However, the good news is that we believe these promotional activities were successful in driving positive depletion trends during the quarter. 
I'd like to provide a few examples. Crown outperformed key competitors in the U.S. beer market during two important first quarter events: Cinco de Mayo and the Memorial Day holiday. During Cinco, Crown outperformed the total Beer and Import categories in case growth, with Modelo Especial outperforming every major domestic and import brand per IRI data corresponding with this time frame. During the Memorial Day holiday, Crown not only increased case sales but grew market share in IRI channels including food, drug and convenience and mass markets.
Crown's promotional activities and timing factors resulted in temporary inventory reductions at the wholesale level during the first quarter. Having said that, Crown is closely managing inventories at wholesale and retail to ensure seamless execution during the summer selling season. Throughout the remainder of fiscal 2011, Crown has focused on further enhancing the integration of sales and marketing efforts by optimizing promotional activity and media support during peak seasonal periods when consumers buy the most. 
Some of the activities that have been or will become visible in the marketplace include: The continued rollout of Negra Modelo and Modelo Especial draft, which now has a presence in 25 cities. The launch of Pacifico draft throughout California, the continuation of the ""Win A Beach Getaway"" summer sweepstakes program that began immediately following the Cinco de Mayo holiday and will run through the end of July. Crown is partnering with Sports Illustrated and World Cup magazine through the duration of the World Cup Soccer event. And Corona is also one of the three major beer sponsors of World Cup TV. 
Recently, Crown launched Modelo's Victoria brand in Chicago as an initial test market and rapidly sold out of its case allocation for this product. Victoria is Mexico's number two volume and oldest beer brand and was introduced at a price point premium to Corona Extra. All aspects of this test market will be tracked and measured with a recommendation for potential expansion in 2011.
Now as closing, we are beginning to reap the rewards of our focus on profitable, organic growth as we work diligently to harvest the ultimate benefit from the execution of our U.S. distributor strategy. And our strong free cash flow enables us to create value in the form of an accelerated share buyback while continuing our debt reduction efforts. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder, our CFO, for a financial discussion of our business results. Bob?"
258589,107892343,66677,"Constellation Brands Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Jul-01-2010",2010-07-01,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Given the continuing challenging economic and competitive market conditions, I'm pleased with our Q1 results, which were generally in line with our expectations. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in",1837,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Given the continuing challenging economic and competitive market conditions, I'm pleased with our Q1 results, which were generally in line with our expectations. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $0.38 a share versus $0.33 last year. Comparable EBIT came in below prior year as expected. However, we saw some encouraging trends in the quarter.
We remain focused on leveraging our new U.S. business structure, streamlined portfolio and consolidated U.S. distributor network. These efforts are progressing as our U.S. distributor initiative gained traction in the marketplace. This, combined with the increased brand investments and promotional activities outlined by Rob, has improved shipment volumes, performance at retail and depletion trends for our U.S. Wine business during the first quarter. However, the higher promotional activity impacted net sales as promotions are recorded as a reduction in the net sales line. 
This reduced North American wine sales and our operating margin. The promotion spend increase was due in part to timing. In fiscal 2010, promotion spending was lighter in Q1 and Q2 as we shifted more promotion dollars to the second half of fiscal '10 as part of our U.S. distributor consolidation effort. In Q1 fiscal '11, we increased spending for more normal levels due to our Easter holiday volume improvement program. Also, as Rob mentioned, wine industry promotion spending had increased in the premium-and-above price category, and we are staying competitive with an eye on the bottom line.  Year-over-year promotion spending comparison should improve in the second half of fiscal '11.
The quarter also saw some positive timing related to our comparable basis effective tax rate, which should reverse in the balance of the year as our effective tax rate came in at 24% versus our targeted full year rate of 35%. Before we look at our Q1 P&L performance in more detail, I wanted to highlight that we had changed our segment reporting structure. 
Our Wine business is now structured in two segments. The first segment is North America. And the second segment is Australia and Europe, with most of Europe represented by the U.K. This reporting change was driven by our strategy shift in Australia and Europe, where we have combined the infrastructures of these businesses given the symbiotic nature of these markets to better align strategy, increase efficiencies, reduce SG&A costs and improve cash generation.
We're very different businesses in these two segments, with diverging economic models and strategies. We believe segregating the reporting of these businesses should help investors better understand our overall business. 
The North American business represents the majority of our profitability and has strong financial profile. Results for New Zealand are included in North America segment as the vast majority of our wine produced in New Zealand is consumed in the U.S. and Canada, and has always been reflected within North America. New Zealand sales not consumed in North America represent about  2% of the North American segment sales. Prior-period results in our press release and our segment history schedule on our website have been restated to conform with the new segment presentation. 
Now let's look at our fiscal Q1 P&L performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated net sales decreased 1%, primarily due to the divestiture of our U.K. Cider and Value Spirits businesses, partially offset by the favorable impact of year-over-year currency rate fluctuations. On an organic constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange rate changes, net sales were even with the prior quarter.
Our commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Our consolidated wine organic net sales decreased 1%. This included a 2% decrease for North America; slight increase in volume was more than offset by the higher promotion activities in the quarter. Australia and Europe increased 1% as marketplace conditions have generally remained unchanged. Spirits organic net sales increased an impressive 28% for the quarter. Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis.
For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 34.5% versus 34.9% for the prior year. This reflects higher promotion spending in the U.S. and unfavorable foreign currency impacts related to shipments of Australian product in the U.K., partially offset by favorable Australian grape costs as the lower cost calendar 2009 harvest starts to flow through our fiscal 2011 income statement. Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $18 million and came in at 21.4% of net sales compared with 19.1% a year ago.
The percentage of sales increase reflects lower net sales as a result of the increased promotional spend combined with higher professional service costs for projects aimed at improving our systems and business operations. Much of the increased costs will remain throughout the year. Consolidated operating income decreased 17% to $103 million, and operating margin decreased 2.7 percentage points to 13.1%. 
I'd now like to turn to our segment operating results to provide highlights of our first quarter operating income change. North American segment operating income decreased $15 million to $133 million. The decrease is primarily due to the higher promotion spending. The Australia and Europe Wine segment reported an operating loss of $3 million versus a break-even result in the prior-year quarter. The grape cost benefits in Australia were offset by the strengthening of the Australian dollar, and gross profit margins in the U.K. continued to be challenged. Please note that the first quarter is the seasonally lowest profit quarter for this segment, and we do expect this segment to be profitable on a full year basis.
Corporate and other expenses totaled $26 million versus $23 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase is primarily driven by higher professional services, including costs related to Project Fusion, a multi-year program designed to strengthen our global business systems and processes. 
Equity earnings for Crown totaled $54 million versus $63 million in the prior year. For the quarter, Crown generated net sales of $622 million, a decrease of 3% and operating income of $109 million, a decrease of 14%. Sales were impacted primarily by higher promotions and unfavorable mix. Operating income for Crown was impacted by the timing of promotional and marketing investments, a contractual product cost increase and unfavorable mix.
Interest expense for the quarter was $49 million, down 29% versus last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower average interest rate during the quarter and our significant debt reduction actions during fiscal 2010. 
Let's take a look at debt. At the end of May, our debt totaled of $4 billion, which represents $182 million increase from our debt level at the end of fiscal '10. The increase primarily reflects funding our $300 million accelerated stock buyback, partially offset by $60 million in note receivable proceeds from the sale of our Value Spirits business and our free cash flow generation. I'll talk more about the stock buyback in a few moments. 
Our average interest rates for the quarter was approximately 5%. Our debt-to-comparable-basis-EBITDA ratio at the end of May was 4.4x. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 24%, which reflects the favorable outcome of tax items and compares to a 39% rate for Q1 last year. As mentioned earlier, we are still targeting a full year tax rate of 35%.
Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated free cash flow of $34 million versus a use of cash of $102 million in the prior year. The improvement reflect anticipated timing benefits for Crown distributions and interest payments. We also saw lower restructuring payments and an inventory benefit primarily related to the U.S. and Australia. CapEx came in at $26 million versus $47 million in Q1 last year due to project timing. We continue targeting free cash flow to be in the range of $350 million to $400 million for fiscal 2011. This includes CapEx in the range of $110 million to $130 million. 
While we expect to pay down debt in fiscal '11, we have redeployed a portion of free cash flow to repurchase stock as we believe our shares represent good value. In April, we entered into a $300 million accelerated stock buyback transaction. We funded this through our low-cost revolver. During the first quarter, we received 13.8 million shares of Class A common stock, which represented the minimum number of shares that will be received under the transaction.  The final number of shares we receive under the transaction will be determined at the close of the transaction period.
That provides a good point to move to our full year fiscal 2011 P&L outlook. We're increasing our comparable basis EPS guidance by $0.10 to a range of $1.63 to $1.78 per share to reflect the estimated accretion benefit of the stock buyback. We still expect interest expense to be in the range of $210 million to $220 million as rates remain below those anticipated at the beginning of the year. We're now assuming weighted average diluted shares to approximate 212 million versus our previous guidance of 224 million to reflect the estimated stock buyback benefit. 
As a reminder, Q2 fiscal 2011 will have a tough comparison versus Q2 fiscal 2010. As previously discussed in Q2 of last year, Constellation and the newly appointed distributors decided to increase distributor inventories and minimize operational disruption to ensure adequate service level for retail customers during the transition.
We estimated Q2 fiscal '10 benefited in this timing shift by approximately $40 million to $50 million in net sales and $0.05 to $0.07 of diluted EPS. As discussed earlier, Q2 fiscal '10 also reflected lower promotion costs. Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed in our news release. During Q1, we recorded a $0.02 charge for restructuring activity related to our global cost-reduction initiative and a $0.13 tax charge associated with the valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets in the U.K.
Before we take your questions, I would like to reiterate that we're on track to meet our financial goals for the year, and we continue to improve our organic business model. We're pleased with the top line results of our marketplace initiatives. Our increased brand investment in core brands, our new product launches and our progress with our distributor initiative have resulted in improved shipment and depletion volumes and market share gains on our core brands. Although Q1 Crown performance was below prior year, we're also seeing some positive top line results from Crown's branding and marketing initiatives. 
Cash flow is starting the year out on a strong note, which, in conjunction with continued low interest rates, is helping reduce the incremental interest expense of our share buyback. Our U.K. Australia business continues to be challenged, and we continue to look for ways to improve the financial returns of this business.
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

And in terms of the category where we have the largest market share, it would be the Super-Premium category, where we have approximately a 30% market share. And then Ultra Premium, we have more like a 20-some-odd percent and then above that, about a 28%. So in terms of how we index versus wine in general, we are skewed significantly towards Premium Plus and even really Super-Premium Plus than the general industry because we do not have the percentage that the industry have in the $5-and-below segment, which still represents a pretty significant piece of the wine industry in general. So to the extent is that the Premium Plus and Super-Premium categories and above are growing faster than the industry, we are growing faster than the industry as well, not only due to our individual brand performance but mix as well. Now all that said, as Bob pointed out, although some of these categories like Super-Premium above $8 are now growing in the double-digit range and there's definitely, we're back to trading less than premiumization, all that has to be qualified by the fact that some of those is driven by some fairly high promotional activity and promotional levels in the marketplace, which is not necessarily a bad thing because it's stimulating the whole category. Wine is taking share from everything, Beer and Spirits and, it's pretty robust. Did that answer your question, Tim?"

That's exclusively driven by our estimate of what accretion will be on the buyback. And in the reported guidance, there is a delta there from comparable all due to the charges, the non-comparable charges we took in the first quarter. And the big piece of that was a charge to eliminate a deferred tax asset in the U.K. And because we are kind of stressed on profitability in the U.K., it's just a probability of ever getting any value out of that asset. And with all the restructuring charges we've taken, the rules are kind of rather [ph] (47:37) shown positive GAAP earnings for the past three years, okay? The accountants get out and [ph] (47:46), they tend to say that we won't be able to utilize that deferred tax assets. So we took that charge in the first quarter, so that's the biggest piece. Regarding the other guidance factors, we really haven't changed anything. And again, you guys do this all the time. But it's the first quarter, so a trend is not quarter to make.

No, our level of investment is significantly higher than our distributors' level of investment on a relative basis. But part of the distributor consolidation program was, as a general proposition, to get more investment behind our business by our distributors throughout the term of the arrangement, which was a 5.5-year term. So they have, as was agreed, increased their level of investment and that increased level of investment will continue throughout the period of the arrangement, which was a 5.5-year deal, basically. And yes, that has been contributing to our growth profile. And basically, working as we wanted it to work and it's basically working as we expected it to work. And as Bob said, we're going to closely monitor the trade-off between promotional spend and volume and sales increases, and make sure that we're striking a right balance. I think that as we have made fairly clear, first quarter's promotional spend was a relative basis higher than we expect for the year, primarily due to a number of factors, which is in first quarter last year, we had a disproportionately low promotion because we had pulled back as we went into the distributor consolidation activity. That's impacting the comparison, number one. And then there's also some timing matters relating to the falling of holidays and how we and when we'd chosen to promote that'll make the first quarter promotional rate higher than we anticipate for the whole year. Although, I would say on a total year basis, we would generally expect promotional expense to be higher than last year because in general, we were not promoting in the first three quarters at normalized levels as we implemented the distributor consolidation effort. So that's basically what's going on with promotion. There's really nothing particularly strange going on there."

As to the metrics that we're looking at, certainly from the consumer point of view, we are keeping a close eye on consumer takeaway from a volume perspective. And we measure that by looking at things like IRI, like other data that we get. And certainly, depletions are representative of consumer takeaway. Sales to retail in that you generally don't expect retailers, key retailers stocking up or we don't see big fluctuations in their inventory levels. Certainly, the mix of our business is a very important measure for us to be looking at, ensuring sharing that we have a healthy mix towards our higher profit items and our higher ROIC items. We've had a big focus on driving return on invested capital. We've taken that down to a certain degree to the brand level, and therefore, we're cognizant of mix as it relates both to profitability and ROIC. And then internally, needless to say, operating profit continues to be a very important measure of our success. And that goes to what we said earlier about making sure that we're appropriately calibrating our promotional activities against our volume growth to optimize the profit picture for the company and the ROIC picture. So not a lot; it's not rocket sciencery, but those are the things that we're looking at."

I believe the highl",1569,"Thanks, Patty, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Constellation's first quarter sales and earnings results. We're up to a good start for the year with results that were generally in line with our expectations. I believe the highlight of the first quarter relates to the fact that we are beginning to realize the benefits from our consolidation of our U.S. distribution network in key markets and the implementation of our new go-to-market strategy. Remember, it was during last year's first quarter that we began to scale back promotional activities for our U.S. Wine and Spirits business in advance of the initiation of our U.S. distributor consolidation program and sales force restructuring efforts.
And we did not increase promotions to more normalized levels until the end of last year's third quarter in advance of our holiday selling season. Nonetheless, in the market, promotional activity has remained strong throughout this period, especially in the Premium Plus category. Now having completed the most significant phase of our U.S. distributor transition, during this year's first quarter, we increased promotional activities and brand investments, launched new products and begin to improve our in-store execution at retail.
Some examples of these activities include: Continuation of what we call the biggest holiday ever promotion during Easter; new product launches, including the introduction of blüfeld German riesling, Arbor Mist White Pear pinot grigio, Black Box malbec and Woodbridge sparkling wines; brand investment in SVEDKA; relaunch of Ravenswood ""No More Wimpy Wines"" campaign using digital media. And collectively, these efforts drove improved marketplace depletion growth in the mid-single-digit range for our U.S. Wine business. And as I mentioned last quarter, we are refocusing our energies toward improving depletion and consumer takeaway, and we made measurable progress towards this goal.
We expect to grow our U.S. Wine business in line with total industry growth trends and are working diligently to achieve this target as we progress through fiscal 2011. Current growth in the IRI channel remains healthy at about 5% on a dollar basis according to recent 12-week IRI data. In particular, the Super-Premium Plus segment, where wine sales for greater than $8 a bottle at retail is currently growing at double-digit rates. And within these price segments, many of our leading well-known brands continue to perform well in the marketplace, including Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Blackstone, Clos du Bois, Estancia, Toasted Head, Simi, Franciscan, Wild Horse and Kim Crawford. 
In fact, with our streamlined portfolio, our top 15 U.S. wine brands represent the vast majority of our U.S. wine profitability, and as these brands that are growing at a pace faster than the market due to our U.S. distributor consolidation effort and our renewed focus on building and promoting our brands.
During the quarter, Constellation gained international recognition. It's having some of the best and most powerful brands in the industry. The 2010 Power 100 list recognizes the world's most powerful wine and spirits brands. This year's list includes several of our brands with SVEDKA as one of the most powerful vodka brand and Black Velvet as one of the most powerful whiskey brand, Robert Mondavi and Hardy as two of the most powerful wine brands and Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy as one of the most powerful brandy brands. 
In addition, Beverage Information Group recently recognized Constellation with three Fast Track Awards for our Black Box, Kim Crawford and SVEDKA brands. In early June, Constellation participated in the inaugural Ultimate Wine Challenge in New York City, which is a professional tasting event of nearly 500 wines representing 15 countries and 43 appellations. The Chairman's trophy was awarded to the best wines in 23 different wine category. Constellation won trophies for Nobilo Sauvignon Blanc 2009, Hogue Cellars Genesis Riesling '08, Simi Cabernet Sauvignon 2006, Clos du Bois Pinot Noir 2007 and Ravenswood Napa Valley Zinfandel 2007.
Moving to our Canadian business, the accolades also continue. In early June, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which is the largest purchaser of beverage alcohol in the world, awarded Vincor Supplier of the Year across all beverage alcohol categories. In addition, they received the Best New Product Launch and Best Image Program awards for their new Open wine brand. These results indicate that our brand strength and reputation are continuing to grow in today's competitive marketplace, which validates our strategic imperative emphasizing premiumization, brand building and organic sales growth.
Now from an operating perspective, our Canadian Wine business posted positive net sales results for the quarter, primarily driven by the premium wine portfolio, including Jackson-Triggs and Inniskillin. In our Spirits business, during the first quarter, SVEDKA Vodka posted sales growth of 40% versus last year and continued to gain market share. As I mentioned earlier, SVEDKA was recognized on the 2010 Power 100 list as one of the world's most powerful spirits brands, but was also honored as the highest-rated single new category entrant and earned a 2010 Business Star Performance award. As you know, SVEDKA is the fastest-growing major U.S. spirits brand and has now become the fourth largest vodka brand in the United States.
And during the quarter, we launched SVEDKA's first national TV advertising campaign, which began airing March 1. Black Velvet also posted strong results in the first quarter, with sales increasing low-double digits. 
Now moving to our International business. The 2010 great progress in Australia is now complete, and it appears that the current harvest estimate is about 1.5 million tons, a 12% decrease from the 2009 harvest of approximately 1.7 million tons. While this harvest intake is closer to current demand, a surplus remains from prior year's oversupply. Current marketplace dynamics in the U.K. and Australia remains unchanged. Therefore, we continue to aggressively restructure our business in these markets through cost reductions, minimization of working capital investment and asset sales. Our primary goal is to generate cash, increase efficiencies and improve gross profits. The U.K. and Australian business combined represent less than 5% of our total consolidated EBIT in 2010. 
Now moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. During the first quarter, sales and operating income for the Crown joint venture continue to be impacted by economically driven challenges for the U.S. beer industry in general. These challenging trends that were pervasive throughout 2009 have continued into 2010 with major premium domestic brands losing volume and share to craft beers, sub-premiums and now, imports. And within the Import category, Crown has recently fared better than most, but I'll discuss this in greater detail in a moment.
Crown's first quarter operating income was unfavorably impacted not only by volume decline and unfavorable mix, but by the timing of marketing and promotional activity, such as programming for the Cinco de Mayo holiday, distribution of value-added coupons in select markets, World Cup Soccer advertising and the ""Win A Beach Getaway"" sweepstakes. However, the good news is that we believe these promotional activities were successful in driving positive depletion trends during the quarter. 
I'd like to provide a few examples. Crown outperformed key competitors in the U.S. beer market during two important first quarter events: Cinco de Mayo and the Memorial Day holiday. During Cinco, Crown outperformed the total Beer and Import categories in case growth, with Modelo Especial outperforming every major domestic and import brand per IRI data corresponding with this time frame. During the Memorial Day holiday, Crown not only increased case sales but grew market share in IRI channels, including food, drug and convenience and mass markets.
Crown's promotional activities and timing factors resulted in temporary inventory reductions at the wholesale level during the first quarter. Having said that, Crown is closely managing inventories at wholesale and retail to ensure seamless execution during the summer selling season. Throughout the remainder of fiscal 2011, Crown has focused on further enhancing the integration of sales and marketing efforts by optimizing promotional activity and media support during peak seasonal periods when consumers buy the most. 
Some of the activities that have been or will become visible in the marketplace include: The continued rollout of Negra Modelo and Modelo Especial draft, which now has a presence in 25 cities. The launch of Pacifico draft throughout California, the continuation of the ""Win A Beach Getaway"" summer sweepstakes program that began immediately following the Cinco de Mayo holiday and will run through the end of July. Crown is partnering with Sports Illustrated and World Cup magazine through the duration of the World Cup Soccer event. And Corona is also one of the three major beer sponsors of World Cup TV. 
Recently, Crown launched Modelo's Victoria brand in Chicago as an initial test market and rapidly sold out of its case allocation for this product. Victoria is Mexico's number two volume and oldest beer brand and was introduced at a price point premium to Corona Extra. All aspects of this test market will be tracked and measured with a recommendation for potential expansion in 2011.
Now as closing, we are beginning to reap the rewards of our focus on profitable, organic growth as we work diligently to harvest the ultimate benefit from the execution of our U.S. distributor strategy. And our strong free cash flow enables us to create value in the form of an accelerated share buyback while continuing our debt reduction efforts. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder, our CFO, for a financial discussion of our business results. Bob?"
258589,107892343,66707,"Constellation Brands Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Jul-01-2010",2010-07-01,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Given the continuing challenging economic and competitive market conditions, I'm pleased with our Q1 results, which were generally in line with our expectations. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in",1837,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Given the continuing challenging economic and competitive market conditions, I'm pleased with our Q1 results, which were generally in line with our expectations. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $0.38 a share versus $0.33 last year. Comparable EBIT came in below prior year as expected. However, we saw some encouraging trends in the quarter.
We remain focused on leveraging our new U.S. business structure, streamlined portfolio and consolidated U.S. distributor network. These efforts are progressing as our U.S. distributor initiative gained traction in the marketplace. This, combined with the increased brand investments and promotional activities outlined by Rob, has improved shipment volumes, performance at retail and depletion trends for our U.S. Wine business during the first quarter. However, the higher promotional activity impacted net sales as promotions are recorded as a reduction in the net sales line. 
This reduced North American wine sales and our operating margin. The promotion spend increase was due in part to timing. In fiscal 2010, promotion spending was lighter in Q1 and Q2 as we shifted more promotion dollars to the second half of fiscal '10 as part of our U.S. distributor consolidation effort. In Q1 fiscal '11, we increased spending for more normal levels due to our Easter holiday volume improvement program. Also, as Rob mentioned, wine industry promotion spending had increased in the premium-and-above price category, and we are staying competitive with an eye on the bottom line.  Year-over-year promotion spending comparison should improve in the second half of fiscal '11.
The quarter also saw some positive timing related to our comparable basis effective tax rate, which should reverse in the balance of the year as our effective tax rate came in at 24% versus our targeted full year rate of 35%. Before we look at our Q1 P&L performance in more detail, I wanted to highlight that we had changed our segment reporting structure. 
Our Wine business is now structured in two segments. The first segment is North America. And the second segment is Australia and Europe, with most of Europe represented by the U.K. This reporting change was driven by our strategy shift in Australia and Europe, where we have combined the infrastructures of these businesses given the symbiotic nature of these markets to better align strategy, increase efficiencies, reduce SG&A costs and improve cash generation.
We're very different businesses in these two segments, with diverging economic models and strategies. We believe segregating the reporting of these businesses should help investors better understand our overall business. 
The North American business represents the majority of our profitability and has strong financial profile. Results for New Zealand are included in North America segment as the vast majority of our wine produced in New Zealand is consumed in the U.S. and Canada, and has always been reflected within North America. New Zealand sales not consumed in North America represent about  2% of the North American segment sales. Prior-period results in our press release and our segment history schedule on our website have been restated to conform with the new segment presentation. 
Now let's look at our fiscal Q1 P&L performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated net sales decreased 1%, primarily due to the divestiture of our U.K. Cider and Value Spirits businesses, partially offset by the favorable impact of year-over-year currency rate fluctuations. On an organic constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange rate changes, net sales were even with the prior quarter.
Our commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Our consolidated wine organic net sales decreased 1%. This included a 2% decrease for North America; slight increase in volume was more than offset by the higher promotion activities in the quarter. Australia and Europe increased 1% as marketplace conditions have generally remained unchanged. Spirits organic net sales increased an impressive 28% for the quarter. Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis.
For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 34.5% versus 34.9% for the prior year. This reflects higher promotion spending in the U.S. and unfavorable foreign currency impacts related to shipments of Australian product in the U.K., partially offset by favorable Australian grape costs as the lower cost calendar 2009 harvest starts to flow through our fiscal 2011 income statement. Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $18 million and came in at 21.4% of net sales compared with 19.1% a year ago.
The percentage of sales increase reflects lower net sales as a result of the increased promotional spend combined with higher professional service costs for projects aimed at improving our systems and business operations. Much of the increased costs will remain throughout the year. Consolidated operating income decreased 17% to $103 million, and operating margin decreased 2.7 percentage points to 13.1%. 
I'd now like to turn to our segment operating results to provide highlights of our first quarter operating income change. North American segment operating income decreased $15 million to $133 million. The decrease is primarily due to the higher promotion spending. The Australia and Europe Wine segment reported an operating loss of $3 million versus a break-even result in the prior-year quarter. The grape cost benefits in Australia were offset by the strengthening of the Australian dollar, and gross profit margins in the U.K. continued to be challenged. Please note that the first quarter is the seasonally lowest profit quarter for this segment, and we do expect this segment to be profitable on a full year basis.
Corporate and other expenses totaled $26 million versus $23 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase is primarily driven by higher professional services, including costs related to Project Fusion, a multi-year program designed to strengthen our global business systems and processes. 
Equity earnings for Crown totaled $54 million versus $63 million in the prior year. For the quarter, Crown generated net sales of $622 million, a decrease of 3% and operating income of $109 million, a decrease of 14%. Sales were impacted primarily by higher promotions and unfavorable mix. Operating income for Crown was impacted by the timing of promotional and marketing investments, a contractual product cost increase and unfavorable mix.
Interest expense for the quarter was $49 million, down 29% versus last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower average interest rate during the quarter and our significant debt reduction actions during fiscal 2010. 
Let's take a look at debt. At the end of May, our debt totaled of $4 billion, which represents $182 million increase from our debt level at the end of fiscal '10. The increase primarily reflects funding our $300 million accelerated stock buyback, partially offset by $60 million in note receivable proceeds from the sale of our Value Spirits business and our free cash flow generation. I'll talk more about the stock buyback in a few moments. 
Our average interest rates for the quarter was approximately 5%. Our debt-to-comparable-basis-EBITDA ratio at the end of May was 4.4x. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 24%, which reflects the favorable outcome of tax items and compares to a 39% rate for Q1 last year. As mentioned earlier, we are still targeting a full year tax rate of 35%.
Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated free cash flow of $34 million versus a use of cash of $102 million in the prior year. The improvement reflect anticipated timing benefits for Crown distributions and interest payments. We also saw lower restructuring payments and an inventory benefit primarily related to the U.S. and Australia. CapEx came in at $26 million versus $47 million in Q1 last year due to project timing. We continue targeting free cash flow to be in the range of $350 million to $400 million for fiscal 2011. This includes CapEx in the range of $110 million to $130 million. 
While we expect to pay down debt in fiscal '11, we have redeployed a portion of free cash flow to repurchase stock as we believe our shares represent good value. In April, we entered into a $300 million accelerated stock buyback transaction. We funded this through our low-cost revolver. During the first quarter, we received 13.8 million shares of Class A common stock, which represented the minimum number of shares that will be received under the transaction.  The final number of shares we receive under the transaction will be determined at the close of the transaction period.
That provides a good point to move to our full year fiscal 2011 P&L outlook. We're increasing our comparable basis EPS guidance by $0.10 to a range of $1.63 to $1.78 per share to reflect the estimated accretion benefit of the stock buyback. We still expect interest expense to be in the range of $210 million to $220 million as rates remain below those anticipated at the beginning of the year. We're now assuming weighted average diluted shares to approximate 212 million versus our previous guidance of 224 million to reflect the estimated stock buyback benefit. 
As a reminder, Q2 fiscal 2011 will have a tough comparison versus Q2 fiscal 2010. As previously discussed in Q2 of last year, Constellation and the newly appointed distributors decided to increase distributor inventories and minimize operational disruption to ensure adequate service level for retail customers during the transition.
We estimated Q2 fiscal '10 benefited in this timing shift by approximately $40 million to $50 million in net sales and $0.05 to $0.07 of diluted EPS. As discussed earlier, Q2 fiscal '10 also reflected lower promotion costs. Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed in our news release. During Q1, we recorded a $0.02 charge for restructuring activity related to our global cost-reduction initiative and a $0.13 tax charge associated with the valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets in the U.K.
Before we take your questions, I would like to reiterate that we're on track to meet our financial goals for the year, and we continue to improve our organic business model. We're pleased with the top line results of our marketplace initiatives. Our increased brand investment in core brands, our new product launches and our progress with our distributor initiative have resulted in improved shipment and depletion volumes and market share gains on our core brands. Although Q1 Crown performance was below prior year, we're also seeing some positive top line results from Crown's branding and marketing initiatives. 
Cash flow is starting the year out on a strong note, which, in conjunction with continued low interest rates, is helping reduce the incremental interest expense of our share buyback. Our U.K. Australia business continues to be challenged, and we continue to look for ways to improve the financial returns of this business.
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

And in terms of the category where we have the largest market share, it would be the Super-Premium category, where we have approximately a 30% market share. And then Ultra Premium, we have more like a 20-some-odd percent and then above that, about a 28%. So in terms of how we index versus wine in general, we are skewed significantly towards Premium Plus and even really Super-Premium Plus than the general industry because we do not have the percentage that the industry have in the $5 and below segment, which still represents a pretty significant piece of the wine industry in general. So to the extent is that the Premium Plus and Super-Premium categories and above are growing faster than the industry, we are growing faster than the industry as well, not only due to our individual brand performance but mix as well. Now all that said, as Bob pointed out, although some of these categories like Super-Premium above $8 are now growing in the double-digit range and there's definitely, we're back to trading up in premiumization, all that has to be qualified by the fact that some of this is being driven by some fairly high promotional activity and promotional levels in the marketplace, which is not necessarily a bad thing because it's stimulating the whole category. Wine is taking share from everything, Beer and Spirits, and it's pretty robust. Did I answer your question, Tim?"

That's exclusively driven by our estimate of what accretion will be on the buyback. And in the reported guidance, there is a delta there from comparable all due to the charges, the non-comparable charges we took in the first quarter. And the big piece of that was a charge to eliminate a deferred tax asset in the U.K. And because we are kind of stressed on profitability in the U.K., it's just a probability of ever getting any value out of that asset. And with all the restructuring charges we've taken, the rules are kind of rather [ph] (47:37) shown positive GAAP earnings for the past three years, okay? The accountants get out and [ph] (47:46), they tend to say that we won't be able to utilize that deferred tax assets. So we took that charge in the first quarter, so that's the biggest piece. Regarding the other guidance factors, we really haven't changed anything. And again, you guys do this all the time. But it's the first quarter, so a trend is not quarter to make. So we're waiting to see how the balance of the year. And of course, as you know, Beer is a summer season, so the second quarter is very important to us.

I think that as we have made fairly clear, first quarter's promotional spend was a relative basis higher than we expect for the year, primarily due to a number of factors, which is in first quarter last year, we had a disproportionately low promotion because we had pulled back as we went into the distributor consolidation activity. That's impacting the comparison, number one. And then there's also some timing matters relating to the falling of holidays and how we and when we'd chosen to promote that'll make the first quarter promotional rate higher than we anticipate for the whole year. Although, I would say on a total year basis, we would generally expect promotional expense to be higher than last year because in general, we were not promoting in the first three quarters at normalized levels as we implemented the distributor consolidation effort.

And we measure that by looking at things like IRI, like other data that we get. And certainly, depletions are representative of consumer takeaway. Sales to retail in that you generally don't expect retailers, key retailers stocking up or we don't see big fluctuations in their inventory levels. Certainly, the mix of our business is a very important measure for us to be looking at, ensuring sharing that we have a healthy mix towards our higher profit items and our higher ROIC items. We've had a big focus on driving return on invested capital. We've taken that down to a certain degree to the brand level, and therefore, we're cognizant of mix as it relates both to profitability and ROIC.

And actually went to a customer-based organization, meaning that our sales organization is now organized around our customers as opposed to just purely geographically. And we have one sales organization as opposed to many sales organizations, et cetera. When we did that, we, of course, adjusted our incentive compensation systems to be aligned with what we were trying to accomplish with our wholesale customers and retail customers. And so the simple answer to your question is, that's all done. And no, there are no significant changes that need to be made at the current time, which is good because it's all up and running and in place, and I would say it's running pretty well right now. And everything's working well so we're pretty optimistic. I mean, the key task now is to drive it to ultimate success over the midterm, which I'm fairly optimistic that we'll get what we're looking for."

Our second quarter results are particularly gratifying. As we are beginning to more consistently realize the benefits from the extensive work we've done to transform our business during the last two plus years.",1675,"Thanks, Patty, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results are particularly gratifying. As we are beginning to more consistently realize the benefits from the extensive work we've done to transform our business during the last two plus years. 
We're doing what we said we would do by executing a strategy that is based on leveraging our leadership in a growing industry, taking steps to reduce debt and improve free cash flow, and most importantly strengthening the core foundation of our business model, while targeting profitable organic growth.
I'm especially pleased with our strong free cash flow results, which have essentially enabled us to fund our share repurchase efforts, while continuing to reduce debt. It also demonstrates the progress we have made from our ongoing focus in this area. And it was during the second quarter last year that we announced the initiation of one of our most strategic initiative, with the signing of multi-year agreements with select U.S. distributors, giving them the rights to sell Constellation's portfolio of wine & spirits exclusively in their respective markets. 
This is the second consecutive quarter that our U.S. Wine business benefited from increased sales volumes and depletion, as we continued to gain momentum from this initiative. However, distributor inventories also increased over last year's second quarter, and I'd like to take a minute to explain what's driving this increase. 
As I've previously indicated, our contractual arrangements with our exclusive U.S. distributors remain in effect for an average of five and a half years. Our contracts require the newly appointed distributors to purchase specified levels of product throughout this fiscal year to ensure minimal disruption during the initial transition period. This has resulted in shipments exceeding depletions in the second quarter, although distributor inventories continue to remain at average levels of two to three months. 
Now to put things into perspective relative to how Constellation is performing versus the total U.S. wine industry, I'd like you to consider the following: According to the three-month SymphonyIRI data, which corresponds to the end of our second quarter, the food and drug channel is growing approximately 4% on a volume basis. From a Consolation perspective, we are gaining market share and outperforming consumer takeaway trends in the IRI food and drug channel, posting 8% total wine growth in the second quarter. Remember, IRI only represents about 1/3 of our business, however, it is the most accurate ands up-to-date barometer of consumer takeaway. 
Collectively, consumer takeaway for the remaining 2/3 of the market is lagging the IRI food and drug channel driven by weakness in On-premise for both Constellation and the industry. Bottom line, Constellation's distributors sales to retail or what we call our depletions are growing at almost 4%, and we believe we are gaining share, overall, in the market. 
Now I would like to take a minute to review the promotional and marketing activities that we have underway that are helping to drive this underlying growth in our business. During the second quarter, new product launches included the introduction of Rex Goliath,  free range red [ph], Cadet d'Oc, a new line extension for Mouton Cadet, and the addition of Sonoma County Pinot Noir to the Simi portfolio. We continue to drive are recently introduced product rollouts of blüfeld German riesling,  Arbor Mist White Pear pinot grigio and Black Box malbec and Woodbridge sparkling wine. 
Blüfeld is already the number three in the Super-Premium German Riesling category and Black Box malbec is currently the number one premium Box malbec brand. We also received recognition for several of our well-known brands, including the highly anticipated 2007 Robert Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve, which received 295 points courses from wine spectator, that's the wine spectator, one for 2007 vintage and one for the To Kalon Vineyard. 
Woodbridge 2008 Sauvignon Blanc and 2009 Pinot Grigio were named best buys by Wine Enthusiast for the month of September and in the sneak preview of Wine Spectator's October 31 issue on Italy, Ruffino Modus 2007 received a 96 rating while Ruffino Il Ducale 2007 received a 90 rating. These are just a few of the numerous awards and accolades recently received. 
In addition to our marketplace initiatives, CWUS also progressed in efforts to improve costs and cash effectiveness during the second quarter with activities that included the completion of the sale of the Witmer Winery to the Hazlitt family of upstate New York, continued consolidation of our California warehouse system, efforts to improve costs and cash payment terms related to great contracts in California. 
As is typical at this point in the year, I'd like to provide an update regarding U.S. grape harvest which is about 40% to 50% complete at this point. Although there are divergent estimates from varying sources, relative to the expected size of this year's harvest, we are currently estimating that the 2010 U.S. industry harvest will be down 5% to 10% versus last year's harvest. The harvest is also expected to be late this year due o to relatively cool summer growing season in California. Although this year's harvest is expected to produce a very high quality output. 
Now moving to our Canadian business. Throughout the second quarter, Canada was focused on sales execution and leveraging successful brands and new markets throughout the country. SVEDKA Vodka has now been officially launched in Canada, primarily in off-premise channels.  However, on-premise promotions are currently underway in Canada's two largest cities, Toronto and Vancouver, and all of Ontario's liquor control board is now added listings to SVEDKA. 
Speaking of SVEDKA and our Spirits business. Our second quarter spirit sales results are certainly not reflective of depletion trends or underlying consumer demand for SVEDKA Vodka, which posted double-digit depletion growth to the first half of the year and strong double-digit IRI growth in the food and drug channel. We are experiencing a tough comparison versus last year when SVEDKA sales were positively affected by the U.S. distributor transition. Overall, food and drug [ph] investments are helping SVEDKA gain market share and expanded distribution at retail. 
And moving to our international businesses, current marketplace dynamics in the UK and Australia remain unchanged. Therefore, we continue to aggressively restructure our businesses in these markets through cost reductions, minimization of working capital investments and asset sales. Our primary goal is to generate cash, increase efficiencies and improve gross profits.
Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. During the second quarter, Crown's sales and operating income were impacted by disruptions related to a brewery strike at Modelo's plant in Mexico [ph]  And by hurricane Alex, which damaged transportation routes in Northern Mexico during the late June, early July timeframe. In addition, Crown experienced strong consumer demand during the busy summer selling season driven in part by the success of the Win the Beach and World Cup soccer promotions.
Collectively these issues caused inventory constraints for select packet sizes and SKUs during the second quarter. However, Crown was proactive in managing these challenges throughout the summer selling season in order to minimize disruption and ensure supply was available to support key promotions.  
By the end of the second quarter inventory shortages began to subside and Crown expects wholesaler inventories to returned to more normal levels by the end of the third quarter.  Although you see the impact of these challenges in Crown's second quarter numbers, I am pleased to report that this is the second consecutive quarter of positive depletion trends for Crown, which reflects strong demand for their portfolio of products.
In fact, during the Fourth of July holiday, Crown outperformed the top three U.S. beer suppliers by delivering the highest absolute and percentage increase in case volumes sold to retailer. And according to Symphony IRI data, coinciding with the end of our second quarter, Crown had the best performance of the top four U.S. beer suppliers in both dollar sales and case percentage growth, driven in part by the strong performance of Modelo Especial and Negra Modelo. 
Crown's performance also improved in the convenience channel during the second quarter. And earlier this week Corona Extra was named one of the Best Global Brands for 2010 by Interbrand. 
Throughout the remainder of fiscal 2011, Crown has focused on market execution and optimizing promotional and media support. For example, this is the second consecutive year that Crown will be advertising during the National Football League games using new creative for Corona Extra and Corona light. Watch for these commercials during Sunday afternoon games on CBS and Fox and Sunday night games on NBC. Crown is also featured in Corona Light as the sponsor of this year's pre-grant game show for Monday night's football on ESPN. 
Throughout the remainder of the year, you will also see the continued rollout of Negra Modelo and Modelo Especial draft through second- and third-tier cities, and additional growth is also expected through the expansion within Tier 1 markets, where Crown already has a presence in more than 25 states. 
Crown will be expanding Pacifico draft outside California after a very successful initial launch there. And during the first quarter, Crown launched Modelo's Victoria brand in Chicago as an initial test market. The introduction was successful across all target markets with demand exceeding initial forecast. Victoria is Modelo's number two brand in Mexico and was introduced at a price point premium to Corona Extra. All aspects of this test market are being tracked and measured with plans being developed for expansion in calendar 2011.
In closing, I am pleased with our second quarter results, as they reflect our diligent effort towards and focus on profitable organic growth. We've made significant progress, and we are gaining traction in many areas despite an unsettled consumer and competitive environment. We are entering one of our strongest seasonal periods, and we plan to effectively leverage the positive marketplace momentum we ready have underway for our U.S. Wine and Beer businesses, which positions us well to achieve our goals for the year. I'd now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our second quarter business results."

Good morning, everyone. I am generally pleased with our Q2 performance. Q2 reflects good progress for two of our core industries, growing at a rate better than our IRI-weighted market share and increasing the percentage of EBITDA that flows to free cash flow. Although profits came in generally as expected, they were below prior year due to a number of reasons, which we will discuss as comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $0.52 a share versus $0.54 last year. 
We saw signs of improvement in many areas, resulting from our efforts to strengthen our organic business model. Effort to leverage our streamlined portfolio and go-to market model under our new U.S. business structure and consolidated U.S. distributor network continue to progress. These efforts, combined with the increased brand investments and promotional activity outlined by Rob have contributed to improved sales and volume and mix, performance at retail and depletion trends for our U.S. Wine business during the second quarter. This is all very good news. The positive volume and mix for the U.S. wine business was somewhat offset by higher promotional activity, which unfavorably impacted net sales and operating margin.
As previously discussed, the total wine market has increased its promotional investment, especially in the more premium wines. Our plan promotion spend increase was impacted by this trend and exacerbated by the year-over-year timing. As a reminder, in fiscal 2010, promotional spending was wider in Q1 and Q2 as we shifted more promotion dollars to the second half of FY '10 as part of our U.S. distributor consolidation efforts.
Year-over-year, promotional spending comparisons should improve in the second half of fiscal 2011. As a reminder, we've previously indicated that we will be making additional investments in U.S. marketing and promotional activities this year, and the results are reflected in our net sales and market place growth trends. 
I'm especially pleased with the results of our increased focus on improving free cash flow generation. You can see evidence of this through our strong free cash flow performance during the first half of fiscal 2011. As a result, we're increasing our full-year free cash flow target range to $375 million to $425 million versus the previous range of $350 million to $400 million. This would represent an all-time high for consolations-free cash inflow. 
Now let's look at our fiscal Q2 P&L performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from the news release, consolidated reported net sales decreased 2% due to the divestiture of our U.K. Cider business. Excluding the Cider sale and impact of currency, net sales increased 2%. My commentary to the following net sales comparisons will be in a constant currency basis.
Our consolidated wine organic net sales increased 4%. This included a 4% increase for North America, which reflected favorable product mix and an increase in volume, partially offset by higher promotional cost in the quarter. Australia and Europe also increased 4%, primarily due to higher volume of lower-priced products. 
Spirits organic net sales decreased 15% for the quarter, Rob already highlighted for you the top comparisons SVEDKA faced in the quarter and the fact that SVEDKA continues to maintain strong momentum in the market place. 
Now let's look at profits on a comparable basis.  For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 36.5% versus 37.1% in the prior year. This reflects higher promotional spending in the U.S. and higher U.S. grape costs, as the higher cost calendar 2008 reduction wine harvest is flowing through our fiscal 2011 income statement. These impacts were partially offset by improved geographic mix and North American product mix. 
Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $8 million and came in at 19.1% of net sales compared with 17.8% a year ago. The percentage of sales increase reflects the absence of an insurance benefit that we received in last year's second quarter. For the back half of the year, absolute SG&A spend will remain at higher levels due to incremental marketing investments and Project Fusion expenses. The consolidated operating income decreased 11% to $151 million and operating margin decreased 1.9 percentage points to 17.4%.
I would now like to turn to our segment operating income results and provide highlights on our second quarter operating income change. North America segment operating income decreased $3 million to $181 million. Improved sales mix and volumes were more than offset by higher promotional spending and higher U.S. grape costs, which I highlighted earlier. The Australia and Europe wine segment reported an operating loss of $3 million. This is a $7 million decrease versus the prior-year quarter. The decrease was due in part to the divestiture of the U.K. Cider business. 
Grape cost benefits in Australia were offset by the strengthening of the Australian dollar and gross profit margins in the U.K. continue to be challenged. Please note that the third quarter is the seasonally highest profit quarter for the segment, and we expect this segment to be profitable on a full-year basis.
Corporate and other expenses totaled $28 million versus $19 million in the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, the increase reflects the absence of an insurance benefit received in last year's second quarter. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $65 million versus $72 million for the prior-year quarter. For the quarter, Crown generated net sales of $679 million, a decrease of 2% and operating income of $131 million, a decrease of 9%. 
Sales were impacted by lower volumes, higher promotions and unfavorable mix. Rob already highlighted for you why sales volume lagged the positive depletion results. Operating income for Crown was impacted by increased promotional investments and contractual product cost increase and lower volumes. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $50 million, down 26% versus last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower average interest rate during the quarter and our significant debt reduction actions during fiscal 2010. 
Let's take a look at our debt position. At the end of August, our debt totaled $3.8 billion, which represents $52 million decrease from our debt level at the end of fiscal '10. This decrease is impressive, as our strong free cash flow generation for this first six months of fiscal 2011, combined with the $60 million in notes receivable proceeds from the sale of our value Spirits business have more than funded our $300 million stock buyback.  Our average interest rate for the quarter was about 5%.
Our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of May was 4.3x, with our increased free cash flow guidance, we're targeting to be around the 4X range by the end of fiscal 2011. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 35% compared to a 31% rate for Q2 last year, which benefited from the favorable outcome of tax items. We're still targeting a full year rate of 35%. 
Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities, less CapEx spending. For the first half of fiscal 2011, we generated free cash flow of $263 million versus $32 million for the same period last year. This improvement reflects timing benefits for Crown distributions and reduced interest payments. We also saw lower tax and restructuring payments and an increased source of funds from the sell-through of inventories. CapEx came in at $43 million versus $65 million for the first six month of last year, mostly due to timing. 
As mentioned earlier, we're now targeting free cash flow for fiscal 2011 in the $375 million to $425 million range. This includes CapEx in the range of $110 million to $130 million. 
As previously discussed, we have redeployed a portion of our free cash flow and purchased $200 million of stock through an accelerated stock buyback transaction. During the first quarter we received 13.8 million shares of Class A common stock, which represented the minimum number of shares that will be received under the transaction. We did not receive any additional shares during Q2. 
The final number of shares to be received will be determined at the close of the transaction, which is scheduled to end no later than November 24. The total number of shares to be received is generally based on the volume-weighted average stock price over the buyback period, less the discount. Based on the run rate of our stock price, we currently expect to receive about 4 million additional shares when the transaction is completed. We still expect about $0.10 of accretion from the stock buyback transaction. 
Now let's move to our full year fiscal 2011 P&L outlook. We are maintaining our comparable basis EPS guidance of $1.63 to $1.78. We're quite happy with our year-to-date depletion trends. Our consolidated distributor base and focus on growing our core brands is paying dividends. 
In the back half of this year, we expect sales growth to moderate in the U.S. as we transition away from the distributor shipment arrangement discussed by Rob. We also expect higher cost of goods sold due to the flow-through of the higher cost OE grapes. In addition, our SG&A will remain higher than the previous year. 
We now expect interest expense to be in the range of $200 million to $210 million, as rates remain below those anticipated at the beginning of the year plus the increase in our free cash flow guidance. the weighted average diluted shares are expected to be about $213 million. Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed in our news release.
During Q2, we recorded $0.08 in charges primarily for restructuring activity related to our cost reduction initiatives. Before we take your questions, I'd like to highlight that we are on track to meet our earnings guidance and exceed our original cash flow guidance for the year. Our increased brand investments in core brands and execution of our new U.S. business structure and consolidating U.S. distributor network, have driven improved depletion volumes and generated market share gains. 
Although Q2 Crown performance was below prior year, we're also seeing positive depletion and retail results from Crown branding and marketing initiatives. Second half results for Crown, primarily the third quarter should show improvement and distributor inventories are expected to build back to more normal levels. Our free cash flow generation profile continues to improve, and we're on track to produce a record-free cash flow results for the year. With that said, we're happy to take your questions."

Our second quarter results are particularly gratifying as we are beginning to more consistently realize the benefits from the extensive work we've done to transform our business during the last two plus years.",1667,"Thanks, Patty, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results are particularly gratifying as we are beginning to more consistently realize the benefits from the extensive work we've done to transform our business during the last two plus years. 
We are doing what we said we would do by executing a strategy that is based on leveraging our leadership in a growing industry, taking steps to reduce debt and improve free cash flow, and most importantly, strengthening the core foundation of our business model, while targeting profitable organic growth.
I'm especially pleased with our strong free cash flow results, which have essentially enabled us to fund our share repurchase efforts, while continuing to reduce debt. It also demonstrates the progress we have made from our ongoing focus in this area. And it was during the second quarter last year that we announced the initiation of one of our most strategic initiatives with the signing of multi-year agreements with select U.S. distributors, giving them the rights to sell Constellation's portfolio of wine & spirits exclusively in their respective markets. 
This is the second consecutive quarter that our U.S. Wine business benefited from increased sales volumes and depletion, as we continued to gain momentum from this initiative. However, distributor inventories also increased over last year's second quarter, and I'd like to take a minute to explain what's driving this increase. 
As I've previously indicated, our contractual arrangements with our exclusive U.S. distributors remain in effect for an average of five and a half years. Our contracts require the newly appointed distributors to purchase specified levels of product throughout this fiscal year to ensure minimal disruption during the initial transition period. This has resulted in shipments exceeding depletions in the second quarter, although distributor inventories continue to remain at average levels of two to three months. 
Now to put things into perspective relative to how Constellation is performing versus the total U.S. wine industry, I'd like you to consider the following: According to the three-month SymphonyIRI data, which corresponds to the end of our second quarter, the food and drug channel is growing approximately 4% on a volume basis. From a Constellation perspective, we are gaining market share and outperforming consumer takeaway trends in the IRI food and drug channel, posting 8% total wine growth in the second quarter. Remember, IRI only represents about 1/3 of our business, however, it is the most accurate and up-to-date barometer of consumer takeaway. 
Collectively, consumer takeaway for the remaining 2/3 of the market is lagging the IRI food and drug channel driven by weakness in On-premise for both Constellation and the industry. Bottom line, Constellation's distributor sales to retailer, or what we call our depletions, are growing at almost 4%, and we believe we are gaining share overall in the market. 
Now I would like to take a minute to review the promotional and marketing activities that we have underway that are helping to drive this underlying growth in our business. During the second quarter, new product launches included the introduction of Rex Goliath,  FreeRange Red, Cadet d'Oc, a new line extension for Mouton Cadet, and the addition of Sonoma County Pinot Noir to the Simi portfolio. We continue to drive our recently introduced product rollouts of blüfeld German riesling,  Arbor Mist White Pear pinot grigio and Black Box malbec and Woodbridge sparkling wine. 
Blüfeld is already the number three in the Super-Premium German Riesling category and Black Box malbec is currently the number one premium Box Malbec brand. We also received recognition for several of our well-known brands, including the highly anticipated 2007 Robert Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve, which received two 95-point scores from Wine Spectator, that's the Wine Spectator, one for the 2007 vintage and one for the To Kalon Vineyard. 
Woodbridge 2008 Sauvignon Blanc and 2009 Pinot Grigio were named best buys by Wine Enthusiast for the month of September, and in the sneak preview of Wine Spectator's October 31 issue on Italy, Ruffino Modus 2007 received a 96 rating while Ruffino Il Ducale 2007 received a 90 rating. These are just a few of the numerous awards and accolades recently received. 
In addition to our marketplace initiatives, CWUS also progressed in efforts to improve costs and cash effectiveness during the second quarter with activities that included the completion of the sale of the Widmer Winery to the Hazlitt family of upstate New York, continued consolidation of our California warehouse system, efforts to improve costs and cash payment terms related to grape contracts in California. 
As is typical at this point in the year, I'd like to provide an update regarding U.S. grape harvest, which is about 40% to 50% complete at this point. Although there are divergent estimates from varying sources relative to the expected size of this year's harvest, we are currently estimating that the 2010 U.S. industry harvest will be down 5% to 10% versus last year's harvest. The harvest is also expected to be late this year due to relatively cool summer growing season in California, although this year's harvest is expected to produce a very high-quality output. 
Now moving to our Canadian business. Throughout the second quarter, Canada was focused on sales execution and leveraging successful brands and new markets throughout the country. SVEDKA Vodka has now been officially launched in Canada, primarily in off-premise channels.  However, on-premise promotions are currently underway in Canada's two largest cities, Toronto and Vancouver, and all of Ontario's liquor control boards have now added listings to SVEDKA. 
Speaking of SVEDKA and our Spirits business. Our second quarter Spirit sales results are certainly not reflective of depletion trends or underlying consumer demand for SVEDKA Vodka, which posted double-digit depletion growth through the first half of the year and strong double-digit IRI growth in the food and drug channel. We are experiencing a tough comparison versus last year when SVEDKA sales were positively affected by the U.S. distributor transition. Overall, prudent brand investments are helping SVEDKA gain market share and expanded distribution at retail. 
And moving to our international businesses, current marketplace dynamics in the UK and Australia remain unchanged. Therefore, we continue to aggressively restructure our businesses in these markets through cost reductions, minimization of working capital investments and asset sales. Our primary goal is to generate cash, increase efficiencies and improve gross profits.
Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. During the second quarter, Crown's sales and operating income were impacted by disruptions related to a brewery strike at Modelo's plant in Tuxtepec, Mexico, and by Hurricane Alex, which damaged transportation routes in Northern Mexico during the late-June-early-July timeframe. In addition, Crown experienced strong consumer demand during the busy summer selling season driven in part by the success of the Win the Beach and World Cup soccer promotions.
Collectively these issues caused inventory constraints for select packet sizes and SKUs during the second quarter. However, Crown was proactive in managing these challenges throughout the summer selling season in order to minimize disruption and ensure supply was available to support key promotions.  
By the end of the second quarter, inventory shortages began to subside and Crown expects wholesaler inventories to returned to more normal levels by the end of the third quarter.  Although you see the impact of these challenges in Crown's second quarter numbers, I am pleased to report that this is the second consecutive quarter of positive depletion trends for Crown, which reflects strong demand for their portfolio of products.
In fact, during the Fourth of July holiday, Crown outperformed the top three U.S. beer suppliers by delivering the highest absolute and percentage increase in case volumes sold to retail. And according to Symphony IRI data, coinciding with the end of our second quarter, Crown had the best performance of the top four U.S. beer suppliers in both dollar sales and case percentage growth, driven in part by the strong performance of Modelo Especial and Negra Modelo. 
Crown's performance also improved in the convenience channel during the second quarter. And earlier this week Corona Extra was named one of the Best Global Brands for 2010 by Interbrand. 
Throughout the remainder of fiscal 2011, Crown is focused on market execution and optimizing promotional and media support. For example, this is the second consecutive year that Crown will be advertising during the National Football League games using new creative for Corona Extra and Corona light. Watch for these commercials during Sunday afternoon games on CBS and Fox and Sunday night games on NBC. Crown is also featuring Corona Light as the sponsor of this year's pre-grant game show for Monday Night Football on ESPN. 
Throughout the remainder of the year, you will also see the continued rollout of Negra Modelo and Modelo Especial draft to second- and third-tier cities, and additional growth is also expected through the expansion within Tier 1 markets, where Crown already has a presence in more than 25 states. 
Crown will be expanding Pacifico draft outside California after a very successful initial launch there. And during the first quarter, Crown launched Modelo's Victoria brand in Chicago as an initial test market. The introduction was successful across all target markets with demand exceeding initial forecast. Victoria is Modelo's number two brand in Mexico and was introduced at a price point premium to Corona Extra. All aspects of this test market are being tracked and measured with plans being developed for expansion in calendar 2011.
In closing, I am pleased with our second quarter results, as they reflect our diligent efforts toward and focus on profitable organic growth. We've made significant progress, and we are gaining traction in many areas despite an unsettled consumer and competitive environment. We are entering one of our strongest seasonal periods, and we plan to effectively leverage the positive marketplace momentum we ready have underway for our U.S. Wine and Beer businesses, which positions us well to achieve our goals for the year. I'd now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our second quarter business results."

Good morning, everyone. I am generally pleased with our Q2 performance. Q2 reflects good progress for two of our core industries, growing at a rate better than our IRI-weighted market share and increasing the percentage of EBITDA that flows to free cash flow. Although profits came in generally as expected, they were below prior year due to a number of reasons, which we will discuss, as comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $0.52 a share versus $0.54 last year. 
We saw signs of improvement in many areas, resulting from our efforts to strengthen our organic business model. Efforts to leverage our streamlined portfolio and go-to market model under our new U.S. business structure and consolidated U.S. distributor network continue to progress. These efforts, combined with the increased brand investments and promotional activity outlined by Rob have contributed to improved sales volume and mix performance at retail and depletion trends for our U.S. Wine business during the second quarter. This is all very good news. The positive volume and mix for the U.S. wine business was somewhat offset by higher promotional activity, which unfavorably impacted net sales and operating margin.
As previously discussed, the total wine market has increased its promotional investment, especially in the more premium wines. Our planned promotion spend increase was impacted by this trend and exacerbated by the year-over-year timing. As a reminder, in fiscal 2010, promotional spending was lighter in Q1 and Q2 as we shifted more promotion dollars to the second half of FY '10 as part of our U.S. distributor consolidation effort.
Year-over-year promotional spending comparisons should improve in the second half of fiscal 2011. As a reminder, we've previously indicated that we will be making additional investments in U.S. marketing and promotional activities this year, and the results are reflected in our net sales and marketplace growth trends. 
I'm especially pleased with the results of our increased focus on improving free cash flow generation. You can see evidence of this through our strong free cash flow performance during the first half of fiscal 2011. As a result, we're increasing our full-year free cash flow target range to $375 million to $425 million versus the previous range of $350 million to $400 million. This would represent an all-time high for Constellation's free cash flow. 
Now let's look at our fiscal Q2 P&L performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from the news release, consolidated reported net sales decreased 2% due to the divestiture of our U.K. Cider business. Excluding the Cider sale and impact of currency, net sales increased 2%. My commentary to the following net sales comparisons will be in a constant currency basis.
Our consolidated wine organic net sales increased 4%. This included a 4% increase for North America, reflected favorable product mix and an increase in volume, partially offset by higher promotional costs in the quarter. Australia and Europe also increased 4%, primarily due to higher volume of lower-priced products. 
Spirits organic net sales decreased 15% for the quarter. Rob already highlighted for you the tough comparisons SVEDKA faced in the quarter and the fact that SVEDKA continues to maintain strong momentum in the marketplace. 
Now let's look at profits on a comparable basis.  For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 36.5% versus 37.1% in the prior year. This reflects higher promotional spending in the U.S. and higher U.S. grape costs, as the higher-cost calendar 2008 red wine harvest is flowing through our fiscal 2011 income statement. These impacts were partially offset by improved geographic mix and North American product mix. 
Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $8 million and came in at 19.1% of net sales compared with 17.8% a year ago. The percentage-of-sales increase reflects the absence of an insurance benefit that we received in last year's second quarter. For the back half of the year, absolute SG&A spend will remain at higher levels due to incremental marketing investments and Project Fusion expenses. The consolidated operating income decreased 11% to $151 million and operating margin decreased 1.9 percentage points to 17.4%.
I would now like to turn to our segment operating income results and provide highlights on our second quarter operating income change. North America segment operating income decreased $3 million to $181 million. Improved sales mix and volumes were more than offset by higher promotional spending and higher U.S. grape costs, which I highlighted earlier. The Australia and Europe Wine segment reported an operating loss of $3 million. This is a $7 million decrease versus the prior-year quarter. The decrease was due in part to the divestiture of the U.K. Cider business. 
Grape cost benefits in Australia were offset by the strengthening of the Australian dollar, and gross profit margins in the U.K. continue to be challenged. Please note that the third quarter is the seasonally highest profit quarter for the segment, and we expect this segment to be profitable on a full-year basis.
Corporate and other expenses totaled $28 million versus $19 million in the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, the increase reflects the absence of an insurance benefit received in last year's second quarter. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $65 million versus $72 million from the prior-year quarter. For the quarter, Crown generated net sales of $679 million, a decrease of 2%, and operating income of $131 million, a decrease of 9%. 
Sales were impacted by lower volumes, higher promotions and unfavorable mix. Rob already highlighted for you why sales volume lagged the positive depletion results. Operating income for Crown was impacted by increased promotional investments and contractual product cost increase and lower volumes. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $50 million, down 26% versus last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower average interest rate during the quarter and our significant debt reduction actions during fiscal 2010. 
Let's take a look at our debt position. At the end of August, our debt totaled $3.8 billion, which represents a $52 million decrease from our debt level at the end of fiscal '10. This decrease is impressive, as our strong free cash flow generation for this first six months of fiscal 2011, combined with the $60 million in notes receivable proceeds from the sale of our Value Spirits business, have more than funded our $300 million stock buyback.  Our average interest rate for the quarter was about 5%.
Our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of May was 4.3x. With our increased free cash flow guidance we are targeting to be around the 4X range by the end of fiscal 2011. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 35% compared to a 31% rate for Q2 last year, which benefited from the favorable outcome of tax items. We're still targeting a full year rate of 35%. 
Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities, less CapEx spend. For the first half of fiscal 2011, we generated free cash flow of $263 million versus $32 million for the same period last year. This improvement reflects timing benefits for Crown distributions and reduced interest payments. We also saw lower tax and restructuring payments and an increased source of funds from the sell-through of inventory. CapEx came in at $43 million versus $65 million for the first six months of last year, mostly due to timing. 
As mentioned earlier, we're now targeting free cash flow for fiscal 2011 in the $375 million to $425 million range. This includes CapEx in the range of $110 million to $130 million. 
As previously discussed, we have redeployed a portion of our free cash flow to purchase $300 million of stock through an accelerated stock buyback transaction. During the first quarter, we received 13.8 million shares of Class A common stock, which represented the minimum number of shares that will be received under the transaction. We did not receive any additional shares during Q2. 
The final number of shares to be received will be determined at the close of the transaction, which is scheduled to end no later than November 24. The total number of shares to be received is generally based on the volume-weighted average of our stock price over the buyback period, less a discount. Based on the run rate of our stock price, we currently expect to receive about 4 million additional shares when the transaction's completed. We still expect about $0.10 of accretion from the stock buyback transaction. 
Now let's move to our full year fiscal 2011 P&L outlook. We are maintaining our comparable basis EPS guidance of $1.63 to $1.78. We're quite happy with our year-to-date depletion trends. Our consolidated distributor base and focus on growing our core brands is paying dividends. 
In the back half of this year, we expect sales growth to moderate in the U.S. as we transition away from the distributor shipment arrangements discussed by Rob. We also expect higher cost of goods sold due to the flow-through of the higher-cost '08 grapes. In addition, our SG&A will remain higher than the previous year. 
We now expect interest expense to be in the range of $200 million to $210 million, as rates remain below those anticipated at the beginning of the year plus the increase in our free cash flow guidance. Weighted average diluted shares are expected to be about $213 million. Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed in our news release.
During Q2, we recorded $0.08 in charges primarily for restructuring activity related to our cost reduction initiatives. Before we take your questions, I'd like to highlight that we are on track to meet our earnings guidance and exceed our original cash flow guidance for the year. Our increased brand investments on core brands and execution of our new U.S. business structure and consolidated U.S. distributor network, have driven improved depletion volumes and generated market share gain. 
Although Q2 Crown performance was below prior year, we are also seeing positive depletion and retail results from Crown branding and marketing initiatives. Second half results for Crown, primarily the third quarter, should show improvement as distributor inventories are expected to build back to more normal levels. Our free cash flow generation profile continues to improve, and we're on track to produce a record free cash flow result for the year. With that said, we're happy to take your questions."

And then when you get into the more premium categories like Super Premium and Luxury, we're seeing pretty strong double-digit growth."

Our second quarter results are particularly gratifying as we are beginning to more consistently realize the benefits from the extensive work we've done to transform our business during the last two plus years.",1667,"Thanks, Patty, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results are particularly gratifying as we are beginning to more consistently realize the benefits from the extensive work we've done to transform our business during the last two plus years. 
We are doing what we said we would do by executing a strategy that is based on leveraging our leadership in a growing industry, taking steps to reduce debt and improve free cash flow, and most importantly, strengthening the core foundation of our business model, while targeting profitable organic growth.
I'm especially pleased with our strong free cash flow results, which have essentially enabled us to fund our share repurchase efforts, while continuing to reduce debt. It also demonstrates the progress we have made from our ongoing focus in this area. And it was during the second quarter last year that we announced the initiation of one of our most strategic initiatives with the signing of multi-year agreements with select U.S. distributors, giving them the rights to sell Constellation's portfolio of wine & spirits exclusively in their respective markets. 
This is the second consecutive quarter that our U.S. Wine business benefited from increased sales volumes and depletion, as we continued to gain momentum from this initiative. However, distributor inventories also increased over last year's second quarter, and I'd like to take a minute to explain what's driving this increase. 
As I've previously indicated, our contractual arrangements with our exclusive U.S. distributors remain in effect for an average of five and a half years. Our contracts require the newly appointed distributors to purchase specified levels of product throughout this fiscal year to ensure minimal disruption during the initial transition period. This has resulted in shipments exceeding depletions in the second quarter, although distributor inventories continue to remain at average levels of two to three months. 
Now to put things into perspective relative to how Constellation is performing versus the total U.S. wine industry, I'd like you to consider the following: According to the three-month SymphonyIRI data, which corresponds to the end of our second quarter, the food and drug channel is growing approximately 4% on a volume basis. From a Constellation perspective, we are gaining market share and outperforming consumer takeaway trends in the IRI food and drug channel, posting 8% total wine growth in the second quarter. Remember, IRI only represents about 1/3 of our business, however, it is the most accurate and up-to-date barometer of consumer takeaway. 
Collectively, consumer takeaway for the remaining 2/3 of the market is lagging the IRI food and drug channel driven by weakness in On-premise for both Constellation and the industry. Bottom line, Constellation's distributor sales to retailer, or what we call our depletions, are growing at almost 4%, and we believe we are gaining share overall in the market. 
Now I would like to take a minute to review the promotional and marketing activities that we have underway that are helping to drive this underlying growth in our business. During the second quarter, new product launches included the introduction of Rex Goliath,  FreeRange Red, Cadet d'Oc, a new line extension for Mouton Cadet, and the addition of Sonoma County Pinot Noir to the Simi portfolio. We continue to drive our recently introduced product rollouts of blüfeld German riesling,  Arbor Mist White Pear pinot grigio and Black Box malbec and Woodbridge sparkling wine. 
Blüfeld is already the number three in the Super-Premium German Riesling category and Black Box malbec is currently the number one premium Box Malbec brand. We also received recognition for several of our well-known brands, including the highly anticipated 2007 Robert Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve, which received two 95-point scores from Wine Spectator, that's the Wine Spectator, one for the 2007 vintage and one for the To Kalon Vineyard. 
Woodbridge 2008 Sauvignon Blanc and 2009 Pinot Grigio were named best buys by Wine Enthusiast for the month of September, and in the sneak preview of Wine Spectator's October 31 issue on Italy, Ruffino Modus 2007 received a 96 rating while Ruffino Il Ducale 2007 received a 90 rating. These are just a few of the numerous awards and accolades recently received. 
In addition to our marketplace initiatives, CWUS also progressed in efforts to improve costs and cash effectiveness during the second quarter with activities that included the completion of the sale of the Widmer Winery to the Hazlitt family of upstate New York, continued consolidation of our California warehouse system, efforts to improve costs and cash payment terms related to grape contracts in California. 
As is typical at this point in the year, I'd like to provide an update regarding U.S. grape harvest, which is about 40% to 50% complete at this point. Although there are divergent estimates from varying sources relative to the expected size of this year's harvest, we are currently estimating that the 2010 U.S. industry harvest will be down 5% to 10% versus last year's harvest. The harvest is also expected to be late this year due to relatively cool summer growing season in California, although this year's harvest is expected to produce a very high-quality output. 
Now moving to our Canadian business. Throughout the second quarter, Canada was focused on sales execution and leveraging successful brands and new markets throughout the country. SVEDKA Vodka has now been officially launched in Canada, primarily in off-premise channels.  However, on-premise promotions are currently underway in Canada's two largest cities, Toronto and Vancouver, and all of Ontario's liquor control boards have now added listings to SVEDKA. 
Speaking of SVEDKA and our Spirits business. Our second quarter Spirit sales results are certainly not reflective of depletion trends or underlying consumer demand for SVEDKA Vodka, which posted double-digit depletion growth through the first half of the year and strong double-digit IRI growth in the food and drug channel. We are experiencing a tough comparison versus last year when SVEDKA sales were positively affected by the U.S. distributor transition. Overall, prudent brand investments are helping SVEDKA gain market share and expanded distribution at retail. 
And moving to our international businesses, current marketplace dynamics in the UK and Australia remain unchanged. Therefore, we continue to aggressively restructure our businesses in these markets through cost reductions, minimization of working capital investments and asset sales. Our primary goal is to generate cash, increase efficiencies and improve gross profits.
Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. During the second quarter, Crown's sales and operating income were impacted by disruptions related to a brewery strike at Modelo's plant in Tuxtepec, Mexico, and by Hurricane Alex, which damaged transportation routes in Northern Mexico during the late-June-early-July timeframe. In addition, Crown experienced strong consumer demand during the busy summer selling season driven in part by the success of the Win the Beach and World Cup soccer promotions.
Collectively these issues caused inventory constraints for select packet sizes and SKUs during the second quarter. However, Crown was proactive in managing these challenges throughout the summer selling season in order to minimize disruption and ensure supply was available to support key promotions.  
By the end of the second quarter, inventory shortages began to subside and Crown expects wholesaler inventories to returned to more normal levels by the end of the third quarter.  Although you see the impact of these challenges in Crown's second quarter numbers, I am pleased to report that this is the second consecutive quarter of positive depletion trends for Crown, which reflects strong demand for their portfolio of products.
In fact, during the Fourth of July holiday, Crown outperformed the top three U.S. beer suppliers by delivering the highest absolute and percentage increase in case volumes sold to retail. And according to Symphony IRI data, coinciding with the end of our second quarter, Crown had the best performance of the top four U.S. beer suppliers in both dollar sales and case percentage growth, driven in part by the strong performance of Modelo Especial and Negra Modelo. 
Crown's performance also improved in the convenience channel during the second quarter. And earlier this week Corona Extra was named one of the Best Global Brands for 2010 by Interbrand. 
Throughout the remainder of fiscal 2011, Crown is focused on market execution and optimizing promotional and media support. For example, this is the second consecutive year that Crown will be advertising during the National Football League games using new creative for Corona Extra and Corona light. Watch for these commercials during Sunday afternoon games on CBS and Fox and Sunday night games on NBC. Crown is also featuring Corona Light as the sponsor of this year's pre-grant game show for Monday Night Football on ESPN. 
Throughout the remainder of the year, you will also see the continued rollout of Negra Modelo and Modelo Especial draft to second- and third-tier cities, and additional growth is also expected through the expansion within Tier 1 markets, where Crown already has a presence in more than 25 states. 
Crown will be expanding Pacifico draft outside California after a very successful initial launch there. And during the first quarter, Crown launched Modelo's Victoria brand in Chicago as an initial test market. The introduction was successful across all target markets with demand exceeding initial forecast. Victoria is Modelo's number two brand in Mexico and was introduced at a price point premium to Corona Extra. All aspects of this test market are being tracked and measured with plans being developed for expansion in calendar 2011.
In closing, I am pleased with our second quarter results, as they reflect our diligent efforts toward and focus on profitable organic growth. We've made significant progress, and we are gaining traction in many areas despite an unsettled consumer and competitive environment. We are entering one of our strongest seasonal periods, and we plan to effectively leverage the positive marketplace momentum we ready have underway for our U.S. Wine and Beer businesses, which positions us well to achieve our goals for the year. I'd now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our second quarter business results."

Good morning, everyone. I am generally pleased with our Q2 performance. Q2 reflects good progress for two of our core industries, growing at a rate better than our IRI-weighted market share and increasing the percentage of EBITDA that flows to free cash flow. Although profits came in generally as expected, they were below prior year due to a number of reasons, which we will discuss, as comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $0.52 a share versus $0.54 last year. 
We saw signs of improvement in many areas, resulting from our efforts to strengthen our organic business model. Efforts to leverage our streamlined portfolio and go-to market model under our new U.S. business structure and consolidated U.S. distributor network continue to progress. These efforts, combined with the increased brand investments and promotional activity outlined by Rob have contributed to improved sales volume and mix performance at retail and depletion trends for our U.S. Wine business during the second quarter. This is all very good news. The positive volume and mix for the U.S. wine business was somewhat offset by higher promotional activity, which unfavorably impacted net sales and operating margin.
As previously discussed, the total wine market has increased its promotional investment, especially in the more premium wines. Our planned promotion spend increase was impacted by this trend and exacerbated by the year-over-year timing. As a reminder, in fiscal 2010, promotional spending was lighter in Q1 and Q2 as we shifted more promotion dollars to the second half of FY '10 as part of our U.S. distributor consolidation effort.
Year-over-year promotional spending comparisons should improve in the second half of fiscal 2011. As a reminder, we've previously indicated that we will be making additional investments in U.S. marketing and promotional activities this year, and the results are reflected in our net sales and marketplace growth trends. 
I'm especially pleased with the results of our increased focus on improving free cash flow generation. You can see evidence of this through our strong free cash flow performance during the first half of fiscal 2011. As a result, we're increasing our full-year free cash flow target range to $375 million to $425 million versus the previous range of $350 million to $400 million. This would represent an all-time high for Constellation's free cash flow. 
Now let's look at our fiscal Q2 P&L performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from the news release, consolidated reported net sales decreased 2% due to the divestiture of our U.K. Cider business. Excluding the Cider sale and impact of currency, net sales increased 2%. My commentary to the following net sales comparisons will be in a constant currency basis.
Our consolidated wine organic net sales increased 4%. This included a 4% increase for North America, reflected favorable product mix and an increase in volume, partially offset by higher promotional costs in the quarter. Australia and Europe also increased 4%, primarily due to higher volume of lower-priced products. 
Spirits organic net sales decreased 15% for the quarter. Rob already highlighted for you the tough comparisons SVEDKA faced in the quarter and the fact that SVEDKA continues to maintain strong momentum in the marketplace. 
Now let's look at profits on a comparable basis.  For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 36.5% versus 37.1% in the prior year. This reflects higher promotional spending in the U.S. and higher U.S. grape costs, as the higher-cost calendar 2008 red wine harvest is flowing through our fiscal 2011 income statement. These impacts were partially offset by improved geographic mix and North American product mix. 
Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $8 million and came in at 19.1% of net sales compared with 17.8% a year ago. The percentage-of-sales increase reflects the absence of an insurance benefit that we received in last year's second quarter. For the back half of the year, absolute SG&A spend will remain at higher levels due to incremental marketing investments and Project Fusion expenses. The consolidated operating income decreased 11% to $151 million and operating margin decreased 1.9 percentage points to 17.4%.
I would now like to turn to our segment operating income results and provide highlights on our second quarter operating income change. North America segment operating income decreased $3 million to $181 million. Improved sales mix and volumes were more than offset by higher promotional spending and higher U.S. grape costs, which I highlighted earlier. The Australia and Europe Wine segment reported an operating loss of $3 million. This is a $7 million decrease versus the prior-year quarter. The decrease was due in part to the divestiture of the U.K. Cider business. 
Grape cost benefits in Australia were offset by the strengthening of the Australian dollar, and gross profit margins in the U.K. continue to be challenged. Please note that the third quarter is the seasonally highest profit quarter for the segment, and we expect this segment to be profitable on a full-year basis.
Corporate and other expenses totaled $28 million versus $19 million in the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, the increase reflects the absence of an insurance benefit received in last year's second quarter. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $65 million versus $72 million from the prior-year quarter. For the quarter, Crown generated net sales of $679 million, a decrease of 2%, and operating income of $131 million, a decrease of 9%. 
Sales were impacted by lower volumes, higher promotions and unfavorable mix. Rob already highlighted for you why sales volume lagged the positive depletion results. Operating income for Crown was impacted by increased promotional investments and contractual product cost increase and lower volumes. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $50 million, down 26% versus last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower average interest rate during the quarter and our significant debt reduction actions during fiscal 2010. 
Let's take a look at our debt position. At the end of August, our debt totaled $3.8 billion, which represents a $52 million decrease from our debt level at the end of fiscal '10. This decrease is impressive, as our strong free cash flow generation for this first six months of fiscal 2011, combined with the $60 million in notes receivable proceeds from the sale of our Value Spirits business, have more than funded our $300 million stock buyback.  Our average interest rate for the quarter was about 5%.
Our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of May was 4.3x. With our increased free cash flow guidance we are targeting to be around the 4X range by the end of fiscal 2011. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 35% compared to a 31% rate for Q2 last year, which benefited from the favorable outcome of tax items. We're still targeting a full year rate of 35%. 
Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities, less CapEx spend. For the first half of fiscal 2011, we generated free cash flow of $263 million versus $32 million for the same period last year. This improvement reflects timing benefits for Crown distributions and reduced interest payments. We also saw lower tax and restructuring payments and an increased source of funds from the sell-through of inventory. CapEx came in at $43 million versus $65 million for the first six months of last year, mostly due to timing. 
As mentioned earlier, we're now targeting free cash flow for fiscal 2011 in the $375 million to $425 million range. This includes CapEx in the range of $110 million to $130 million. 
As previously discussed, we have redeployed a portion of our free cash flow to purchase $300 million of stock through an accelerated stock buyback transaction. During the first quarter, we received 13.8 million shares of Class A common stock, which represented the minimum number of shares that will be received under the transaction. We did not receive any additional shares during Q2. 
The final number of shares to be received will be determined at the close of the transaction, which is scheduled to end no later than November 24. The total number of shares to be received is generally based on the volume-weighted average of our stock price over the buyback period, less a discount. Based on the run rate of our stock price, we currently expect to receive about 4 million additional shares when the transaction's completed. We still expect about $0.10 of accretion from the stock buyback transaction. 
Now let's move to our full year fiscal 2011 P&L outlook. We are maintaining our comparable basis EPS guidance of $1.63 to $1.78. We're quite happy with our year-to-date depletion trends. Our consolidated distributor base and focus on growing our core brands is paying dividends. 
In the back half of this year, we expect sales growth to moderate in the U.S. as we transition away from the distributor shipment arrangements discussed by Rob. We also expect higher cost of goods sold due to the flow-through of the higher-cost '08 grapes. In addition, our SG&A will remain higher than the previous year. 
We now expect interest expense to be in the range of $200 million to $210 million, as rates remain below those anticipated at the beginning of the year plus the increase in our free cash flow guidance. Weighted average diluted shares are expected to be about $213 million. Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed in our news release.
During Q2, we recorded $0.08 in charges primarily for restructuring activity related to our cost reduction initiatives. Before we take your questions, I'd like to highlight that we are on track to meet our earnings guidance and exceed our original cash flow guidance for the year. Our increased brand investments on core brands and execution of our new U.S. business structure and consolidated U.S. distributor network, have driven improved depletion volumes and generated market share gain. 
Although Q2 Crown performance was below prior year, we are also seeing positive depletion and retail results from Crown branding and marketing initiatives. Second half results for Crown, primarily the third quarter, should show improvement as distributor inventories are expected to build back to more normal levels. Our free cash flow generation profile continues to improve, and we're on track to produce a record free cash flow result for the year. With that said, we're happy to take your questions."
