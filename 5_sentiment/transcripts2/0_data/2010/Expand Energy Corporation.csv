We hope you've had time to review Tuesday's operational release and yesterday's financial release. On the operational side, our production for the fourth quarter hit a new quarterly record with a daily average of 2.618 b",1172,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. We hope you've had time to review Tuesday's operational release and yesterday's financial release. On the operational side, our production for the fourth quarter hit a new quarterly record with a daily average of 2.618 bcfe. In addition, our production for the year hit a new annual record with a daily average of 2.481 bcfe. These are increases of 13% and 8% over the year-ago period. Because of the strength of this production performance and our anticipated ongoing drilling success, we've also increased our 2010 and '11 production forecast for the second time in six weeks.With the current gains coming from our oil and natural gas liquids plays, particularly the Granite Wash, we are now anticipating a 50% increase in our liquids production over the next two years. For all of our production, we are now projecting 8% to 10% growth in 2010 and 15% to 17% growth in 2011. These are, of course, net of property divestitures.CHK's proved reserve growth in 2009 was even more impressive. Proved reserves rose from 12.1 tcfe at the beginning of the year to 15.5 tcfe at year end, using 10-year strip pricing and to 14.3 tcfe using SEC pricing assumptions. This time one year ago, we had forecasted CHK's proved reserves would reach 14 tcfe by year-end '09 and 16 tcfe by year-end 2010. It looks like today, we will equally exceed our year-end 2010 goal of 16 tcfe, and that we're well on our way to producing 3.5 to 3.7 bcfe per day by year-end 2012, and owning 20 to 22 tcfe of proved reserves by that date and maintaining unproved reserves on a risked basis well over 100 tcfe.To back test our ability to reach these goals over the next three years, I'll remind you that for 2009, we had a 3.4 tcfe of proved reserves using 10-year strip pricing and 2.2 tcfe of proved reserves using SEC pricing. So compounding that over the next three years would add seven to ten tcfe in proved reserves. So we feel very comfortable projecting only a six to eight tcfe increase over the next three years.Although I use the word only to describe our increase of six to eight tcfe over next three years, you might note that if that were a stand-alone company, it would be a top 10 U.S. gas producer that we will form inside of Chesapeake in just the next three years. We believe that we'll add a reserve value that should translate into per share value growth of at least $25 to $30 per share.We continue to execute the nation's most active drilling program, both overall and in the Barnett, Haynesville, Marcellus and Granite Wash plays specifically. As for new plays, I would highlight that we will now be referring to our shale plays as the Big 6 rather than the Big 4, given the emerging Bossier Shale play in Louisiana and given our newly acquired leasehold in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas.In the Bossier, we had 180,000 net acres. And in the Eagle Ford, we are now up to 150,000 net acres and hope to have 300,000 to 400,000 net acres before it's all said and done. In addition, our liquids production is set to begin expanding rapidly due to the success we have established in six large, new, unconventional oil plays. Collectively, in these six, we owned almost 600,000 net acres. Expect to add 400,000 more net acres in the year ahead. We are the leader in each play technologically, and also we own more acreage than any competitor in each play. In addition, we have completed wells in each play that have produced more than 500 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a multi-day basis in each play.If we are correct about these plays' potential, we believe Chesapeake will have 3,000 to 5,000 oil wells to drill, with an estimated per-well average ultimate reserve recovery of 300,000 to 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent each. That means these six new plays that are primarily oil contain approximately 1 billion to 2.5 billion barrels of oil recoverable net to Chesapeake. Our horizontal drilling expertise and our unconventional geological target identification skills are second to none in the industry, have been perfected over the past 20 years, and will increasingly allow us to separate ourselves from the industry pack in the years ahead.I might also note that our Reservoir Technology Center continues to provide significant technological advantages since opening the RTC in April 2007. We have processed almost 23,000 feet of core. Moreover, during the past three years, the RTC has analyzed as many feet of core samples as the two largest commercial facilities that are available to our competitors did on a combined basis.Please keep in mind these six oil plays do not even include the Granite Wash play at the Anadarko Basin, a very oily area in which our industry-leading acreage position is now 190,000 net acres. In this play, we are producing 200 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. We have 1.1 tcfe of proved reserves. We have 3.1 tcfe of risked unproved reserves. We have 4.4 tcfe of unrisked unproved reserves. We've completed 137 horizontal wells, and have developed and delivered average gross reserves of approximately 900,000 barrels of oil equivalent per operated well.In the Granite Wash, we believe we have 900 more risked net wells to drill, and with average growth reserves of approximately 900,000 barrels of oil equivalent possible. That is another 650 million barrels of oil equivalent of potential liquids risked reserves at [ph] Chesapeake.In addition, these calculations do not include our emerging position in the liquids-rich portion of the Eagle Ford Shale play, a play in which we now how 150,000 net acres and expect to achieve a final level of 300,000 to 400,000 net acres. We are just beginning production from our first well and have recently set pipe on our second well. We will begin ramping up our drilling activity in this area in the coming months and years.Finally, we do wish to point out the fact that we believe was overlooked this week following Anadarko's impressive deal with Mitsui in the Northeastern Pennsylvanian part of the Marcellus play. In the area, where Anadarko sold 100,000 of its 300,000 net acres to Mitsui for 14,000 per net acres, Chesapeake owned approximately 370,000 net acres of leasehold. That is of at least equivalent value to what Anadarko sold. This would put a value of $8 per share just for our acreage in the Anadarko area and Northeastern PA. And of course, this is less than one-third of our total Marcellus holdings.In closing, we hope that all this information helps highlight for you the remarkable asset and base that Chesapeake has assembled over the past five years. We believe it will form the foundation of industry-leading shareholder value creation in 2010 and for many years to come. This completes my commentary, and I'll now turn the call over to Marc Rowland."

I've seen a comment or two expressing surprise at the charge given year-end pricing. Of course, year-end pricing as of 12/31/09 is no longer the rules. The SEC has invoked a number of changes effective as of that date governing reserve bookings. One of those was with regard to the use of pricing. We are now required to use the average prices of the first day of each of the trailing 12 months preceding the measurement date. This resulted in a NYMEX gas price of only $3.87 and wellhead realization price of just over $3 for Chesapeake. I would note that we have not booked any goodwill in any of our acquisitions as compared to many of our peers, who have substantial amounts of goodwill booked and remaining on their books today.  Goodwill reduces the pool of costs against which the ceiling test is measured and likely would've eliminated any such charge for us during the year. Another factor in taking this charge as compared to 03/31/09, which was the date of our last charge and when we last faced an impairment charge, was to reduce the level of qualifying cash flow hedges we have in place as of 12/31. All of which from an accounting perspective can and do reduce any charge to the extent that the Hedges are in the money.I hope you will take time to review our updated valuation analysis in the first part of our investors slide shown on our website. You will see that the value estimates for each of our plays are conservatively estimated relative to multiple actual transactions in the industry, including the recent Anadarko sale to Mitsui that Aubrey just mentioned, our sale of our net assets to Total and of course, the XTO sale to Exxon. This analysis indicates that CHK today trades at a 60% to 75% discount to our actual net asset value, a discount that's frankly inexplicable to us and one which we will work hard to eliminate this year.Looking into 2010, we are continuing to successfully execute on our announced strategy. I'll note that the $2.25 billion joint venture was closed in January with Total in the Barnett, whereby CHK received $800 million in cash and will receive $1.45 billion in drilling carriers. Further, we executed on a $180 million VPP [volumetric production payment] in February. We have several asset sale transactions in the works in West Texas, East Texas and the Appalachian Basin that are likely to be Q2 events for Chesapeake. Also we are beginning to work on our seventh VPP transaction and find the interest levels very active and high in this area.Lastly, but importantly, I want to call your attention to our press release announcing the registration statement filed on Form S-1 for Chesapeake Midstream Partners, L.P. earlier this week. We believe at Chesapeake Energy that there will be ample opportunities to achieve liquidity for CHK in the future, which could fund most if not all of our future CapEx midstream gathering costs in the Fayetteville, Haynesville and ultimately, the Marcellus and other shales that we're now pursuing. Moderator, I'd like to turn it over to the question-and-answer session, please."

And they're all west of the Mississippi in areas where we either have traditional operations, conventional operations, or perhaps some new areas as well. And some of these areas that we're in are plays that have been talked about. We've even mentioned, for example, the Cleveland horizontal play in the Anadarko Basin as one of those, where we've carved out a big position. So we're not ready to talk a whole lot more about them because, as I mentioned in my comments, we're only about 60% of the way done in terms of where we want to end up leasing. But I do want to emphasize that the biggest oil play of all right now that we have is the Granite Wash's.

But we are dealing with big ranches where once you have negotiated surface rights agreements, it's actually, probably easier to get infrastructure built rather than more difficult. So right now, we're taking a wait and see. We don't even have our first well fully tested yet. But the play looks promising to us. And we passed on the kind of the original part of the play where Petrohawk, Cadbury [ph] discovery and other companies were drilling up to the Northeast, because it was our view that we didn't need more gas when we investigated further and of course, realized there was a significant combo play and an oil play, we jumped in, and I think we've had a great deal of success in the oilier part of the play. So as you probably are aware, we can get geared up pretty fast to address a play. And so we'll see how we go here in the first part of 2010. But I would expect there would be a pretty rapid ramp up here, as well as in our other oil plays. And what will happen over time here, is as we reach the level where the vast majority of our Haynesville, Fayetteville, Barnett acreage its HBP, we will begin ramping down activity in those areas and allocating those rigs to the oilier areas. For example, for the last couple of years, we've drilled with 20 rigs in the Fayetteville will be, basically 100% HBP there by the end of 2010, and we will cut our rig count in half. And I should think that's something that the rest of the industry will do as well. You see a lot of drilling today that may be to investors and analysts doesn't seem supported by pricing, and that's probably true. But there's a secondary driver in that activity, and that's to get that acreage's HBP. But except for the Marcellus, all of that HBP in activity will happen here in the next 12 to 24 months."

I mean, If you just look at the curve, you've got basically a $14 to $15 mcf equivalent oil curve out there, and you got a little less than half of that on the gas side. So clearly every producer in America has got to be looking at how they can increase their oil production. It won't matter with regard to world oil balances, so success in finding oil in the United States is not going to affect negatively oil prices. Whereas on the other hand, obviously, when you find more gas, it has the potential of negatively affecting gas prices. So sometimes, producers are accused of not being rational. We think we're a lot more rational than people give us credit for, and we're responding to price signals. With regard to the ability to see price convergence, I hope in my career we are able to see that. I think it would through an uplift of gas prices rather than the downdraft in oil prices. And whether it be gas to liquids or whether it be a big increase in the transportation sector's demand for natural gas, either directly through CNG or indirectly through additional electricity. That is obviously, the Holy Grail for our industry is to have gas achieve oil pricing parity in the U.S. Around the world, as we talk to our partners at Statoil and Total and BP and other people, and talk to them about how they see world LNG balances, I think there is an emerging view that beyond 2012 and '13, we're likely to get back into a scenario, world gas prices approach, world oil prices and will likely to be short world gas on a worldwide basis. One thing I think we've learned so far in the past year, is that the world is not going to be a wash in shale gas in the next five to 10 years. That is a proposition. The success of that proposition, I think, is unique to North America and will be many, many years before it has any impact on worldwide gas balances."

I think we'll approach that question, maybe two ways. One, is when you say sub-$5 gas prices, I assume you're referring to NYMEX prices. And when you include basis differentials, as well as gathering and compression, $5 NYMEX really means about $3.5",290,"Sure. I think we'll approach that question, maybe two ways. One, is when you say sub-$5 gas prices, I assume you're referring to NYMEX prices. And when you include basis differentials, as well as gathering and compression, $5 NYMEX really means about $3.50 at the wellhead. And despite the success that many of us have had in developing shale reserves, I think $3.50 gas at the wellhead does not create enough cash flow in the industry to maintain even today's drilling pace. And so, I think $5 gas is not a sustainable gas price for even the best shale plays. With regard to the unconventional or the rather the conventional stack, it's still our view that gas prices will be set by the gas price required to incentivize another couple of hundred rigs to go back to work in somewhat conventional plays, and we stand by our conclusion on that, that we've set forth over the last year. So that we think that number is somewhere between $6 and $8, and have seen nothing in our own company or in the industry to persuade us that we're wrong. I would note that based on what we've seen so far in the industry is production performance in the fourth quarter, there are more companies that are showing sequential production declines and increases. And so, we think the 914 data will likely begin to reflect what we're beginning to see in company data. And of course, keep in mind that the 50% of production that we all see through public company reports is the best 50% of the gas production in the U.S, and you're not seeing the worst 50%. And we think that's probably and fairly substantial decline at this point."

So I won't talk about it from the midstream side of the entity to this file. I'll just kind of reiterate from the Chesapeake's side. The Chesapeake Energy strategy for sometime, going back to the announcement of the formation of this joint venture with Global Infrastructure Partners back in September, has been a growth-oriented story, with Chesapeake inside of the entity not filing, developing the Fayetteville, the Haynesville, the Marcellus and some other assets on what is a very big and capital-intensive program. We're spending a lot of money that ultimately needs to be recouped, either through the sale of assets to a venture such as Chesapeake midstream or to a third party or some other formation of a capital raise. There are many avenues attractive to us, and these types of assets are easily financeable, either through issuance of notes or equity-type ventures. So I think it's pretty clear that Chesapeake's growth in the shale plays demands a lot of greenfield midstream-gathering type assets that we have been budgeting for, and you see it on our cash flow, that Jeff and others have prepared for our kind of overview of what we're spending in 2010, '11, and that will continue into the '12, '13, '14 trade as well. So I think it's pretty clear what our strategy is from a Chesapeake Energy standpoint, and the filing of this registration statements is just one avenue that we're pursuing."

I think there's really three things that I think about a VPP and why we might use that versus an asset sale. One is the lengthy nature of some of our conventional production when sold to a traditional buyer after eight or 10 years of production, really you're getting zero value from the buyer on the tail of that production. So in some of our VPPs, the tail of the production and the coverage ratios are 70% of the total asset value or more. So by giving nearly as much proceeds as you could from a conventional player, which by the way would be taxable where a VPP is not a [ph] taxable, [indiscernible] kind of  optionality as you put it. The second thing I think about is the technology in the deeper drilling, reserves overtime in Oklahoma and the Appalachian Basin, for example. New plays have come out just like the Marcellus, which underlies much of the assets that we bought back from CNR [Columbia Natural Resources] in 2005. And so we did a VPP there, keeping the optionality of new technology, new plays that are deeper. So I think that's certainly one way to think about it. And then the third thing, honestly, is that in this market, the financial players with the VPP that might be equivalent to an investment grade type of investment, significantly broadens the potential universe of people that are willing to give us money. We operate for those people. We keep our skin in the game. And so they've come forward at discount rates that are lower than what I've seen in the potential competing asset buyer, the discount rates being lower for the financial players than what the industry, let's say, is willing to accept. So those are several reasons why I think VPP is very attractive to us."

The SEC rule changed that many people have asked questions about how we booked and so forth, included a new requirement. That as of that date and going forward, each one of your impairment test measurement dates uses the first of the month pricing from the trailing 12 months. So on an unweighted basis, January 1, February 1 and so forth to 2009, the unweighted average price for gas was $3.87. Now going forward with every quarter, it should obviously get better because prices have been going up. But the end of the year price was a couple of dollars higher and of course, we would not have had an impairment charge. Second rule that changed is that just because prices go up after your measurement period, which was true in June and September, such that we didn't have a charge, that rule was revoked, if you will, and is no longer in place. So the mechanics of how it's applied has changed. And we'll be it [ph] back going forward, although we don't think that will yield any additional impairment charges."

And there are a lot of geochemical reasons for that, geological reasons for that. A lot of gas has been found in those areas.

Otherwise, I think we'd  have a big position there. And as a result of that and our success with gas, I think it's the one strategic weakness that the company has which is we're at, in the fourth quarter, 93% in gas in a world that does not value gas molecule the way they value oil molecule. So we and others have been shifting over the past couple of years to focus more on the oil side of the business, and that's what we're doing. And that shift takes time and the generation of new ideas and acquisition of acreage and then the drilling and completion of wells and watching the production, all really gets measured in years, not in months. And so what you're going to see unfolding in our company in 2010 and '11 is actually something we've signaled in March  of 2008, that we were going to look far more seriously at developing oil plays.

We hope you've had time to review Monday's operational release and yesterday's financial release. On the operational front, our daily production for the first quarter was very strong at 2.6 bcfe, up 9% year-over-year. Adjuste",1177,"Good morning. Thanks, Jeff. We hope you've had time to review Monday's operational release and yesterday's financial release. 
On the operational front, our daily production for the first quarter was very strong at 2.6 bcfe, up 9% year-over-year. Adjusted for the sale of our volumetric production payment number six and for our Barnett JV deal with Total, our production was up 19% year-over-year. 
On a sequential basis, our production was up 5% adjusted for those two asset sales. And even with those sales included, our production was down, less than 1%, on a sequential basis. Because of the strength of our drilling program, we have also increased our 2011 production forecast for the second time in six weeks, this time to a range of 16% to 18% with the increase being completely driven by our oil and natural gas liquids plays. In particular, we hope that you noticed that our liquids production was up 35% year-over-year. 
Chesapeake's proved reserve growth rate in the first quarter of 2010 kept pace with our very impressive production growth. Proved reserves rose from 14.3 tcfe at year end 2009 to 14.8 tcfe at the end of the first quarter. And that's after selling about 900 bcfe during the first quarter through our joint venture with Total and in VPP number six.  
Excluding asset sales, we actually increased our proved reserves by 1.4 trillion cubic feet of gas equivalents or 10% in just the past three months, we believe a incredible achievement. Using 10-year strip pricing in effect at the first quarter, our proved reserves actually increased to 15.8 tcfe. So we're Well, on our way to becoming the 20 to 22 tcfe proved reserve company by year end 2012 and potentially even earlier than that. 
I would also like to highlight our remarkably low finding cost during the first quarter. We added 1.6 tcfe at a drilling and completion cost of only $0.67 per mcfe. I don't believe there's another company in this industry that is capable of finding 1.6 tcfe in 90 days, much less finding it at $0.67 per mcfe. This success has been achieved by the nation's most active and highest-quality drilling program and led by our industry-leading leasehold positions in America's best shale plays. 
Speaking of leasehold, some of you probably noticed that on a net basis, we invested $622 million in new leasehold during the quarter. Of that $622 million, $210 million was invested in the Eagle Ford, $100 million in various Anadarko Basin oil plays, $100 million in the Haynesville, $75 million in the Marcellus, $75 million in various Permian Basin oil plays and $60 million in the Barnett and Fayetteville combined. For that investment, we acquired about 340,000 net acres or about $1,800 per net acre cost. We know that every acre we buy today could be resold for much more than we're paying for it, plus every acre gives us the right to develop new reserves at less than a $0.05 per mcfe cost to us. 
Please recall that in our JVs to-date, we have made more than $7 billion in profit by selling acreage at a cost basis to us of only about $2 billion. In our newest big acreage play, the Eagle Ford, we now own 400,000 net acres at a combined cost of about $550 million or less than $1,400 per net acre. Based on our Well, results and recent deals in the industry, we believe we likely already have a built-in gain of at least $1 billion and maybe $2 billion in our Eagle Ford position. 
You might further recall we did not own 1 acre in the Eagle Ford just nine months ago. It remains our expectation that by the end of 2010, we will have raised as much money from selling acreage this year as we have invested in acquiring acreage this year.
As for why we are seeking new plays, it's because we continue to focus primarily on oil and liquids-rich areas. That's where the money is these days, with oil to gas values now exceeding 3:1.  As for oil plays, it does surprise me that some analysts have commented that Chesapeake is a Johnny-come-lately to the unconventional oil business, and that it's simply not true. 
In March 2008, after two years of quiet development, we announced the discovery of the Colony Granite Wash, which over time could net to Chesapeake more than 800 million barrels of oil equivalent. At that same time, we also announced that Chesapeake would embark on a program to develop new unconventional oil plays. 
Back then, we had five unconventional oil plays in mind, four of which have turned out to be successful. We have now supplemented those original four plays with eight additional unconventional oil plays. And across our company, every asset team plus our new ventures group is very focused on continuing to develop new oil plays. 
If you thought we were a leader in revolutionizing the onshore U.S. natural gas business during the past five years, just wait and see what we can do to the onshore U.S. oil business in the next five years. Our horizontal drilling expertise and our unconventional geological target identification skills combined with our leasehold acquisition skills are second to none in the industry. They've been perfected over the past 20 years and will increasingly allow us to separate ourselves from the industry pack in the years ahead. 
For now we are disclosing just 12 liquids-rich plays, but there are more on the way. In these 12 plays, we have drilled more than 200 Well, to-date and have amassed an enviable position of 1.9 million acres of leasehold on which we have identified nearly 7 billion barrels of potential liquids-rich resources. We are the largest leasehold owner in these plays. And with the exception of the Eagle Ford Shale, where we had moved into third place with 400,000 net acres that is situated very strategically in the wet gas and oil portions of the Eagle Ford play. 
Finally, in response to continued low natural gas prices and the ongoing success in our liquids-rich play, we have redirected capital from our natural gas shale plays to focus more on oil. On our gas-focused plays, we now plan to spend about 12% less in 2010 and 17% less in 2011 than we previously have planned to spend. These capital savings will be used to further accelerate our oil program. This oil focus should lead to at least a threefold increase in our liquids production by year-end 2012 to more than 100,000 barrels of oil per day production versus the 32,000 barrels per day we've produced on average in 2009. 
By 2012, we look for liquids mix to be about 15% to 20% of our total production and perhaps 40% to 50% of our total revenues. That will be a tremendous accomplishment given how strong we expect our growth to continue to be from natural gas shale plays during that same time frame. This completes my commentary, and I'll now turn the call over to Marc."

Good morning, everyone. I just have a few notes this morning. I want to begin by reminding you of the status of our Midstream business.

I want to begin by reminding you of the status of our Midstream business. Our affiliate, Chesapeake Midstream Partners, L.P., which is a 50-50 partnership between Chesapeake and Global Infrastructure Partners, L.P., who is based in New York City, currently has a registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to its initial public offering. We have received an additional round of comments from the SEC. And in response, have filed our second amendment to the registration statement. So this initiative continues to move forward as expected. 
Outside of this entity, we have a wholly-owned business, Chesapeake Midstream Development. That entity is developing the Fayetteville, Haynesville, Marcellus and Eagle Ford gathering plays that we think have at least as much value as the IPO entity. 
Our liquidity remains very strong at the end of this quarter with about $2 billion in cash and available lines of credit. In addition to those lines of credit, we have close to $400 million of availability inside of CMP through that standalone revolving credit facility. 
Looking to the second quarter, we note in our release and I would emphasize that we are on track to monetize about $750 million through asset sales or VPPs during this second quarter. Two of four transactions that were expected to close have already closed to-date. 
You may have noticed we had a non-cash, nonrecurring charge below the line, so to speak, this quarter. For inquiring minds, this is a result of the new January 1, 2010 authoritative guidance for variable interest entities, which is quite a mouthful, since we no longer consolidate our midstream joint ventures' result to that. Because we have shared control with  our 50% partner, GIP, our investment in Chesapeake Midstream is now accounted for under the equity method. 
Unfortunately, the adoption of this new guidance resulted in an after-tax charge of about $140 million, which is reflected in our statement of operations as a cumulative effect of the accounting charge this quarter. This charge actually reflects the difference between the carrying value of our initial investment going back into the joint venture last year, and that was recorded of course at a carryover basis under common control. And the accounting change resulted in that switching to a fair-value entity based on what GIP came into. 
Finally, you might have noticed the substantial increase in our oil and gas liquids production as Aubrey pointed out this quarter. And this is mainly a result of our shift in drilling focus and the impact from the Granite Wash and new Anadarko emerging oil plays and of course, the Eagle Ford play in South Texas and the southwest Marcellus play in northwest West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania. 
But also, conforming to what we believe is industry practice, we are now reporting some liquids that are separated from gas and sold as liquids by us that were previously treated as part of the gas revenue stream. So a little bit of a change there. Moderator, I'll turn it over to the question-and-answer session please."

First, we do anticipate additional joint ventures. Those could be in the Eagle Ford, for example, or it could be in some of the emerging oil plays that we have. We have a whole group of minor assets that are under review for additional sales this quarter. We've already closed on about $210 million of miscellaneous properties in the Permian Basin. We have another group of properties in Virginia that we don't think have a lot of prospectivity for additional deep drilling. That's under consideration for about $150 million. So that's some of the type of assets that we're considering, and I think we will continue to monetize those type of assets. In another category, we're continuing to develop assets that we think will be monetized in the Midstream business. I mentioned Chesapeake Midstream Development, which is 100% owned by Chesapeake. We do have a considerable CapEx allocation to that business to develop the gathering systems, particularly in the Haynesville and the Marcellus play and to a lesser extent, developing out the Fayetteville and the emerging Eagle Ford play. Some of those might be taken up by third parties. We've occasionally sold some assets to a third-party. But primarily going forward, I expect those to be offered to and perhaps taken by Chesapeake Midstream partners in a drop-down scenario. And then finally, the VPP market remains very robust particularly in the oil pricing-related properties. And so I think we'll continue to look for opportunities to do that. I don't have a particular budget for that, but we've outlined our overall cash in and cash our summary in our releases, in our slide shows, et cetera. So I expect that the sales will exceed the amount that we spend in those additional categories of acreage and development of pipelines and so forth."

The Granite Wash play, for example, where we have 195,000 acres is basically spoken for. There's not much else that can be done there. In the Eagle Ford, we're at 400,000 acres. We might be able to get the 450,000 or the 500,000, but that's quickly becoming a play with all the positions locked down. A lot of upside in the Anadarko Basin. We have about 665,000 acres there and chasing three different plays there and we'll continue to add. But most of the areas is HBP, and so it's just kind of one-section at-a-time kind of stuff. Permian Basin, a fair amount of leasehold upside there. We've got 290,000 acres. And then in the Rockies, which is both the Powder River Basin oil plays. And then also the Niobrara play and the D-J Basin, we have 400,000 acres. And that could probably increase a fair amount. What we're finding  is the big companies around the world that are oil companies have clearly loved what we have found in gas in the U.S. But given that there are others, they'd probably just assume it's bringing them into oil deals as well. And so they have a big appetite and a lot of money, and it takes big leasehold positions to create the kind of billions of barrels of oil and equivalent impact to them that we think we can deliver. So we'll continue to do what we do really well, perhaps singularly well, which is to identify new plays and buy the acreage and then bring in partners at a very advantageous cost differential to us. It's been a model that's worked well for us, and we'll continue to do so going forward."

I mean right now, as I've stated on numerous occasions, I believe at least half and probably 2/3 or 3/4 of our gas drilling is what I would call involuntary. It's being incentivized by something other than the gas price. It might be the realization of a carry in the Marcellus or in the Barnett. It might be the need to hold acreage in the Haynesville, for example or it could be a combination of those two things. And I think that's, in large part, true across the industry that there's an enormous amount of drilling today that is economic. It's just economic for reasons other than what current gas prices are. But how we look at is a couple of years from now, our gas plays would be largely HBP. We will have ramped up our oil drilling quite aggressively. We will then be moving into a phase of needing to HBP our oil leasehold as well. But the difference between our gas plays and oil plays is of course first, the oil plays are valued at 3x:1 on a unit of production basis on the price alone. Plus there is no amount of success that I think we and our colleagues can have in the industry to really drive down oil prices with our success in finding, I think, new reserves of oil onshore in the U.S. And my guess is offshore oil drilling just got a little more difficult and probably more expensive. And so I think the stage is set for there to be a real rejuvenation in onshore American oil production. It'll be led by the same people that led the rejuvenation of the gas business, of which of course we're one. So if you get into a world where gas prices remain at $4 two years from now, I could see a scenario where the majority of our drilling is simply on oil projects and we'll let our gas projects HBP. If you get back to a scenario where gas prices are $6 to $7, which we expect, then you'll probably see a more balanced approach, so highly price dependent."

But I think there are a couple of encouraging things out there. First of all, supposedly, we were going to be awash in LNG this year. I think that marks the fifth or sixth year since 2001 I was told that U.S. producer will be swamped in LNG, and I don't think it's ever happened. And I suspect it will never happen. And so the world LNG supply-demand balance is fixing itself pretty rapidly through increased demand. And I suspect a couple of years from now, you'll be back in a position where you see a re-linkage of worldwide gas prices to worldwide oil prices, not on a one-to-one basis. But certainly over the last year and a half, we've seen world gas prices gravitate towards Henry Hub rather than towards oil equivalency. I think going forward, you'll see them head back the other way. So that is, I think, something favorable out there for a couple of years from now. I think the whole rush to HBP acreage right now, which occurred at almost any gas price, will have essentially run its course a couple of years from now. And it will be done by then. And all of a sudden, our drilling, rather than becoming involuntary or being involuntary, will become voluntary. And we only drill gas wells when we think the price curve pays us to do it, not because of the ancillary benefits of picking up a carry or HBP in acreage. Finally, I think -- well, two final thoughts: one is the coal floor, I think, is continuing to come up. Clearly, the accident in West Virginia is going to make coal more expensive to mine going forward. It's going to make it more difficult to mine. Yesterday's coal ash rules proposed by the EPA could be game changers for the burning of coal in the U.S. And so I think I wouldn't be surprised to see if the coal floor come up by $0.50 in mcf in each of the next few years, and that will help provide some support. And then I think there's also the possibility that we'll see some demand initiatives kick in two or three years from now as utilities begin to close some of their oldest coal plants and begin to run their natural gas plants harder. And I think we've kind of -- we're scraping along the bottom. I don't know if that's $3.50. I don't know if that's $4 right now, but I do think the bottom is continuing to come up. And I think there's some reasons to be optimistic about a return to kind of a $6 or $7 gas price in the U.S. over the next few years because I think it's very favorable to consumers and is a decent price for producers as well."

So based on those results that are clearly from a small set, but I think what we've learned these days is when you get well results that meet your geological model, your geological model can be trusted over a pretty wide area that you've mapped. And so we're going to be adding some rigs up in the Rockies soon, and I think it can be a big play for us. Now in the past, I haven't wanted to be in the Rockies because I hadn't liked the gas prices there and I hadn't liked the environmental issues. But at least in these areas of Wyoming, most of the land that we're involved in, it's going to be fee land rather than federal land. And in the D-J Basin, it's going to be on fee land as well. So yes, I think there'd be a lot more visibility on those plays going forward.

So there are about five reasons why we like them as being superior to an asset sale. And frankly, I'm thrilled that no one else appears to like them very much. Marc may have some other thoughts there. On the JVs, you have to, first of all, be able to acquire the idea and acquire the acreage and then have an operation that an international major wants to affiliate with. And that's not true with every company, and I like having to raise our game to meet the standards of BP or a Statoil or a Total around the world. And I think that's made us a better organization for having to meet additional standards with our domestic operations. Also, look, if shareholders value your Marcellus acreage at $15,000 a net acre, you don't sell it into a JV at $14,000. If shareholders value Marcellus acreage at $2,000 an acre and you can get some somebody to pay you $10,000 or $15,000 an acre for it on a JV basis, then that's what you do. So we'd love for investors to do some of the parts here and realize we have assets worth over $50 billion and have our stock price be $75 that we think the assets support. But if they're not willing to do so, then we know that there are industry players out there that will give a fair value for those assets. And we'll bring them in and create value that way."

I think it is cleaner for some companies with the rating agencies to simply enter into a sale rather than a VPP-type arrangement. I mean we happen to disagree with the rating agencies pretty vociferously. It doesn't mean they've changed their minds. But I mean clearly, this is for GAAP purposes of sale, we take the reserves off of our books. We legally transfer them. We don't show any production from those.

And I think over the last I guess 14 years that -- 1994, I guess 16 years since we've had long-term senior notes traded in the market, we've always had a track record of moving maturities when they get within three or four years out. And I think we could easily do that today. It's just our feeling. Our feeling has been that rates would remain relatively benign. And that the closer we get to a call date in this environment, probably the better our net present value exchange is with refinancing those notes.

We hope you've had time to review Monday's operational release and yesterday's financial release. On the operational front, our daily production for the first quarter was very strong at 2.6 bcfe, up 9% year-over-year. Adjuste",1178,"Good morning. Thanks, Jeff. We hope you've had time to review Monday's operational release and yesterday's financial release. 
On the operational front, our daily production for the first quarter was very strong at 2.6 bcfe, up 9% year-over-year. Adjusted for the sale of our volumetric production payment number six and for our Barnett JV deal with Total, our production was up 19% year-over-year. 
On a sequential basis, our production was up 5% adjusted for those two asset sales. And even with those sales included, our production was down, less than 1%, on a sequential basis. Because of the strength of our drilling program, we have also increased our 2011 production forecast for the second time in six weeks, this time to a range of 16% to 18% with the increase being completely driven by our oil and natural gas liquids plays. In particular, we hope that you noticed that our liquids production was up 35% year-over-year. 
Chesapeake's proved reserve growth rate in the first quarter of 2010 kept pace with our very impressive production growth. Proved reserves rose from 14.3 tcfe at year end 2009 to 14.8 tcfe at the end of the first quarter. And that's after selling about 900 bcfe during the first quarter through our joint venture with Total and in VPP number six.  
Excluding asset sales, we actually increased our proved reserves by 1.4 trillion cubic feet of gas equivalents or 10% in just the past three months, we believe a incredible achievement. Using 10-year strip pricing in effect at the first quarter, our proved reserves actually increased to 15.8 tcfe. So we're Well, on our way to becoming the 20 to 22 tcfe proved reserve company by year end 2012 and potentially even earlier than that. 
I would also like to highlight our remarkably low finding cost during the first quarter. We added 1.6 tcfe at a drilling and completion cost of only $0.67 per mcfe. I don't believe there's another company in this industry that is capable of finding 1.6 tcfe in 90 days, much less finding it at $0.67 per mcfe. This success has been achieved by the nation's most active and highest-quality drilling program and led by our industry-leading leasehold positions in America's best shale plays. 
Speaking of leasehold, some of you probably noticed that on a net basis, we invested $622 million in new leasehold during the quarter. Of that $622 million, $210 million was invested in the Eagle Ford, $100 million in various Anadarko Basin oil plays, $100 million in the Haynesville, $75 million in the Marcellus, $75 million in various Permian Basin oil plays and $60 million in the Barnett and Fayetteville combined. For that investment, we acquired about 340,000 net acres or about $1,800 per net acre cost. We know that every acre we buy today could be resold for much more than we're paying for it, plus every acre gives us the right to develop new reserves at less than a $0.05 per mcfe cost to us. 
Please recall that in our JVs to-date, we have made more than $7 billion in profit by selling acreage at a cost basis to us of only about $2 billion. In our newest big acreage play, the Eagle Ford, we now own 400,000 net acres at a combined cost of about $550 million or less than $1,400 per net acre. Based on our well results to date and recent deals in the industry, we believe we likely already have a built-in gain of at least $1 billion and maybe $2 billion in our Eagle Ford position. 
You might further recall we did not own 1 acre in the Eagle Ford just nine months ago. It remains our expectation that by the end of 2010, we will have raised as much money from selling acreage this year as we have invested in acquiring acreage this year.
As for why we are seeking new plays, it's because we continue to focus primarily on oil and liquids-rich areas. That's where the money is these days, with oil-to-gas values now exceeding 3:1.  As for oil plays, it does surprise me that some analysts have commented that Chesapeake is a Johnny-come-lately to the unconventional oil business, and that is simply not true. 
In March 2008, after two years of quiet development, we announced the discovery of the Colony Granite Wash, which over time could net to Chesapeake more than 800 million barrels of oil equivalent. At that same time, we also announced that Chesapeake would embark on a program to develop new unconventional oil plays. 
Back then, we had five unconventional oil plays in mind, four of which have turned out to be successful. We have now supplemented those original four plays with eight additional unconventional oil plays. And across our company, every asset team plus our new ventures group is very focused on continuing to develop new oil plays. 
If you thought we were a leader in revolutionizing the onshore U.S. natural gas business during the past five years, just wait and see what we can do to the onshore U.S. oil business in the next five years. Our horizontal drilling expertise and our unconventional geological target identification skills combined with our leasehold acquisition skills are second to none in the industry. They've been perfected over the past 20 years and will increasingly allow us to separate ourselves from the industry pack in the years ahead. 
For now we are disclosing just 12 liquids-rich plays, but there are more on the way. In these 12 plays, we have drilled more than 200 wells to-date and have amassed an enviable position of 1.9 million acres of leasehold on which we have identified nearly 7 billion barrels of potential liquids-rich resources. We are the largest leasehold owner in these plays. And with the exception of the Eagle Ford Shale, where we had moved into third place with 400,000 net acres that is situated very strategically in the wet gas and oil portions of the Eagle Ford play. 
Finally, in response to continued low natural gas prices and the ongoing success in our liquids-rich play, we have redirected capital from our natural gas shale plays to focus more on oil. On our gas-focused plays, we now plan to spend about 12% less in 2010 and 17% less in 2011 than we previously have planned to spend. These capital savings will be used to further accelerate our oil program. This oil focus should lead to at least a threefold increase in our liquids production by year-end 2012 to more than 100,000 barrels of oil per day production versus the 32,000 barrels per day we've produced on average in 2009. 
By 2012, we look for our liquids mix to be about 15% to 20% of our total production and perhaps 40% to 50% of our total revenues. That will be a tremendous accomplishment given how strong we expect our growth to continue to be from natural gas shale plays during that same time frame. This completes my commentary, and I'll now turn the call over to Marc."

Good morning, everyone. I just have a few notes this morning. I want to begin by reminding you of the status of our Midstream business.

I want to begin by reminding you of the status of our Midstream business. Our affiliate, Chesapeake Midstream Partners, L.P., which is a 50-50 partnership between Chesapeake and Global Infrastructure Partners, L.P., who is based in New York City, currently has a registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to its initial public offering. We have received an additional round of comments from the SEC, and in response, have filed our second amendment to the registration statement. So this initiative continues to move forward as expected. 
Outside of this entity, we have a wholly-owned business, Chesapeake Midstream Development. That entity is developing the Fayetteville, Haynesville, Marcellus and Eagle Ford gathering plays that we think have at least as much value as the IPO entity. 
Our liquidity remains very strong at the end of this quarter with about $2 billion in cash and available lines of credit. In addition to those lines of credit, we have close to $400 million of availability inside of CMP through that standalone revolving credit facility. 
Looking to the second quarter, we note in our release and I would emphasize that we are on track to monetize about $750 million through asset sales or VPPs during this second quarter. Two of four transactions that were expected to close have already closed to-date. 
You may have noticed we had a non-cash, nonrecurring charge below the line, so to speak, this quarter. For inquiring minds, this is a result of the new January 1, 2010 authoritative guidance for variable interest entities, which is quite a mouthful, since we no longer consolidate our midstream joint ventures' result to that. Because we have shared control with  our 50% partner, GIP, our investment in Chesapeake Midstream is now accounted for under the equity method. 
Unfortunately, the adoption of this new guidance resulted in an after-tax charge of about $140 million, which is reflected in our statement of operations as a cumulative effect of the accounting charge this quarter. This charge actually reflects the difference between the carrying value of our initial investment going back into the joint venture last year, and that was recorded of course at a carryover basis under common control. And the accounting change resulted in that switching to a fair-value entity based on what GIP came into. 
Finally, you might have noticed the substantial increase in our oil and gas liquids production as Aubrey pointed out this quarter. And this is mainly a result of our shift in drilling focus and the impact from the Granite Wash and new Anadarko emerging oil plays and of course, the Eagle Ford play in South Texas and the southwest Marcellus play in northwest West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania. 
But also, conforming to what we believe is industry practice, we are now reporting some liquids that are separated from gas and sold as liquids by us that were previously treated as part of the gas revenue stream. So a little bit of a change there. Moderator, I'll turn it over to the question-and-answer session please."

First, we do anticipate additional joint ventures. Those could be in the Eagle Ford, for example, or it could be in some of the emerging oil plays that we have. We have a whole group of minor assets that are under review for additional sales this quarter. We've already closed on about $210 million of miscellaneous properties in the Permian Basin. We have another group of properties in Virginia that we don't think have a lot of prospectivity for additional deep drilling. That's under consideration for about $150 million. So that's some of the type of assets that we're considering, and I think we will continue to monetize those type of assets. In another category, we're continuing to develop assets that we think will be monetized in the Midstream business. I mentioned Chesapeake Midstream Development, which is 100% owned by Chesapeake. We do have a considerable CapEx allocation to that business to develop the gathering systems, particularly in the Haynesville and the Marcellus play and to a lesser extent, developing out the Fayetteville and the emerging Eagle Ford play. Some of those might be taken up by third parties. We've occasionally sold some assets to a third-party. But primarily going forward, I expect those to be offered to and perhaps taken by Chesapeake Midstream partners in a drop-down scenario. And then finally, the VPP market remains very robust particularly in the oil pricing-related properties. And so I think we'll continue to look for opportunities to do that. I don't have a particular budget for that, but we've outlined our overall cash in and cash our summary in our releases, in our slide shows, et cetera. So I expect that the sales will exceed the amount that we spend in those additional categories of acreage and development of pipelines and so forth."

The Granite Wash play, for example, where we have 195,000 acres is basically spoken for. There's not much else that can be done there. In the Eagle Ford, we're at 400,000 acres. We might be able to get the 450,000 or the 500,000, but that's quickly becoming a play with all the positions locked down. A lot of upside in the Anadarko Basin. We have about 665,000 acres there and chasing three different plays there and we'll continue to add. But most of the areas is HBP, and so it's just kind of one-section at-a-time kind of stuff. Permian Basin, a fair amount of leasehold upside there. We've got 290,000 acres. And then in the Rockies, which is both the Powder River Basin oil plays. And then also the Niobrara play and the D-J Basin, we have 400,000 acres. And that could probably increase a fair amount. What we're finding  is the big companies around the world that are oil companies have clearly loved what we have found in gas in the U.S. But given that there are others, they'd probably just assume it's bringing them into oil deals as well. And so they have a big appetite and a lot of money, and it takes big leasehold positions to create the kind of billions of barrels of oil and equivalent impact to them that we think we can deliver. So we'll continue to do what we do really well, perhaps singularly well, which is to identify new plays and buy the acreage and then bring in partners at a very advantageous cost differential to us. It's been a model that's worked well for us, and we'll continue to do so going forward."

I mean right now, as I've stated on numerous occasions, I believe at least half and probably 2/3 or 3/4 of our gas drilling is what I would call involuntary. It's being incentivized by something other than the gas price. It might be the realization of a carry in the Marcellus or in the Barnett. It might be the need to hold acreage in the Haynesville, for example or it could be a combination of those two things. And I think that's, in large part, true across the industry that there's an enormous amount of drilling today that is economic. It's just economic for reasons other than what current gas prices are. But how we look at is a couple of years from now, our gas plays would be largely HBP. We will have ramped up our oil drilling quite aggressively. We will then be moving into a phase of needing to HBP our oil leasehold as well. But the difference between our gas plays and oil plays is of course first, the oil plays are valued at 3x:1 on a unit of production basis on the price alone. Plus there is no amount of success that I think we and our colleagues can have in the industry to really drive down oil prices with our success in finding, I think, new reserves of oil onshore in the U.S. And my guess is offshore oil drilling just got a little more difficult and probably more expensive. And so I think the stage is set for there to be a real rejuvenation in onshore American oil production. It'll be led by the same people that led the rejuvenation of the gas business, of which of course we're one. So if you get into a world where gas prices remain at $4 two years from now, I could see a scenario where the majority of our drilling is simply on oil projects and we'll let our gas projects HBP. If you get back to a scenario where gas prices are $6 to $7, which we expect, then you'll probably see a more balanced approach, so highly price dependent."

But I think there are a couple of encouraging things out there. First of all, supposedly, we were going to be awash in LNG this year. I think that marks the fifth or sixth year since 2001 I was told that the U.S. producer will be swamped in LNG, and I don't think it's ever happened. And I suspect it will never happen. And so the world LNG supply-demand balance is fixing itself pretty rapidly through increased demand. And I suspect a couple of years from now, you'll be back in a position where you see a re-linkage of worldwide gas prices to worldwide oil prices, not on a one-to-one basis. But certainly over the last year and a half, we've seen world gas prices gravitate towards Henry Hub rather than towards oil equivalency. I think going forward, you'll see them head back the other way. So that is, I think, something favorable out there for a couple of years from now. I think the whole rush to HBP acreage right now, which occurred at almost any gas price, will have essentially run its course a couple of years from now. And it will be done by then. And all of a sudden, our drilling, rather than becoming involuntary or being involuntary, will become voluntary. And we only drill gas wells when we think the price curve pays us to do it, not because of the ancillary benefits of picking up a carry or HBP in acreage. Finally, I think -- well, two final thoughts: one is the coal floor, I think, is continuing to come up. Clearly, the accident in West Virginia is going to make coal more expensive to mine going forward. It's going to make it more difficult to mine. Yesterday's coal ash rules proposed by the EPA could be game changers for the burning of coal in the U.S. And so I think I wouldn't be surprised to see the coal floor come up by $0.50 in mcf in each of the next few years, and that will help provide some support. And then I think there's also the possibility that we'll see some demand initiatives kick in two or three years from now as utilities begin to close some of their oldest coal plants and begin to run their natural gas plants harder. And I think we've kind of -- we're scraping along the bottom. I don't know if that's $3.50. I don't know if that's $4 right now, but I do think the bottom is continuing to come up. And I think there's some reasons to be optimistic about a return to kind of a $6 or $7 gas price in the U.S. over the next few years because I think it's very favorable to consumers and is a decent price for producers as well."

So based on those results that are clearly from a small set, but I think what we've learned these days is when you get well results that meet your geological model, your geological model can be trusted over a pretty wide area that you've mapped. And so we're going to be adding some rigs up in the Rockies soon, and I think it can be a big play for us. Now in the past, I haven't wanted to be in the Rockies because I hadn't liked the gas prices there and I hadn't liked the environmental issues. But at least in these areas of Wyoming, most of the land that we're involved in, it's going to be fee land rather than federal land. And in the D-J Basin, it's going to be on fee land as well. So yes, I think there'd be a lot more visibility on those plays going forward.

Marc may have some other thoughts there. On the JVs, you have to, first of all, be able to acquire the idea and acquire the acreage and then have an operation that an international major wants to affiliate with. And that's not true with every company, and I like having to raise our game to meet the standards of BP or a Statoil or a Total around the world. And I think that's made us a better organization for having to meet additional standards with our domestic operations. Also, look, if shareholders value your Marcellus acreage at $15,000 a net acre, you don't sell it into a JV at $14,000. If shareholders value Marcellus acreage at $2,000 an acre and you can get some somebody to pay you $10,000 or $15,000 an acre for it on a JV basis, then that's what you do. So we'd love for investors to do some of the parts here and realize we have assets worth over $50 billion and have our stock price be $75 that we think the assets support.

I mean we happen to disagree with the rating agencies pretty vociferously. It doesn't mean they've changed their minds.

We hope you had time to review Monday's operational release and yesterday's financial release. We always strive to provide the most detailed information in the industry to our investors. On the operational s",2262,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning to you all. We hope you had time to review Monday's operational release and yesterday's financial release. We always strive to provide the most detailed information in the industry to our investors. 
On the operational side, our daily production for the first quarter was very strong at 2.8 Bcfe, up 14% year-over-year, and that's after selling a significant amount of production through various VPPs, asset sales and our Barnett joint venture deal with Total. On a sequential basis, our production was up 8%, and most importantly, our liquids production was up 41% year-over-year.
Because of the strength of our drilling program and the outstanding performance of our wells, we are increasing our 2010 and 2011 production growth forecast to 13% for 2010 and 18% for 2011. Much of that growth will come from our rapidly increasing liquids production. In fact, we expect our liquids production to increase by 60% in 2010 and 80% in 2011, both of which are remarkable numbers, especially for a company of our size.
Next, I'd like to highlight our exceptionally low finding cost rate in for the first half of the year. We added a net 1.2 Tcfe at a drilling and completion cost of only $0.87 per Mcfe. I don't believe there's another company in the industry as capable of adding 2.5 to 3 Tcf per year to there proved reserves at under $1 per Mcfe. And this success has been achieved by the nation's most active and highest quality drilling program, led by our industry-leading leasehold positions in America's best unconventional natural gas liquids plays. 
The growth in our liquids production and in our proved reserves and our planned slowdown in natural gas drilling are our most important messages today.  I want to make clear, in fact, crystal clear that Chesapeake is pursuing a differentiated growth model for many of our colleagues in the industry. The CHK model is not a commitment to increasing gas productions without regard to natural gas prices. Quite the opposite, in fact. Unless gas prices increase over $6 per MCF, Chesapeake is committed to continuing to reduce its gas drilling CapEx, increase its liquids drilling CapEx. 
In fact, in 2011, we will see an $800-million swing as we reduce gas CapEx by $400 million and increase liquids CapEx by that same $400 million, all the while planning to keep year-over-year CapEx flat. I'll repeat, we are reducing natural gas CapEx, while increasing liquids CapEx, while planning to keep overall drilling CapEx flat in 2011 versus 2010.
With regard to the oil and liquids plays that will drive Chesapeake's growth model in the years ahead, I want to remind you that we started to make this transition back in 2008 when it became clear to us that oil prices were likely to outperform natural gas prices for a long time to come. However, because of the long lead time in developing the technological expertise to find and test unconventional oil plays and the length of time it takes to put leasehold plays together, it is only now that we are really starting to see the payoff from the strategy shift that we initiated in 2008.
This will be the single largest strategy shift in Chesapeake's history. And once it has been completed during the next few years, it will generate huge benefits to our shareholders. And we believe that unlike with natural gas, Chesapeake's success in finding large new reserves of unconventional oil in the U.S. will not negatively affect oil prices. Obviously, this has not been the case with our large discoveries of unconventional natural gas during the past few years.
One final thought on our liquids plays. For now, we are disclosing the names and locations of 12 of these plays, but there are more on the way. In these 12 plays, we have drilled about 280 wells and have a amassed an industry-leading position of 2.4 million acres, on which we have identified more than 8 billion barrels of potential unrisk liquids-rich resources. 
We now own the largest inventory of leasehold in two of the top three new unconventional liquids plays in Niobrara and the Eagle Ford Shale, where we now on 675,000 and 550,000 net acres, respectively, located very strategically in the liquids-rich portion of each play. We are especially pleased about our position in the Eagle Ford and are very excited to move forward with the JV on this acreage. We are in good position here with many potential partners, all of whom we believe are working hard to get to the right answer.
Speaking of acreage, I am well aware of the huge amount of capital we have laid out for acreage so far this year as we transition away from our former gas-only strategy and towards our more balanced gas-and-oil strategy. First of all, some of our gassy peers have chosen not to make this transition and appear willing to take their chances with future gas prices. That is a risk to which I am not willing to expose our investors.
On the other hand, if you believe oil and NGL prices will be much stronger than gas prices for a long time into the future, as we do, then you have two choices: You can either buy your way into more liquids production through acquisitions, or you can organically grow your way into more liquids production through leasing and drilling. The first approach is one that has been taken by some companies recently, but it is a very, very expensive route. We prefer the second approach, provided it is onshore and in the U.S.A. 
We started building the foundation for this transition back in 2008 with our discovery of the Granite Wash play in Western Oklahoma. During the past two years, our move to oil has been gaining momentum until this year, when the pace greatly quickened as about 10 new oil plays developed either under our initiative or, in a few cases, by some of our peers.
My review of the recent history of the unconventional gas business tells me that it took only about three years from the confirmation of the Barnett size and the Fayetteville discovery in 2005 to the discovery of the Haynesville, Marcellus and down-dip Eagle Ford in 2007 and 2008. I hope you'll recognize that there hasn't been another big unconventional gas play since those discoveries of two years ago.
If you didn't play big in those three years from 2005 to 2008, then you are left behind or relegated to paying big premiums to established positions in these premier new unconventional gas plays. Paying up after the fact can work just fine for big international companies, but it doesn't work for us. 
In moving from unconventional gas history to thinking more about how the history of unconventional liquids will be written, it was my assessment that 2010 would be the year that companies either lockdown positions in this big new liquids plays or were left out and left behind or perhaps relegated to paying very big premiums down the road. I decided that Chesapeake had to play, while costs were still affordable for companies of our size, and we have played in a big way. While we still have more leasing to complete in the second half of 2010, the spend will not be as heavy as it was in the first half. 
Furthermore, starting in the third quarter of 2010, we will begin selling off minority positions in some of these new oil plays to recover much, if not all, of our initial leasehold investment. That process will continue into 2011. And when it's all said and done, we will have locked down the best unconventional liquids position in the industry and we will have very low remaining costs in our retained acreage. If you do not believe that we are capable of this, then I respectfully refer you to the $10 billion of joint ventures we entered into in the big four shale gas plays in 2008 and in early 2009, in which we sold about $2 billion of leasehold cost for $10 billion in value.
There is one more aspect of our leasehold buying and selling I'd like to discuss. For CHK tax reasons and for partner cash flow reasons, when we sell acreage into a JV, we only receive a portion of the total consideration in upfront cash. The rest comes in drilling carries over time, i.e., a reduction in our CapEx for drilling. For starters, we can't book this drilling carries as receivables because their contingent on us drilling wells to earn the carry. That's always a disappointment as our financial statements do not reflect these very big and very valuable drilling carry, which total right now about $3 billion. I can assure you that we will drill the wells over time, and we will receive this cash. 
However, when we receive the cash, we record it as a reduction in our drilling CapEx, not as a reduction in our leasehold CapEx. However, it is in fact very much a recovery of leasehold CapEx that has simply been triggered by drilling, but that's not the way it shows up on our financial statements.
Since many analysts routinely kick out our carries in their analysis of our finding costs because to them they are somehow not real, we end up with the worst of all world. Our industry-leading low finding costs are virtually disregarded, and our industry-leading leasehold CapEx investments are overstated by the amount of the drilling carries received. 
Therefore, our true leasehold CapEx should always be evaluated by looking at what we spend, less what we collect in upfront cash and then also less what we will collect in future drilling carries. This is a big issue, and I hope you will now have a better appreciation of how our leasehold CapEx is always overstated and in my view, therefore, very likely underappreciated as our number one profit center over the years.
One more thing in regard to profit centers, I do hope you will recognize that our cash hedging gains since 2001 have now reached $5.4 billion. I offer congratulations to the other two members of the hedging committee, they are here with me today, Marc Rowland and Jeff Mobley. We have delivered outstanding value to investors here in far greater amounts than anyone else in the industry has, and I do believe this is a vastly underappreciated aspect of management's performance over time.
So I'd like to close my commentary with reading you an excerpt from our press release that we believe very clearly states what we are seeking to accomplish this year and in the years ahead. We plan to reduce drilling and natural gas well, except for those required to hold leasehold by production or to use a drilling carry provided by a joint venture partner until such time as natural gas prices rise above $6 per MCF. 
We plan to lease and develop substantial new liquids-rich plays in which the company can acquire very large leasehold positions of 250,000 to 750,000 net acres. Within one year of acquisition, we plan to sell a minority position in a new play recovering all or virtually all of the costs acquired to leasehold in the play and to fund a significant portion of Chesapeake's future drilling costs in the play. 
We plan to accelerate drilling of liquids-rich plays until year-end 2012, when the company's drilling capital expenditures are balanced, approximately 50-50 between natural gas and liquids. We plan to continue adding proved reserves, net of monetizations and divestitures, of approximately 2.5 to 3.0 Tcfe or up to 500 million barrels annually. And we project by the end of 2012, we are likely to own 18 Tcf of proved reserves and about 1 billion barrels of oil. I encourage you to consider what that would be worth. 
And finally, we plan to accomplish these goals without the issuance of additional equity and with a reduction of debt levels, such that the company becomes investment grade within the next few years.  The key challenge we face in implementing this strategy is to allocate capital between our very large gas asset base and our emerging unconventional liquids plays. 
We have considerable gas drilling that we need to drill to earn the $3 billion of outstanding carries and also to hold very valuable and very high-quality gas acreage, but we also have tremendous opportunities in new unconventional liquids plays. These two activities result in very large capital needs. Fortunately, our assets are exceptional, and we've been able to attract partners, or expect to, who will finance much of our new liquids projects.
Because our assets are so valuable, we will be able to accomplish the oil and gas industry hat trick in the years ahead. We will grow reserves and production by 13% to 18% annually, reduce leverage and not issue any additional equity. Our assets give us the ability to use a range of asset-level financing tools to raise money at significant premiums to our cost bases in these assets. 
In summary, having helped to revolutionize the onshore U.S. natural gas business, we look forward to doing the same for the U.S. oil business, but we will do so receiving $10 to $15 per production unit versus the $4 to $5 per production unit we're receiving for our gas right now. This brighter, more profitable tomorrow cannot arrive soon enough for me. 
This completes my commentary, and I'll now turn the call over to Marc."

Also, one that's a lot of attractive financing transactions. 
Notably, we completed in May the issuance of $2.6 billion of cumulative convertible preferred stock, including approximately $1.5 billion that was sold to prominent Asian investors for the first time ever. We used the proceeds to redeem $1.3 billion of senior notes in June, and additional $0.6 billion of notes that were redeemed in July after the quarter closed. The remaining proceeds were used to reduce our bank debt. So with the issuance of $2.6 billion of face amount of preferred, we reduced our debt by a similar amount.
In June, we closed on our VPP number seven, or volumetric production payment, for $322 million of proceeds or about $8.75 per Mcf equivalent for around 38 Bcf of sales. Obviously, monetization at a rate well above what our company is valued at in total. We also concluded two other asset sales that we had spoke about earlier in the year for $330 million in proceeds, one in the Permian Basin and one in the Appalachian area. 
So a busy quarter that resulted in end of quarter cash and undrawn credit facilities of $2.8 billion. As Aubrey noted, our hedging gains over the last many years, particularly powerful in quarter two, giving us an additional unrealized cash revenues of $2.26 per Mcf equivalent. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we were successful in launching our Chesapeake Midstream Partners' IPO, New York Stock Exchange symbol CHKM. We priced 21.25 million primary units at $21 per unit, the high end of our expected range. Today, those units are trading for about $23, giving CHKM an enterprise value of around $3.2 billion or $1.34 billion to Chesapeake's 41.45% interest. 
There's nearly $1 billion of cash and unused credit facilities to accomplish CHK drop-down acquisitions or other acquisitions inside of CHKM, something we intend to pursue in the near future. And as a sidebar to that, our remaining Midstream assets that were not put in CHKM have nearly the identical production profile as the assets that we've transferred to date.
You may have also noticed that last night we announced a cash tender offer for an additional aggregate $1.5 billion of senior notes of various maturities. We intend to finance these with notes of longer maturities and the tenders conditions on our successfully placing these notes in the near future.
I would end by saying our finding costs, the power of our joint ventures and substantial remaining drilling carries, along with the other ventures we are pursuing, particularly in the Eagle Ford and in the Midstream, lead us to be in excellent position to continue with outsized returns on our invested capital.

In the Fayetteville, I remind you our drilling has gone down by half, seventeen to eight rigs. That's when we reached the point where we can comfortably kind of glide into the finished HBP position. So that will occur next in the Barnett after the Haynesville, and then next after that, the Marcellus. So at the mean time, a large portion of the industry drilling right now is for gas, anyway, is involuntary as it works to HBP leasehold, and most of those leasehold positions were established in '06, '07 and '08. And the time to finished HBP in net acreage will be this year and next year, and after that, I think the industry moves into a much different drilling phase."

And I think within a year of having bought that first lease, that we will have executed the transaction and recovered a good bit of our leasehold expenditures. And I think that's a model that will work well for us going forward. So it won't always fit into the handy definition of a year. But also, I really do believe that this will end up being a lot like the gas plays, where they come at you fast and heavy and over the course of it took three years for gas plays to emerge and once the industry found out this kind of rock will work, and now the industry has found out a different kind of rock will work to move oil molecule through and at the pace at which life moves today, I think that three-year timeframe is probably going to be collapsed down to a year, a year and a half.

So that's the goal, but some of these plays are relatively immature and it's not always noble yet today, exactly what that exact percentage would be. But I think if you use 50-50 today and 2/3, 1/3 oil versus NGL over time, we would expect that the differentials that we've recently widened to account for NGLs, will hopefully narrow over time as more of our oil gets more of our liquids production comes in the form of oil."

So I think there is much less risk of an NGL pricing collapse in the U.S. But having said that, we're certainly taking our message to consumers of NGLs, that we're going to be increasing supply for a long time to come and they should make appropriate investments to be able to handle our new NGL production."

But I do think we can get to a 50-50 value proposition and we can get there, of course, pretty quickly, we hope. Something to look forward the mid part of the decade. And that's predicated on basically the continuation of what we have, which is strong oil markets. I suspect it's stronger, just have to look no further than what's happening in China again. You go back five years and look at what their oil consumption was. I think very few people would've guessed that five years later, they would be at 9 million barrels a day. Nobody seems to believe that in five more years, China could be at 15 million barrels a day, but that's, I think, unavoidable. And when you look at that and you look at what's happening in other Asian countries and you look at oil consumption stabilizing in the OIC countries, then I don't see how you get away from an analysis that said oil prices are going to be strong basically for a long time until this world figures out that you can substitute something cheaper for that oil, which is natural gas. And that's a very obvious fact that completely escapes apparently most American policymakers. But at some point, we're going to have to revisit that as we will be unable, in my view, to compete with China for oil supply in the years ahead. So I still feel that oil will be strong, gas will be kind of range bound here for another year or two. And so the industry is able to reduce its drilling and have more of its drilling become discretionary rather than non-discretionary, and for more coal-fired power to get converted to natural gas. And I think, hopefully, someday, we'll see some inroads on the transportation side. So I do feel like the gas coal switching floor has come up over the last year, so we're not talking about $3 gas price like last year. Today, we're talking about a switching price of about $4. And hopefully, next year can it'll be a little higher as well. So we're just doing what I think anybody would do. You can go out and spend money and find a unit that you can sell for $4. Or you can go out and spend money and finding a unit yourself for $14. And our problem before was we just didn't find -- we didn't think we can find any of the $14 unit. Now we know we can find them and is as quickly as possible, we're making that acceleration in transition over from $4 units to $14 units. And when you ask about the ultimate goal, the ultimate goal is to make a bunch more money doing what we're doing. And the way to do that is to replace $4 unit to $14 unit."

But for us, the primary one is to develop a relationship with Sasol and to maybe work with Statoil and Sasol and hopefully, achieve the holy grail in the Gas business, which would be to turn natural gas into a liquid transportation fuel. I've spent a lot of my time in the last few years trying to get the U.S. transportation switched over from a liquid-based system to gas-based system, and maybe it would be a lot easier to take the fuel and transition it from gas to liquids, and force that conversion where I've been trying to force the conversion of large segments of the U.S. transportation system from liquid to gas."

We will size them and assign a tender to them to maximize the oil-gas relationship and to maximize the sweet part of the market for what we see the economic demand. Right now, we're seeing probably as much interest as we ever have and I think the reason for that is at least partly, the nature of the banks being heavy on capital and light on investment opportunities. And remember, while the rating agencies might consider part of these to be debt for GAAP purposes, there are sale the reserves are taking off. We have no dollar obligation going back to '06 when we did our first VPP. There's never been one month in any VPP where the production wasn't satisfied from the curve that we sold to the investor. Today, the capital rate on those is probably close to what our bonds trade at. I would think a five-year VPP probably could come inside a 7.5% pretty easily. And think about what the investors are getting for 7.5% and a 50 bps two-year treasury market, we're getting an investment-grade product that is completely bankruptcy proof. They own the assets, it's fully hedged. And so that becomes a secured hard asset loan for them, which is really an investment, obviously, because they don't book it as a loan.

But generally, we've been spending on the $500 million to $700 million range, outside of the CHK and the new MLP publicly traded entity. I think that's probably going to not be more than that as we take on additional joint ventures and as we do drop-down sales similar to the one that Western and Anadarko announced just this last week. Where I think we'll be from a guidance on drop-downs is that I think we'll be in a position to do a couple of them per year at anywhere from $250 million to $500 million each in size and that they'll either be part of one of our systems like Haynesville, or Fayetteville, or other opportunities. And not only will we receive capital in that scenario, but then, that will in turn, reduce the capital spend for the further development of the systems that are transferred. And it's completely consistent with our partner, GIP, and what we have told the market with respect to our sponsorship of CHKN, that we want to do drop-downs in a very favorable setting for the partnership. We own 41.25% of it. We don't intend to sell any units. And so this is going to be another form of capital that will benefit those investors and that partnership on an accretive basis and it will provide us the capital and capital relief from further expenditures as we go forward.

We hope you had time to review Monday's operational release and yesterday's financial release. We always strive to provide the most detailed information in the industry to our investors. On the operational s",2262,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning to you all. We hope you had time to review Monday's operational release and yesterday's financial release. We always strive to provide the most detailed information in the industry to our investors. 
On the operational side, our daily production for the first quarter was very strong at 2.8 Bcfe, up 14% year-over-year, and that's after selling a significant amount of production through various VPPs, asset sales and our Barnett joint venture deal with Total. On a sequential basis, our production was up 8%, and most importantly, our liquids production was up 41% year-over-year.
Because of the strength of our drilling program and the outstanding performance of our wells, we are increasing our 2010 and 2011 production growth forecast to 13% for 2010 and 18% for 2011. Much of that growth will come from our rapidly increasing liquids production. In fact, we expect our liquids production to increase by 60% in 2010 and 80% in 2011, both of which are remarkable numbers, especially for a company of our size.
Next, I'd like to highlight our exceptionally low finding cost rate in for the first half of the year. We added a net 1.2 Tcfe at a drilling and completion cost of only $0.87 per Mcfe. I don't believe there's another company in the industry as capable of adding 2.5 to 3 Tcf per year to there proved reserves at under $1 per Mcfe. And this success has been achieved by the nation's most active and highest quality drilling program, led by our industry-leading leasehold positions in America's best unconventional natural gas liquids plays. 
The growth in our liquids production and in our proved reserves and our planned slowdown in natural gas drilling are our most important messages today.  I want to make clear, in fact, crystal clear that Chesapeake is pursuing a differentiated growth model for many of our colleagues in the industry. The CHK model is not a commitment to increasing gas productions without regard to natural gas prices. Quite the opposite, in fact. Unless gas prices increase over $6 per MCF, Chesapeake is committed to continuing to reduce its gas drilling CapEx, increase its liquids drilling CapEx. 
In fact, in 2011, we will see an $800-million swing as we reduce gas CapEx by $400 million and increase liquids CapEx by that same $400 million, all the while planning to keep year-over-year CapEx flat. I'll repeat, we are reducing natural gas CapEx, while increasing liquids CapEx, while planning to keep overall drilling CapEx flat in 2011 versus 2010.
With regard to the oil and liquids plays that will drive Chesapeake's growth model in the years ahead, I want to remind you that we started to make this transition back in 2008 when it became clear to us that oil prices were likely to outperform natural gas prices for a long time to come. However, because of the long lead time in developing the technological expertise to find and test unconventional oil plays and the length of time it takes to put leasehold plays together, it is only now that we are really starting to see the payoff from the strategy shift that we initiated in 2008.
This will be the single largest strategy shift in Chesapeake's history. And once it has been completed during the next few years, it will generate huge benefits to our shareholders. And we believe that unlike with natural gas, Chesapeake's success in finding large new reserves of unconventional oil in the U.S. will not negatively affect oil prices. Obviously, this has not been the case with our large discoveries of unconventional natural gas during the past few years.
One final thought on our liquids plays. For now, we are disclosing the names and locations of 12 of these plays, but there are more on the way. In these 12 plays, we have drilled about 280 wells and have a amassed an industry-leading position of 2.4 million acres, on which we have identified more than 8 billion barrels of potential unrisk liquids-rich resources. 
We now own the largest inventory of leasehold in two of the top three new unconventional liquids plays in Niobrara and the Eagle Ford Shale, where we now on 675,000 and 550,000 net acres, respectively, located very strategically in the liquids-rich portion of each play. We are especially pleased about our position in the Eagle Ford and are very excited to move forward with the JV on this acreage. We are in good position here with many potential partners, all of whom we believe are working hard to get to the right answer.
Speaking of acreage, I am well aware of the huge amount of capital we have laid out for acreage so far this year as we transition away from our former gas-only strategy and towards our more balanced gas-and-oil strategy. First of all, some of our gassy peers have chosen not to make this transition and appear willing to take their chances with future gas prices. That is a risk to which I am not willing to expose our investors.
On the other hand, if you believe oil and NGL prices will be much stronger than gas prices for a long time into the future, as we do, then you have two choices: You can either buy your way into more liquids production through acquisitions, or you can organically grow your way into more liquids production through leasing and drilling. The first approach is one that has been taken by some companies recently, but it is a very, very expensive route. We prefer the second approach, provided it is onshore and in the U.S.A. 
We started building the foundation for this transition back in 2008 with our discovery of the Granite Wash play in Western Oklahoma. During the past two years, our move to oil has been gaining momentum until this year, when the pace greatly quickened as about 10 new oil plays developed either under our initiative or, in a few cases, by some of our peers.
My review of the recent history of the unconventional gas business tells me that it took only about three years from the confirmation of the Barnett size and the Fayetteville discovery in 2005 to the discovery of the Haynesville, Marcellus and down-dip Eagle Ford in 2007 and 2008. I hope you'll recognize that there hasn't been another big unconventional gas play since those discoveries of two years ago.
If you didn't play big in those three years from 2005 to 2008, then you are left behind or relegated to paying big premiums to established positions in these premier new unconventional gas plays. Paying up after the fact can work just fine for big international companies, but it doesn't work for us. 
In moving from unconventional gas history to thinking more about how the history of unconventional liquids will be written, it was my assessment that 2010 would be the year that companies either lockdown positions in this big new liquids plays or were left out and left behind or perhaps relegated to paying very big premiums down the road. I decided that Chesapeake had to play, while costs were still affordable for companies of our size, and we have played in a big way. While we still have more leasing to complete in the second half of 2010, the spend will not be as heavy as it was in the first half. 
Furthermore, starting in the third quarter of 2010, we will begin selling off minority positions in some of these new oil plays to recover much, if not all, of our initial leasehold investment. That process will continue into 2011. And when it's all said and done, we will have locked down the best unconventional liquids position in the industry and we will have very low remaining costs in our retained acreage. If you do not believe that we are capable of this, then I respectfully refer you to the $10 billion of joint ventures we entered into in the big four shale gas plays in 2008 and in early 2009, in which we sold about $2 billion of leasehold cost for $10 billion in value.
There is one more aspect of our leasehold buying and selling I'd like to discuss. For CHK tax reasons and for partner cash flow reasons, when we sell acreage into a JV, we only receive a portion of the total consideration in upfront cash. The rest comes in drilling carries over time, i.e., a reduction in our CapEx for drilling. For starters, we can't book this drilling carries as receivables because their contingent on us drilling wells to earn the carry. That's always a disappointment as our financial statements do not reflect these very big and very valuable drilling carry, which total right now about $3 billion. I can assure you that we will drill the wells over time, and we will receive this cash. 
However, when we receive the cash, we record it as a reduction in our drilling CapEx, not as a reduction in our leasehold CapEx. However, it is in fact very much a recovery of leasehold CapEx that has simply been triggered by drilling, but that's not the way it shows up on our financial statements.
Since many analysts routinely kick out our carries in their analysis of our finding costs because to them they are somehow not real, we end up with the worst of all world. Our industry-leading low finding costs are virtually disregarded, and our industry-leading leasehold CapEx investments are overstated by the amount of the drilling carries received. 
Therefore, our true leasehold CapEx should always be evaluated by looking at what we spend, less what we collect in upfront cash and then also less what we will collect in future drilling carries. This is a big issue, and I hope you will now have a better appreciation of how our leasehold CapEx is always overstated and in my view, therefore, very likely underappreciated as our number one profit center over the years.
One more thing in regard to profit centers, I do hope you will recognize that our cash hedging gains since 2001 have now reached $5.4 billion. I offer congratulations to the other two members of the hedging committee, they are here with me today, Marc Rowland and Jeff Mobley. We have delivered outstanding value to investors here in far greater amounts than anyone else in the industry has, and I do believe this is a vastly underappreciated aspect of management's performance over time.
So I'd like to close my commentary with reading you an excerpt from our press release that we believe very clearly states what we are seeking to accomplish this year and in the years ahead. We plan to reduce drilling and natural gas well, except for those required to hold leasehold by production or to use a drilling carry provided by a joint venture partner until such time as natural gas prices rise above $6 per MCF. 
We plan to lease and develop substantial new liquids-rich plays in which the company can acquire very large leasehold positions of 250,000 to 750,000 net acres. Within one year of acquisition, we plan to sell a minority position in a new play recovering all or virtually all of the costs acquired to leasehold in the play and to fund a significant portion of Chesapeake's future drilling costs in the play. 
We plan to accelerate drilling of liquids-rich plays until year-end 2012, when the company's drilling capital expenditures are balanced, approximately 50-50 between natural gas and liquids. We plan to continue adding proved reserves, net of monetizations and divestitures, of approximately 2.5 to 3.0 Tcfe or up to 500 million barrels annually. And we project by the end of 2012, we are likely to own 18 Tcf of proved reserves and about 1 billion barrels of oil. I encourage you to consider what that would be worth. 
And finally, we plan to accomplish these goals without the issuance of additional equity and with a reduction of debt levels, such that the company becomes investment grade within the next few years.  The key challenge we face in implementing this strategy is to allocate capital between our very large gas asset base and our emerging unconventional liquids plays. 
We have considerable gas drilling that we need to drill to earn the $3 billion of outstanding carries and also to hold very valuable and very high-quality gas acreage, but we also have tremendous opportunities in new unconventional liquids plays. These two activities result in very large capital needs. Fortunately, our assets are exceptional, and we've been able to attract partners, or expect to, who will finance much of our new liquids projects.
Because our assets are so valuable, we will be able to accomplish the oil and gas industry hat trick in the years ahead. We will grow reserves and production by 13% to 18% annually, reduce leverage and not issue any additional equity. Our assets give us the ability to use a range of asset-level financing tools to raise money at significant premiums to our cost bases in these assets. 
In summary, having helped to revolutionize the onshore U.S. natural gas business, we look forward to doing the same for the U.S. oil business, but we will do so receiving $10 to $15 per production unit versus the $4 to $5 per production unit we're receiving for our gas right now. This brighter, more profitable tomorrow cannot arrive soon enough for me. 
This completes my commentary, and I'll now turn the call over to Marc.

Also, one that's a lot of attractive financing transactions. 
Notably, we completed in May the issuance of $2.6 billion of cumulative convertible preferred stock, including approximately $1.5 billion that was sold to prominent Asian investors for the first time ever. We used the proceeds to redeem $1.3 billion of senior notes in June, and additional $0.6 billion of notes that were redeemed in July after the quarter closed. The remaining proceeds were used to reduce our bank debt. So with the issuance of $2.6 billion of face amount of preferred, we reduced our debt by a similar amount.
In June, we closed on our VPP number seven, or volumetric production payment, for $322 million of proceeds or about $8.75 per Mcf equivalent for around 38 Bcf of sales. Obviously, monetization at a rate well above what our company is valued at in total. We also concluded two other asset sales that we had spoke about earlier in the year for $330 million in proceeds, one in the Permian Basin and one in the Appalachian area. 
So a busy quarter that resulted in end of quarter cash and undrawn credit facilities of $2.8 billion. As Aubrey noted, our hedging gains over the last many years, particularly powerful in quarter two, giving us an additional unrealized cash revenues of $2.26 per Mcf equivalent. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we were successful in launching our Chesapeake Midstream Partners' IPO, New York Stock Exchange symbol CHKM. We priced 21.25 million primary units at $21 per unit, the high end of our expected range. Today, those units are trading for about $23, giving CHKM an enterprise value of around $3.2 billion or $1.34 billion to Chesapeake's 41.45% interest. 
There's nearly $1 billion of cash and unused credit facilities to accomplish CHK drop-down acquisitions or other acquisitions inside of CHKM, something we intend to pursue in the near future. And as a sidebar to that, our remaining Midstream assets that were not put in CHKM have nearly the identical production profile as the assets that we've transferred to date.
You may have also noticed that last night we announced a cash tender offer for an additional aggregate $1.5 billion of senior notes of various maturities. We intend to finance these with notes of longer maturities and the tenders conditions on our successfully placing these notes in the near future.
I would end by saying our finding costs, the power of our joint ventures and substantial remaining drilling carries, along with the other ventures we are pursuing, particularly in the Eagle Ford and in the Midstream, lead us to be in excellent position to continue with outsized returns on our invested capital. 
Moderator, I turn it to questions please.

Plus lease partners have already put in a lot of capital into these plays to date. They're very PV-driven, and so we do not sense any interest from Statoil or in Total in what's going down. In fact, they encourage us to stay active and put their capital to work. And a lot of these carries are in areas remaining in the Marcellus and the Barnett, where we're still holding acreage by drilling new wells, and so there's that interplay that goes into that as well. And of course, if we're receiving the carry, even though gas prices are low right now, in our finding costs are so improved on that, that low costs doesn't really change our return very much at all.

So it's pretty tough for there to be a gas price not attractive to us. I would like to say that once the carries are used and once the acreage is HBP, then we move into a much different note and we've already said $6 is our bogey. And so we look forward to a time, a year from now, for example, in the Haynesville, when most of our acreage will be HBP. And if we need to, we can begin gearing down. In the Fayetteville, I remind you our drilling has gone down by half, seventeen to eight rigs. That's when we reached the point where we can comfortably kind of glide into the finished HBP position. So that will occur next in the Barnett after the Haynesville, and then next after that, the Marcellus. So at the mean time, a large portion of the industry drilling right now is for gas, anyway, is involuntary as it works to HBP leasehold, and most of those leasehold positions were established in '06, '07 and '08. And the time to finished HBP in net acreage will be this year and next year, and after that, I think the industry moves into a much different drilling phase.

But at eight rigs, over the long period of time, it stays about the same. We're very comfortable with that. And in fact, if gas prices were a bit lower from here and our investment drilling is completely discretionary in the Fayetteville, we're comfortable reducing it further. I mean, we've reduced our drilling everywhere else in the company, except for a deep springer play in Western Oklahoma, where we are close to another carry arrangement there. So essentially, 100% of our drilling in shale play or in gas plays today is either carried by -- is in an area where there is a substantial carry of 75% of our costs, or is in an area like the Fayetteville where we already cut drilling dramatically, or is in the Haynesville where we are a year away from being able to start driving down.

If you include just leasehold sales, we will not cover all of the CapEx that's been extended to date, that's because we were spending money on several plays that we won't be able to JV until 2011. So I kind of believe these things are over a full year cycle. We bought our first lease in the Eagle Ford in November of 2008, and we're at 855 acres today less than a year later. And I think within a year of having bought that first lease, that we will have executed the transaction and recovered a good bit of our leasehold expenditures. And I think that's a model that will work well for us going forward. So it won't always fit into the handy definition of a year. But also, I really do believe that this will end up being a lot like the gas plays, where they come at you fast and heavy and over the course of it took three years for gas plays to emerge and once the industry found out this kind of rock will work, and now the industry has found out a different kind of rock will work to move oil molecule through and at the pace at which life moves today, I think that three-year timeframe is probably going to be collapsed down to a year, a year and a half. And again, you either play or you don't play. And we've chosen to play and then to be risked by bringing new partners.

And that's predicated on basically the continuation of what we have, which is strong oil markets. I suspect it's stronger, just have to look no further than what's happening in China again. You go back five years and look at what their oil consumption was. I think very few people would've guessed that five years later, they would be at 9 million barrels a day. Nobody seems to believe that in five more years, China could be at 15 million barrels a day, but that's, I think, unavoidable. And when you look at that and you look at what's happening in other Asian countries and you look at oil consumption stabilizing in the OIC countries, then I don't see how you get away from an analysis that said oil prices are going to be strong basically for a long time until this world figures out that you can substitute something cheaper for that oil, which is natural gas. And that's a very obvious fact that completely escapes apparently most American policymakers. But at some point, we're going to have to revisit that as we will be unable, in my view, to compete with China for oil supply in the years ahead. So I still feel that oil will be strong, gas will be kind of range bound here for another year or two. And so the industry is able to reduce its drilling and have more of its drilling become discretionary rather than non-discretionary, and for more coal-fired power to get converted to natural gas. And I think, hopefully, someday, we'll see some inroads on the transportation side. So I do feel like the gas coal switching floor has come up over the last year, so we're not talking about $3 gas price like last year. Today, we're talking about a switching price of about $4. And hopefully, next year can it'll be a little higher as well. So we're just doing what I think anybody would do. You can go out and spend money and find a unit that you can sell for $4. Or you can go out and spend money and finding a unit yourself for $14. And our problem before was we just didn't find -- we didn't think we can find any of the $14 unit. Now we know we can find them and is as quickly as possible, we're making that acceleration in transition over from $4 units to $14 units. And when you ask about the ultimate goal, the ultimate goal is to make a bunch more money doing what we're doing. And the way to do that is to replace $4 unit to $14 unit.

But the only public announcement we've made is that we're looking at a leasehold block in South Africa, and there are many reasons to look at that. But for us, the primary one is to develop a relationship with Sasol and to maybe work with Statoil and Sasol and hopefully, achieve the holy grail in the Gas business, which would be to turn natural gas into a liquid transportation fuel. I've spent a lot of my time in the last few years trying to get the U.S. transportation switched over from a liquid-based system to gas-based system, and maybe it would be a lot easier to take the fuel and transition it from gas to liquids, and force that conversion where I've been trying to force the conversion of large segments of the U.S. transportation system from liquid to gas.

Guidance, I think, for that, of course, it shows up in our 10-Q and 10-K all of the time. For Q2, our natural gas and oil properties we had capitalized interest of $171 million. And then with G&G, which is a separate pool and some of our construction, which is very minor on Midstream assets, the total was $178.8 million for the quarter. Most of the folks that follow us, particularly on the debt side, of course, extract that back out. We always show it clearly in our filings with the SEC and put it into interest expense for a calculated basis, so for an adjusted basis. So anyway, I don't know how else to say. It was $161 million last quarter, $178 million, and if you go back a year ago, it was basically not too much different, $152 million in the second quarter of 2009.

So I think it's difficult for us to escape the gravitational pull of oil or the gravitational pull of low gas prices until we prove that the transition of oil will work. So I just encourage people to look at it this way. By the end of 2012 to latest, 2013, the company's going to have 24 tcfe, same share count and less debt. So today, our enterprise value is $21 billion. So just tell me if in two and a half years that 24 tcf of gas is worth $29 billion. I kind of doubt it. And I think it is worth more like $50 billion to $60 billion. And if that's oil or the same, even the share count has only increased by employee stock grants, then it doesn't take a very smart person to do the math on dividing $50 billion by our number of shares outstanding and seeing where you end up in two and a half years. It's completely mechanical, as it does not require a new discovery, it doesn't require a new slug of capital. It doesn't require anything other than really, in our 9,000 colleagues show up for work everyday and continue to deliver reserve growth of 2.5 to 3 tcfe a year. We create every year a new company inside our own company that the market would capitalize at $8 billion to $10 billion. And you can ignore that for a while.

We will size them and assign a tender to them to maximize the oil-gas relationship and to maximize the sweet part of the market for what we see the economic demand. Right now, we're seeing probably as much interest as we ever have and I think the reason for that is at least partly, the nature of the banks being heavy on capital and light on investment opportunities. And remember, while the rating agencies might consider part of these to be debt for GAAP purposes, there are sale the reserves are taking off. We have no dollar obligation going back to '06 when we did our first VPP. There's never been one month in any VPP where the production wasn't satisfied from the curve that we sold to the investor. Today, the capital rate on those is probably close to what our bonds trade at. I would think a five-year VPP probably could come inside a 7.5% pretty easily. And think about what the investors are getting for 7.5% and a 50 bps two-year treasury market, we're getting an investment-grade product that is completely bankruptcy proof. They own the assets, it's fully hedged. And so that becomes a secured hard asset loan for them, which is really an investment, obviously, because they don't book it as a loan. And so there's a lot of demand for that product. And we've continued to work with the big financial institutions that we've sold to in the past.

Where I think we'll be from a guidance on drop-downs is that I think we'll be in a position to do a couple of them per year at anywhere from $250 million to $500 million each in size and that they'll either be part of one of our systems like Haynesville, or Fayetteville, or other opportunities. And not only will we receive capital in that scenario, but then, that will in turn, reduce the capital spend for the further development of the systems that are transferred. And it's completely consistent with our partner, GIP, and what we have told the market with respect to our sponsorship of CHKN, that we want to do drop-downs in a very favorable setting for the partnership. We own 41.25% of it. We don't intend to sell any units. And so this is going to be another form of capital that will benefit those investors and that partnership on an accretive basis and it will provide us the capital and capital relief from further expenditures as we go forward.

Thank you, Jeff. We hope you had time to review yesterday's operational and financial release, and we're pleased with our results.
On the operational side, our daily production for the second quarter was very strong at 3.0 Bcfe, up 23% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. An added highlight is our rapidly growing liquids production, which was up 50% year-over-year.
We are currently producing more than 55,000 barrels of liquids per day and have our sights set on exceeding 150,000 barrels per day by year end 2012 and 250,000 barrels per day by year end 2015. We think that will make us a top five producer of liquids in the U.S. by the end of 2005.
Next, I'd like to highlight our exceptionally low finding cost during the first nine months of the year. We added, on a gross basis, 4.0 Tcfe of proved reserves at a drilling and completion cost of only $0.97 per Mcfe. Basically, we are building a top 10 U.S. natural gas producer every year inside our company, an incredible achievement we believe.
And not only are we good at finding gas cheaply at the $0.97 per Mcfe level, we are also good at selling it for much more. To date this year, we have received well north of $3 per Mcfe when we have sold properties through VPPs. It's always good to buy low and sell high, and that's what we try to do around here, whether it's leasehold or proved reserves.

And our data room is open for the Niobrara Shale JV, in which we own 800,000 net acres, evenly split between the Powder River and D-J Basins. We expect to also sell a 33% working interest in this play at what we believe will be an attractive price both to us and to our future partner.
We believe the recoverable resource under our 800,000 net acres is an unrisked approximate 4.6 billion barrels of oil, representing potentially $400 billion of future undiscounted revenue. This is a reminder that the size of the plays that we have chased and have captured is quite remarkable.
Some of you may be wondering what's next in our liquids plays. I can tell you that we have several new plays under evaluation or development, including an almost 100,000-acre new position in the Williston Basin and a 1 million-acre position in another play that will probably be ready for disclosure in the JV data room in the first half of 2011. We believe there will be worldwide interest in this next big play of ours.
One other thing. On the Anschutz deal, we will be selling about 25% of the assets we acquired that aren't a great fit for us. We'll do that as soon as we can after we close. And then with what's left, we'll combine it with some other acreage we have then do a JV in the first half of 2011. I know that several analysts were confused on this point, so I thought we should clear it up.
Finally, I'd like to point out that our realized cash hedging gains since 2001 now reached almost $6 billion. In addition, we have hedged approximately 80% of our anticipated gas production in the first half of 2011 with swaps at an average strike price of $6.35 per Mcf and approximately 43% in the second half of 2011, the swaps at an average strike price of $6.61 per Mcf. If today's 2011 strip holds true, we should record another $1.5 billion in hedging gains in 2011.
That $1.5 billion, along with an expected $2 billion in drilling carried in 2011, will provide Chesapeake with $3.5 billion in cash from two important competitive advantages and what most expect will be a tough industry environment in 2011. We also expect to generate more than $1.5 billion in cash and $1.5 billion in additional drilling carries from two new JVs that we should close in 2011. So that's a total of $6.5 billion in competitive advantages before we even consider the expected $3.5 billion in operating cash flow we should generate in 2011 without any hedges.
We are a resourceful management team. We relish tough operating environments. We take pride in what we have built. And we look forward to additional opportunities that may come our way in 2011. 
This completes my commentary. And I'll now turn the call over to Nick Dell'Osso, our CFO."
323857,114165189,85225,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Aubrey. Good morning. I'm pleased to be joining you on the conference call as Chesapeake's new CFO. As Aubrey discussed and I'm sure you have seen in our earnings release, Q3 was another successful quarter for CHK. A couple of quick items I will",756,"Thanks, Aubrey. Good morning. I'm pleased to be joining you on the conference call as Chesapeake's new CFO. As Aubrey discussed and I'm sure you have seen in our earnings release, Q3 was another successful quarter for CHK. 
A couple of quick items I will point out in addition to Aubrey's comments are a continued decrease in LOE per Mcfe, which came in this quarter at $0.95 per Mcfe, as well as our finding cost at $0.97 per Mcfe. If you'd like to consider what it takes Chesapeake to find oil and gas on an organic basis, without the effect of our drilling carries, it comes to $1.16 per Mcfe.
We achieved these low cost through four major advantages. First, we have a top one or two leasehold position in every important unconventional play in the U.S. Second, we have drilled more horizontal wells than anyone else in the world. Third, we are vertically integrated through most of our key service needs. And fourth, we have a size and scale that lends itself to great efficiency in our drilling and production processes.
The third quarter was also a very productive period for us on the financing front as we completed the balance sheet restructuring made possible by our preferred equity offering, which closed in June of this year. The net effect of this series of transactions is to have added $2.6 billion of equity to our balance sheet, have reduced long-term debt by $1.4 billion and retired or redeemed all bonds that were issued under our older, more restrictive form of indenture. Just to remind you, this was the first step in our ongoing multi-year strategy of balance sheet improvement.
Additionally, I'd like to point out the closing of our eight volumetric production payment transaction on September 30 for $1.15 billion in proceeds. This represents the sale of 390 Bcf of gas over five years from our Barnett Shale production, monetized at the strip and adjusted for transportation cost. This brings our total VPP sales to $4.7 billion over the past three years at a realized price of $4.50 per Mcfe. This compares favorably to the value of the reserves left in the ground or sold at current natural gas prices, plus we've kept the upside, kept the tail and paid no taxes on the proceeds. Furthermore, these sales of primarily gas assets have helped us fund our aggressive and timely shift to a more liquids-focused portfolio.
Looking forward, we are excited about continuing to build one of the industry's leading unconventional liquids plays. And I would like to highlight our guidance attached to last night's earnings release in which we have estimated 80% and 60% growth in liquids in 2011 and 2012, respectively.
This is an increase to our liquids production guidance for 2012 made possible by gaining clarity on the development plan associated with our pending transaction with Xenon and our confidence in achieving an attractive JV for our Niobrara acreage. Additionally, we believe we will have a JV in the first half of 2011 on a new, very large liquids prospect that we have not yet publicly identified.
We have also begun the renewal process for our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, and we'll be looking to wrap that up in the next few weeks. The existing facility was set to mature in November of 2012, so we chose to enter the market now and have the new facility, which will again have a five-year maturity, sewn up well in advance of the existing facility becoming a current obligation on our balance sheet. 
The reception, thus far, has been very strong. We expect the deal will be slightly larger than the current facility to reflect the company's increased scale of operations since 2007, and we'll have improved commercial terms for CHK's benefit. But generally, it will be a very similar facility to what we have in place today.
Finally, as Aubrey discussed, I'd like to reiterate that our hedging program has locked in prices for 2011 that averaged approximately $2.15 over the current strip, around 60% of our projected gas production for the year and 80% of our projected gas production for the first half of '11.
By the end of 2011, our cash gains since initiating our hedging program since 2001 will be exceed $7.5 billion. I personally look forward to taking a more active role at Chesapeake in continuing to lead the industry in this important area of risk mitigation and value creation.
Operator, we're now ready for questions. Thank you."

We're always going to have a backlog. I've heard commentary from some other companies that they are having a hard time getting wells frac-ed or whatever their excuse might be at the time. We just view that as a normal part of our business. It's one of the reasons why we're vertically integrated. We've got the fifth largest drilling contracting company in America. We're the second largest compression company in America. We have our own trucking company. We have a lot of specialized-service companies that do things for us. We own 26% of Frac Tech. And given our scale, we think we're generally able to step to the front of the line with most service companies, and we're their biggest North American customer, generally, by far. We think we're doing fine. We'll always have a backlog, but I don't view that this is much different than it's been over the last couple of years, where backlogs have ebbed and flowed."

So you're seeing a lot of companies starting to come up with -- well, we can't make our growth targets, because we got to go sell assets, and when you include the asset sale, there is no growth. And what we've been able to show is that we think asset sales are important and vital and an everyday part of what we do to fund the business and also to monetize older assets. And we've chosen to do so through VPPs. The rating agencies don't care for them, but that's not what has to be the ultimate driver. The ultimate driver has to be what's the best way to create value and through asset monetizations. And we think the benefits, which Nick talked about, of keeping the upside, keeping the tail and not paying taxes on them are pretty important issues to keep in mind. So we want you to remember that as we talk about out-year growth of 18%, that is after asset sales that take care of any funding gap that we might have.

Let's talk about, first of all, the change in production guidance. For 2010, we did previously have just a spot number for our oil production at 19 million barrels. We went ahead and added a range there of 18 million to 19 m",369,"You bet. Good question, Steve. Let's talk about, first of all, the change in production guidance. For 2010, we did previously have just a spot number for our oil production at 19 million barrels. We went ahead and added a range there of 18 million to 19 million, and that really reflects some ethane rejection that occurred that took our NGL barrels down. We haven't properly accounted for that in our models and now are doing a better job of that. And then also some pickup delays related to some Midstream activity. So we'll see where we come out there, but we felt like it was prudent to put a range in rather than just a spot number of 19 million barrels. And then in 2012, I think Nick mentioned this, but just greater clarity on some of our plays, particularly the Eagle Ford, and I think I might have mentioned the Niobrara as well. So that's been able to give us that clarity. What's that mean with regard to our thoughts about gas prices? I mean, I think we just have to live with today's reality, which is the projection for gas prices going forward and comparing that to the curve would make anybody with a choice of drilling an oil well or drilling a gas well be inclined to drill an oil well. And so that's what we're doing. And then three years ago or so, we were a single-product company focused only on natural gas. We didn't really think we could find oil in any meaningful quantities. We didn't want to go out and buy it. But all that's changed in the last three years, and we have figured out a way to find liquids. And so we're going to back down our gas drilling over time. And again, as I mentioned before, we'll be down to a third of our drilling in 2012 will be gas compared to 90% last year. If gas prices rebound and the country says we need more gas, we can absolutely respond to that very quickly. But right now, the focus is on oil, because it's 3x or 4x more profitable to look for it than it is natural gas."

We hope you've had time to review yesterday's operational and financial release, and we're pleased with our results.On the operational side, our daily production for the second quarter was very strong at 3.0 Bcfe, up 23% y",752,"Good morning. Thank you, Jeff. We hope you've had time to review yesterday's operational and financial release, and we're pleased with our results.
On the operational side, our daily production for the second quarter was very strong at 3.0 Bcfe, up 23% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. An added highlight is our rapidly growing liquids production, which was up 50% year-over-year.
We are currently producing more than 55,000 barrels of liquids per day and have our sights set on exceeding 150,000 barrels per day by year end 2012 and 250,000 barrels per day by year end 2015. We think that will make us a top five producer of liquids in the U.S. by the end of 2005 (sic).
Next, I'd like to highlight our exceptionally low finding costs during the first nine months of the year. We added, on a gross basis, 4.0 Tcfe of proved reserves at a drilling and completion cost of only $0.97 per Mcfe. Basically, we are building a top 10 U.S. natural gas producer every year inside our company, an incredible achievement we believe.
And not only are we good at finding gas cheaply at the $0.97 per Mcfe level, we are also good at selling it for much more. To date this year, we have received well north of $3 per Mcfe when we have sold properties through VPPs. It's always good to buy low and sell high, and that's what we try to do around here, whether it's leasehold or proved reserves. 
Our latest JV, the CNOOC deal in the Eagle Ford, is expected to close in the near future. And our data room is open for the Niobrara Shale JV, in which we own 800,000 net acres, evenly split between the Powder River and D-J Basins. We expect to also sell a 33% working interest in this play at what we believe will be an attractive price both to us and to our future partner.
We believe the recoverable resource under our 800,000 net acres is an unrisked approximate 4.6 billion barrels of oil, representing potentially $400 billion of future undiscounted revenue. This is a reminder that the size of the plays that we have chased and have captured is quite remarkable.
Some of you may be wondering what's next in our liquids plays. I can tell you that we have several new plays under evaluation or development, including an almost 100,000-acre new position in the Williston Basin and a 1 million-acre position in another play that will probably be ready for disclosure in a JV data room in the first half of 2011. We believe there will be worldwide interest in this next big play of ours.
One other thing. On the Anschutz deal, we will be selling about 25% of the assets we acquired that aren't a great fit for us. We'll do that as soon as we can after we close. And then with what's left, we'll combine it with some other acreage we have and do a JV in the first half of 2011. I noticed several analysts were confused on this point, so I thought we should clear it up.
Finally, I'd like to point out that our realized cash hedging gains since 2001 now reach almost $6 billion. In addition, we have hedged approximately 80% of our anticipated gas production the first half of 2011 with swaps at an average strike price of $6.35 per Mcf and approximately 43% in the second half of 2011, with swaps at an average strike price of $6.61 per Mcf. If today's 2011 strip holds true, we should record another $1.5 billion in hedging gains in 2011.
That $1.5 billion, along with an expected $2 billion in drilling carries in 2011, will provide Chesapeake with $3.5 billion in cash from two important competitive advantages in what most expect will be a tough industry environment in 2011. We also expect to generate more than $1.5 billion in cash and $1.5 billion in additional drilling carries from two new JVs that we should close in 2011. So that's a total of $6.5 billion in competitive advantages before we even consider the expected $3.5 billion in operating cash flow we should generate in 2011 without any hedges.
We are a resourceful management team. We relish tough operating environments. We take pride in what we have built. And we look forward to additional opportunities that may come our way in 2011. 
This completes my commentary. And I'll now turn the call over to Nick Dell'Osso, our CFO."
323857,114165189,85497,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Aubrey. Good morning. I'm pleased to be joining you on the conference call as Chesapeake's new CFO. As Aubrey discussed and I'm sure you have seen in our earnings release, Q3 was another successful quarter for CHK. A couple of quick items I will",755,"Thanks, Aubrey. Good morning. I'm pleased to be joining you on the conference call as Chesapeake's new CFO. As Aubrey discussed and I'm sure you have seen in our earnings release, Q3 was another successful quarter for CHK. 
A couple of quick items I will point out in addition to Aubrey's comments are a continued decrease in LOE per Mcfe, which came in this quarter at $0.95 per Mcfe, as well as our finding costs at $0.97 per Mcfe. If you'd like to consider what it takes Chesapeake to find oil and gas on an organic basis, without the effect of our drilling carries, it comes to $1.16 per Mcfe.
We achieved these low costs through four major advantages. First, we have a top one or two leasehold position in every important unconventional play in the U.S. Second, we have drilled more horizontal wells than anyone else in the world. Third, we are vertically integrated through most of our key service needs. And fourth, we have a size and scale that lends itself to great efficiency in our drilling and production processes.
The third quarter was also a very productive period for us on the financing front as we completed the balance sheet restructuring made possible by our preferred equity offering, which closed in June of this year. The net effect of this series of transactions is to have added $2.6 billion of equity to our balance sheet, have reduced long-term debt by $1.4 billion and retired or redeemed all bonds that were issued under our older, more restrictive form of indenture. Just to remind you, this was the first step in our ongoing, multi-year strategy of balance sheet improvement.
Additionally, I'd like to point out the closing of our eight volumetric production payment transaction on September 30 for $1.15 billion in proceeds. This represents the sale of 390 Bcf of gas over five years from our Barnett Shale production, monetized at the strip and adjusted for transportation costs. This brings our total VPP sales to $4.7 billion over the past three years at a realized price of $4.50 per Mcfe. This compares favorably to the value of the reserves left in the ground or sold at current natural gas prices, plus we've kept the upside, kept the tail and paid no taxes on the proceeds. Furthermore, these sales of primarily gas assets have helped us fund our aggressive and timely shift to a more liquids-focused portfolio.
Looking forward, we are excited about continuing to build one of the industry's leading unconventional liquids plays. And I would like to highlight our guidance attached to last night's earnings release in which we have estimated 80% and 60% growth in liquids in 2011 and 2012, respectively.
This is an increase to our liquids production guidance for 2012, made possible by gaining clarity on the development plan associated with our pending transaction with CNOOC and our confidence in achieving an attractive JV for our Niobrara acreage. Additionally, we believe we will have a JV in the first half of 2011 on a new, very large, liquids prospect that we have not yet publicly identified.
We have also begun the renewal process for our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, and we'll be looking to wrap that up in the next few weeks. The existing facility was set to mature in November of 2012, so we chose to enter the market now and have the new facility, which will again have a five-year maturity, sewn up well in advance of the existing facility becoming a current obligation on our balance sheet. 
The reception, thus far, has been very strong. We expect the deal will be slightly larger than the current facility to reflect the company's increased scale of operations since 2007, and we'll have improved commercial terms for CHK's benefit. But generally, it will be a very similar facility to what we have in place today.
Finally, as Aubrey discussed, I'd like to reiterate that our hedging program has locked in prices for 2011 that average approximately $2.15 over the current strip, on 60% of our projected gas production for the year and 80% of our projected gas production for the first half of '11.
By the end of 2011, our cash gains since initiating our hedging program in 2001 will exceed $7.5 billion. I personally look forward to taking a more active role at Chesapeake in continuing to lead the industry in this important area of risk mitigation and value creation.

They have a lot of questions about what those JVs mean, but they don't necessarily view those any differently than the rest of you guys would. VPPs, we've had lengthy discussions with the agencies on this point, and they continue to view them as debt. Again, we sell the reserves, transfer title to them, we take the reserves off our books. The only obligation we have ongoing is to be a prudent operator of the property, and they are a partner in the property like anyone else is. We do have the obligation, as they are now a royalty owner in the property, to pay their operating costs. So that's no different, really, than any other royalty owner. And if you think about the way that those guys are going to look at it as debt, one of the things that we always scratched our head about is if we do a VPP in a gas price environment of 2011, where the strip is going to average something in the, let's call it, mid-fives to low fives, versus having done a VPP in 2000 -- first off in 2008, where the strip was much higher than that, it's actually going to result in more debt in 2008 than in 2011 for the same property, just because the price was higher.

Those are after projected asset sales. So you're seeing a lot of companies starting to come up with, ""Well, we can't make our growth targets, because we got to go sell assets."" And when you include the asset sale, there is no growth. And what we've been able to show is that we think asset sales are an important and vital and everyday part of what we do to fund the business and also to monetize older assets. And we've chosen to do so through VPPs. The rating agencies don't care for them, but that's not what has to be the ultimate driver. The ultimate driver has to be what's the best way to create value and through asset monetizations. And we think the benefits, which Nick talked about, of keeping the upside, keeping the tail and not paying taxes on them are pretty important issues to keep in mind. So we want you to remember that, as we talk about out-year growth of 18%, that is after asset sales that take care of any funding gap that we might have. So converting leasehold into PDP is what the machine does around here. We've got the capability of doing that of up to 4 Tcf per year, and we'll continue to do that year after year."

For 2010, we did previously have just a spot number for our oil production at 19 million barrels. We went ahead and added a range there of 18 million to 19 million, and that really reflects some ethane rejection that occurred that took our NGL barrels down. We hadn't properly accounted for that in our models and now are doing a better job of that. And then also some hookup delays related to some midstream activity. So we'll see where we come out there. But we felt like it was prudent to put a range in rather than just a spot number of 19 million barrels. And then in 2012, I think Nick mentioned this, but just greater clarity on some of our plays, particularly the Eagle Ford, and I think I might have mentioned the Niobrara as well. So that's been able to give us that clarity. What's that mean with regard to our thoughts about gas prices? I mean, I think we just have to live with today's reality, which is the projection for gas prices going forward, and comparing that to the curve would make anybody with a choice of drilling an oil well or drilling a gas well be inclined to drill an oil well. And so that's what we're doing. And then three years ago or so, we were a single-product company focused only on natural gas. We didn't really think we could find oil in any meaningful quantities. We didn't want to go out and buy it. But all that's changed in the last three years, and we have figured out a way to find liquids. And so we're going to back down our gas drilling over time. And again, as I mentioned before, we'll be down to a third of our drilling in 2012 will be gas compared to 90% last year. If gas prices rebound and the country says we need more gas, we can absolutely respond to that very quickly. But right now, the focus is on oil, because it's 3x or 4x more profitable to look for it than it is natural gas."

Thank you, Jeff. We hope you've had time to review yesterday's operational and financial release, and we're pleased with our results.
On the operational side, our daily production for the second quarter was very strong at 3.0 Bcfe, up 23% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. An added highlight is our rapidly growing liquids production, which was up 50% year-over-year.
We are currently producing more than 55,000 barrels of liquids per day and have our sights set on exceeding 150,000 barrels per day by year end 2012 and 250,000 barrels per day by year end 2015. We think that will make us a top five producer of liquids in the U.S. by the end of 2005 (sic).
Next, I'd like to highlight our exceptionally low finding costs during the first nine months of the year. We added, on a gross basis, 4.0 Tcfe of proved reserves at a drilling and completion cost of only $0.97 per Mcfe. Basically, we are building a top 10 U.S. natural gas producer every year inside our company, an incredible achievement we believe.
And not only are we good at finding gas cheaply at the $0.97 per Mcfe level, we are also good at selling it for much more. To date this year, we have received well north of $3 per Mcfe when we have sold properties through VPPs. It's always good to buy low and sell high, and that's what we try to do around here, whether it's leasehold or proved reserves. 
Our latest JV, the CNOOC deal in the Eagle Ford, is expected to close in the near future. And our data room is open for the Niobrara Shale JV, in which we own 800,000 net acres, evenly split between the Powder River and D-J Basins. We expect to also sell a 33% working interest in this play at what we believe will be an attractive price both to us and to our future partner.
We believe the recoverable resource under our 800,000 net acres is an unrisked approximate 4.6 billion barrels of oil, representing potentially $400 billion of future undiscounted revenue. This is a reminder that the size of the plays that we have chased and have captured is quite remarkable.
Some of you may be wondering what's next in our liquids plays. I can tell you that we have several new plays under evaluation or development, including an almost 100,000-acre new position in the Williston Basin and a 1 million-acre position in another play that will probably be ready for disclosure in a JV data room in the first half of 2011. We believe there will be worldwide interest in this next big play of ours.
One other thing. On the Anschutz deal, we will be selling about 25% of the assets we acquired that aren't a great fit for us. We'll do that as soon as we can after we close. And then with what's left, we'll combine it with some other acreage we have and do a JV in the first half of 2011. I noticed several analysts were confused on this point, so I thought we should clear it up.
Finally, I'd like to point out that our realized cash hedging gains since 2001 now reach almost $6 billion. In addition, we have hedged approximately 80% of our anticipated gas production the first half of 2011 with swaps at an average strike price of $6.35 per Mcf and approximately 43% in the second half of 2011, with swaps at an average strike price of $6.61 per Mcf. If today's 2011 strip holds true, we should record another $1.5 billion in hedging gains in 2011.
That $1.5 billion, along with an expected $2 billion in drilling carries in 2011, will provide Chesapeake with $3.5 billion in cash from two important competitive advantages in what most expect will be a tough industry environment in 2011. We also expect to generate more than $1.5 billion in cash and $1.5 billion in additional drilling carries from two new JVs that we should close in 2011. So that's a total of $6.5 billion in competitive advantages before we even consider the expected $3.5 billion in operating cash flow we should generate in 2011 without any hedges.
We are a resourceful management team. We relish tough operating environments. We take pride in what we have built. And we look forward to additional opportunities that may come our way in 2011. 
This completes my commentary. And I'll now turn the call over to Nick Dell'Osso, our CFO."
323857,114165189,85513,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Aubrey. Good morning. I'm pleased to be joining you on the conference call as Chesapeake's new CFO. As Aubrey discussed and I'm sure you have seen in our earnings release, Q3 was another successful quarter for CHK. A couple of quick items I will",755,"Thanks, Aubrey. Good morning. I'm pleased to be joining you on the conference call as Chesapeake's new CFO. As Aubrey discussed and I'm sure you have seen in our earnings release, Q3 was another successful quarter for CHK. 
A couple of quick items I will point out in addition to Aubrey's comments are a continued decrease in LOE per Mcfe, which came in this quarter at $0.95 per Mcfe, as well as our finding costs at $0.97 per Mcfe. If you'd like to consider what it takes Chesapeake to find oil and gas on an organic basis, without the effect of our drilling carries, it comes to $1.16 per Mcfe.
We achieved these low costs through four major advantages. First, we have a top one or two leasehold position in every important unconventional play in the U.S. Second, we have drilled more horizontal wells than anyone else in the world. Third, we are vertically integrated through most of our key service needs. And fourth, we have a size and scale that lends itself to great efficiency in our drilling and production processes.
The third quarter was also a very productive period for us on the financing front as we completed the balance sheet restructuring made possible by our preferred equity offering, which closed in June of this year. The net effect of this series of transactions is to have added $2.6 billion of equity to our balance sheet, have reduced long-term debt by $1.4 billion and retired or redeemed all bonds that were issued under our older, more restrictive form of indenture. Just to remind you, this was the first step in our ongoing, multi-year strategy of balance sheet improvement.
Additionally, I'd like to point out the closing of our eight volumetric production payment transaction on September 30 for $1.15 billion in proceeds. This represents the sale of 390 Bcf of gas over five years from our Barnett Shale production, monetized at the strip and adjusted for transportation costs. This brings our total VPP sales to $4.7 billion over the past three years at a realized price of $4.50 per Mcfe. This compares favorably to the value of the reserves left in the ground or sold at current natural gas prices, plus we've kept the upside, kept the tail and paid no taxes on the proceeds. Furthermore, these sales of primarily gas assets have helped us fund our aggressive and timely shift to a more liquids-focused portfolio.
Looking forward, we are excited about continuing to build one of the industry's leading unconventional liquids plays. And I would like to highlight our guidance attached to last night's earnings release in which we have estimated 80% and 60% growth in liquids in 2011 and 2012, respectively.
This is an increase to our liquids production guidance for 2012, made possible by gaining clarity on the development plan associated with our pending transaction with CNOOC and our confidence in achieving an attractive JV for our Niobrara acreage. Additionally, we believe we will have a JV in the first half of 2011 on a new, very large, liquids prospect that we have not yet publicly identified.
We have also begun the renewal process for our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, and we'll be looking to wrap that up in the next few weeks. The existing facility was set to mature in November of 2012, so we chose to enter the market now and have the new facility, which will again have a five-year maturity, sewn up well in advance of the existing facility becoming a current obligation on our balance sheet. 
The reception, thus far, has been very strong. We expect the deal will be slightly larger than the current facility to reflect the company's increased scale of operations since 2007, and we'll have improved commercial terms for CHK's benefit. But generally, it will be a very similar facility to what we have in place today.
Finally, as Aubrey discussed, I'd like to reiterate that our hedging program has locked in prices for 2011 that average approximately $2.15 over the current strip, on 60% of our projected gas production for the year and 80% of our projected gas production for the first half of '11.
By the end of 2011, our cash gains since initiating our hedging program in 2001 will exceed $7.5 billion. I personally look forward to taking a more active role at Chesapeake in continuing to lead the industry in this important area of risk mitigation and value creation.

We do have the obligation, as they are now a royalty owner in the property, to pay their operating costs. So that's no different, really, than any other royalty owner. And if you think about the way that those guys are going to look at it as debt, one of the things that we always scratched our head about is if we do a VPP in a gas price environment of 2011, where the strip is going to average something in the, let's call it, mid-fives to low fives, versus having done a VPP in 2000 -- first off in 2008, where the strip was much higher than that, it's actually going to result in more debt in 2008 than in 2011 for the same property, just because the price was higher.

Those are after projected asset sales. So you're seeing a lot of companies starting to come up with, ""Well, we can't make our growth targets, because we got to go sell assets."" And when you include the asset sale, there is no growth. And what we've been able to show is that we think asset sales are an important and vital and everyday part of what we do to fund the business and also to monetize older assets. And we've chosen to do so through VPPs. The rating agencies don't care for them, but that's not what has to be the ultimate driver. The ultimate driver has to be what's the best way to create value and through asset monetizations. And we think the benefits, which Nick talked about, of keeping the upside, keeping the tail and not paying taxes on them are pretty important issues to keep in mind. So we want you to remember that, as we talk about out-year growth of 18%, that is after asset sales that take care of any funding gap that we might have. So converting leasehold into PDP is what the machine does around here. We've got the capability of doing that of up to 4 Tcf per year, and we'll continue to do that year after year."

For 2010, we did previously have just a spot number for our oil production at 19 million barrels. We went ahead and added a range there of 18 million to 19 million, and that really reflects some ethane rejection that occurred that took our NGL barrels down. We hadn't properly accounted for that in our models and now are doing a better job of that. And then also some hookup delays related to some midstream activity. So we'll see where we come out there. But we felt like it was prudent to put a range in rather than just a spot number of 19 million barrels. And then in 2012, I think Nick mentioned this, but just greater clarity on some of our plays, particularly the Eagle Ford, and I think I might have mentioned the Niobrara as well. So that's been able to give us that clarity. What's that mean with regard to our thoughts about gas prices? I mean, I think we just have to live with today's reality, which is the projection for gas prices going forward, and comparing that to the curve would make anybody with a choice of drilling an oil well or drilling a gas well be inclined to drill an oil well. And so that's what we're doing. And then three years ago or so, we were a single-product company focused only on natural gas. We didn't really think we could find oil in any meaningful quantities. We didn't want to go out and buy it. But all that's changed in the last three years, and we have figured out a way to find liquids. And so we're going to back down our gas drilling over time. And again, as I mentioned before, we'll be down to a third of our drilling in 2012 will be gas compared to 90% last year. If gas prices rebound and the country says we need more gas, we can absolutely respond to that very quickly. But right now, the focus is on oil, because it's 3x or 4x more profitable to look for it than it is natural gas."

323857,114165189,86536,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives"," Good morning. Thank you, Jeff. We hope you had time to review yesterday's operational and financial release, and we're pleased with our results. On the operational side, our daily production for the second quarter was very strong at 3.0 Bcfe, up 23% ye",753," Good morning. Thank you, Jeff. We hope you had time to review yesterday's operational and financial release, and we're pleased with our results.
 On the operational side, our daily production for the second quarter was very strong at 3.0 Bcfe, up 23% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. An added highlight is our rapidly growing liquids production, which was up 50% year-over-year.
 We are currently producing more than 55,000 barrels of liquids per day and have our sights set on exceeding 150,000 barrels per day by year end 2012 and 250,000 barrels per day by year end 2015. We think that will make us a top five producer of liquids in the U.S. by the end of 2005.
 Next, I'd like to highlight our exceptionally low finding cost during the first nine months of the year. We added, on a gross basis, 4.0 Tcfe of proved reserves at a drilling and completion cost of only $0.97 per Mcfe. Basically, we are building a top 10 U.S. natural gas producer every year inside our company, an incredible achievement we believe.
 And not only are we good at finding gas cheaply at the $0.97 per Mcfe level, we are also good at selling it for much more. To date this year, we have received well north of $3 per Mcfe when we have sold properties through VPPs. It's always good to buy low and sell high, and that's what we try to do around here, whether it's leasehold or proved reserves.
 Our latest JV, the CNOOC deal in the Eagle Ford, is expected to close in the near future. And our data room is open for the Niobrara Shale JV, in which we own 800,000 net acres, evenly split between the Powder River and D-J Basins. We expect to also sell a 33% working interest in this play at what we believe will be an attractive price both to us and to our future partner.
 We believe the recoverable resource under our 800,000 net acres is an unrisked approximate 4.6 billion barrels of oil, representing potentially $400 billion of future undiscounted revenue. This is a reminder that the size of the plays that we have chased and have captured is quite remarkable.
 Some of you may be wondering what's next in our liquids plays. I can tell you that we have several new plays under evaluation or development, including an almost 100,000-acre new position in the Williston Basin and a 1 million-acre position in another play that will probably be ready for disclosure in the JV data room in the first half of 2011. We believe there will be worldwide interest in this next big play of ours.
 One other thing. On the Anschutz deal, we will be selling about 25% of the assets we acquired that aren't a great fit for us. We'll do that as soon as we can after we close. And then with what's left, we'll combine it with some other acreage we have then do a JV in the first half of 2011. I know that several analysts were confused on this point, so I thought we should clear it up.
 Finally, I'd like to point out that our realized cash hedging gains since 2001 now reached almost $6 billion. In addition, we have hedged approximately 80% of our anticipated gas production in the first half of 2011 with swaps at an average strike price of $6.35 per Mcf and approximately 43% in the second half of 2011, the swaps at an average strike price of $6.61 per Mcf. If today's 2011 strip holds true, we should record another $1.5 billion in hedging gains in 2011.
 That $1.5 billion, along with an expected $2 billion in drilling carried in 2011, will provide Chesapeake with $3.5 billion in cash from two important competitive advantages and what most expect will be a tough industry environment in 2011. We also expect to generate more than $1.5 billion in cash and $1.5 billion in additional drilling carries from two new JVs that we should close in 2011. So that's a total of $6.5 billion in competitive advantages before we even consider the expected $3.5 billion in operating cash flow we should generate in 2011 without any hedges.
 We are a resourceful management team. We relish tough operating environments. We take pride in what we have built. And we look forward to additional opportunities that may come our way in 2011.
 This completes my commentary. And I'll now turn the call over to Nick Dell'Osso, our CFO.

323857,114165189,86536,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives"," Thanks, Aubrey. Good morning. I'm pleased to be joining you on the conference call as Chesapeake's new CFO. As Aubrey discussed and I'm sure you have seen in our earnings release, Q3 was another successful quarter for CHK. A couple of quick items I wil",756," Thanks, Aubrey. Good morning. I'm pleased to be joining you on the conference call as Chesapeake's new CFO. As Aubrey discussed and I'm sure you have seen in our earnings release, Q3 was another successful quarter for CHK.
 A couple of quick items I will point out in addition to Aubrey's comments are a continued decrease in LOE per Mcfe, which came in this quarter at $0.95 per Mcfe, as well as our finding cost at $0.97 per Mcfe. If you'd like to consider what it takes Chesapeake to find oil and gas on an organic basis, without the effect of our drilling carries, it comes to $1.16 per Mcfe.
 We achieved these low cost through four major advantages. First, we have a top one or two leasehold position in every important unconventional play in the U.S. Second, we have drilled more horizontal wells than anyone else in the world. Third, we are vertically integrated through most of our key service needs. And fourth, we have a size and scale that lends itself to great efficiency in our drilling and production processes.
 The third quarter was also a very productive period for us on the financing front as we completed the balance sheet restructuring made possible by our preferred equity offering, which closed in June of this year. The net effect of this series of transactions is to have added $2.6 billion of equity to our balance sheet, have reduced long-term debt by $1.4 billion and retired or redeemed all bonds that were issued under our older, more restrictive form of indenture. Just to remind you, this was the first step in our ongoing multi-year strategy of balance sheet improvement.
 Additionally, I'd like to point out the closing of our eight volumetric production payment transaction on September 30 for $1.15 billion in proceeds. This represents the sale of 390 Bcf of gas over five years from our Barnett Shale production, monetized at the strip and adjusted for transportation cost. This brings our total VPP sales to $4.7 billion over the past three years at a realized price of $4.50 per Mcfe. This compares favorably to the value of the reserves left in the ground or sold at current natural gas prices, plus we've kept the upside, kept the tail and paid no taxes on the proceeds. Furthermore, these sales of primarily gas assets have helped us fund our aggressive and timely shift to a more liquids-focused portfolio.
 Looking forward, we are excited about continuing to build one of the industry's leading unconventional liquids plays. And I would like to highlight our guidance attached to last night's earnings release in which we have estimated 80% and 60% growth in liquids in 2011 and 2012, respectively.
 This is an increase to our liquids production guidance for 2012 made possible by gaining clarity on the development plan associated with our pending transaction with Xenon and our confidence in achieving an attractive JV for our Niobrara acreage. Additionally, we believe we will have a JV in the first half of 2011 on a new, very large liquids prospect that we have not yet publicly identified.
 We have also begun the renewal process for our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, and we'll be looking to wrap that up in the next few weeks. The existing facility was set to mature in November of 2012, so we chose to enter the market now and have the new facility, which will again have a five-year maturity, sewn up well in advance of the existing facility becoming a current obligation on our balance sheet.
 The reception, thus far, has been very strong. We expect the deal will be slightly larger than the current facility to reflect the company's increased scale of operations since 2007, and we'll have improved commercial terms for CHK's benefit. But generally, it will be a very similar facility to what we have in place today.
 Finally, as Aubrey discussed, I'd like to reiterate that our hedging program has locked in prices for 2011 that averaged approximately $2.15 over the current strip, around 60% of our projected gas production for the year and 80% of our projected gas production for the first half of '11.
 By the end of 2011, our cash gains since initiating our hedging program since 2001 will be exceed $7.5 billion. I personally look forward to taking a more active role at Chesapeake in continuing to lead the industry in this important area of risk mitigation and value creation.

I mean, our out-year projections already anticipate that we'll be selling $1 billion a year of VPPs. And we still talk about the growth that we're delivering as 18% in '11, 18% in '12. Those are after projected asset sales. So you're seeing a lot of companies starting to come up with -- well, we can't make our growth targets, because we got to go sell assets, and when you include the asset sale, there is no growth. And what we've been able to show is that we think asset sales are important and vital and an everyday part of what we do to fund the business and also to monetize older assets. And we've chosen to do so through VPPs. The rating agencies don't care for them, but that's not what has to be the ultimate driver. The ultimate driver has to be what's the best way to create value and through asset monetizations. And we think the benefits, which Nick talked about, of keeping the upside, keeping the tail and not paying taxes on them are pretty important issues to keep in mind. So we want you to remember that as we talk about out-year growth of 18%, that is after asset sales that take care of any funding gap that we might have. So converting leasehold into PDP is what the machine does around here. We've got the capability of doing that of up to 4 Tcf per year, and we'll continue to do that year after year.

Let's talk about, first of all, the change in production guidance. For 2010, we did previously have just a spot number for our oil production at 19 million barrels.

For 2010, we did previously have just a spot number for our oil production at 19 million barrels. We went ahead and added a range there of 18 million to 19 million, and that really reflects some ethane rejection that occurred that took our NGL barrels down. We haven't properly accounted for that in our models and now are doing a better job of that. And then also some pickup delays related to some Midstream activity. So we'll see where we come out there, but we felt like it was prudent to put a range in rather than just a spot number of 19 million barrels. And then in 2012, I think Nick mentioned this, but just greater clarity on some of our plays, particularly the Eagle Ford, and I think I might have mentioned the Niobrara as well. So that's been able to give us that clarity. What's that mean with regard to our thoughts about gas prices? I mean, I think we just have to live with today's reality, which is the projection for gas prices going forward and comparing that to the curve would make anybody with a choice of drilling an oil well or drilling a gas well be inclined to drill an oil well. And so that's what we're doing. And then three years ago or so, we were a single-product company focused only on natural gas. We didn't really think we could find oil in any meaningful quantities. We didn't want to go out and buy it. But all that's changed in the last three years, and we have figured out a way to find liquids. And so we're going to back down our gas drilling over time. And again, as I mentioned before, we'll be down to a third of our drilling in 2012 will be gas compared to 90% last year. If gas prices rebound and the country says we need more gas, we can absolutely respond to that very quickly. But right now, the focus is on oil, because it's 3x or 4x more profitable to look for it than it is natural gas.
