Our business model served us",2461,"Thanks, Jeff and good morning, everyone. Obviously 2009 was an interesting year, a year filled with some uncertainty and challenges. But a year that also as we exited 2009, was a year in which we started to see some stability. Our business model served us well. I think you'd all agree over the past few years, the leadership team, and for that matter, all of the employees of the Equifax faced into the challenges of 2009 and made some very tough decisions of maintaining our focus on the long-term strategy and executing our short-term plans to manage our expense base. We also accomplished two very strategic acquisitions in 2009 and delivered, I think an impressive financial performance. With a stronger company, as we enter 2010 and I feel much better about the prospects of the upcoming year that I felt one year ago. We have unique and significant data assets that are unmatched by our competition. I'll talk about that in great detail later on. We've also streamlined our cost base. We've institutionalized LEAN operating model that will provide important operating leverage during the recovery. We have many new products that address customers emerging needs for the marketing and risk management decisions, and we continue to deliver a track of financial returns enabling us to reinvest in the business and return value to our shareholders. Taking a look at the quarter, our fourth quarter results were strong and exceeded the outlook we gave you from the conference call covering our third quarter earnings release. Total revenue was $464.3 million, up 1% in constant dollars from the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 2% in constant dollars from the quarter of 2009. Operating margin was 23.2% excluding the restructuring charge, down slightly when compared with to the third quarter of 2009 [indiscernible] mix. Adjusted EPS was $0.61 a share, exceeding the guidance we gave during the third quarter earnings release. Also, some noteworthy accomplishments that the team delivered during the quarter. Number one, Online Consumer Services is the core of our USCIS [U.S. Consumer Information Solutions] business, it's operating margins continue to be strong. For the fourth quarter of 2009, the operating margin was up slightly from the fourth quarter's of both 2008 and 2007, despite revenue being down over 90% during the quarter. As a result, USCIS continue investing in NPI while countering recent pricing pressures in our Marketing business.TALX Work Number revenue was up 17% excluding the contribution revenue reporting, continuing with double-digit growth trend since the acquisition in May of 2007. PSOL, Personal Solutions grew to direct-to-consumer branded Subscription business  by 5% while delivering strong double-digit margins over 28% in the fourth quarter and 23% for the full year. And North American Commercial grew revenue 11.4% in the fourth quarter with 34% operating margin, up significantly from fourth quarter of 2008.International delivered a solid quarter compared to the third quarter as operating margin improved by 50 basis points. In addition, year-over-year revenue growth improved in all three major geographies when compared to year-over-year growth in third quarter. And we completed, as I mentioned before, two strategic acquisitions that will strengthen our franchise and broaden our opportunities for growth. And again, I'll talk about both those in a moment. And for the year, we delivered strong financial results in a very difficult environment which Lee will report on shortly. We also made great progress on our most important strategic objectives, which are intended to redefine a competitive landscape, as well as further diversify our revenue growth.First, let me talk about this. For three years now, NPI, New Product Innovation, I'm very proud of the accomplishments we've made with NPI. Throughout the company the process of idea creation, formulation, development and implementation on new products have achieved through many of our employees. It's a process that has become very critical part of our DNA and delivered significant revenue growth for us in 2009. For the year, we launched 65 new products and generated $134 million in revenue from products launched in 2006, '07 and '08. We call that, as you know, our NPI Vitality Index. Our three largest business units, USCIS, TALX and International, all delivered strong double-digit NPI growth versus 2008. Our objective is to have over 10% of each business unit's annual revenue driven by their NPI initiatives. Next, as our Technology and Analytical Services, we call it TALX. Today's environment has added significantly to the challenges our customers face in managing their lending risk and improving their underwriting decisions. As a result, customers both domestic and international are increasingly demanding more innovation from our software and analytical solutions to address these challenges. As you know in 2009, we consolidated our Enabling Technologies and Analytical Services organization into our global Technology and Analytical Services unit. To pursue markets not presently served by existing business units and to develop solutions that access non-Equifax that has important deviation from us. Whereas in the past, that particular entity was used only enabling data sales never going to embark a ton of opportunities that are outside of the need for pulling through our data and we'll going to talk about that in the Q&A, if you got any questions.Finally, customers continue to reinforce that InterConnect platform is the platform of choice for their decisioning needs. This platform has been very successful as you know in the U.S and most recently in Canada. And we've also introduced InterConnect in the U.K. and have received interest from some of our Latin American customers as well. So that is a platform that will soon become a standard platform for us globally. Our acquisition of IXI is already having an impact on our product offerings. With our combined experience, unique data and sophisticated analytical resources, Equifax is leading the industry with powerful ability to pay solutions. Only Equifax can offer ability to pay solutions that leverage the Work Number database and incorporate models built with actual wealth and income data. And these solutions can be delivered realtime or in batch to best suit our customers' needs. We're truly uniquely positioned there. Our comprehensive set of data assets makes us the only source for a complete 360-degree view of the customers, including their propensity to pay. And with IXI and the Work Number, their ability to pay and their capacity to pay. The data assets of IXI will broaden the understanding of our customers wealth, income and spending which can further drive break-through decisioning and targeting solutions for our customers. In short, the building blocks we have in our vast data arsenal combined with our capabilities in the analytics and decisioning technology provide us with a much broader set of differentiated solutions to serve our customers' business needs. The acquisition of Rapid Reporting, we made last year has significantly scaled our 45,060 services within the Work Number business segment. Combined with our acquisition of Discover Source in 2008, TALX is the industry leader for IRS tax return information and Social Security Number verification services. Rapid Reporting's 12-year relationship with the IRS has underpinned the evolution of these services for the industry. We will continue to drive innovation, leveraging our close working relationship with the IRS and the Social Security Administration. We anticipated various legislative proposals in Congress and this was being undertaken at Fannie and Freddie and more rigorous underwriting standards being adopted by many of large mortgage lenders will lead to attractive growth and product development opportunities for these types of services in 2010 and beyond. With our current scale of operations, we have the capacity to deliver a unique portfolio of products with the high quality of services at a competitive price. Something I've been deeply involved in, as we shift gears, is something we launched just recently called our Key Client Program. Equifax, as you know, has a long history of focusing on the needs of our customers. Their need for innovation and new decisioning tools is more critical now than ever. In 2009, we enhanced our commitment to a select group of our largest most influential customers by dedicating some of our most talented professionals strictly to their needs. For my meetings with CEOs of our major customers, it quickly became obvious that we needed to rethink how we best organize and serve their large and complex needs in this new environment. For many of them, we've had numerous initiatives underway throughout our company. They want a stronger coordination and cooperation across our enterprise, staffs with professionals, who truly understand them, speak their language and have the utmost integrity and very collaborative and engaged in our operating excellence. For the fourth quarter, we organized a global Key Client Program. Each key client will have a dedicated team, including a chief client officer as well as a specialist in each of our solution oriented with disciplines, including analytics, decisioning and marketing. Unlike many of these types of enterprise-wide initiatives, these teams have solid line reporting relationships to a chief client officer not your typical bottom line structure. So simply what we've done is taken the best in values people we have across the entire organization and they are now full-time dedicated to the health and well being of selected customers for Equifax. Each team is going to be evaluated and measured solely on their success in driving product penetration and revenue growth with these specific clients. The whole goal there is to disrupt the marketplace and gain share in these key clients. I believe this approach will, in fact, disrupt the marketplace, drive a deeper and longer-lasting relationships with our most important customers and give us many new opportunities as we deliver superior solutions that leverage our unique capabilities and our unique data assets.Right now, I think you've all seen the press on our joint venture in India. After many months, in fact, years of active preparation, we have finalized and funded our partnership with six large public and private institutions in the banking and financial sectors. We submitted our application to the Reserve Bank of India and we expect to be granted a license some time later in the first quarter or at worst case, early second quarter 2010. Later this year, we expect to have the IT infrastructure completed and operational. Our global data service platform will provide key strategic differentiator, such as the ability to host unique, negative and positive data from a variety of sources. I am optimistic and remains optimistic as I have in the past that this is a great long-term growth opportunity for Equifax.Moving on to Global Operations. They continue to be a critical driver of leverage across our business units. In 2009, we accelerated our LEAN initiatives to further improve operating leverage and give us the ability to quickly scale operations consistent with our customer demands. We completed 54 initiatives across the business and delivered over $10 million of incremental expense savings in 2009. Over 1,200 individuals have been trained in LEAN methodologies and tools further integrating the operational excellence culture into the management's DNA. And I expect the 2010 contributions in expense savings from LEAN to be even greater. In fact, up double digit over the savings from 2009.Let's just talk about the talent in the company for a second. It's a very important part of our culture here, recruiting the best, developing the best and retaining the best. And to that end, we recently promoted two of our seasoned leaders to drive growth for our Personal Solutions and our Commercial business unit. I think many of you know Trey Loughran. Trey has led our corporate development effort now for three and a half to four years and most recently promoted to lead and become President of our North American Personal Solutions business unit. We've also promoted Alex Gonzalez, who is leading our strategic marketing activities. He is now the President of our North American Commercial Solutions business. I've got a great expectations for both of these as they bring these business units to new levels of growth and profitability.We've also hired a world-class Chief Technology Officer, who had joined us a few weeks ago. I believe it's three weeks ago, Dave Webb. Dave is a very seasoned IT leader, comes with a broad and diverse set of experiences in the IT world. I really look forward to having Dave join the organization.We've accomplished a great deal over the past year, while not deviating from our strategy and our business model continues to deliver strong operating margins and cash flow for reinvestment into the business and returns to our shareholders. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Our access to capital is good. Our operating leverage will enable us to improve those margins when growth returns, and I do expect that growth to return later on this year. Clearly, the environment in Equifax have begun to stabilize, which is good news, a trend that I expect that will continue throughout the first half of 2010. I also expect our financial performance to increase in the second half of 2010 as the economy continues and begins to recover. We talk very briefly about the outlook for each of our business units for the first quarter. For the first quarter, USCIS revenue is expected to be down in the mid- to upper-single digit range when compared with the first quarter of 2009. That is primarily driven by the decline in the volume of mortgage lending activity that we saw in the first quarter of 2009. And refresh everyone's memory, we had a significant refinancing boom in the first quarter of 2009. I don't anticipate that will repeat from obvious reasons in the first quarter 2010, but the underlying health of the USCIS business, excluding mortgages, is relatively stable.In the first quarter, we expect International revenue excluding any impact of foreign currency translation to be up modestly when compared to the first quarter of 2009, as growth in Canada and Latin America offsetting slow U.K. economy. On a reported basis, revenue is expected to be up in the mid-teens due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar over last year.In first quarter on TALX, the revenue is expected to be up in mid-teens when compared to the first quarter of 2009 driven primarily by the growth in the Work Number.In PSOL, we expect revenue to be down modestly when compared to the first quarter of 2009, but at much better rate when compared to what we experienced in the first quarter of 2009 versus the first quarter of 2008. The North American Commercial Solutions first quarter, revenue is expected to be up modestly in local currency when compared to the first quarter of 2009. So now let me turn over to Lee, who will give you more financial details. Lee?"
175749,84148369,48400,"Equifax Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-04-2010",2010-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick and good morning, everyone. This morning, all financial information I will be discussing is presented on a GAAP basis except as otherwise noted, and will exclude the restructuring charge described in our press release. You should also refer t",1517,"Thanks, Rick and good morning, everyone. This morning, all financial information I will be discussing is presented on a GAAP basis except as otherwise noted, and will exclude the restructuring charge described in our press release. You should also refer to the Q&A and non-GAAP reconciliations attached to our earnings release for additional financial information.For the quarter compared to the same quarter in 2008, consolidated revenue of $464.3 million was up 3.9%. Changes in foreign exchange rates favorably impacted revenue by approximately $13.6 million. In constant dollars, revenue was up almost 1%. The acquisition of IXI and Rapid Reporting, two significant strategic investments made during the quarter, added approximately two percentage points of growth in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, the operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2009 was 19.7%. After adjusting for the restructuring charge, the operating margin was 23.2% in the quarter compared to 26% in 2008 and 23.5% in both the second and third quarters of 2009.Excluding the amortization of acquisition intangibles and the restructuring charge, the adjusted operating margin was 28.2%. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.47. Excluding the impact of acquisition related intangible amortization, a tax benefit related to foreign tax credit carryforwards and the restructuring charge, adjusted earnings per share were $0.61 flat when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.Even excluding the foreign tax credit carryforward benefit, we still had an unusually low tax rate in the quarter. At a tax rate excluding discrete items that would be close to the 36%, our adjusted EPS would have been lower by approximately $0.04 but still in line with our guidance. Total debt increased during the quarter by $105 million. During the quarter, we invested $196 million in the two acquisitions we completed, of which a little under half was funded with cash from operations and the remainder from a net increase in debt.In contrast to most of 2008 and 2009, when in most quarters, we saw a modest sequential decline in constant currency revenue as activity in many of our end use markets continue to soften, we are somewhat encouraged by the most recent quarterly performance. Fourth quarter revenue was essentially flat when compared to the third quarter on a constant currency basis and excluding the impact of acquisitions, reflecting a more stable operating environment and continuing traction from our NPI initiatives.Now for the individual business units. U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $199 million for the quarter. Excluding the contribution from IXI, revenue was in line with the expectations we communicated during our third quarter earnings release in October. Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $122.2 million, down 9.6% compared to 2008, primarily driven by a 14% decline in our online credit decision volume. Average revenue per transaction was flat as price compression was offset by the mix of transaction volume.Mortgage Solutions revenue of $23 million was up 27% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Mortgage Reporting revenue was up 22% over the prior year, and Settlement Services was up over 40% compared to the same quarter in 2008.Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue, which is comprised of Credit Marketing Services and our newly acquired IXI was $30.9 million. Excluding the contribution from IXI, revenue was down in the high teens from the last year due to lower prescreen and portfolio review volumes with our larger customers and to pricing pressure. Turning to Q3 of 2009, revenue was down approximately 2%, excluding the contribution from IXI. Although our primary banking customers have continued to test and analyze various marketing strategies, they have been hesitant to launch large campaigns until they can ensure full and complete compliance of the Card Act .Direct Marketing Services revenue was $22.9 million, down 5.7% from the fourth quarter of 2008, but up 8.4% compared to the third quarter, reflecting normal seasonal patterns. The operating margin for our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions segment was 33.2%, down from the third quarter due to lower total revenue and shift in product line mix toward lower margin mortgage solutions and Direct Marketing Services.International's revenue was $117.7 million compared to $105.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. In local currency, revenue was down 0.9% from a year ago and 0.8% from the third quarter, consistent with the expectations we communicated during our third quarter earnings release in October.By region, Latin America's revenue was $55.1 million, up 19% in U.S. dollar terms and 3.2% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2008. This marks a return to year-over-year growth after declines in the second and third quarters of this year when Latin American economy is temporarily weakened. Europe delivered revenue of $35.9 million, flat in U.S. dollars and down 5.7% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2008. While still reflective of the year-over-year weak economic conditions, this is an improvement from year-over-year local currency comparisons in the first three quarters of this year. Our Canada consumer revenue was $26.7 million in the quarter, up 13% in U.S. dollars but down 1.5% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2008. Again, the best year-over-year local currency comparisons this year.International's operating margin was 27.5%, up from 27.0% in 2008 and up approximately 50 basis points from the third quarter. Operating margins were up in eight of the 11 country geographies. TALX revenue in the fourth quarter was $89.4 million, up 18.5% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and approximately 12% excluding the contribution from Rapid Reporting. The Work Number continues to deliver broad-based growth with revenue of $41.6 million. Tax and Talent Management Services delivered $47.8 million of revenue, up 8% compared to last year. And the TALX operating margin was 21.1% compared to 19.9% in the same period in 2008.In North America Personal Solutions, revenue was up $36 million, down 3.2% from the prior year and generally in line with the expectations we communicated during our third quarter earnings release.Direct to Consumer subscription revenue was up 5% year-over-year, but was more than offset by double-digit declines in breach and transaction revenues, which have been more economically sensitive. Operating margin was 28.1% for the quarter, which is up from 27.3% in the third quarter, though down from the 33.9% in the prior year. During the fourth quarter, advertising expense was up 20% compared to the fourth quarter of last year as we continue to promote various subscription products with TV advertising.North America Commercial Solutions revenue was $22.2 million, up 11.4% on a reported basis and up 7.5% in local currency. Compared to the third quarter, revenue was up 38% and substantially ahead of our expectations communicated during the third quarter earnings call. Our Data Management product revenues delivered healthy double-digit growth and several new and existing customers initiated projects to support their revenue growth initiatives. The operating margin in our commercial business was 34% compared to 28.3% in the fourth quarter a year ago.In summary, our fourth quarter performance is solid and very much in line with the expectations we communicated last October. For the year, compared to 2008, consolidated revenue of $1.8 billion was down 5.8%. Changes in foreign exchange rates unfavorably impacted revenue by $48.9 million. In constant dollars, revenue declined 3.2%. Operating margin was 22.3% for the year compared to 24.7% in 2008. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusting for restructuring charges, adjusted operating margin was 23.7%. Excluding acquisition-related amortization, comparable to the reported metric of one of our public competitors, adjusted margins were 28.5%. Diluted earnings per share for the year was $1.83, down from $2.09 in 2008. Excluding the impact of our acquisition-related intangible amortizations, the restructuring charge and the income tax benefit previously noted, adjusted earnings per share was $2.33, down from $2.48 in 2008.With the fourth quarter adjustments, we have now fully recognized our foreign tax credit carry-forwards. As a result, looking forward, our effective tax rate in 2010 is expected to increase to a range of 37% to 38%, more than two full percentage points higher than 2009 to adjusted tax rate. This will negatively impact earnings per share in 2010 by approximately $0.07 to $0.08 when compared to 2009.Finally, we reduced debt during the year by $45 million while financing the acquisitions that we described. Throughout the year, we work hard to position ourselves for a recovery. We accelerated the operating cost initiatives in our traditional businesses to protect our operating margins, achieving a $60 million reduction expense, excluding the impact of foreign exchange in our expense base for those businesses.  We also invested in our growth businesses, such as TALX and Mortgage Reporting, expanding operating margins in those businesses by almost 400 basis point collectively. In conjunction with the acquisitions we made in the fourth quarter, we issued $275 million in five year notes at very attractive rates due in large part to the strength of our balance sheet and strong operating cash flow.  Delivering this performance in 2010 reflects very much on our balance focus of aggressively managing our expenses while investing in our strategic growth initiatives. Now let me turn it back to Rick."

One, I expect that the GDP around the world will be some growth, it will be modest and improving throughout the year. I think that employment specific on the U.S., is going to remain at high levels -- unemployment at high levels throughout most of the year. You may see a slight improvement towards the very end of the year. Home prices will continue to face pressure due to foreclosures rising. On a positive side, we are starting to see an increased interest from credit card issuers to begin soliciting new customers, and that should drive growth for business in the second half of the year. As a result, I think 2010 will be a year we return to growth. With this outlook and given the current foreign exchange rates, we expect operating results to be stable at their current levels during the first half of the year and then pick up nicely in the second half of the year. For the first quarter, assuming the current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be up in the low, single-digit range from a year ago, and adjusted EPS is expected to be similar between $0.53 a share and $0.57 a share, including the negative impact of a higher effective tax rate. For the full year, we intend to give you a CapEx guidance. This year, we expect CapEx to be in the range of $75 million to $100 million. In 2009, we delivered what I call a solid financial performance in that economic environment. So in our 2010 I feel much better than I did a year ago. We got a strong balance sheet, we got a great data assets, we got unique product offerings and most importantly, we also have an improved economic environment which should bode well for the company.

These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC including our 2008 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are explained in the non-GAAP financial measures reconciliation attached our earnings release including adjusted net income, adjusted operating margins, adjusted diluted EPS and operating results excluding the impact of foreign exchange. These measures also exclude the restructuring charge and income tax benefit in the fourth quarter, which is described in our press release. The pretax impact of the restructuring charge is $16.4 million for the fourth quarter and $24.8 million for the full year of 2009. The after-tax impact of the restructuring charge is $10.4 million in the fourth quarter and $15.8 million for the full year. The tax benefit in the fourth quarter was $7.3 million.

But a year that also as we exited 2009, was a year in which we started to see some stability. Our business model served us well. I think you'd all agree over the past few years, the leadership team, for that matter all the employees of Equifax faced into the challenges of 2009. They made some very tough decisions while maintaining our focus on the long-term strategy and executing our short-term plans to manage our expense base. We also accomplished two very strategic acquisitions in 2009 and delivered, I think an impressive financial performance. WeÆre a stronger company as we enter 2010 and I feel much better about the prospects of the upcoming year that I felt one year ago. We have unique and significant data assets that are unmatched by our competition. I'll talk about that in great detail later on. We've also streamlined our cost base. We've institutionalized LEAN operating model that will provide important operating leverage during the recovery. We have many new products that address customersÆ emerging needs for the marketing and risk management decisions, and we continue to deliver attractive financial returns enabling us to reinvest in the business and return value to our shareholders. Taking a look at the quarter. Our fourth quarter results were strong and exceeded the outlook we gave you on the conference call covering our third quarter earnings release. Total revenue was $464.3 million, up 1% in constant dollars from the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 2% in constant dollars from the third quarter of 2009. Operating margin was 23.2% excluding the restructuring charge, down slightly when compared to the third quarter 2009 largely driven by mix. Adjusted EPS was $0.61 a share, exceeding the guidance we gave during the third quarter earnings release. Also, some noteworthy accomplishments that the team delivered during the quarter. Number one, Online Consumer Services is the core of our USCIS [U.S. Consumer Information Solutions] business. It's operating margins continue to be strong. For the fourth quarter 2009, the operating margin was up slightly from the fourth quarters of both 2008 and 2007 despite revenue being down over 90% during the quarter. As a result, USCIS can continue investing in NPI while countering recent pricing pressures in our Marketing business.TALX Work Number revenue was up 17% excluding the contribution from Rapid Reporting continuing the double-digit growth trend since the acquisition in May of 2007. PSOL, Personal Solutions grew its direct-to-consumer branded Subscription business by 5% while delivering strong double-digit margins over 28% in the fourth quarter and 23% for the full year. North American Commercial grew revenue 11.4% in the fourth quarter with 34% operating margin, up significantly from fourth quarter 2008.International delivered a solid quarter compared to the third quarter as operating margin improved by 50 basis points. In addition, year-over-year revenue growth improved in all three major geographies when compared to year-over-year growth in third quarter. And we completed, as I mentioned before, two strategic acquisitions that will strengthen our franchise and broaden our opportunities for growth. And again, I'll talk about both those in a moment. And for the year, we delivered strong financial results in that very difficult environment, which Lee will report on shortly. We also made great progress on our most important strategic objectives, which are intended to redefine a competitive landscape as well as further diversify our revenue growth.First, let me talk about this. For three years now, NPI, New Product Innovation, I'm very proud of the accomplishments we've made with NPI. Throughout the company the process of idea creation, formulation, development and implementation on new products have achieved through many of our employees. It's a process that has become very critical part of our DNA and delivered significant revenue growth for us in 2009. For the year, we launched 65 new products and generated $134 million in revenue from products launched in 2006, '07 and '08. We call that, as you know, our NPI Vitality Index. Our three largest business units, USCIS, TALX and International, all delivered strong double-digit NPI growth versus 2008. Our objective is to have over 10% of each business unit's annual revenue driven by their NPI initiatives. Next, as our Technology and Analytical Services, we call it TALX. Today's environment has added significantly to the challenges our customers face in managing their lending risk and improving their underwriting decisions. As a result, customers both domestic and international are increasingly demanding more innovation from our software and analytical solutions to address these challenges. As you know in 2009, we consolidated our Enabling Technologies and Analytical Services organization into our global Technology and Analytical Services unit. To pursue markets not presently served by existing business units and to develop solutions that access non-Equifax that has important deviation from us. Whereas in the past, that particular entity was used only enabling data sales never going to embark a ton of opportunities that are outside of the need for pulling through our data and we'll going to talk about that in the Q&A, if you got any questions.Finally, customers continue to reinforce that InterConnect platform is the platform of choice for their decisioning needs. This platform has been very successful as you know in the U.S. and most recently in Canada. And we've also introduced InterConnect in the U.K. and have received interest from some of our Latin American customers as well. So that is a platform that will soon become a standard platform for us globally. Our acquisition of IXI is already having an impact on our product offerings. With our combined experience, unique data and sophisticated analytical resources, Equifax is leading the industry with powerful ability to pay solutions. Only Equifax can offer ability to pay solutions that leverage the Work Number database and incorporate models built with actual wealth and income data. And these solutions can be delivered realtime or in batch to best suit our customers' needs. We're truly uniquely positioned there. Our comprehensive set of data assets makes us the only source for a complete 360-degree view of the customers, including their propensity to pay. And with IXI and the Work Number, their ability to pay and their capacity to pay. The data assets of IXI will broaden the understanding of our customersÆ wealth, income and spending which can further drive break-through decisioning and targeting solutions for our customers. In short, the building blocks we have in our vast data arsenal combined with our capabilities in the analytics and decisioning technology provide us with a much broader set of differentiated solutions to serve our customers' business needs. The acquisition of Rapid Reporting, we made last year has significantly scaled our 45,060 services within the Work Number business segment. Combined with our acquisition of Discover Source in 2008, TALX is the industry leader for IRS tax return information and Social Security Number verification services. Rapid Reporting's 12-year relationship with the IRS has underpinned the evolution of these services for the industry. We will continue to drive innovation, leveraging our close working relationship with the IRS and the Social Security Administration. We anticipated various legislative proposals in Congress and this was being undertaken at Fannie and Freddie and more rigorous underwriting standards being adopted by many of large mortgage lenders will lead to attractive growth and product development opportunities for these types of services in 2010 and beyond. With our current scale of operations, we have the capacity to deliver a unique portfolio of products with the high quality of services at a competitive price. Something I've been deeply involved in, as we shift gears, is something we launched just recently called our Key Client Program. Equifax, as you know, has a long history of focusing on the needs of our customers. Their need for innovation and new decisioning tools is more critical now than ever. In 2009, we enhanced our commitment to a select group of our largest most influential customers by dedicating some of our most talented professionals strictly to their needs. For my meetings with CEOs of our major customers, it quickly became obvious that we needed to rethink how we best organize and serve their large and complex needs in this new environment. For many of them, we've had numerous initiatives underway throughout our company. They want a stronger coordination and cooperation across our enterprise, staffs with professionals, who truly understand them, speak their language and have the utmost integrity and very collaborative and engaged in our operating excellence. For the fourth quarter, we organized a global Key Client Program. Each key client will have a dedicated team, including a chief client officer as well as a specialist in each of our solution oriented with disciplines, including analytics, decisioning and marketing. Unlike many of these types of enterprise-wide initiatives, these teams have solid line reporting relationships to a chief client officer not your typical bottom line structure. So simply what we've done is taken the best in values people we have across the entire organization and they are now full-time dedicated to the health and wellbeing of selected customers for Equifax. Each team is going to be evaluated and measured solely on their success in driving product penetration and revenue growth with these specific clients. The whole goal there is to disrupt the marketplace and gain share in these key clients. I believe this approach will, in fact, disrupt the marketplace, drive a deeper and longer-lasting relationships with our most important customers and give us many new opportunities as we deliver superior solutions that leverage our unique capabilities and our unique data assets.Right now, I think you've all seen the press on our joint venture in India. After many months, in fact, years of active preparation, we have finalized and funded our partnership with six large public and private institutions in the banking and financial sectors. We submitted our application to the Reserve Bank of India and we expect to be granted a license some time later in the first quarter or at worst case, early second quarter 2010. Later this year, we expect to have the IT infrastructure completed and operational. Our global data service platform will provide key strategic differentiator, such as the ability to host unique, negative and positive data from a variety of sources. I am optimistic and remains optimistic as I have in the past that this is a great long-term growth opportunity for Equifax.Moving on to Global Operations. They continue to be a critical driver of leverage across our business units. In 2009, we accelerated our LEAN initiatives to further improve operating leverage and give us the ability to quickly scale operations consistent with our customer demands. We completed 54 initiatives across the business and delivered over $10 million of incremental expense savings in 2009. Over 1,200 individuals have been trained in LEAN methodologies and tools further integrating the operational excellence culture into the management's DNA. And I expect the 2010 contributions in expense savings from LEAN to be even greater. In fact, up double digit over the savings from 2009.Let's just talk about the talent in the company for a second. It's a very important part of our culture here, recruiting the best, developing the best and retaining the best. And to that end, we recently promoted two of our seasoned leaders to drive growth for our Personal Solutions and our Commercial business unit. I think many of you know Trey Loughran. Trey has led our corporate development effort now for three and a half to four years and most recently promoted to lead and become President of our North American Personal Solutions business unit. We've also promoted Alex Gonzalez, who is leading our strategic marketing activities. He is now the President of our North American Commercial Solutions business. I've got a great expectations for both of these as they bring these business units to new levels of growth and profitability.We've also hired a world-class Chief Technology Officer, who had joined us a few weeks ago. I believe it's three weeks ago, Dave Webb. Dave is a very seasoned IT leader, comes with a broad and diverse set of experiences in the IT world. I really look forward to having Dave join the organization.We've accomplished a great deal over the past year, while not deviating from our strategy and our business model continues to deliver strong operating margins and cash flow for reinvestment into the business and returns to our shareholders. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Our access to capital is good. Our operating leverage will enable us to improve those margins when growth returns, and I do expect that growth to return later on this year. Clearly, the environment in Equifax have begun to stabilize, which is good news, a trend that I expect that will continue throughout the first half of 2010. I also expect our financial performance to increase in the second half of 2010 as the economy continues and begins to recover. We talk very briefly about the outlook for each of our business units for the first quarter. For the first quarter, USCIS revenue is expected to be down in the mid- to upper-single digit range when compared with the first quarter of 2009. That is primarily driven by the decline in the volume of mortgage lending activity that we saw in the first quarter of 2009. And refresh everyone's memory, we had a significant refinancing boom in the first quarter of 2009. I don't anticipate that will repeat from obvious reasons in the first quarter 2010, but the underlying health of the USCIS business, excluding mortgages, is relatively stable.In the first quarter, we expect International revenue excluding any impact of foreign currency translation to be up modestly when compared to the first quarter of 2009, as growth in Canada and Latin America offsetting slow U.K. economy. On a reported basis, revenue is expected to be up in the mid-teens due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar over last year.In first quarter on TALX, the revenue is expected to be up in mid-teens when compared to the first quarter of 2009 driven primarily by the growth in the Work Number.In PSOL, we expect revenue to be down modestly when compared to the first quarter of 2009, but at much better rate when compared to what we experienced in the first quarter of 2009 versus the first quarter of 2008. The North American Commercial Solutions first quarter, revenue is expected to be up modestly in local currency when compared to the first quarter of 2009. So now let me turn over to Lee, who will give you more financial details. Lee?"
175749,84148369,55174,"Equifax Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-04-2010",2010-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick and good morning, everyone. This morning, all financial information I will be discussing is presented on a GAAP basis except as otherwise noted, and will exclude the restructuring charge described in our press release. You should also refer t",1516,"Thanks, Rick and good morning, everyone. This morning, all financial information I will be discussing is presented on a GAAP basis except as otherwise noted, and will exclude the restructuring charge described in our press release. You should also refer to the Q&A and non-GAAP reconciliations attached to our earnings release for additional financial information.For the quarter compared to the same quarter in 2008, consolidated revenue of $464.3 million was up 3.9%. Changes in foreign exchange rates favorably impacted revenue by approximately $13.6 million. In constant dollars, revenue was up almost 1%. The acquisition of IXI and Rapid Reporting, two significant strategic investments made during the quarter, added approximately two percentage points of growth in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, the operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2009 was 19.7%. After adjusting for the restructuring charge, the operating margin was 23.2% in the quarter compared to 26% in 2008 and 23.5% in both the second and third quarters of 2009.Excluding the amortization of acquisition intangibles and the restructuring charge, the adjusted operating margin was 28.2%. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.47. Excluding the impact of acquisition related intangible amortization, a tax benefit related to foreign tax credit carryforwards and the restructuring charge, adjusted earnings per share were $0.61 flat when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.Even excluding the foreign tax credit carryforward benefit, we still had an unusually low tax rate in the quarter. At a tax rate excluding discrete items that would be close to the 36%, our adjusted EPS would have been lower by approximately $0.04 but still in line with our guidance. Total debt increased during the quarter by $105 million. During the quarter, we invested $196 million in the two acquisitions we completed, of which a little under half was funded with cash from operations and the remainder from a net increase in debt.In contrast to most of 2008 and 2009, when in most quarters, we saw a modest sequential decline in constant currency revenue as activity in many of our end use markets continue to soften, we are somewhat encouraged by the most recent quarterly performance. Fourth quarter revenue was essentially flat when compared to the third quarter on a constant currency basis and excluding the impact of acquisitions, reflecting a more stable operating environment and continuing traction from our NPI initiatives.Now for the individual business units. U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $199 million for the quarter. Excluding the contribution from IXI, revenue was in line with the expectations we communicated during our third quarter earnings release in October. Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $122.2 million, down 9.6% compared to 2008, primarily driven by a 14% decline in our online credit decision volume. Average revenue per transaction was flat as price compression was offset by the mix of transaction volume.Mortgage Solutions revenue of $23 million was up 27% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Mortgage Reporting revenue was up 22% over the prior year, and Settlement Services was up over 40% compared to the same quarter in 2008.Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue, which is comprised of Credit Marketing Services and our newly acquired IXI was $30.9 million. Excluding the contribution from IXI, revenue was down in the high teens from the last year due to lower prescreen and portfolio review volumes with our larger customers and to pricing pressure. Turning to Q3 of 2009, revenue was down approximately 2%, excluding the contribution from IXI. Although our primary banking customers have continued to test and analyze various marketing strategies, they have been hesitant to launch large campaigns until they can ensure full and complete compliance of the CARD Act .Direct Marketing Services revenue was $22.9 million, down 5.7% from the fourth quarter of 2008, but up 8.4% compared to the third quarter, reflecting normal seasonal patterns. The operating margin for our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions segment was 33.2%, down from the third quarter due to lower total revenue and shift in product line mix toward lower margin mortgage solutions and Direct Marketing Services.International's revenue was $117.7 million compared to $105.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. In local currency, revenue was down 0.9% from a year ago and 0.8% from the third quarter, consistent with the expectations we communicated during our third quarter earnings release in October.By region, Latin America's revenue was $55.1 million, up 19% in U.S. dollar terms and 3.2% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2008. This marks a return to year-over-year growth after declines in the second and third quarters of this year when Latin American economy is temporarily weakened. Europe delivered revenue of $35.9 million, flat in U.S. dollars and down 5.7% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2008. While still reflective of the year-over-year weak economic conditions, this is an improvement from year-over-year local currency comparisons in the first three quarters of this year. Our Canada consumer revenue was $26.7 million in the quarter, up 13% in U.S. dollars but down 1.5% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2008. Again, the best year-over-year local currency comparisons this year.International's operating margin was 27.5%, up from 27.0% in 2008 and up approximately 50 basis points from the third quarter. Operating margins were up in eight of the 11 country geographies. TALX revenue in the fourth quarter was $89.4 million, up 18.5% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and approximately 12% excluding the contribution from Rapid Reporting. The Work Number continues to deliver broad-based growth with revenue of $41.6 million. Tax and Talent Management Services delivered $47.8 million of revenue, up 8% compared to last year. And the TALX operating margin was 21.1% compared to 19.9% in the same period in 2008.In North America Personal Solutions, revenue was up $36 million, down 3.2% from the prior year and generally in line with the expectations we communicated during our third quarter earnings release.Direct to Consumer subscription revenue was up 5% year-over-year, but was more than offset by double-digit declines in breach and transaction revenues, which have been more economically sensitive. Operating margin was 28.1% for the quarter, which is up from 27.3% in the third quarter, though down from the 33.9% in the prior year. During the fourth quarter, advertising expense was up 20% compared to the fourth quarter of last year as we continue to promote various subscription products with TV advertising.North America Commercial Solutions revenue was $22.2 million, up 11.4% on a reported basis and up 7.5% in local currency. Compared to the third quarter, revenue was up 38% and substantially ahead of our expectations communicated during the third quarter earnings call. Our Data Management product revenues delivered healthy double-digit growth and several new and existing customers initiated projects to support their revenue growth initiatives. The operating margin in our commercial business was 34% compared to 28.3% in the fourth quarter a year ago.In summary, our fourth quarter performance is solid and very much in line with the expectations we communicated last October. For the year, compared to 2008, consolidated revenue of $1.8 billion was down 5.8%. Changes in foreign exchange rates unfavorably impacted revenue by $48.9 million. In constant dollars, revenue declined 3.2%. Operating margin was 22.3% for the year compared to 24.7% in 2008. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusting for restructuring charges, adjusted operating margin was 23.7%. Excluding acquisition-related amortization, comparable to the reported metric of one of our public competitors, adjusted margins were 28.5%. Diluted earnings per share for the year was $1.83, down from $2.09 in 2008. Excluding the impact of our acquisition-related intangible amortizations, the restructuring charge and the income tax benefit previously noted, adjusted earnings per share was $2.33, down from $2.48 in 2008.With the fourth quarter adjustments, we have now fully recognized our foreign tax credit carryforwards. As a result, looking forward, our effective tax rate in 2010 is expected to increase to a range of 37% to 38%, more than two full percentage points higher than 2009Æs adjusted tax rate. This will negatively impact our earnings per share in 2010 by approximately $0.07 to $0.08 when compared to 2009.Finally, we reduced debt during the year by $45 million while financing the acquisitions that we described. Throughout the year, we worked hard to position ourselves for a recovery. We accelerated the operating cost initiatives in our traditional businesses to protect our operating margins, achieving a $60 million reduction expense excluding the impact of foreign exchange in our expense base for those businesses.  We also invested in our growth businesses such as TALX and Mortgage Reporting, expanding operating margins in those businesses by almost 400 basis points collectively. In conjunction with the acquisitions we made in the fourth quarter, we issued $275 million in five-year notes at very attractive rates due in large part to the strength of our balance sheet and strong operating cash flow.  Delivering this performance in 2010 reflects very much on our balanced focus of aggressively managing our expenses while investing in our strategic growth initiatives. Now let me turn it back to Rick."

One, I expect that the GDP around the world thereÆll be some growth but itÆll be modest and improving throughout the year. I think that employment specifically in the U.S. is going to remain at high levels -- unemployment at high levels throughout most of the year. You may see a slight improvement towards the very end of the year. Home prices will continue to face pressure due to foreclosures rising. On a positive side, we are starting to see an increased interest from credit card issuers to begin soliciting new customers and that should drive growth for business in the second half of the year. As a result, I think 2010 will be a year we return to growth. With this outlook and given the current foreign exchange rates, we expect operating results to be stable at their current levels during the first half of the year and then pick up nicely in the second half of the year. For the first quarter, assuming the current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be up in the low single-digit range from a year ago, and adjusted EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.53 a share and $0.57 a share including the negative impact of a higher effective tax rate. For the full year, we intend to give you CapEx guidance. This year, we expect CapEx to be in the range of $75 million to $100 million. 2009, we delivered what I call a solid financial performance in that economic environment. As we enter 2010 I feel much better than I did a year ago. We got a strong balance sheet. We got great data assets. We got unique product offerings and most importantly, we also have an improved economic environment, which should bode well for the company.

And I think we continue to feel targeting the range of 1.75x to 2x debt to EBITDA positions as effectively to absorb acquisitions like the ones we did in the fourth quarters. We ended 2009 with a debt to EBITDA at about 2.1x.

These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC including our 2008 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are explained in the non-GAAP financial measures reconciliation attached our earnings release including adjusted net income, adjusted operating margins, adjusted diluted EPS and operating results excluding the impact of foreign exchange. These measures also exclude the restructuring charge and income tax benefit in the fourth quarter, which is described in our press release. The pretax impact of the restructuring charge is $16.4 million for the fourth quarter and $24.8 million for the full year of 2009. The after-tax impact of the restructuring charge is $10.4 million in the fourth quarter and $15.8 million for the full year. The tax benefit in the fourth quarter was $7.3 million.

But a year that also as we exited 2009, was a year in which we started to see some stability. Our business model served us well. I think you'd all agree over the past few years, the leadership team, for that matter all the employees of Equifax faced into the challenges of 2009. They made some very tough decisions while maintaining our focus on the long-term strategy and executing our short-term plans to manage our expense base. We also accomplished two very strategic acquisitions in 2009 and delivered, I think an impressive financial performance. WeÆre a stronger company as we enter 2010 and I feel much better about the prospects of the upcoming year that I felt one year ago. We have unique and significant data assets that are unmatched by our competition. I'll talk about that in great detail later on. We've also streamlined our cost base. We've institutionalized LEAN operating model that will provide important operating leverage during the recovery. We have many new products that address customersÆ emerging needs for the marketing and risk management decisions, and we continue to deliver attractive financial returns enabling us to reinvest in the business and return value to our shareholders. Taking a look at the quarter. Our fourth quarter results were strong and exceeded the outlook we gave you on the conference call covering our third quarter earnings release. Total revenue was $464.3 million, up 1% in constant dollars from the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 2% in constant dollars from the third quarter of 2009. Operating margin was 23.2% excluding the restructuring charge, down slightly when compared to the third quarter 2009 largely driven by mix. Adjusted EPS was $0.61 a share, exceeding the guidance we gave during the third quarter earnings release. Also, some noteworthy accomplishments that the team delivered during the quarter. Number one, Online Consumer Services is the core of our USCIS [U.S. Consumer Information Solutions] business. It's operating margins continue to be strong. For the fourth quarter 2009, the operating margin was up slightly from the fourth quarters of both 2008 and 2007 despite revenue being down over 90% during the quarter. As a result, USCIS can continue investing in NPI while countering recent pricing pressures in our Marketing business.TALX Work Number revenue was up 17% excluding the contribution from Rapid Reporting continuing the double-digit growth trend since the acquisition in May of 2007. PSOL, Personal Solutions grew its direct-to-consumer branded Subscription business by 5% while delivering strong double-digit margins over 28% in the fourth quarter and 23% for the full year. North American Commercial grew revenue 11.4% in the fourth quarter with 34% operating margin, up significantly from fourth quarter 2008.International delivered a solid quarter compared to the third quarter as operating margin improved by 50 basis points. In addition, year-over-year revenue growth improved in all three major geographies when compared to year-over-year growth in third quarter. And we completed, as I mentioned before, two strategic acquisitions that will strengthen our franchise and broaden our opportunities for growth. And again, I'll talk about both those in a moment. And for the year, we delivered strong financial results in that very difficult environment, which Lee will report on shortly. We also made great progress on our most important strategic objectives, which are intended to redefine a competitive landscape as well as further diversify our revenue growth.First, let me talk about this. For three years now, NPI, New Product Innovation, I'm very proud of the accomplishments we've made with NPI. Throughout the company the process of idea creation, formulation, development and implementation on new products is achieved through many of our employees. It's a process that has become very critical part of our DNA and delivered significant revenue growth for us in 2009. For the year, we launched 65 new products and generated $134 million in revenue from products launched in 2006, '07 and '08. We call that, as you know, our NPI Vitality Index. Our three largest business units, USCIS, TALX and International, all delivered strong double-digit NPI growth versus 2008. Our objective is to have over 10% of each business unit's annual revenue driven by their NPI initiatives.  Next is our Technology and Analytical Services, we call it TALX. Today's environment has added significantly to the challenges our customers face in managing their lending risk and improving their underwriting decisions. As a result, customers both domestic and international are increasingly demanding more innovation from our software and analytical solutions to address these challenges. As you know in 2009, we consolidated our Enabling Technologies and Analytical Services organization into our global Technology and Analytical Services unit to pursue markets not presently served by existing business units and to develop solutions that access non-Equifax that has important deviation from us. Whereas in the past, that particular entity was used only enabling data sales never going to embark a ton[ph] (10:44) of opportunities that are outside of the need for pulling through our data and I'd love to talk about that in the Q&A, if you've got any questions.Finally, customers continue to reinforce that InterConnect platform is the platform of choice for their decisioning needs. This platform has been very successful as you know in the U.S. and most recently in Canada. And we've also introduced InterConnect in the U.K. and have received interest from some of our Latin American customers as well. So that is a platform that will soon become a standard platform for us globally. Our acquisition of IXI is already having an impact on our product offerings. With our combined experience, unique data and sophisticated analytical resources, Equifax is leading the industry with powerful ability to pay solutions. Only Equifax can offer ability to pay solutions that leverage the Work Number database and incorporate models built with actual wealth and income data. And these solutions can be delivered in realtime or in batch to best suit our customers' needs. We're truly uniquely positioned there. Our comprehensive set of data assets makes us the only source for a complete 360-degree view of the customers, including their propensity to pay; and with IXI and the Work Number, their ability to pay and their capacity to pay. The data assets of IXI will broaden the understanding of our customers' wealth, income and spending which can further drive break-through decisioning and targeting solutions for our customers. In short, the building blocks we have in our vast data arsenal combined with our capabilities in the analytics and decisioning technology provide us with a much broader set of differentiated solutions to serve our customers' business needs. The acquisition of Rapid Reporting, we made last year has significantly scaled our 45,060 services within the Work Number business segment. Combined with our acquisition of Discover Source in 2008, TALX is the industry leader for IRS tax return information and Social Security Number verification services. Rapid Reporting's 12-year relationship with the IRS has underpinned the evolution of these services for the industry. We will continue to drive innovation, leveraging our close working relationship with the IRS and the Social Security Administration. We anticipate various legislative proposals in Congress and this was being undertaken at Fannie and Freddie and more rigorous underwriting standards being adopted by many of large mortgage lenders will lead to attractive growth and product development opportunities for these types of services in 2010 and beyond. With our current scale of operations, we have the capacity to deliver a unique portfolio of products with a high quality of services at a competitive price. Something I've been deeply involved in as we shift gears is something we launched just recently called our Key Client Program. Equifax, as you know, has a long history of focusing on the needs of our customers. Their need for innovation and new decisioning tools is more critical now than ever. In 2009, we enhanced our commitment to a select group of our largest, most influential customers by dedicating some of our most talented professionals strictly to their needs. In my meetings with CEOs of our major customers, it quickly became obvious that we needed to rethink how we best organize and serve their large and complex needs in this new environment. For many of them, we've had numerous initiatives underway throughout our company. They want a stronger coordination and cooperation across our enterprise, staffed with professionals who truly understand them, speak their language and have the utmost integrity and very collaborative and engaged in our operating excellence. For the fourth quarter, we organized a global Key Client Program. Each key client will have a dedicated team, including a chief client officer as well as a specialist in each of our solution-oriented disciplines, including analytics, decisioning and marketing. Unlike many of these types of enterprise-wide initiatives, these teams have solid line reporting relationships to a chief client officer not your more typical bottom line structure.  So simply what we've done is taken the best in values people we have across the entire organization and they are now full time dedicated to the health and wellbeing of selected customers for Equifax. Each team is going to be evaluated and measured solely on their success in driving product penetration and revenue growth with these specific clients. The whole goal there is to disrupt the marketplace and gain share in these key clients. I believe this approach will, in fact, disrupt the marketplace, drive a deeper and longer-lasting relationships with our most important customers and give us many new opportunities as we deliver superior solutions that leverage our unique capabilities and our unique data assets.By now, I think you've all seen the press on our joint venture in India. After many months, in fact, years of active preparation, we have finalized and funded a partnership with six large public and private institutions in the banking and financial sectors. We submitted our application to the Reserve Bank of India and we expect to be granted a license sometime later in the first quarter or at worst case, early second quarter 2010. Later this year, we expect to have the IT infrastructure completed and operational. Our global data service platform will provide key strategic differentiators such as the ability to host unique, negative and positive data from a variety of sources. I am optimistic, and remains optimistic as I have in the past that this is a great long-term growth opportunity for Equifax.Moving on to Global Operations. They continue to be a critical driver of leverage across our business units. In 2009, we accelerated our LEAN initiatives to further improve operating leverage and give us the ability to quickly scale operations consistent with our customer demands. We completed 54 initiatives across the business and delivered over $10 million of incremental expense savings in 2009. Over 1,200 individuals have been trained in LEAN methodologies and tools further ingraining the operational excellence culture into the management's DNA. And I expect the 2010 contributions in expense savings from LEAN to be even greater. In fact, up double digit over the savings from 2009.Let's just talk about the talent in the company for a second. It's a very important part of our culture here; recruiting the best, developing the best and retaining the best. And to that end, we recently promoted two of our seasoned leaders to drive growth for our Personal Solutions and our Commercial business units. I think many of you know Trey Loughran. Trey has led our corporate development effort now for three and a half to four years, and most recently promoted to lead and become President of our North American Personal Solutions business unit.  We've also promoted Alex Gonzalez, who is leading our strategic marketing activities. He is now the President of our North American Commercial Solutions business. I've got great expectations for both of these as they bring these business units to new levels of growth and profitability.We've also hired a world-class Chief Technology Officer, who had joined us a few weeks ago. I believe it's three weeks ago, Dave Webb. Dave is a very seasoned IT leader, comes with a broad and diverse set of experiences in the IT world. I really look forward to having Dave join the organization.We've accomplished a great deal over the past year, while not deviating from our strategy and our business model continues to deliver strong operating margins and cash flow for reinvestment into the business and returns to our shareholders. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Our access to capital is good. Our operating leverage will enable us to improve those margins when growth returns, and I do expect that growth to return later on this year. Clearly, the environment and Equifax have begun to stabilize, which is good news; a trend that I expect that will continue throughout the first half of 2010. I also expect our financial performance to increase in the second half of 2010 as the economy continues and begins to recover. We talked very briefly about the outlook for each of our business units for the first quarter. For the first quarter, USCIS revenue is expected to be down in the mid- to upper-single digit range when compared with the first quarter of 2009. That is primarily driven by the decline in the volume of mortgage lending activity that we saw in the first quarter of 2009. And refresh everyone's memory, we had a significant refinancing boom in the first quarter of 2009. I don't anticipate that will repeat for obvious reasons in the first quarter 2010, but the underlying health of the USCIS business, excluding mortgage, is relatively stable.In the first quarter, we expect International revenue excluding any impact of foreign currency translation to be up modestly when compared to the first quarter of 2009, as growth in Canada and Latin America offsetting slow U.K. economy. On a reported basis, revenue is expected to be up in the mid-teens due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar over last year.In first quarter on TALX, the revenue is expected to be up in mid-teens when compared to the first quarter of 2009, driven primarily by the growth in the Work Number.In PSOL, we expect revenue to be down modestly when compared to the first quarter of 2009, but at a much better rate when compared to what we experienced in the first quarter of 2009 versus the first quarter of 2008. The North American Commercial Solutions first quarter, revenue is expected to be up modestly in local currency when compared to the first quarter of 2009. So now let me turn over to Lee, who will give you more financial details. Lee?"
175749,84148369,55203,"Equifax Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-04-2010",2010-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. This morning, all financial information I will be discussing is presented on a GAAP basis, except as otherwise noted, and will exclude the restructuring charge described in our press release. You should also refer",1516,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. This morning, all financial information I will be discussing is presented on a GAAP basis, except as otherwise noted, and will exclude the restructuring charge described in our press release. You should also refer to the Q&A and non-GAAP reconciliations attached to our earnings release for additional financial information.For the quarter compared to the same quarter in 2008, consolidated revenue of $464.3 million was up 3.9%. Changes in foreign exchange rates favorably impacted revenue by approximately $13.6 million. In constant dollars, revenue was up almost 1%. The acquisition of IXI and Rapid Reporting, two significant strategic investments made during the quarter, added approximately two percentage points of growth in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, the operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2009 was 19.7%. After adjusting for the restructuring charge, the operating margin was 23.2% in the quarter compared to 26% in 2008 and 23.5% in both the second and third quarters of 2009.Excluding the amortization of acquisition intangibles and the restructuring charge, the adjusted operating margin was 28.2%. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.47. Excluding the impact of acquisition related intangible amortization, a tax benefit related to foreign tax credit carryforwards and the restructuring charge, adjusted earnings per share were $0.61 flat when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.Even excluding the foreign tax credit carryforward benefit, we still had an unusually low tax rate in the quarter. At a tax rate excluding discrete items that would be close to the 36%, our adjusted EPS would have been lower by approximately $0.04 but still in line with our guidance. Total debt increased during the quarter by $105 million. During the quarter, we invested $196 million in the two acquisitions we completed, of which a little under half was funded with cash from operations, and the remainder from a net increase in debt.In contrast to most of 2008 and 2009, when in most quarters, we saw a modest sequential decline in constant currency revenue as activity in many of our end use markets continue to soften, we are somewhat encouraged by the most recent quarterly performance. Fourth quarter revenue was essentially flat when compared to the third quarter on a constant currency basis and excluding the impact of acquisitions, reflecting a more stable operating environment and continuing traction from our NPI initiatives.Now for the individual business units. U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $199 million for the quarter. Excluding the contribution from IXI, revenue was in line with the expectations we communicated during our third quarter earnings release in October. Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $122.2 million, down 9.6% compared to 2008, primarily driven by a 14% decline in our online credit decision volume. Average revenue per transaction was flat as price compression was offset by the mix of transaction volume.Mortgage Solutions revenue of $23 million was up 27% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Mortgage Reporting revenue was up 22% over the prior year, and Settlement Services was up over 40% compared to the same quarter in 2008.Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue, which is comprised of Credit Marketing Services in our newly acquired IXI was $30.9 million. Excluding the contribution from IXI, revenue was down in the high teens from the last year due to lower prescreen and portfolio review volumes with our larger customers and to pricing pressure. Turning to Q3 of 2009, revenue was down approximately 2%, excluding the contribution from IXI. Although our primary banking customers have continued to test and analyze various marketing strategies, they have been hesitant to launch large campaigns until they can ensure full and complete compliance of the CARD Act .Direct Marketing Services revenue was $22.9 million, down 5.7% from the fourth quarter of 2008, but up 8.4% compared to the third quarter, reflecting normal seasonal patterns. The operating margin for our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions segment was 33.2%, down from the third quarter due to lower total revenue and shift in product line mix toward lower margin mortgage solutions and Direct Marketing Services.International's revenue was $117.7 million compared to $105.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. In local currency, revenue was down 0.9% from a year ago and 0.8% from the third quarter, consistent with the expectations we communicated during our third quarter earnings release in October.By region, Latin America's revenue was $55.1 million, up 19% in U.S. dollar terms and 3.2% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2008. This marks a return to year-over-year growth after declines in the second and third quarters of this year when Latin American economy is temporarily weakened. Europe delivered revenue of $35.9 million, flat in U.S. dollars and down 5.7% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2008. While still reflective of the year-over-year weak economic conditions, this is an improvement from year-over-year local currency comparisons in the first three quarters of this year. Our Canada consumer revenue was $26.7 million in the quarter, up 13% in U.S. dollars but down 1.5% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2008. Again, the best year-over-year local currency comparisons this year.International's operating margin was 27.5%, up from 27.0% in 2008 and up approximately 50 basis points from the third quarter. Operating margins were up in eight of the 11 country geographies. TALX revenue in the fourth quarter was $89.4 million, up 18.5% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and approximately 12% excluding the contribution from Rapid Reporting. The Work Number continues to deliver broad-based growth with revenue of $41.6 million. Tax and Talent Management Services delivered $47.8 million of revenue, up 8% compared to last year. And the TALX operating margin was 21.1% compared to 19.9% in the same period in 2008.In North America Personal Solutions, revenue was up $36 million, down 3.2% from the prior year and generally in line with the expectations we communicated during our third quarter earnings release.Direct to Consumer subscription revenue was up 5% year-over-year, but was more than offset by double-digit declines in breach and transaction revenues, which have been more economically sensitive. Operating margin was 28.1% for the quarter, which is up from 27.3% in the third quarter, though down from the 33.9% in the prior year. During the fourth quarter, advertising expense was up 20% compared to the fourth quarter of last year as we continue to promote various subscription products with TV advertising.North America Commercial Solutions revenue was $22.2 million, up 11.4% on a reported basis and up 7.5% in local currency. Compared to the third quarter, revenue was up 38% and substantially ahead of our expectations communicated during the third quarter earnings call. Our Data Management product revenues delivered healthy double-digit growth and several new and existing customers initiated projects to support their revenue growth initiatives. The operating margin in our commercial business was 34% compared to 28.3% in the fourth quarter a year ago.In summary, our fourth quarter performance is solid and very much in line with the expectations we communicated last October. For the year, compared to 2008, consolidated revenue of $1.8 billion was down 5.8%. Changes in foreign exchange rates unfavorably impacted revenue by $48.9 million. In constant dollars, revenue declined 3.2%. Operating margin was 22.3% for the year compared to 24.7% in 2008. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusting for restructuring charges, adjusted operating margin was 23.7%. Excluding acquisition-related amortization, comparable to the reported metric of one of our public competitors, adjusted margins were 28.5%. Diluted earnings per share for the year was $1.83, down from $2.09 in 2008. Excluding the impact of our acquisition-related intangible amortizations, the restructuring charge and the income tax benefit previously noted, adjusted earnings per share was $2.33, down from $2.48 in 2008.With the fourth quarter adjustments, we have now fully recognized our foreign tax credit carryforwards. As a result, looking forward, our effective tax rate in 2010 is expected to increase to a range of 37% to 38%, more than two full percentage points higher than 2009Æs adjusted tax rate. This will negatively impact our earnings per share in 2010 by approximately $0.07 to $0.08 when compared to 2009.Finally, we reduced debt during the year by $45 million while financing the acquisitions that we described. Throughout the year, we worked hard to position ourselves for a recovery. We accelerated the operating cost initiatives in our traditional businesses to protect our operating margins, achieving a $60 million reduction expense excluding the impact of foreign exchange in our expense base for those businesses.  We also invested in our growth businesses such as TALX and Mortgage Reporting, expanding operating margins in those businesses by almost 400 basis points collectively. In conjunction with the acquisitions we made in the fourth quarter, we issued $275 million in five-year notes at very attractive rates due in large part to the strength of our balance sheet and strong operating cash flow.  Delivering this performance in 2010 reflects very much on our balanced focus of aggressively managing our expenses while investing in our strategic growth initiatives. Now let me turn it back to Rick."

One, I expect that the GDP around the world thereÆll be some growth but itÆll be modest and improving throughout the year. I think that employment specifically in the U.S. is going to remain at high levels -- unemployment at high levels throughout most of the year. You may see a slight improvement towards the very end of the year. Home prices will continue to face pressure due to foreclosures rising. On a positive side, we are starting to see an increased interest from credit card issuers to begin soliciting new customers and that should drive growth for business in the second half of the year. As a result, I think 2010 will be a year we return to growth. With this outlook and given the current foreign exchange rates, we expect operating results to be stable at their current levels during the first half of the year and then pick up nicely in the second half of the year. For the first quarter, assuming the current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be up in the low single-digit range from a year ago, and adjusted EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.53 a share and $0.57 a share including the negative impact of a higher effective tax rate. For the full year, we intend to give you CapEx guidance. This year, we expect CapEx to be in the range of $75 million to $100 million. 2009, we delivered what I call a solid financial performance in that economic environment. As we enter 2010 I feel much better than I did a year ago. We got a strong balance sheet. We got great data assets. We got unique product offerings and most importantly, we also have an improved economic environment, which should bode well for the company.

In fact, we have both the positive other income, so it's actually some negative as we have some investments coming through as we launch India. So that's just some noise [indiscernible] on the numbers.  And secondly, there's some mix changes in the business. It cradled a little bit of headwind when we look at the EPS quarter-on-quarter comparisons. But as far as the Credit Card Reform Act, that's launched in February. I think you'll see some positive benefits. But truly, I think that happens in the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter, not necessarily the first quarter."

We ended the quarter pretty much inline with our expectations and we saw strengthening in trends as the quarter progressed. As for the numbers the total revenue for the quarter was $461.3 million, up 3% on a reported basis and flat on a constant dollar basis in the first quarter of last year.
The operating margin was 23.3%, up slightly when compared to the fourth quarter adjusted operating margins of 23.2%, adjusted EPS was $0.56 0which is inline with the outlook we gave during the fourth quarter earnings release. As I stated today, my optimism for the full-year has improved.
Given how we ended the quarter and as four of our five business units deliver constant dollar revenue growth over the prior year. Here is some details, first on the Online Consumer Information Solutions operating margin were up slightly compared to fourth quarter 2009. As we continued to gain traction in some of our newer online products such as we’ve always focused on consumer’s income and ability to pay, I’ll talk about that in some detail later on. 
Despite of 35% reduction in the mortgage application index, the Work Number verifications actually grew 5%, during the quarter due to strength in collections, government and consumer finance. The mortgage portion started slowly for the Work Number towards six, seven weeks and then finished strong over the remaining four or five weeks of the quarter, given the confidence as we go into the second quarter. 
Personal Solutions, we exceeded our expectations for both revenue growth and operating margins, its direct-to-consumer branded description business grew by over 13%. Also this quarter represents the first quarterly year-over-year growth since the third quarter of 2008 as the team has done a fantastic job on executing the number changes in experience that our online customers have. 
I think North America’s commercials, US commercial and risk marketing business delivered strong double-digit growth by the business segment exceeded our expectations for those revenue growths and operating margin in the quarter. International continued to make progress in many of its markets in net of our expectations for revenue growth for the quarter. 
We’ve talked many times about our four pillars of growth strategy, one, increased share of customers spend. Two, increased penetration of technology and networking services; three, differential data that is unique from a competition, by full expansion into key emerging markets as I’ll talk about all four of those now. 
As you know to-date, we’ve made some very important strategic acquisitions. We’ve introduced the number of very unique products. We brought many of our existing customer relationships and develop significant new customer relationships based on superior value of our products and services. 
Today, I want to take you through some very real live examples, but how the strategies playing out in the marketplace and with our customers and allowing us to gain market share. According to the charm the 360 degree deal of the customer, you could as talk about that in the past, where we display the powerful insights our customers gain, and they leverage the benefits of our employment, our income, our wealth and our tough going utility data combined with our credit data brought them a better decisions in an increasingly challenging competitive environment.
I’m going to walk you through now some specific examples where we gained share over the first three months of 2010. In the first quarter, we signed a multiyear deal with $25 million to $30 million with the major insurance company, increasing our shares selected core product offerings from a very small share to 100%.
Although this customer had given a majority of their business to a competitor for over 15 years we’ll also count it with a lower price. We own this opportunity because, we represented a stronger longer-term business partner due to the diversity and quay from data assets the breadth of our decisioning platforms spend of superior analytic capabilities.
With our unique solutions, we can enable this testaments offer more competitive rates approved customers who would otherwise had been rejected, reduce frauds, ID analytics, ID authentication and data verification and approve the underwriting for small businesses for example, again by leveraging the most unique data assets in the industry.
In the first quarter, we increased our share of online credit approach from 25% to 50% and a key business units of a top four bank. Our current relationship includes products from eight Equifax business units including online consumer information, IXI, mortgage reporting, direct marketing services, the Work Number North American Commercial and technology and then analytical services truly overwhelming the customer with all of our product offerings.
The new opportunities include additional market share for a Work Number products, analytics and our new personal income model, which leverages both our divested assets as well as our analytical capabilities. The power of this 360 degree view of the consumer is enabling us to expand our partnership with another top four banks. In addition to our InterConnect platform and our core services offering, we’re leveraging a broader way of newer products including the Work Number. Reg G complains income in credit capacity models, that’s the income formulations, settlement services, and property evaluation estimator.
Today, eight different Equifax business segments are also showing solutions to seven different business segments of this customer although we have now the largest share on the credit-based information and solutions, to a very special projects our technology and local services unit has provided this customer with valuable insight and careful to improve their underrating practices while enabling them to find new opportunities to grow revenue and profit.
Finally and very exiting, we recently won an opportunity with a major internet proto to help them determine worked advertising content to display to consumers on the internet. With the IXI data, will be that’s full partner for data driven targeting for household economic information and that if you look through a further enhanced benefits of the IXI data for this customer with income data at the plus four level.
Our unique data and capabilities enabled us to win this opportunity at it price more than two times with economic paying to our two competitors with lesser quality information. In fact many of the IXI’s current clients strongly hear this portal to integrate IXI data into their online product offering. Our new -- I’d say it was enormous digital marketing space, it looks very promising. 
No one else in our industry has the ability to solve these increasingly complex problems, but we can now solve, we got unique data assets. Technology and analytical services performs a critical support for many of our 360 degree initiatives, domestically and internationally. Our creative and innovative analytics continue to be highly valued by our customers.
Equifax scores delivered on a credit reporting increasing just over 20% in the first quarter of 2008, totaled 30% to the first quarter 2010. We are also leveraging our decision platforms on a global scale. InterConnect was introduced in Canada as you know last year, we have a number of signed deals and active customers in Canada coming in 2010 and we have another large customer in the contract stage and a growing pipeline. 
InterConnect is also being deployed in UK, where they have a one signed financial institution and building a pipeline of new opportunities over the point of similar plan across our footprint in Latin America. As you know last year we really expanded this scope of what we call TAS, Technology and Analytical Services, to further leverage its expertise in the areas where required solution is not surely dependent on Equifax data and that is a significant change more past strategy where we sold our Technology and Analytical Services only to pull through data. We are now looking at being data agnostic as it comes to those solutions.
We’re increasing our investment in this area to develop software solutions that will integrate analytics on customer information and on other various data assets. It enable us to enter new markets, where we can leverage our decisioning software tools quickly and develop a products and capabilities in the areas of fraud, maximizing customer profitability, and improved portfolio management. 
Now moving onto new product innovations, something we’ve talked to you about a lot over the past two years is continued again significant attraction for us. We’ve launched 12 new products during the quarter. The revenue from products launch during the prior two years, we approach you as charity index it was $40 million in the first quarter of 2010, that up 29% from the first quarter 2009. Our long-term goal as you know we’ve had at least 10% of our revenues in each business unit, generated by new products launch during the previous three years and we’re well on our way to doing with that.
Also during the quarters, you have read to receive the license from Reserve Bank of India that operated credit reporting, that it’s in India along with six Indian financial institutions as our partners. We have the CEO now onboard in India and we’re not soliciting and loading data from a number of financial institutions. We expect to be fully operational over the coming few months, but view that as great launch on growth opportunity for Equifax.
The growth operations, we continued to make great progress with our LEAN initiatives. Many of our customers asked us to develop joint process improvement initiatives, using LEAN great competitive differentiated for us and we further scandalizing various tools and measures in our international operations to improve operating efficiencies and continued to register our cost outside the US. We continued to make significant progress on our key strategic initiatives and have a number of outstanding growth opportunities in front of us. Our outlook for the second quarter is consistent with the outlook for many of our customers, which is lot of going optimism.
The second quarter, USCIS revenues expected to be down in a low single-digit range when compared to second quarter of 2009. However, it will be up mid single-digits, when compared to the first quarter of 2010. We expect international revenue excluding any impact of foreign currency translations to be up and a lower single-digit range, when compared to second quarter of 2009, all 3G graphic regions are expected to deliver positive revenue growth in the second quarter.
The second quarter TALX revenues expected to deliver strong growth in the high single digit to mid-team range. Strengthening the Work Number will be partially offset by expected softness in the Tax and Talent Management services as improvement in the job markets lowers unemployment clients’ activity.
Personal Solution should continue to show growth in a low single-digit range in the second quarter of 2009, as market conditions improved and transaction with our newer products increases and our ability to execute the change we’ve talked about past six month are gaining traction. North American Commercial Solution is again expected to deliver high single to low double-digit growth in second quarter, when compared to the second quarter of 2009. So this is how employment affected across all products as we go to the second quarter.
So with that I’ll stop and turn it over to Lee, who will give you the details on a financials. Lee.

This morning, all financial information I will be discussing is presented on a GAAP basis, except as otherwise noted, and treat APPRO was a discontinued operation given the recently completed sales of this presence",1123,"Thanks, Rick and good morning, everyone. This morning, all financial information I will be discussing is presented on a GAAP basis, except as otherwise noted, and treat APPRO was a discontinued operation given the recently completed sales of this presence. You should also refer to the Q-and-A and non-GAAP reconciliations attached to our earnings release for additional financial information.
As Rich as pointed out, our quarter performance is encouraging, when compared to fourth quarter of 2009, first quarter 2010 revenue on a constant dollar organic basis was up $0.06 of a present from the fourth quarter. This reverse is modest sequential declines we’d seen in the prior three quarters. This quarter’s performance reinforces our view that business conditions are beginning to improve and that our full-year outlook is expressed in our fourth quarter earnings release remains appropriate. Now with the details, compared to the same quarter in 2009 consolidated revenue of $461.3 million was up 3.3%.
Changes in foreign exchange rates favorably impacted revenue by approximately $14.8 million. In constant dollars, revenue was flat. The acquisition of IXI and Rapid Reporting in the fourth quarter of last year, added approximately three percentage points of growth in the first quarter.
On a GAAP basis, the operating margin in the first quarter of 2010 was 23.3%, compared to 22.6% in the first quarter of 2009. On a non-GAAP basis, our first quarter operating margin from continuing operations is down from the prior year, but comparable of 23.2% we reported in the fourth quarter 2009, as for adjusted for the restructuring charges we recorded during that quarter. Excluding the amortization of acquisition intangibles and the restructuring charge in Q1 of 2009, the adjusted operating margin from the first quarter was 28.3%, versus 29% in same period in 2009.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Equifax for the quarter was $0.44, excluding the impact of acquisition related intangible amortization, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax was $0.56. Total debt increased by $26.3 million from December 31, and during the quarter, we repurchased 300,000 shares of stock for $9.4 million. As at quarter end our remaining authorization per share repurchase was $112.
Moving to the individual business units, US Consumer Information Solutions rev, it was $191.4 million, down 6% for the quarter, but slightly better than the expectations we communicated during our fourth quarter earnings release. Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue, which excludes discontinued operations, was $119.8 million, down 8.5% compared to 2009, primarily driven by a 15% decline in our online credit decision volume. The average revenue per transactions is up 1% as pricing gains with our smaller customers were offset by the negative impact in sector mix shift.
Mortgage Solutions revenue of $23.2 million was down 9% when compared to the first quarter of 2009. However, the mortgage banker’s application in debts for the quarter was down 35%. Core mortgage reporting in settlement services each significantly mitigated the impact of lower applications through share gains.
Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue was $30.2 million, excluding the contribution from IXI, revenue was down approximately 11% do largely to lower pricing with our largest customers. Direct Marketing Services revenue was $18.2 million, down 9% from the first quarter of 2009.
Operating margin for our US Consumer Information Solutions segment was 33.1%, down slightly from 33.4% in the fourth quarter of 2009, and down from 36.3% in the first quarter of 2009. Our international business unit’s revenue was $116.2 million, compared to $100.8 million in the same quarter in 2009. In local currency, revenue was up 1.6% from a year ago and consistent with the expectations we communicated during our fourth quarter earnings release in early February.
By region, Latin America’s revenue was $55.1 million, up 20% in US dollar terms and up 5% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2009. Europe delivered revenue of $33.9 million, up 2% in US dollars and down 5% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2009. While still reflected of year-over-year weak economic conditions, this is Europe’s best year-over-year local currency performance since September of 2008.
Canada Consumer Information revenue was $27.2 million, up 25% US dollars and 4% in local currency when compared to the same period a year ago. Also this was best their best year-over-year local currency performance since filling of 2008. International’s operating margin was 24.7%, down from 28.7% in 2009, lower online volumes, which represented our highest margin offerings has been offset by growth in marketing projects and other services allowing us to achieve revenue growth in a still challenging environment, but putting downward pressure on operating margins.
As the business environment begins to recover in some of these international geographies, online volumes should increase and we would expect operating margins to improve. TALX revenue $95.3 million for the quarter, up 8.4% from the first quarter of 2009, in short of the expectations we had previously communicated as the mortgage market prove to be more challenging than anticipated.
Excluding the acquisition of Rapid Reporting, revenue growth would have been flat. The Work Number continues to deliver broad-based growth with revenue $49.7 million up 23%. Excluding rapid reporting the Work Number was up 5% that strengthen government, collections and consumer finance markets allowed us to achieve solid growth despite lower mortgage volumes in a weak labor market, which impacted some of our complimentary services.
Tax and Talent Management services delivered $45.6 million in revenue down 4% compared to last year, driven largely by the strong performance in 2009 and the year-over-year decline in unemployment compensation claims that we’ve experienced in 2010. The TALX operating margins is 22.6%, up compared to 21.5% in 2009.
North American Personal Solutions revenue was $39.7 million up 3% from the prior year, which was significantly better than the outlook we’ve communicated in February. Direct-to-consumer subscription revenue was up 13% year-over-year driven largely by 10% increase in average revenue per subscriber. Operating margin was 25.2% for the quarter up from 15.5% a year ago. Credit Marketing expenses were lower than in the prior period.
North American Commercial Solutions revenue was $18.7 million, up 18% on a reported basis and 12% in local currency driven by higher volume of transactions and project activity. Revenue was substantially ahead of the expectations we’ve communicated through our fourth quarter earnings call in February.
US Commercial Risk and Marketing delivered very healthy double-digit growth as well as improved operating margins, compared to the first quarter of 2009. Operating margin for the segment is 23.5% compared to 14.4% a year ago. In summary, our first quarter performance continues to gradually improving outlook, which we believe will enable us to deliver overall revenue growth in 2010. 
Now, let me turn back to Rick.

An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section of the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.
During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2009 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are explained in the non-GAAP financial measures reconciliation attached to our earnings release, including adjusted net income and adjusted operating margins. These measures also exclude the $8.4 million restructuring charges that were recorded in the first quarter of 2009. 
Adjusted diluted EPS and non-GAAP financial measures includes the results of discontinued operations, but excludes the restructuring charge taken in the first quarter of 2009 and the acquisition-related amortization expense. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation section included in the earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section under the About Equifax tab on our website for further details.

Our first quarter results were very encouraging. We ended the quarter pretty much in line with our expectations, and we saw a strengthening in trends as the quarter progressed. As for the numbers, the total revenue",1924,"Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results were very encouraging. We ended the quarter pretty much in line with our expectations, and we saw a strengthening in trends as the quarter progressed. 
As for the numbers, the total revenue for the quarter was $461.3 million, up 3% on a reported basis, and flat on a constant dollar basis from the first quarter of last year. The operating margin was 23.3%, up slightly when compared to the fourth quarter adjusted operating margin of 23.2%. Adjusted EPS was $0.56, which is in line with the outlook we gave during the fourth quarter earnings release.
And as I sit here today, my optimism for the full year has improved given how we ended the quarter and as four of our five business units delivered constant-dollar revenue growth over the prior year. Here are some details. 
First, on the Online Consumer Information Solutions. Operating margin were up slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 as we continue to gain traction in some of our newer Online products, such as those focused on consumers income and ability to pay, and I'll talk about that in some detail later on.
Despite a 35% reduction in the mortgage application index, the Work Number verifications actually grew 5% during the quarter due to strength in collections, government and consumer finance. The mortgage portion started slowly for the Work Number for six, seven weeks, and then finished strong over the remaining four or five weeks of the quarter, given me confidence as we go into the second quarter. 
Personal Solutions exceeded our expectations for both revenue growth and operating margin as its Direct-to-Consumer Branded Subscription business grew by over 13%.
Also, this quarter represents the first quarterly year-over-year growth since the third quarter of 2008 as the team has done a fantastic job on executing a number of changes in the experience that our Online customers have. The North America's Commercials, U.S. Commercial and Risk Marketing business delivered strong double-digit growth as the business segment exceeded our expectations for both revenue growth and operating margin in the quarter.  International continue to make progress in many of its markets and met our expectations for revenue growth for the quarter.
We talked many times about our four pillars of growth strategy: One, increased share of customer spend; two, increased penetration of Technology and Analytical Services; three, differential data that is unique from the competition; and fourth, expansion into key emerging markets and geographies. I'll talk about all four of those now.
As you know, to date, we've made some very important strategic acquisitions. We've introduced a number of very unique products. We've brought many of our existing customer relationships and developed significant new customer relationships based on superior value of our products and services. Today, I want to take you through some very real wide examples of how the strategy is playing out in the marketplace and with our customers and allowing us to gain market share. 
We have coined the term, the 360-degree view of the customer, you put us talk about that in the past, where we display the powerful insights our customers gain when they leverage the benefits of our employment, our income, our wealth and our topical and utility data, combined with our credit data, allowing them to make better decisions in an increasingly challenging competitive environment. I'm going to walk you through now to some specific examples where we gained share over the first three months of 2010.
In the first quarter, we signed a multi-year deal worth $25 million to $30 million with a major insurance company, increasing our share of selected core product offerings from a very small share to 100%. Although this customer had given the majority of their business to a competitor for over 15 years, we also counter with a lower price. We've won this opportunity because we represented a stronger, longer-term business partner, due to the diversity and quality of our data assets, the breadth of our decisioning platforms and our superior analytic capabilities.
With our unique solutions, we can enable this customer to offer more competitive rates, approve customers who would otherwise have been rejected, reduce fraud through ID Analytics, ID Authentication and data verification and approve their underwriting for small businesses.
Another example. Again, by leveraging the most unique data assets in the industry, in the first quarter, we increased our share of online credit reports from 25% to 50% in the key business units of a top four bank. Our current relationship includes products from eight Equifax business units, including Online Consumer Information, IXI, Mortgage Reporting, Direct Marketing Services, The Work Number, North American Commercial and Technology and Analytical Services, truly overwhelming the customer with all of our product offerings.
The new opportunities include additional market share for our Work Number products, alerts and our new personal income model, which leverages both our diverse data assets, as well as our analytical capabilities. The power of this 360-degree view of the consumer is enabling us to expand our partnership with another top four bank. 
In addition to our InterConnect platform and our core services offering, we're leveraging a broad array of newer products, including The Work Number, Reg Z compliant, income and credit capacity models, debt-to-income formulations, settlement services and property valuation estimator.
Today, eight different Equifax business segments are also selling solutions to seven different business segments of this customer, where we have now the largest share on the credit-based information and solutions. Through a variety of special projects, our Technology and Analytical Services unit has provided this customer with invaluable insight and counsel to improve their underwriting practices while enabling them to find new opportunities to grow revenue and profit.
Finally, and the very exciting, we recently won an opportunity with a major Internet portal to help them determine what advertising content to display to consumers on the Internet. With the IXI data, we'll be the preferred partner for data-driven targeting on household economic information, and we look to further enhance the benefits of the IXI data for this customer with income data at the ZIP+4 level.
Our unique data and capabilities enabled us to win this opportunity at a price more than 2x what they're currently paying to our two competitors with lesser quality information. In fact, many of the IXI's current clients strongly urge this portal to integrate IXI data into their online product offering. Our new entree to this enormous digital marketing space looks very promising. No one else in our industry has the ability to solve these increasingly complex problems that we can now solve with our unique data assets. 
Technology and Analytical Services performs a critical support role for many of our 360-degree initiatives, domestically and internationally. Our creative and innovative Analytics continued to be highly valued by our customers. Equifax scores delivered on a credit report increased from just over 20% in the first quarter of 2008 to over 30% in the first quarter of 2010.
We're also leveraging our decision platform on a global scale. InterConnect was introduced in Canada, as you know, last year. We have a number of signed deals and active customers in Canada coming into 2010, and we have another large customer in the contract stage and a growing pipeline. InterConnect has also been deployed in the U.K., where they already have one signed financial institution and are building a pipeline of new opportunities. And we're deploying this similar plan across our footprint in Latin America.
As you know, last year, we really expanded the scope of what we call TAS, Technology and Analytical Services, to further leverage its expertise in the areas where the required solution is not solely dependent on Equifax data. And that is a significant change from our past strategy, where we saw our Technology and Analytical Services only to pull through data. We are now looking at being data agnostic as it comes to those solutions. 
We're increasing our investment in this area to develop new software solutions that will integrate Analytics on customer information and on other various data assets. It enable us to enter new markets, where we can leverage our decisioning software tools quickly and develop a branch with products and capabilities in the areas of fraud, maximizing customer profitability and improved portfolio management.
Now moving on to new product innovations, something we talked to you about a lot over the past few years. This continued to gain significant traction for us. We launched 12 new products during the quarter. The revenue from products launched during the prior three years, what we refer to as a vitality index, is $40 million in the first quarter of 2010. That's up 29% from the first quarter of 2009. Our long-term goal, as you know, is to have at least 10% of our revenues in each business unit, generated by new products launched during the previous three years, and we're well on our way to doing just that.
Also during the quarter, as you have read, we received the license from the Reserve Bank of India to operate a Credit Reporting business in India, along with six Indian financial institutions as our partners. We have a CEO now on board in India, and we're now soliciting and loading data from a number of financial institutions. We expect to be fully operational over the coming few months. Really, we view that as a great long-term growth opportunity for Equifax. 
In Global operations, we continue to make great progress with our LEAN initiatives. Many of our customers asked us to develop joint process improvement initiatives using LEAN, a great competitive differentiator for us. And we are further standardizing various tools and measures in our International operations to improve operating efficiencies and continue to reduce our costs outside the U.S. We continue to make significant progress on our key strategic initiatives, and have a number of outstanding growth opportunities in front of us.
Our outlook for the second quarter is consistent with the outlook for many of our customers, which is a lot of growing optimism. The second quarter, USCIS revenue is expected to be down in the low single-digit range when compared to second quarter of 2009. However, it'll be up mid-single digits when compared to the first quarter of 2010. 
We expect International revenue, excluding any impact of foreign currency translation, to be up in the low single-digit range, when compared to second quarter of 2009. All three geographic regions are expected to deliver positive revenue growth in the second quarter.
In the second quarter, TALX revenue is expect to deliver strong growth in the high single-digit to mid-teen range. Strength in The Work Number will be partially offset by expected softness in the Tax and Talent Management Services as improvement in the job market lowers unemployment claims activity. 
Personal Solutions should continue to show growth in the low single-digit range from the second quarter of 2009 as market conditions improved and transaction with our newer products increases and our ability to execute the changes we've talked about in the past six months will gain traction. 
North American Commercial Solutions is, again, expected to deliver high single to low double-digit growth in the second quarter when compared to the second quarter of 2009. So a good solid performance is expected across all five business units as we go into the second quarter.
So with that, I'll stop and turn it over to Lee, who'll give you the details on the financials. Lee?"

This morning, all financial information I will be discussing is presented on a GAAP basis, except as otherwise noted, and treats APPRO as a discontinued operation given the recently completed sale of this business",1125,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. This morning, all financial information I will be discussing is presented on a GAAP basis, except as otherwise noted, and treats APPRO as a discontinued operation given the recently completed sale of this business. You should also refer to the Q&A and non-GAAP reconciliations attached to our earnings release for additional financial information.
As Rick just pointed out, our first quarter performance was encouraging. But compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, first quarter 2010 revenue on a constant-dollar organic basis was up 0.6% from the fourth quarter. This reverses modest sequential declines we'd seen in the prior three quarters. This quarter's performance reinforces our view that business conditions are beginning to improve, and that our full year outlook as expressed in our fourth quarter earnings release remains appropriate.
Now for the details. Compared to the same quarter in 2009, consolidated revenue of $461.3 million was up 3.3%. Changes in foreign exchange rates favorably impacted revenue by approximately $14.8 million. In constant dollars, revenue was flat. The acquisition of IXI and Rapid Reporting in the fourth quarter last year added approximately three percentage points of growth in the first quarter.
On a GAAP basis, the operating margin in the first quarter of 2010 was 23.3%, compared to 22.6% in the first quarter of 2009. On a non-GAAP basis, our first quarter operating margin from continuing operations is down from the prior year, but comparable to the 23.2% we reported in the fourth quarter of 2009 and for the restructuring charges we recorded during that quarter.
Excluding the amortization of acquisition, intangibles and the restructuring charge in Q1 of 2009, the adjusted operating margin for the first quarter was 28.3%, versus 29% for the same period in 2009. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Equifax for the quarter was $0.44. Excluding the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax was $0.56. 
Total debt decreased by $26.3 million from December 31. And during the quarter, we repurchased 300,000 shares of stock for $9.4 million. As of quarter end, our remaining authorization per share repurchase was $112 million. 
Moving to the individual business units. U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $191.4 million, down 6% for the quarter, but slightly better than the expectations we communicated during our fourth quarter earnings release. 
Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue, which excludes discontinued operations, was $119.8 million, down 8 1/2% compared to 2009, primarily driven by a 15% decline in our online credit decision volume. Average revenue per transaction was up 1% as pricing gains with our smaller customers were offset by the negative impact from the sector mix shift. 
Mortgage Solutions revenue of $23.2 million was down 9% compared to the first quarter of 2009. Although the mortgage bankers application index for the quarter was down 35%, core mortgage reporting and settlement services, each significantly mitigated the impact of lower applications through share gains.
Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue was $30.2 million. Excluding the contribution from IXI, revenue was down approximately 11% due largely to lower pricing with our largest customers. 
Direct Marketing Services revenue was $18.2 million, down 9% from the first quarter of 2009. Operating margin for our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions segment was 33.1%, down slightly from 33.4% in the fourth quarter of 2009, and down from 36.3% in the first quarter of 2009.
Our International business units revenue was $116.2 million, compared to $100.8 million in the same quarter in 2009. In local currency, revenue was up 1.6% from a year ago, and consistent with the expectations we communicated during our fourth quarter earnings release in early February.
By region, Latin America's revenue was $55.1 million, up 20% in U.S. dollar terms, and up 5% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2009. Europe delivered revenue of $33.9 million, up 2% U.S. dollars, and down 5% local currency when compared to the same period in 2009. While still reflective of year-over-year weak economic conditions, this is Europe's best year-over-year local currency performance since September of 2008.
Canada consumer information revenue was $27.2 million, up 25% U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency when compared to the same period a year ago. Also, this was their best year-over-year local currency performance since June of 2008.
International's operating margin was 24.7%, down from 28.7% in 2009. Lower online volumes, which represent our highest margin offerings, have been offset by growth in marketing projects and other services, allowing us to achieve revenue growth in a still challenging environment, but putting downward pressure on operating margins. As the business environment begins to recover in some of these international geographies, online volume should increase, and we would expect the operating margins to improve.
TALX revenue was $95.3 million for the quarter, up 8.4% from the first quarter of 2009 and short of the expectations we have previously communicated as the mortgage market proved to be more challenging than anticipated. Excluding the acquisition of Rapid Reporting, revenue growth would have been flat. 
The Work Number continues to develop and deliver broad-based growth with revenue of $49.7 million, up 23%. Excluding Rapid Reporting, The Work Number was up 5% as strength in government, collections and consumer finance markets allowed us to achieve solid growth despite lower mortgage volumes and weak labor market, which impacted some of our complementary services.
Tax and Talent Management Services delivered $45.6 million in revenue, down 4% compared to last year, driven largely by the strong performance in 2009 and the year-over-year decline in unemployment compensation claims that we've experienced in 2010. The TALX operating margin was 22.6%, up compared to 21.5% in 2009.
North America Personal Solutions revenue was $39.7 million, up 3% from the prior year, which was significantly better than the outlook we've communicated in February. Direct-to-consumer Subscription revenue was up 13% year-over-year, driven largely by a 10% increase in average revenue per subscriber. Operating margin was 25.2% for the quarter, up from 15 1/5% a year ago as marketing expenses were lower than in the prior period.
North America Commercial Solutions revenue was $18.7 million, up 18% on a reported basis and 12% in local currency, driven by higher volume of transactions and project activity. Revenue was substantially ahead of the expectations we communicated during our fourth quarter earnings call in February. 
U.S. Commercial Risk and Marketing delivered very healthy double-digit growth, as well as improved operating margins compared to the first quarter of 2009. Operating margin for the segment was 23 1/2%, compared to 14.4% a year ago. 
In summary, our first quarter performance continues to gradually improving outlook, which we believe will enable us to deliver overall revenue growth in 2010. Now let me turn it back to Rick."

In fact, we talk internally oftentimes, I feel better about the outlook now, the prospects for growth than I felt in, probably, three years since mid-2007 when we entered the downturn. So for the second quarter, assuming current exchange rates, we do expect revenue to be up in the low- to mid-single-digit range from a year ago and adjusted EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.59 per share.

On the portfolio, yes, it's an annual exercise that we go through. Look at the portfolio saying, what is strategic, what is not? We have no need to sell anything at this juncture. However, it is always top of mine. There's some assets out there and I can't really get in a lot detail there, Michael. but there are some assets that are far less strategic than others. That if I found the right buyer at the right price, I would sell those and redeploy that capital, things like, acquisitions like IXI, Rapid Reporting or others were our shareholders get a better return. So that's a fluid process."

The FTC on the score, and maybe the advertising approach that one of our competitors took, had some impact on us in the first quarter. The team's done a marvelous job trying to navigate and get through that. Beyond that, it's uncertain as to what regulatory body's going to oversee us. Is it going to be the FTC or this consumer protection agency, or some combination of both? But as I look at the financial model for us right now, 2010, 2011, well, there's a lot of movement.

Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2009 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

175749,109118162,70419,"Equifax Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Jeff. And good morning, everyone. Second quarter for Equifax was the strongest quarter we have had in a number of years. More importantly than that, we are carrying very strong momentum, growth momentum, operating momentum, as we enter into",1409,"Great. Thanks, Jeff. And good morning, everyone. Second quarter for Equifax was the strongest quarter we have had in a number of years. More importantly than that, we are carrying very strong momentum, growth momentum, operating momentum, as we enter into the third and fourth quarter. I’ll talk more about that later on in the discussion.
The second quarter came in stronger than we expected. Four business units exceeded and USCIS solidly met the expectations we outlined for you during our first quarter earnings call. And while at the macro level, the environment continued to be challenging. I think you would agree. I am again very optimistic that we will continue to see continued year-over-year improvements for the remainder of 2010.
The numbers quickly. The revenue from continuing operations for the quarter was $460.7 million, up 7% on a reported basis and up 6% on a constant dollar basis in the second quarter of 2009. The operating margin was solid 23% when compared to the first quarter margin of 23.5%, and adjusted EPS was $0.58 a share, up from last year and first quarter. Overall, strong quarter for the company.
Although each business unit in their own way faced its own challenges and their own opportunities, they all improved as the quarter progressed and have built a solid pipeline of opportunities for the third quarter. And again, an important point there is, as the quarter progressed, each of the business units finished stronger than they started the quarter.
Quick look at each of the individual BUs. In the US Consumer Information Solutions, daily online revenue has strengthened just the beginning of the year, which is a great trend. As we ended the quarter, aggregate revenue from accounts with increasing revenue exceeded the aggregate revenue for those accounts with decreasing revenue, the first time since January of 2009. Additionally, our revenue from prescreen services was up 6%, the first year-over-year growth since the first quarter of 2007, but again sequential growth also for USCIS second quarter versus first quarter. So strong growth first time I think since 2007 as well.
Operating margin for USCIS also improved. For the second quarter, USCIS delivered significant improvement in operating margin from the first quarter, exceeding 37%, driven largely by increases in our Credit Marketing Services product line and our Mortgage Solutions products. And we expect that level of margin to continue or higher for the balance of the year for USCIS.
International exceeded our expectations for the quarter, growing 7% in local currency, as Europe, Latin America and Canada, all delivered positive growth for the quarter. In the International, our Personal Solutions and our Marketing Services product lines contributed healthy double-digit growth in the quarter. Also, our significant investments we’ve been making in Technology and Analytical Services is paying off in a big way, as we realized double-digit growth from our analytical and decisioning services in Canada, Europe and Latin America.
On the TALX, TALX exceeded our expectations again, delivering solid double-digit growth, as the Work Number, Rapid Reporting and Talent Assessment offset the anticipated softness in Tax Management Services. Great quarter again for TALX.
North America Personal Solutions delivered stronger revenue growth than we expected along with improved operating margins, a 12% growth in subscription-based revenue as a result of improved average revenue per subscriber due to pricing and mix optimization efforts. While acquiring new subscribers is challenging in the current environment, we expect to sustain the current level of revenue per subscriber. We have also made a number of very good process improvements over operational efficiencies, customer experience, and the rates for conversion and churn.
Finally, North America Commercial again exceeded our expectations with double-digit revenue growth and improved operating margins. The US commercial risk and data management delivered strong double-digit growth during the quarter.
As you know, we completed a very important divestiture during the quarter, as we continued to tightly align our business units to our corporate strategy. Direct Marketing Services, we call it DMS, was not a good fit for our long-term business strategy. We were able to sell the business to Alliance Data Systems at an attractive price, and most importantly, create a strong long-term strategic partnership with ADS.
As we’ve done in the past, we will continue to assess each of our business units in an effort to validate their role for our future business success and our ability to deliver the business performance that we and our shareholders expect. However, at this point, we have no further divestiture plans underway.
On the TALX, our Technology and Analytical Services offerings continued to deliver value to our customers, strengthen our partnerships, leverage our data assets, and develop long-term sources of future revenue growth. Innovative [ph] platform delivered strong double-digit revenue growth. During the quarter, revenues were up 31%, excluding pull-through revenue from data that is included in the transaction.
In the US, an increasing percentage of our revenue is now driven by our various decisioning platforms. Our Analytical Solutions continue to penetrate the market. Equifax risk scores delivered with an online credit report increased now to 32% in the second quarter, which is up nicely from both the first quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2009.
We’ve invested heavily and developing analytical products during the past few years. And as a result, the analytical insights that our products provide have become increasing valuable tool to approve our customers’ underwriting process. For example, since 2008, we have witnessed a steady increase in the number of scores delivered with each of our online transactions, and we expect that trend to continue into the economic recovery.
We’ve talked a lot about NPI. Our new product initiatives delivered another quarter of very strong double-digit growth. Year-to-date we are ahead of our expectations, and we expect that trend to improve as the year progresses. It’s a clear indication from our customers that the new products, which leverage unique data from the Work Number and IXI, are disrupting the status quo in the marketplace.
While ongoing activities with lean and other process improvement initiatives are also improving the fundamentals of our business operations by driving out unnecessary expense and positioning us with strong operating leverage. For the first two quarters of this year, we’ve exceeded our cost reduction targets for global operations and lean initiatives throughout the rest of the company have also exceeded targets we set at the beginning of the year. Lean is truly starting to become a part of our DNA and how we operate this company.
Over the past few years, our focus has been two-fold; continuing to execute on our strategy to drive revenue growth while exercising strong expense management discipline to protect their operating margins. As part of the team’s accomplishments during this period, we have significantly improved our product mix, acquired diverse and important data assets which will enhance our competitive position, strengthened the relationships with our customers, and improved our focus by divesting non-strategic business segments.
As the environment improves, many of the headwinds we have endured will abate and we would anticipate a solid lift towards revenue growth and operating margins. We are executing on a winning strategy that will deliver increasing value to our shareholders.
A quick look forward before Lee gets into some financial details for the third quarter. The third quarter USCIS revenue is expected to be up in the mid-to-high single-digit range when compared to the third quarter of 2009. We expect international revenue, excluding any impact of foreign currency transaction, to be up in the low-single digit range when compared to third quarter of 2009. It should be noted that third quarter 2009 was the strongest quarter for International. So we’ve got couple of comparables in the third quarter.
In the third quarter, TALX revenue is expected to deliver once again strong growth in the mid-teens. We expect strength in the Work Number, Talent Assessment, driven by further market penetration and new products will offset continued softness in Tax Management Services caused by the trends in unemployment. Personal Solutions should grow in the mid-single digit range for the quarter, and North American Commercial Solutions is expected to deliver low-double digit growth in the third quarter when compared to the third quarter of 2009. So once again, I think a solid second quarter and great momentum going into the third quarter for the company.
Lee, if you would give the detail for the financials, it would be great.

And good morning, everyone. This morning, all financial information I will be discussing is presented on a GAAP basis, except as otherwise noted, and treats APPRO and Direct Marketing Services as discontinued operations given the recently completed sales of these businesses. You should also refer to the Q&A and non-GAAP reconciliations attached to our earnings release for additional financial information. Our second quarter performance benefited greatly from the continuing progress on our key strategic initiatives along with improving business conditions for revenue growth.
Now for the details. Compared to the same quarter in 2009, consolidated revenue from continuing operations of $460.7 million was up 7% year-over-year. Changes in foreign exchange rates favorably impacted revenue by approximately $6 million. In constant dollars, revenue was up 6%. The acquisition of IXI and Rapid Reporting added approximately 4 percentage points of growth in the second quarter.
On a GAAP basis, the operating margin in the second quarter was 23% compared to 23.8% in the second quarter of 2009. Excluding the amortization of acquisition intangibles, adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 27.8% compared to 28.4% for the same period in 2009.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Equifax for the quarter was $0.45, excluding the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization and the gain from the sale of APPRO, adjusted earnings per share was $0.58. Discontinued operations contributed approximately $0.015 to this result. With these operations fully divested as of July 1st, there will be no similar contribution in the third quarter.
We reduced debt by $81 million during the quarter and $107 million year-to-date. During the quarter, we also repurchased 1.7 million shares of stock for $55 million. As at quarter-end, our remaining Board authorization for share repurchase was $207 million.
Moving to the individual business units, US Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $184.6 million, flat when compared to the same quarter in 2009 and in line with the expectations we communicated during our first quarter earnings release. Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue, which excludes discontinued operations, was $120.3 million, down 6.7% compared to 2009, primarily driven by an 8% decline in our online credit decision volume. Average revenue per transactions was down 1%, primarily driven by sector mix shift.
Mortgage Solutions revenue of $28.8 million was up 1% when compared to the second quarter a year ago. Although the mortgage bankers application index for the quarter was down 29%, both core mortgage reporting and settlement services continued to benefit from share gains.
Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue was $35.5 million, up 30%. In addition to the contributions of IXI, which performed as expected, Credit Marketing Services has stabilized after several quarters of decline and revenue from our prescreen services grew 6%, the first growth quarter for this product since the first quarter of 2007.
The operating margin for our US Consumer Information Solutions segment was 37.1%, up a full 2.5 percentage points 34.6% in the first quarter and down slightly from 37.4% in the second quarter of 2009. These margins are all now stated on a continuing operations basis. Compared to the first quarter, operating margins were maintained in Online Consumer Information Solutions, while the operating margins in both Mortgage Solutions and Consumer Financial Services improved significantly.
Our International business unit’s revenue was $118.2 million, up 12% from $105 million in 2009. In local currency, revenue was up 7% from a year ago, ahead of the expectations we communicated during our first quarter earnings call, as all three geographies delivered positive local currency growth.
By region, Latin America’s revenue was $56.7 million, up 21% in US dollar terms and 12% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2009. Europe delivered revenue of $32.5 million, down 1% in US dollars, but up 4% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2009. Both the UK and Spain delivered positive local currency growth despite the challenging economic circumstances in both countries.
Canada Consumer Information revenue was $29 million, up 15% in US dollars and 1% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2009, reflective of a low growth economy with limited consumer credit activity at the current time. International’s operating margin was 25.4%, up from 25.3% in 2009. Our TALX revenue $99 million for the quarter, up 15% from the second quarter of 2009 and ahead of expectation, as we had previously communicated.
The Work Number delivered another quarter of strong broad-based growth with revenue of $50 million, up 28%, as the addition of rapid reporting, which performed as expected and double-digit revenue growth from Work Number collections, free employment in government markets offset softness in mortgage and consumers finance markets.
Tax and Talent Management Services delivered $49 million in revenue, up 4% compared to last year, driven significantly by strong performance in our Talent Assessment business, which more than offset the year-over-year decline in Tax Management Services from lower unemployment claims activity. The TALX operating margin was 23.2%, flat with 2009.
North America Personal Solutions revenue was $40.3 million, up 8% from prior year and significantly better than the outlook we gave during our first quarter earnings call. Direct-to-consumer subscription revenue was up 12% year-over-year, driven largely by the increase in average revenue per subscriber. Operating margin was 25.4% for the quarter, up from 21.5% in the second quarter of 2009, as operating expenses declined 3%.
North America Commercial Solutions revenue was $18.6 million, up 18% on a reported basis and 13% in local currency, driven by strong double-digit growth in our US operations. Revenue was also ahead of the expectations we’ve communicated during our first quarter earnings call. The operating margin for our commercial business was 20.2% compared to 15.4% in the second quarter of 2009. With the broad-based points this quarter, we are well positioned to deliver successive improvement in year-over-year revenue growth for the remainder of the year.
Now let me turn it back to Rick.

One, we’ve been at now for couple of quarters. It’s taking the core decisioning engines we have that are so successful here than in other parts of the world. And that is starting to pay significant dividends, be it our fraud platforms we take in UK and bring it to Canada or our innovative platform we bring from Canada here to the UK and then to Iberia, also now down (inaudible) investment heavily in new decisioning engines across Latin America. So decisioning engines and accelerating that penetration outside the US because we’ve got great penetration within the US. The vast majority of all the great banks, we have decisioning engines already installed. So it’s replicating that model outside of the US.
The second area of technology we are investing heavily in is what we call database linking. We have a term that we call keystone, which is basically the ability for us to infiltrate all these very disparate databases we have real-time with very got cost efficiency to pull data together and build products faster and less expensively than we have in the past. And we’ve been at that now for about 12 months or so, and that should come to a conclusion sometime later on this year. So those are the two big things we’ve been investing in from a technology perspective. On the cross-sell, we’re hitting it out of the park, leveraging USCIS and the Work Number. And at the center of that, by the way, is our product management team building new products to disrupt the marketplace.
And by the way, it goes beyond just the Work Number and USCIS. It’s now embedding that plus IXI. So if you think about the credit data, income data, employment data and wealth data, leveraging that is making a big difference in the marketplace. It’s going to (inaudible) official to have Dann Adams who has peaked in his understanding of the credit side now running TALX and getting his hands on the Work Number data and leveraging skills and knowledge of the USCIS with now Rudy Ploder leading that. So a great progress today and I think even better days ahead.

The level of conversations, Shlomo, we could now have with banks is far different from we’ve ever had in the past and far different than anyone else can have right now. You can combine the look at a client making an underwriting decision, and it’s not just based upon your credit, you pass credit behavior. But are you employed? How long you’re employed? How much income do you have? How volatile is that income? How much wealth do you have? All those come into play on your ability to pay off an obligation. So our customers now have a much better way to make an underwriting decision than they ever had in the past.
As a result, the result of that is all the ones we’ve been talking about now for the past X number of quarters, it’s why TALX is growing at the rate they are growing. It’s one of the reasons we are seeing significant turnaround in USCIS. It’s a core of all the new products. We’re talking for years about our NPI, core NPI, not sometimes those things we’re doing with IXI and things we’re doing with the Work Number in combination with the core credit. And there is more to be done, by the way. And starting think about our income data that we have at zip plus four level, by the way. So you can target market either digitally or otherwise much better, smarter than you could before. So if you can couple together wealth data, the zip plus four, and income data zip plus four, and the credit data zip plus four, those are things going out to do in the past.

We’re focusing on the unique visitors, total visitors, churn conversion, customer experience , pricing mix. And we are now well into the implementation and we started implementing that in early first quarter, and you’re seeing the benefits of that. You’re seeing ARPU move up, you’re seeing churn improve. The churn moved significantly down over second quarter of 2009. So it’s really a combination of all those. The new leadership team there, energized team, they are doing the right thing.

Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2009 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Also, we will refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, which we call adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Equifax, which for this report, includes the operating results of discontinued operations, but not the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and the gain on the sale of our APPRO product line.

175749,109118162,70567,"Equifax Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter for Equifax was the strongest quarter we have had in a number of years. More importantly than that, we are carrying very strong momentum, growth momentum, operating momentum, as we enter into",1400,"Great. Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter for Equifax was the strongest quarter we have had in a number of years. More importantly than that, we are carrying very strong momentum, growth momentum, operating momentum, as we enter into the third and fourth quarter. I'll talk more about that later on in the discussion. 
The second quarter came in stronger than we expected. Four business units succeeded, and USCIS solidly met the expectations that we outlined for you during our first quarter earnings call. And while at the macro level, the environment continued to be challenging, I think you'd agree. I am, again, very optimistic that we'll continue to see continued year-over-year improvements for the remainder of 2010. 
The numbers quickly. The revenue from continuing operations for the quarter was $460.7 million or 7% on a reported basis, up 6% on a constant dollar basis from the second quarter of 2009. Operating margin was solid 23% when compared to the first quarter margin of 23.5%, and adjusted EPS was $0.58 a share, up from last year and first quarter. Overall, a strong quarter for the company.
Although each business unit in their own way faced its own challenges and their own opportunities, they all improved as the quarter progressed and have built a solid pipeline of opportunities for the third quarter. And again, an important point there is as the quarter progressed, each of the business units finished stronger than they started the quarter. 
Quick look at each of the individual BUs. In U.S. Consumer Information Solutions, daily online revenue has strengthened since the beginning of the year, which is a great trend. As we ended the quarter, aggregate revenue from accounts with increasing revenue exceeded the aggregate revenue for those accounts with decreasing revenue, the first time since January of 2009. Additionally, our revenue from Pre-screen Services was up 6%, the first year-over-year growth since the first quarter of 2007. But again, a sequential growth also for USCIS second quarter versus first quarter showed strong growth, first time, I think, since 2007 as well. 
Operating margin for USCIS also improved. For the second quarter, USCIS delivered significant improvement in operating margin from the first quarter exceeding 37%, driven largely by increases in our Credit Marketing Services product line and our Mortgages Solutions products. And we expect that level of margin to continue or higher for the balance of the year for USCIS.
International exceeded our expectations for the quarter, growing 7% in local currency as Europe, Latin America and Canada all delivered positive growth for the quarter. In International, our Personal Solutions, our Marketing Services product lines contributed healthy double-digit growth in the quarter. Also, our significant investments we've been making in Technology and Analytical Services is paying off in a big way as we realize double-digit growth from our Analytical and Decisioning Services in Canada, Europe and Latin America.
On the TALX. TALX exceeded our expectations again, delivering solid double-digit growth as The Work Number, Rapid Reporting and Talent Assessment, offset the anticipated softness in Tax Management Services; a great quarter, again, for TALX. 
North America Personal Solutions delivered stronger revenue growth than we expected, along with improved operating margins. A 12% growth in subscription-based revenue was a result of improved average revenue per subscriber due to pricing and mix optimization efforts. While acquiring new subscribers is challenging in the current environment, we expect to sustain the current level of revenue per subscriber. We've also made a number of very good process improvements over operational efficiencies, customer experience and the rates for conversion and churn.
Finally, North America Commercial again exceeded our expectations with double-digit revenue growth and improved operating margins. U.S. Commercial Risk and Data Management delivered strong double-digit growth during the quarter. As you know, we completed a very important divestiture during the quarter as we continue to tightly align our business units to our corporate strategy. Direct Marketing Services, we call it DMS, was not a good fit for our long-term business strategy. We're able to sell the business to Alliance Data Systems at an attractive price, and most importantly, created a strong long-term strategic partnership with ADS. 
As we've done in the past, we'll continue to assess each of our business units in an effort to validate their role for our future business success and our ability to deliver the business performance that we and our shareholders expect. However, at this point, we have no further divestiture plans underway. 
On the TAS, or Technology and Analytical Services offerings, continue to deliver value to our customers, strengthen our partnerships, leverage our data assets and develop long-term sources of future revenue growth. Our InterConnect platform delivered strong double-digit revenue growth. During the quarter, revenues were up 31%, excluding pull-through revenue from Data that is included in the transaction. 
In the U.S., an increasing percentage of our revenue is now driven by our various Decisioning platforms.
Our Analytical Solutions continue to penetrate the market. Equifax Risk Score delivered with an online credit report increased now to 32% in the second quarter, which is up nicely from both the first quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2009. 
We've invested heavily in developing analytical products during the past few years, and as a result, the analytical insights that our products provide have become increasingly valuable tool to approve our customers' underwriting process. For example, since 2008, we have witnessed a steady increase in a number of scores delivered with each of our online transactions, and we expect that trend to continue into the economic recovery. 
We've talked a lot about NPI. Our new product initiatives delivered another quarter of very strong double-digit growth. Year-to-date, we are ahead of our expectations, and we expect that trend to improve as the year progresses. It's a clear indication from our customers that the new products, which leverage unique data from The Work Number and IXI, are disrupting the status quo in the marketplace. 
While ongoing activities with LEAN and other process improvement initiatives are also improving the fundamentals of our business operations by driving out unnecessary expense and positioning us with strong operating leverage. For the first two quarters of this year, we've exceeded our cost reduction targets for global operations, and LEAN initiatives throughout the rest of the company have also exceeded targets we set at the beginning of the year. LEAN is truly starting to become a part of our DNA and how we operate this company.
Over the past few years, our focus has been two-fold: continuing to execute on our strategy to drive revenue growth while exercising strong expense management discipline to protect our operating margins. I'm proud of the team's accomplishments during this period. We have significantly improved our product mix, acquired diverse and important data assets, which will enhance our competitive position, strengthened relationships with our customers and improved our focus by divesting non-strategic business segments. As the environment improves, many of the headwinds we have endured will abate, and we would anticipate a solid lift to both revenue growth and operating margins. We're executing on a winning strategy that will deliver increasing value to our shareholders.
Now a quick look forward before Lee gets into some financial details for the third quarter. The third quarter USCIS revenue is expected to be up in the mid to high single-digit range when compared to the third quarter of 2009. We expect International revenue, excluding any impact of foreign currency translation, to be up in the low single-digit range when compared to third quarter of 2009. It should be noted that third quarter 2009 was the strongest quarter for International, so we get tougher comparables in the third quarter. 
In the third quarter, TALX is expected to deliver, once again, strong growth in the mid-teens. We expect strength in The Work Number, Talent Assessment, driven by further market penetration, and new products will offset continued softness in Tax Management Services caused by the trends in unemployment. Personal Solutions should grow in the mid single-digit range for the quarter, and North American Commercial Solutions is expected to deliver low double-digit growth in the third quarter when compared to the third quarter of 2009. 
So once again, I think, a solid second quarter and great momentum going into the third quarter for the company. Lee, if you'd give the details of the financials, it'd be great."

This morning, all financial informational I will be discussing is presented on a GAAP basis except as otherwise noted, and treats APPRO and Direct Marketing Services as discontinued operations given the recently completed sale of these businesses. You should also refer to the Q&A and non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release for additional financial information. Our second quarter performance benefited greatly from the continuing progress on our key strategic initiatives, along with improving business conditions for revenue growth. 
Now for the details. Compared to the same quarter in 2009, consolidated revenue from continuing operations of $460.7 million was up 7% year-over-year. Changes in foreign exchange rates favorably impacted revenue by approximately $6 million. In constant dollars, revenue was up 6%. The acquisition of IXI and Rapid Reporting added approximately 4 percentage points of growth in the second quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, the operating margin in the second quarter was 23%, compared to 23.8% in the second quarter of 2009. Excluding the amortization of acquisition intangibles, adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 27.8% compared to 28.4% for the same period in 2009. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Equifax for the quarter was $0.45. Excluding the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization and the gain from the sale of APPRO, adjusted earnings per share was $0.58. Discontinued operations contributed approximately $0.015 to this result. With these operations fully divested as of July 1, there will be no similar contribution in the third quarter. 
We reduced debt by $81 million during the quarter and $107 million year-to-date. During the quarter, we also repurchased 1.7 million shares of stock for $55 million. As of quarter end, our remaining board authorization for share repurchase was $207 million. 
Moving to the individual business units. U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $184.6 million, flat when compared to the same quarter in 2009 and in line with the expectations we communicated during our first quarter earnings release. Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue, which excludes discontinued operations, was $120.3 million, down 6.7% compared to 2009, primarily driven by an 8% decline in our online credit decision volume. Average revenue per transaction was down 1%, primarily driven by sector mix shift. 
Mortgage Solutions revenue of $28.8 million was up 1% when compared to the second quarter a year ago. Although the Mortgage Bankers' application index for the quarter was down 29%, both core Mortgage Reporting and Settlement Services continue to benefit from share gains.
Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue was $35.5 million, up 30%. In addition of the contributions of IXI, which performed as expected, Credit Marketing Services has stabilized after several quarters of decline, and revenue from our Pre-screening Services grew 6%, the first growth quarter for this product since the first quarter of 2007.
The operating margin for our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions segment was 37.1%, up a full 2.5 percentage points from 34.6% in the first quarter and down slightly from 37.4% in the second quarter of 2009. These margins are all now stated on a continuing operations basis. Compared to the first quarter, operating margins were maintained in Online Consumer Information Solutions, while the operating margins in both Mortgage Solutions and Consumer Financial Services improved significantly.
Our International business unit's revenue was $118.2 million, up 12% from $105 million in 2009. In local currency, revenue was up 7% from a year ago, ahead of the expectations we communicated during our first quarter earnings call as all three geographies delivered positive local currency growth. 
By region, Latin America's revenue was $56.7 million, up 21% in U.S. dollar terms and 12% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2009. Europe delivered revenue of $32.5 million, down 1% U.S. dollars, but up 4% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2009. Both the U.K. and Spain delivered positive local currency growth despite the challenging economic circumstances in both countries. 
Canada Consumer Information revenue was $29 million, up 15% in U.S. dollars and 1% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2009, reflective of a low-growth economy with limited consumer credit activity at the current time. International's operating margin was 25.4%, up from 25.3% in 2009. 
Our TALX revenue was $99 million for the quarter, up 15% from the second quarter of 2009 and ahead of expectations we had previously communicated. The Work Number delivered another quarter of strong broad-based growth with revenue of $50 million, up 28% as the addition of Rapid Reporting, which performed as expected, and double-digit revenue growth from The Work Number collections, pre-employment and government markets offset softness in mortgage and consumer finance markets.
Tax and Talent Management Services delivered $49 million in revenue, up 4% compared to last year, driven significantly by strong performance in our Talent Assessment business, which more than offset the year-over-year decline in Tax Management Services from lower unemployment claims activity. The TALX operating margin was 23.2%, flat with 2009.
North America Personal Solutions revenue is $40.3 million, up 8% from the prior year and significantly better than the outlook we gave during our first quarter earnings call. Direct-to-consumer subscription revenue was up 12% year-over-year, driven largely by the increase in average revenue per subscriber. Operating margin was 25.4% for the quarter, up from 21.5% in the second quarter of 2009 as operating expenses declined 3%. 
North America Commercial Solutions' revenue was $18.6 million, up 18% on a reported basis and 13% local currency, driven by strong double-digit growth in our U.S. operations. Revenue was also ahead of the expectations we communicated during our first quarter earnings call. The operating margin in our Commercial business was 20.2% compared to 15.4% in the second quarter of 2009. 
With the broad-based performance this quarter, we are well positioned to deliver successive improvement in year-over-year revenue growth for the remainder of the year. Now let me turn it back to Rick."

As I look forward to the third and fourth quarter, again, I am convinced we will have continued improvement in our operating performance for the balance of the year. 
For the third quarter, specifically, assuming the current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be up in the mid to upper single-digit range from a year ago quarter. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $0.55 and $0.59 a share, when considering the dilutive impact of our recent divestiture, which was approximately $0.02 a share. The guidance for the third quarter is consistent with our outlook from improving performance in the second half of 2010.

One, we've been out now for a couple of quarters is taking the core decisioning engines we have that have been so successful here to take in other parts of the world. And that is starting to pay a significant difference, be it our fraud platforms we take in U.K. and bring to Canada, or our InterConnect platform we bring from here to Canada, here to U.K. and into Iberia, also now down into LATAM. We've got investment heavily in new decisioning engines across Latin America. So decisioning engines and accelerating that penetrations outside the U.S., because we've got great penetrations within the U.S., the vast majority of all the big banks we have decisioning engines already installed, so it's replicating that model outside of the U.S. The second area of technology we're investing heavily in is what we call database linking. We have a term which we call keystone, which is basically the ability for us to infiltrate all these very disparate databases we have realtime with very great cost efficiency to pool data together and build products faster and less expensively than we have in the past. And we've been at that now for about 12 months or so, and that should come to a conclusion sometime later on this year. So those are the two big things we've been investing in from a technology perspective. On the cross sell, we're hitting at the park, leveraging USCIS and The Work Number. And at the center of that, by the way, is our product management team building new products to disrupt the marketplace. And by the way, it goes beyond just The Work Number and USCIS. It's now embedding that plus IXI. So if you think about it, credit data, income data, employment data, wealth data, leveraging that is making a big difference in the marketplace. It's kind of really beneficial to have Dan Adams, who is steep in his understanding of the credit side, now running talks and getting his hands on The Work Number data and leveraging the skills and knowledge of the USCIS, with now Rudy Ploder leading that.

The level of conversations, Shlomo, we can now have with banks is far different than we could ever have in the past and far different than anyone else can have right now. When you can combine the look at a client, making underwriting decisions, and it's not just based upon your credit, your past credit behavior, but are you employed? How long are you employed? How much income do you have? How volatile is that income? How much wealth do you have? All of those come into play on your ability to pay off an obligation. So our customers now have a much better way to make an underwriting decision than they ever have in the past. And the result of that is, all the wins we've been talking about now for the past x number of quarters. It's why TALX is growing the way they're growing. It's one of the reasons we're seeing significant turnaround in USCIS. It's a core of all the new products. We've talked now for years about our NPI, about the core NPI, and oftentimes, the things we're doing with IXI and things we're doing for Work Number, in combination with the core credit. And there's more to be done, by the way. We're starting to think about our income data that we have at the ZIP+4 level, by the way. So you can target market either digitally, or otherwise, much smarter that you could before. So if you can couple together wealth data, the ZIP+4, and income data ZIP+4, and then credit data ZIP+4, well, those are things no help can do in the past. So it's helping on the underwriting side and on the marketing side."

These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2009 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. 
Also, we will refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Equifax, which excludes the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation section included in the earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section under About Equifax tab at our website for further details. Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick."

It was broad-based, which is very important across all business units. They met or exceeded our expectations that we outlined to you during our second quarter call. 
As I continue to meet with our customers, it's increasingly clear to me that our strength of our business model combined with the innovative solutions we're delivering and the traction we're developing as we leverage our unique and diverse data assets are enabling our customers to manage their business more effectively and profitably. Each of our business units have strong leaders and deep commitment to executing on the strategic initiatives and the performance they delivered this year illustrates just that. 
First, some numbers. Total revenue for the quarter was $473.8 million, up 11% from third quarter 2009 on both reported and local currency basis and well ahead of our expectations. Operating margin was 23%, up 30 basis points from the second quarter of 2010 on revenues that were up 3% sequentially as well. Adjusted EPS was $0.60, up from last year and second quarter, driven by strong execution across all of our strategic initiatives. All of our business units are executing well against our strategies. They're delivering our key objectives, enhancing relationships with our customers through innovative and unique solutions. 
On the business units, USCIS has accelerated its year-over-year growth each quarter this year. In fact, all the business units within USCIS have improved on a quarterly year-over-year growth rate in 2010. Along with this growth, USCIS is expanded its operating margin each quarter in 2010. 
Long-term opportunities in International continue to be very attractive. We've developed aggressive and compelling strategies and continue to invest in all of our existing geographies to build a strong market position for long-term growth. Obviously, that investment has an impact on the margin in International short term, short to medium term? 
In The Work Number, healthy double-digit growth across each of the key customer sections enabled TALX to deliver solid double-digit growth. The acquisition of TALX has been transformative for Equifax. Even today, we continue to find new opportunities to expand our coverage and grow active records in our database, as well as broaden our service offerings as an HR solutions provider, which further strengthens relationships with our data providers for The Work Number. 
Our PS business, North American Personnel Solutions, continues to leverage new product development and sharpen its focus on securing long-term consumer relationships. These relationships are based on high value-added services, educational content to help consumers become smarter in the management of their financial well-being and better execution on the fundamentals. All of which grow increased conversion, lower churn, higher average revenue per user and solid growth for the quarter. 
PS is also testing and evaluating various combinations of product messaging, offer types pricing and affiliate mix to drive increased growth in subscription customers. 
Finally, double-digit growth in North America Commercial was driven by strong growth in our U.S. operations, including both risk and marketing applications. 
Shortly after the quarter closed, as you now know, we broadened our ID management product offering and expanded our presence in the government and healthcare sectors with the acquisition of Anakam. One of the core product offerings in our Technology and Analytical Services unit we call TAS is ID authentication. We were the innovators in this space and have developed a very strong presence with financial institutions and telecommunication companies in the U.S. as well as some of our international markets such as the U.K. 
In addition to rigorous ID authentication, there's an increasing demand for risk-based verification solutions that support customers' needs for secure content delivery. Anakam is the leading provider of large-scale, cost-effective, multi-factor ID verification solutions. Traditional two-factor verification such as hearts open, [ph] smart cards, USB devices or even biometrics, as you know are expensive to deploy and maintain, particularly when the end user is a consumer, making the Anakam offering very unique and cost-effective. This acquisition enables us to offer a full life cycle of ID management solutions while deepening our relationships with those market sectors which have the greatest needs for these solutions. 
Also during the quarter, we added another significant digital marketing opportunity through a partnership between IXI and Corescom, (sic) [comScore] a leading provider of online audience measurement services for Internet advertising and e-commerce activities. Corescom (sic) [comScore] will be utilizing our data and technology to develop a new, co-branded solution designed to optimize ad placement for the financial services sector to more effectively reach their targeted audiences based on estimated income assets, discretionary spending or ability to pay. We will become Corescom's (sic) [comScore] preferred data partner towards targeting an ad-effective solutions in the financial institution section. If you'll recall on the last earnings call, we talked about our presence expanding in the digital market with a large provider, a very exciting marketplace for us long term.
Relationship with our customers continue to be strengthened by the analytical tools and decisioning platforms delivered through TAS, Technology and Analytical Services. Our analytics are increasingly used by customers for their decisioning needs. During the quarter, scores delivered from Equifax models increased 23% from the same period in 2009. While at the same time, the delivery of scores from models developed by other vendors declined 4%. Over the past couple of years, we've seen our customers' decisioning needs become more complicated, driven by increased uncertainty surrounding the economic and regulatory environment. These needs range from developing an overall portfolio strategy to decisioning each individual consumer transaction. This creates enormous opportunities to leverage our diverse data assets and increase investment in Technology and Analytical Services. The acquisition of Anakam is a great example of how we can capitalize on these opportunities and further monetize our data and technology assets. 
Innovation continues to be an important strategic initiative for us and is helping us win in the marketplace and with our customers. Year to date, we have launched 55 new products and continue to meet our revenue targets and our vitality target we've captured that now for four or five years. 
As a top leader, we're continuing to develop analytical tools in business intelligence to assist customers as they develop their strategies for addressing emerging challenges and opportunities. The initiatives will give us greater insight in the client strategies and priorities, while further leveraging our data and technology capabilities, including extensive integration of Equifax data alongside client data to develop a complete customer view. With our technology, we can link Equifax data assets now with a client's customer information to give them true one-on-one decision-making solutions. 
We're also investing heavily in developing unique consumer keys that can be used to retrieve data consistently and accurately. All of our databases will soon be linked to the others' proprietary key to ensure that all of our relevant information for specific consumers is accessible to all of our clients' decisioning needs. That will allow us to develop more products faster and more cost-effectively than we have ever been able to do in the past. 
Finally, we're building new predictive modeling tools that significantly improved decision-making needs. These new tools incorporate advanced analytics developed through our deep understanding of diverse data assets and the use of advanced statistical techniques to reduce risk in our clients' decisioning activities. Clearly, our investment in innovation and talent we have recruited, the investments we've made and the commitments to our customers during these difficult times has positioned us very well for new and exciting opportunities. 
As we are in the final stretch of 2010, we expect to end with a strong quarter in the fourth quarter. We have improved our strategic focus by divesting non-strategic assets, which generated funds that were reinvested in new product innovation, strategic M&A and return to shareholders in the form of share buyback. 
I'll give you a quick look at some of the business units' expectations for the fourth quarter. USCIS revenue is expected to be up at least 10% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, another strong quarter. We expect International revenue, when excluding any impact of foreign currency translation, to be up in the low single-digit range when compared to fourth quarter of 2009. TALX in the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver double-digit revenue growth year-on-year. Personal Solutions growth should be in the mid single-digit range year-on-year. And North America Commercial Solutions is expected to deliver high single to low double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, again when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. So we're expecting another strong quarter as we exit 2010. 
Lee, take over to give the details please on the financials?"

All of our business units delivered strong performance in the third quarter. We're making good progress in our growth initiatives and continued effective expense management that allowed us to invest in future growth opportunities while continuing to earn attractive margins. 
Now for the details. Compared to the same quarter in 2009, consolidated revenue of $473.8 million was up 11% on a reported and local currency basis. The acquisition of IXI and Rapid Reporting a year ago added approximately four percentage points of growth in the fourth quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, the operating margin in the third quarter was 23.3% compared to 23.5% in the third quarter of 2009. Excluding the amortization of acquisition intangibles, adjusted operating margin for Q3 2010 was 28% compared to 28.2% for the same quarter in 2009. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Equifax was $0.49 per share in the quarter, up 11% from $0.44 in the third quarter a year ago. Excluding the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, adjusted earnings per share attributable to Equifax was $0.60, up 13% from $0.53 in the third quarter of 2009. 
We reduced total debt by $60 million during the quarter and $167 million year-to-date. During the quarter, we also repurchased 1.7 million shares of stock for $51.7 million. As of quarter end, our remaining board authorization for share repurchase is $155 million.
Moving to the individual business units. Our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $194 million, up 12% from the same quarter in 2009 and generously ahead of the expectations we communicated during our second quarter earnings release, primarily driven by success in the mortgage market. Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue, which excludes discontinued operations, was $128 million, up 2% compared to 2009. Consistent with our improving revenue trends, our year-over-year online credit decision volume trends have improved every quarter this year from being down 15% year-over-year in the first quarter to down 8% in the second quarter to down only 1% on our most recent quarter. For the quarter, average revenue per transaction was up 1%, primarily driven by sector mix shift. Volume trends improved for the second consecutive quarter, as online transactions were up 7% sequentially from the second quarter. 
Mortgage Solutions revenue of $32 million was up 43% compared to the third quarter a year ago. The Mortgage Bankers application index for the quarter was up 39% from a year ago.
Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue was $34 million, up 30%. IXI's performance exceeded our original acquisition assumptions during the quarter. And our Credit Marketing Services Unit delivered modest year-over-year growth for the first time since 2007, driven by growth in pre-screening services and portfolio review. 
The operating margin for U.S. Consumer Information Solutions was 37.2%, up 100 basis points from the third quarter of 2009. 
Our International Business units' revenue was $122 million, up 7% from the third quarter of 2009. In local currency, revenue was up 5% from a year ago, in line with our expectations. By region, Latin America's revenue was $59 million, up 13% in U.S. dollar terms and 8% in local currency when compared to a year ago. Europe's revenue was $35 million, down 4% in U.S. dollars but up 2% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2009. Both the U.K. and Spain delivered positive local currency growth. Canada Consumer information revenue was $28 million, up 9% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2009. 
For International in total, softness in online credit services, reflective of weak consumer loan activity in many of our geographies, was offset by expanded sales in the analytical, technology and marketing services. International's operating margin was 25.2%, down slightly from 25.4% in the second quarter and 27% in 2009. The lower margin reflects the reduced proportion of online services revenue currently in our product mix. 
TALX revenues was $99 million for the quarter, up 19% from the third quarter of 2009 and well ahead of the expectations we communicated during our second quarter earnings call. Growth in The Work Number continues with revenue of $55 million, up 49% over the prior year. Double-digit revenue growth in collections, mortgage, preemployment and government sectors and our employment-related transaction processing services, plus the impact of our acquisition of Rapid Reporting, all contribute to this strong performance. 
Tax and Talent Management Services revenue was $44 million, down 5% compared to last year, driven by double-digit declines in unemployment claims activity from the elevated levels a year ago, which is partially offset by double-digit growth in Talent Assessment. The TALX operating margin was 22.5%, up from 21.4% in 2009. 
North America Personal Solutions revenue was $40 million, up 7% and ahead of the outlook we gave during our Second Quarter Earnings Call. Direct-to-consumer subscription revenue was up 10% year-over-year, driven by an increase in average revenue per subscriber as well as lower churn. New subscription-based products, such as Equifax Complete with high-value features continues to drive up the average revenue per subscription and improves our overall operating effectiveness.
Operating margin was 31.9% for the quarter, up from 27.3% a year ago, driven by improved productivity and lower marketing expense. 
Finally, North America Commercial Solutions revenue was $18 million, up 14% on a reported basis and 12% local currency, driven again by strong double-digit growth on our U.S. operations. Revenue was also ahead of the expectations we communicated during our Second Quarter Earnings Call. Revenue growth in the U.S. segment was primarily driven by transaction volume, which was up 12% for the quarter. The operating margin for the quarter was 17.9%, up slightly from the year-ago margin. 
Overall, our growth this quarter, as well as for each quarter this year, reflects the progress we continue to make on our three key strategic initiatives. We continue to invest in and grow our revenue base, while tightly managing expenses and deliver attractive operating margins and cash flow. Now let me turn it back to Rick."

Our performance is broad-based across all business units and many product lines. Our unique data assets are truly a differentiator for us, allowing us to gain share, win customers and build new products rapidly. Our team is executing on our initiatives. 
And as we go forward and look at the fourth quarter, I won't expect any improvement in the economic landscape. But rather as we've shown over the last couple of years, we will win due to internally generated momentum. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect again another strong quarter, especially when you think about the grandfathering of IXI and Rapid Reporting and a slowdown in the mortgage refinancing in the U.S. business. And we expect revenue to be up 8% to 10% from a year ago. And adjusted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be somewhere between $0.58 and $0.61 a share. So operator, if you could open the lines for some questions."

And that's a very large fragmented market, and we continue to grow in that market environment. So when you think of mortgage, and I'll get to grow over in a second, think about it this way. You had obviously some wind at the back with refinancing. But beyond that it's taking share and it's ESS continuing to grow. So it's that kind of trifecta to itself in the mortgage business. As I think of year-on-year, you're not going get next year, I don't think with the continuation of the refinancing. But we'll continue to win on trimerge We'll continue to win on ESS. And more importantly and even that, we'll continue to invest in other new products that would've been launched this year, which should give us nice growth in 2011.

At the same time, you've got to remember that the Mortgage business, while it's a great growth engine for us, is not the same margins as our online business. That's where you get the big lift.

Number two is I think as Lee mentioned or I mentioned, we're investing heavily internationally in key markets around the world to drive organic growth. And I think it's important for us in the long term. So those combinations of things that don't allow maybe a significant step up in margin. But I'm convinced over time we'll get that increased margin. I told you that our goal long term is to get the margin up over 24% to 25%. And we're going to head in that direction. You also had some noise, Carter, in the third quarter itself with some deal costs, some professional fees costs. We had to shore up our AFP, our incentive plan. We got some equity grants that were more expensive for us in the fourth quarter than they were a year ago. So you got some unusual things, if you will, that also creates some headwind.

At best, towards the back end of the year, we'll see some improvement. So with that, I think our core growth will be in the low single-digit, 2% or 3%. And then I think on top of that, you're going to get strategic initiatives, which will give us 3% to 4% growth.

Let me go back to one point you made there, Andrew, which I jumped over briefly on the data. We've been investing now for a couple of years in this keying concept that I mentioned in my opening comments, which now allow us to take all these disparate databases and key the consumers as one. When you can do that across an IXI database, a TALX database, a NTC, UE plus database, the credit file, your ability to build products faster and more cost-effectively is greatly enhanced.

So you'll see a little bit of fluctuation in that particular piece. Deal costs will tend to show up on the corporate line. SG&A is obviously much more broadly distributed.

I think you specifically gave us the quarter-on-quarter transaction volume increase as being 7%. And I wondered if you might be able to do two things: one, talk about to what extent that was driven by mortgage. I mean, I understand that mortgage impacts on different parts of your business. But I'm guessing some of that 7% must have been mortgage related. And two, given what you said about pre-screen being a lead indicator, a one- to two-month lead indicator for OSIS how confident you are of a pretty good quarter-on-quarter pickup in Q4 in that transaction volume?"

It was broad-based, which was very important across all business units. They met or exceeded our expectations that we outlined to you during our second quarter call. 
As I continue to meet with our customers, it's increasingly clear to me that our strength of our business model combined with the innovative solutions we're delivering and the traction we're developing as we leverage our unique and diverse data assets are enabling our customers to manage their business more effectively and profitably. Each of our business units have strong leaders and deep commitment to executing on the strategic initiatives, and the performance they delivered this year illustrates just that. 
First, some numbers. Total revenue for the quarter was $473.8 million, up 11% from third quarter 2009 on both a reported and local currency basis and well ahead of our expectations. Operating margin was 23%, up 30 basis points from the second quarter of 2010 on revenues that were up 3% sequentially as well. Adjusted EPS was $0.60, up from last year and second quarter, driven by strong execution across all of our strategic initiatives. All of our business units are executing well against our strategies. They're delivering on key objectives, enhancing relationships with our customers through innovative and unique solutions. 
On the business units, USCIS has accelerated its year-over-year growth each quarter this year. In fact, all the business units within USCIS have improved on a quarterly year-over-year growth rate in 2010. Along with this growth, USCIS has expanded its operating margin each quarter in 2010. 
Long-term opportunities in International continue to be very attractive. We've developed aggressive and compelling strategies and continue to invest in all of our existing geographies to build a strong market position for long-term growth. Obviously, that investment has an impact on the margin in International short term, short to medium term. 
In The Work Number, healthy double-digit growth across each of the key customer sections enabled TALX to deliver solid double-digit growth. The acquisition of TALX has been transformative for Equifax. Even today, we continue to find new opportunities to expand our coverage and grow active records in our database, as well as broaden our service offerings as an HR solutions provider, which further strengthens relationships with our data providers for The Work Number. 
Our PSol business, North American Personnel Solutions, continues to leverage new product development and sharpen its focus on securing long-term consumer relationships. These relationships are based on high value-added services, educational content to help consumers become smarter in the management of their financial well-being and better execution on the fundamentals, all of which grow increased conversion, lower churn, higher average revenue per user and solid growth for the quarter. 
PSol is also testing and evaluating various combinations of product messaging, offer types, pricing and affiliate mix to drive increased growth in subscription customers. 
Finally, double-digit growth in North America Commercial was driven by strong growth in our U.S. operations, including both risk and marketing applications. 
Shortly after the quarter closed, as you now know, we broadened our ID management product offering and expanded our presence in the government and healthcare sectors with the acquisition of Anakam. One of the core product offerings in our Technology and Analytical Services unit we call TAS is ID authentication. We were the innovators in this space and have developed a very strong presence with financial institutions and telecommunication companies in the U.S. as well as some of our international markets such as the U.K. 
In addition to rigorous ID authentication, there's an increasing demand for risk-based verification solutions that support customers' needs for secure content delivery. Anakam is the leading provider of large-scale, cost-effective, multi-factor ID verification solutions. Traditional two factor verification, such as hard tokens, smart cards, USB devices or even biometrics, as you know, are expensive to deploy and maintain, particularly when the end user is a consumer, making the Anakam offering very unique and cost-effective. This acquisition enables us to offer a full life cycle of ID management solutions while deepening our relationships with those market sectors which have the greatest needs for these solutions. 
Also during the quarter, we added another significant digital marketing opportunity through a partnership between IXI and Corescom (sic) [comScore], a leading provider of online audience measurement services for Internet advertising and e-commerce activities. Corescom (sic) [comScore] will be utilizing our data and technology to develop a new, co-branded solution designed to optimize ad placement for the financial services sector to more effectively reach their targeted audiences based on estimated income assets, discretionary spending or ability to pay. We will become Corescom's (sic) [comScore] preferred data partner for its targeting and ad-effective solutions in the financial institution section. If you'll recall on the last earnings call, we talked about our presence expanding in the digital market with a large provider, a very exciting marketplace for us long term.
Relationship with our customers continue to be strengthened by the analytical tools and decisioning platforms delivered through TAS, Technology and Analytical Services. Our analytics are increasingly used by customers for their decisioning needs. During the quarter, scores delivered from Equifax models increased 23% from the same period in 2009, while at the same time, the delivery of scores from models developed by other vendors declined 4%. Over the past couple of years, we've seen our customers' decisioning needs become more complicated, driven by increased uncertainty surrounding the economic and regulatory environment. These needs range from developing an overall portfolio strategy to decisioning each individual consumer transaction. This creates enormous opportunities to leverage our diverse data assets and increase investment in Technology and Analytical Services. The acquisition of Anakam is a great example of how we can capitalize on these opportunities and further monetize our data and technology assets. 
Innovation continues to be an important strategic initiative for us and is helping us win in the marketplace and with our customers. Year to date, we have launched 55 new products and continue to meet our revenue targets and our vitality target we've talked to you about now for four or five years. 
As a thought leader, we're continuing to develop analytical tools in business intelligence to assist customers as they develop their strategies for addressing emerging challenges and opportunities. These initiatives will give us greater insight in the client strategies and priorities, while further leveraging our data and technology capabilities, including extensive integration of Equifax data alongside client data to develop a complete customer view. With our technology, we can link Equifax data assets now with a client's customer information to give them true one-on-one decision-making solutions. 
We're also investing heavily in developing unique consumer keys that can be used to retrieve data consistently and accurately. All of our databases will soon be linked to the others' proprietary key to ensure that all of the relevant information for specific consumers is accessible to all of our clients' decisioning needs. That will allow us to develop more products faster and more cost-effectively than we have ever been able to do in the past. 
Finally, we're building new predictive modeling tools that significantly improve decision-making. These new tools incorporate advanced analytics developed through our deep understanding of diverse data assets and the use of advanced statistical techniques to reduce risk in our clients' decisioning activities. Clearly, our investment in innovation and talent we have recruited, the investments we've made and the commitments to our customers during these difficult times has positioned us very well for new and exciting opportunities. 
As we enter the final stretch of 2010, we expect to end with a strong quarter in the fourth quarter. We have improved our strategic focus by divesting non-strategic assets, which generated funds that were reinvested in new product innovation, strategic M&A and return to shareholders in the form of share buyback. 
I'll give you a quick look at some of the business units' expectations for the fourth quarter. USCIS revenue is expected to be up at least 10% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, another strong quarter. We expect International revenue, when excluding any impact of foreign currency translation, to be up in the low single-digit range when compared to fourth quarter of 2009. TALX ,in the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver double-digit revenue growth year-on-year. Personal Solutions growth should be in the mid-single-digit range year-on-year. And North America Commercial Solutions is expected to deliver high single to low double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, again when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. So we're expecting another strong quarter as we exit 2010.

You should also refer to the Q&A and non-GAAP reconciliations attached to our earnings release for additional financial information. 
All of our business units delivered strong performance in the third quarter. We're making good progress on our growth initiatives, and continued effective expense management has allowed us to invest in future growth opportunities while continuing to earn attractive margins. 
Now for the details. Compared to the same quarter of 2009, consolidated revenue of $473.8 million was up 11% on a reported and local currency basis. The acquisition of IXI and Rapid Reporting a year ago added approximately four percentage points of growth in the fourth quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, the operating margin in the third quarter was 23.3% compared to 23.5% in the third quarter of 2009. Excluding the amortization of acquisition intangibles, adjusted operating margin for Q3 2010 was 28% compared to 28.2% for the same quarter in 2009. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Equifax was $0.49 per share in the quarter, up 11% from $0.44 in the third quarter a year ago. Excluding the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, adjusted earnings per share attributable to Equifax was $0.60, up 13% from $0.53 in the third quarter of 2009. 
We reduced total debt by $60 million during the quarter and $167 million year-to-date. During the quarter, we also repurchased 1.7 million shares of stock for $51.7 million. As of quarter end, our remaining board authorization for share repurchase was $155 million.
Moving to the individual business units. Our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $194 million, up 12% from the same quarter in 2009 and generously ahead of the expectations we communicated during our second quarter earnings release, primarily driven by success in the mortgage market. Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue, which excludes discontinued operations, was $128 million, up 2% compared to 2009. Consistent with our improving revenue trends, our year-over-year online credit decision volume trends have improved every quarter this year from being down 15% year-over-year in the first quarter to down 8% in the second quarter to down only 1% in our most recent quarter. For the quarter, average revenue per transaction was up 1%, primarily driven by sector mix shift. Volume trends improved for the second consecutive quarter, as online transactions were up 7% sequentially from the second quarter. 
Mortgage Solutions revenue of $32 million was up 43% compared to the third quarter a year ago. The Mortgage Bankers Application Index for the quarter was up 39% from a year ago.
Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue was $34 million, up 30%. IXI's performance exceeded our original acquisition assumptions during the quarter. And our Credit Marketing Services unit delivered modest year-over-year growth for the first time since 2007, driven by growth in pre-screening services and portfolio review. 
The operating margin for U.S. Consumer Information Solutions was 37.2%, up 100 basis points from the third quarter of 2009. 
Our International Business units revenue was $122 million, up 7% from the third quarter of 2009. In local currency, revenue was up 5% from a year ago, in line with our expectations. By region, Latin America's revenue was $59 million, up 13% in U.S. dollar terms and 8% in local currency when compared to a year ago. Europe's revenue was $35 million, down 4% in U.S. dollars but up 2% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2009. Both the U.K. and Spain delivered positive local currency growth. Canada Consumer information revenue was $28 million, up 9% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2009. 
For International in total, softness in online credit services, reflective of weak consumer loan activity in many of our geographies, was offset by expanded sales in analytical, technology and marketing services. International's operating margin was 25.2%, down slightly from 25.4% in the second quarter and 27% in 2009. The lower margin reflects the reduced proportion of online services revenue currently in our product mix. 
TALX revenue was $99 million for the quarter, up 19% from the third quarter of 2009 and well ahead of the expectations we communicated during our second quarter earnings call. Growth in The Work Number continues with revenue of $55 million, up 49% over the prior year. Double-digit revenue growth in collections, mortgage, pre-employment and government sectors and our employment-related transaction processing services, plus the impact of our acquisition of Rapid Reporting, all contribute to this strong performance. 
Tax and Talent Management Services revenue was $44 million, down 5% compared to last year, driven by double-digit declines in unemployment claims activity from the elevated levels a year ago, which was partially offset by double-digit growth in Talent Assessment. The TALX operating margin was 22.9%, up from 21.4% in 2009. 
North America Personal Solutions revenue was $40 million, up 7% and ahead of the outlook we gave during our Second Quarter Earnings Call. Direct-to-consumer subscription revenue was up 10% year-over-year, driven by an increase in average revenue per subscriber as well as lower churn. New subscription-based products, such as Equifax Complete with high-value features continues, to drive up the average revenue per subscription and improves our overall operating effectiveness.
Operating margin was 31.9% for the quarter, up from 27.3% a year ago, driven by improved productivity and lower marketing expense. 
Finally, North America Commercial Solutions revenue was $18 million, up 14% on a reported basis and 12% local currency, driven again by strong double-digit growth on our U.S. operations. Revenue was also ahead of the expectations we communicated during our Second Quarter Earnings Call. Revenue growth in the U.S. segment was primarily driven by transaction volume, which was up 12% for the quarter. The operating margin for the quarter was 17.9%, up slightly from the year-ago margin. 
Overall, our growth this quarter, as well as for each quarter this year, reflects the progress we continue to make on our key strategic initiatives. We continue to invest in and grow our revenue base, while tightly managing expenses to deliver attractive operating margins and cash flow. Now let me turn it back to Rick."

Our unique data assets are truly a differentiator for us, allowing us to gain share, win customers and build new products rapidly. Our team is executing on our initiatives. 
And as we go forward and look at the fourth quarter, I won't expect any improvement in the economic landscape. But rather as we've shown over the last couple years, we will win due to internally generated momentum. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect again another strong quarter, especially when you think about the grandfathering of IXI and Rapid Reporting and a slowdown in the mortgage refinancing in the U.S. business. And we expect revenue to be up 8% to 10% from a year ago. And adjusted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be somewhere between $0.58 and $0.61 a share. So operator, if you could open up the lines for some questions."

And that's a very large fragmented market, and we continue to grow in that market environment. So when you think of mortgage, and I'll get to grow-over in a second, think about it this way. You had obviously some wind at the back with refinancing. But beyond that it's taking share and its ESS continuing to grow. So it's that kind of trifecta, if you will, that’s helping our mortgage business. As I think of year-on-year, what you're not going to get next year, I don't think, is the continuation of the refinancing. But we'll continue to win on tri-merge. We'll continue to win on ESS. And more importantly than even that, we’re going to continue to invest in other new products that have been launched this year which should give us nice growth in 2011. So I don't view mortgage as an excuse for headwind overall for USIS or Equifax in 2011."

Good morning, and welcome to today’s conference call. I’m Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations. And with me today are Rick Smith, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Adrean, Chief Financial Officer. Today’s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section of the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.  
During this call, we’ll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2009 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.     Also, we will refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Equifax, which excludes the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation section included in the earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section under About Equifax tab at our website for further details.
Now I’d like to turn it over to Rick.     Richard Smith</TAG>
Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a very strong performance in the third quarter. It was broad-based, which was very important across all business units. They met or exceeded our expectations that we outlined to you during our second quarter call.     As I continue to meet with our customers, it’s increasingly clear to me that our strength of our business model combined with the innovative solutions we’re delivering and the traction we’re developing as we leverage our unique and diverse data assets are enabling our customers to manage their business more effectively and profitably. Each of our business units have strong leaders and deep commitment to executing on the strategic initiatives, and the performance they delivered this year illustrates just that.     First, some numbers. Total revenue for the quarter was $473.8 million, up 11% from third quarter 2009 on both a reported and local currency basis and well ahead of our expectations.
Operating margin was 23%, up 30 basis points from the second quarter of 2010 on revenues that were up 3% sequentially as well.
Adjusted EPS was $0.60, up from last year and second quarter, driven by strong execution across all of our strategic initiatives. All of our business units are executing well against our strategies. They’re delivering on key objectives, enhancing relationships with our customers through innovative and unique solutions.     On the business units, USCIS has accelerated its year-over-year growth each quarter this year. In fact, all the business units within USCIS have improved on their quarterly year-over-year growth rate in 2010. Along with this growth, USCIS has expanded its operating margin each quarter in 2010.     Long-term opportunities in International continue to be very attractive. We’ve developed aggressive and compelling strategies and continue to invest in all of our existing geographies to build a strong market position for long-term growth. Obviously, that investment has an impact on the margin in International short term, short to medium term.     In The Work Number, healthy double-digit growth across each of the key customer sections enabled TALX to deliver solid double-digit growth. The acquisition of TALX has been transformative for Equifax.
Even today, we continue to find new opportunities to expand our coverage and grow active records in our database, as well as broaden our service offerings as an HR solutions provider, which further strengthens relationships with our data providers for The Work Number.     Our PSol business, North American Personnel Solutions, continues to leverage new product development and sharpen its focus on securing long-term consumer relationships. These relationships are based on high value-added services, educational content to help consumers become smarter in the management of their financial well-being and better execution on the fundamentals, all of which grow increased conversion, lower churn, higher average revenue per user and solid growth for the quarter.     PSol is also testing and evaluating various combinations of product messaging, offer types, pricing and affiliate mix to drive increased growth in subscription customers.     Finally, double-digit growth in North America Commercial was driven by strong growth in our U.S. operations, including both risk and marketing applications.     Shortly after the quarter closed, as you now know, we broadened our I.D. management product offering and expanded our presence in the government and healthcare sectors with the acquisition of Anakam. One of the core product offerings in our Technology and Analytical Services unit we call TAS is I.D. authentication. We were the innovators in this space and have developed a very strong presence with financial institutions and telecommunication companies in the U.S. as well as some of our international markets such as the U.K.     In addition to rigorous I.D. authentication, there’s an increasing demand for risk-based verification solutions that support customers’ needs for secure content delivery. Anakam is the leading provider of large-scale, cost-effective, multi-factor ID verification solutions. Traditional two factor verification, such as hard tokens, smart cards, USB devices or even biometrics, as you know, are expensive to deploy and maintain, particularly when the end user is a consumer, making the Anakam offering very unique and cost-effective.
This acquisition enables us to offer a full life cycle of I.D. management solutions while deepening our relationships with those market sectors which have the greatest needs for these solutions.     Also during the quarter, we added another significant digital marketing opportunity through a partnership between IXI and comScore, a leading provider of online audience measurement services for Internet advertising and e-commerce activities. comScore will be utilizing our data and technology to develop a new, co-branded solution designed to optimize ad placement for the financial services sector to more effectively reach their targeted audiences based on estimated income assets, discretionary spending or ability to pay.
We will become comScore preferred data partner for its targeting and ad-effective solutions in the financial institution section. If you’ll recall on the last earnings call, we talked about our presence expanding in the digital market with a large provider, a very exciting marketplace for us long term.     Relationship with our customers continue to be strengthened by the analytical tools and decisioning platforms delivered through TAS, Technology and Analytical Services. Our analytics are increasingly used by customers for their decisioning needs. During the quarter, scores delivered from Equifax models increased 23% from the same period in 2009, while at the same time; the delivery of scores from models developed by other vendors declined 4%.
Over the past couple of years, we’ve seen our customers’ decisioning needs become more complicated, driven by increased uncertainty surrounding the economic and regulatory environment. These needs range from developing an overall portfolio strategy to decisioning each individual consumer transaction. This creates enormous opportunities to leverage our diverse data assets and increase investment in Technology and Analytical Services. The acquisition of Anakam is a great example of how we can capitalize on these opportunities and further monetize our data and technology assets.     Innovation continues to be an important strategic initiative for us and is helping us win in the marketplace and with our customers. Year-to-date, we have launched 55 new products and continue to meet our revenue targets and our vitality target we’ve talked to you about now for four or five years.     As a thought leader, we’re continuing to develop analytical tools in business intelligence to assist customers as they develop their strategies for addressing emerging challenges and opportunities. These initiatives will give us greater insight in the client strategies and priorities, while further leveraging our data and technology capabilities, including extensive integration of Equifax data alongside client data to develop a complete customer view.
With our technology, we can link Equifax data assets now with a client’s customer information to give them true one-on-one decision-making solutions.     We’re also investing heavily in developing unique consumer keys that can be used to retrieve data consistently and accurately. All of our databases will soon be linked to the others’ proprietary key to ensure that all of the relevant information for specific consumers is accessible to all of our clients’ decisioning needs. That will allow us to develop more products faster and more cost-effectively than we have ever been able to do in the past.     Finally, we’re building new predictive modeling tools that significantly improve decision-making. These new tools incorporate advanced analytics developed through our deep understanding of diverse data assets and the use of advanced statistical techniques to reduce risk in our clients’ decisioning activities. Clearly, our investment in innovation and talent we have recruited, the investments we’ve made and the commitments to our customers during these difficult times has positioned us very well for new and exciting opportunities.     As we enter the final stretch of 2010, we expect to end with a strong quarter in the fourth quarter. We have improved our strategic focus by divesting non-strategic assets, which generated funds that were reinvested in new product innovation, strategic M&A and return to shareholders in the form of share buyback.     I’ll give you a quick look at some of the business units’ expectations for the fourth quarter. USCIS revenue is expected to be up at least 10% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, another strong quarter.
We expect International revenue, when excluding any impact of foreign currency translation, to be up in the low single-digit range when compared to fourth quarter of 2009.
TALX, in the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver double-digit revenue growth year-on-year.
Personal Solutions growth should be in the mid-single-digit range year-on-year. And North America Commercial Solutions is expected to deliver high single to low double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, again when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. So we’re expecting another strong quarter as we exit 2010.     Lee, take over to give the details please on financials?     Lee Adrean</TAG>
Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. This morning, all financial information I will be discussing is presented on a GAAP basis except as otherwise noted and excludes all of our discontinued operations. You should also refer to the Q&A and non-GAAP reconciliations attached to our earnings release for additional financial information.     All of our business units delivered strong performance in the third quarter. We’re making good progress on our growth initiatives, and continued effective expense management has allowed us to invest in future growth opportunities while continuing to earn attractive margins.     Now for the details. Compared to the same quarter of 2009, consolidated revenue of $473.8 million was up 11% on a reported and local currency basis. The acquisition of IXI and Rapid Reporting a year ago added approximately four percentage points of growth in the fourth quarter.     On a GAAP basis, the operating margin in the third quarter was 23.3% compared to 23.5% in the third quarter of 2009. Excluding the amortization of acquisition intangibles, adjusted operating margin for Q3 2010 was 28% compared to 28.2% for the same quarter in 2009. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Equifax was $0.49 per share in the quarter, up 11% from $0.44 in the third quarter a year ago. Excluding the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, adjusted earnings per share attributable to Equifax was $0.60, up 13% from $0.53 in the third quarter of 2009.     We reduced total debt by $60 million during the quarter and $167 million year-to-date. During the quarter, we also repurchased 1.7 million shares of stock for $51.7 million. As of quarter end, our remaining board authorization for share repurchase was $155 million.     Moving to the individual business units. Our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $194 million, up 12% from the same quarter in 2009 and generously ahead of the expectations we communicated during our second quarter earnings release, primarily driven by success in the mortgage market. Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue, which excludes discontinued operations, was $128 million, up 2% compared to 2009. Consistent with our improving revenue trends, our year-over-year online credit decision volume trends have improved every quarter this year from being down 15% year-over-year in the first quarter to down 8% in the second quarter to down only 1% in our most recent quarter. For the quarter, average revenue per transaction was up 1%, primarily driven by sector mix shift. Volume trends improved for the second consecutive quarter, as online transactions were up 7% sequentially from the second quarter.     Mortgage Solutions revenue of $32 million was up 43% compared to the third quarter a year ago. The Mortgage Bankers Application Index for the quarter was up 39% from a year ago.     Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue was $34 million, up 30%. IXI’s performance exceeded our original acquisition assumptions during the quarter. And our Credit Marketing Services unit delivered modest year-over-year growth for the first time since 2007, driven by growth in pre-screening services and portfolio review.     The operating margin for U.S. Consumer Information Solutions was 37.2%, up 100 basis points from the third quarter of 2009.     Our International Business unit’s revenue was $122 million, up 7% from the third quarter of 2009. In local currency, revenue was up 5% from a year ago, in line with our expectations.
By region, Latin America’s revenue was $59 million, up 13% in U.S. dollar terms and 8% in local currency when compared to a year ago. Europe’s revenue was $35 million, down 4% in U.S. dollars but up 2% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2009. Both the U.K. and Spain delivered positive local currency growth. Canada Consumer information revenue was $28 million, up 9% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency when compared to the same period in 2009.     For International in total, softness in online credit services, reflective of weak consumer loan activity in many of our geographies, was offset by expanded sales in analytical, technology and marketing services. International’s operating margin was 25.2%, down slightly from 25.4% in the second quarter and 27% in 2009. The lower margin reflects the reduced proportion of online services revenue currently in our product mix.     TALX revenue was $99 million for the quarter, up 19% from the third quarter of 2009 and well ahead of the expectations we communicated during our second quarter earnings call. Growth in The Work Number continues with revenue of $55 million, up 49% over the prior year. Double-digit revenue growth in collections, mortgage, pre-employment and government sectors and our employment-related transaction processing services, plus the impact of our acquisition of Rapid Reporting, all contribute to this strong performance.     Tax and Talent Management Services revenue was $44 million, down 5% compared to last year, driven by double-digit declines in unemployment claims activity from the elevated levels a year ago, which was partially offset by double-digit growth in Talent Assessment. The TALX operating margin was 22.9%, up from 21.4% in 2009.     North America Personal Solutions revenue was $40 million, up 7% and ahead of the outlook we gave during our Second Quarter Earnings Call. Direct-to-consumer subscription revenue was up 10% year-over-year, driven by an increase in average revenue per subscriber as well as lower churn.
New subscription-based products, such as Equifax Complete with high-value features continues, to drive up the average revenue per subscription and improves our overall operating effectiveness.     Operating margin was 31.9% for the quarter, up from 27.3% a year ago, driven by improved productivity and lower marketing expense.     Finally, North America Commercial Solutions revenue was $18 million, up 14% on a reported basis and 12% local currency, driven again by strong double-digit growth on our U.S. operations. Revenue was also ahead of the expectations we communicated during our Second Quarter Earnings Call. Revenue growth in the U.S. segment was primarily driven by transaction volume, which was up 12% for the quarter. The operating margin for the quarter was 17.9%, up slightly from the year-ago margin.     Overall, our growth this quarter, as well as for each quarter this year, reflects the progress we continue to make on our key strategic initiatives. We continue to invest in and grow our revenue base, while tightly managing expenses to deliver attractive operating margins and cash flow.
Now let me turn it back to Rick.     Richard Smith</TAG>
Thanks, Lee. Hopefully, you get the sense that we’re continuing to win in the marketplace. Our performance is broad-based across all business units and many product lines. Our unique data assets are truly a differentiator for us, allowing us to gain share, win customers and build new products rapidly. Our team is executing on our initiatives.     And as we go forward and look at the fourth quarter, I won’t expect any improvement in the economic landscape. But rather as we’ve shown over the last couple years, we will win due to internally generated momentum.     For the fourth quarter, we expect again another strong quarter, especially when you think about the grandfathering of IXI and Rapid Reporting and a slowdown in the mortgage refinancing in the U.S. business. And we expect revenue to be up 8% to 10% from a year ago. And adjusted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be somewhere between $0.58 and $0.61 a share.
So operator, if you could open up the lines for some questions.

Just as you think of the mortgage business, are you guys winning share in that space on the tri-merge side relative to your competition? And how do you think about that from a grow-over standpoint looking out next year?     Richard Smith</TAG>
Great, great question. The answer’s yes. We’ve shown you now for a number of years that our team has outperformed the index. That has continued.
Secondly, as you know, we invested in a new offering, I think it’s been 4 years ago, which is our Settlement Services. And that’s a very large fragmented market, and we continue to grow in that market environment. So when you think of mortgage, and I’ll get to grow-over in a second, when you think of mortgage, think about it this way.
You had obviously some wind at the back with refinancing. But beyond that it’s taking share and its ESS continuing to grow. So it’s that kind of trifecta, if you will, that’s helping our mortgage business.
As I think of year-on-year, what you’re not going to get next year, I don’t think, is the continuation of the refinancing. But we’ll continue to win on tri-merge. We’ll continue to win on ESS. And more importantly than even that, we’re going to continue to invest in other new products that have been launched this year which should give us nice growth in 2011. So I don’t view mortgage as an excuse for headwind overall for USIS or Equifax in 2011.     George Mihalos - Bank of America</TAG>
Okay, understood. And then just looking at the operating margin for the USCIS. I was a little bit surprised it didn’t go up a little bit more. Just kind of looking at it sequentially, you came in at about 37.2% given the top line growth. Can you kind of talk a little bit about the puts and takes that went into that, especially given the strong OCIS growth?     Richard Smith</TAG>
One, I look at it this way; think about the margin in USIS. First quarter, it was down significantly versus 2009, down again at second quarter; third quarter up 90 basis points is a doggone good performance year-on-year. And it’s trending in the right direction. And I would expect that leverage to continue as we go to the fourth quarter. So I’m proud of what they’ve done.
At the same time, you’ve got to remember that the Mortgage business, while it’s a great growth engine for us, is not the same margins as our online business. That’s where you get the big lift. That’s a good margin. I think any business would love to have that margin. But when you compare it to the online, it was less.

So, can you help us understand where that top line acceleration is coming from? Are you seeing volumes trend upwards in your core business? Or where do you really expect to see that growth come from?     Richard Smith</TAG>
Yes. I think it’s obviously the new products we’ve developed. And those continue to gain traction, as I’ve mentioned before which is good news. We’ve talked about in CMS, our credit marketing business; we had significant growth in the third quarter, which we expect to continue in pre-screen as well as in the portfolio management.
And lastly, The Work Number continues to be a strong growth for us. So if you put that all together, I expect this will offset the grandfathering of IXI, Rapid Reporting and the fact that the refinancing business will slow down.     Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc.</TAG>
Okay. And looking at the bottom line guidance as well, it implies that we’re not going to have a meaningful pickup in leverage in the business. Are you guys spending more internally to launch new products for 2011, 2012?     Richard Smith</TAG>
Yes. Think about it this way. What we had, if you go back to 2005, ‘06, we had low CapEx because we’re not investing in NPI at the rate we are now. So you had years of, and Carter, I don’t have the exact numbers, maybe $50 million to $60 million of CapEx that are now rolling off, they’re grandfathering. And you’ve got higher CapEx years from 2007, ‘08 and ‘09; we’re investing $80 million to $100 million so we can invest in more new products. So that’s one impact.
Number two is I think as Lee mentioned or I mentioned, we’re investing heavily internationally in key markets around the world to drive organic growth. And I think it’s important for us in the long term. So it’s those combinations of things that don’t allow maybe a significant step up in margin.
But I’m convinced over time we’ll get that increase in margin. I told you that our goal long term is to get the margin up over 24 to 25%. And we’re going to head in that direction. You also had some noise, Carter, in the third quarter itself with some deal costs, some professional fees costs. We had to shore up our AIP, our incentive plan. We got some equity grants that will be more expensive for us in the fourth quarter than they were a year ago. So you got some unusual things, if you will, that also creates some headwind.
But think about it in the area of growth, it’s CapEx at a much higher rate and core investments in sales people, marketing people internationally.     Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc.</TAG>
Okay. And so because of those sort of onetime, if you want to call them equity grants and deal costs or whatnot, are we going to see the corporate expense line above $30 million again this quarter?     Lee Adrean</TAG>
Yes, the principal driver in the fourth quarter is our equity grant for the general management population occurs in the fourth quarter. We take an immediate P&L hit for anyone who’s retirement-eligible, as we expense the entire cost of that portion of the grant. That grant was made October 1. Other than that, we’d be about flat. But as a result of that, we’ll probably be up a couple of million dollars.     Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc.</TAG>
Okay. Actually, going back to International there, Rick, sorry, are you talking about investing in existing databases, growing those? Or are you actually talking about moving into - obviously you’re building out in India and some other countries, but are you talking about expanding geography further or investing within the countries that you’re in?     Richard Smith</TAG>
Investing in the countries we’re in, adding a lot more sales people, adding more marketing people, adding more TAS, Technology and Analytical Services people. Just reinvesting.

The one thing I, as we look out to ‘11, I’d love to be able to understand and maybe quantify a little more is how much organic revenue growth, incremental revenue growth do you think you can get from the integration of some of the data you’ve bought, some of the analytics you’ve bought? Generally, the efforts to cross-sell your solutions, you’ve obviously had a lot of success on proprietary scores.
I mean is there a way to think about, given no sort of fundamental change in the demand environment, the rate at which kind of the base Equifax business grows and then the amount by which you think new initiatives can augment that growth next year?     Richard Smith</TAG>
Yes, that’s a good question. Let me answer it two ways. As I think about our model - I’m looking at the financial model because I’m not going to give guidance at this juncture for 2011. But think about our model, Andrew, and what we’ve talked about, which is, I think one, I don’t expect the economic landscape to be marginally better than 2010. At best, probably towards the back end of the year, we’ll see some improvement.
So with that, I think our core growth will be in the low single-digit, 2% or 3%. And then I think on top of that, you’re going to get our strategic initiatives, which will give us 3% to 4% growth.

Okay. And so you think that’s really a sustainable underlying growth rate for the business?     Richard Smith</TAG>
Absolutely.     Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey</TAG>
Okay. And you’ve bought a lot of proprietary data. To the extent that you can deliver 3 to 4% revenue growth from those data, that’s pretty impressive, and it would certainly be rationale to make more acquisitions.
Where do you think you might have holes in your solutions set? Generally, sort of directionally, what types of acquisitions do you think would be the most accretive top and bottom line strategically?     Richard Smith</TAG>
Yes, good question. I think its two areas. There’s still some data assets that we want to get our hands on. That we’ve been consistent in the last five years, that’s the core of who we are. So we continue to look at data assets around the world. There’s data assets in the U.S. I’m interested in, and there’s data assets in almost every country that we operate in outside the U.S.
Secondly, in TAS, Technology and Analytical Solutions, there’s some great opportunities there. This Anakam deal, while it’s small, doing more deals like that, that build out a suite of analytical products where Rajib Roy and his team in test, is a big area focus for us as well.
Let me go back to one point you made though, Andrew, which I jumped over briefly on the data. We’ve been investing now for a couple years in this keying concept that I mentioned in my opening comments, which now allow us to take all these disparate databases and key the consumers as one. When you can do that across an IXI database, a TALX database, a NTC, UE plus database, the credit file, your ability to build products faster and more cost-effectively is greatly enhanced. And that’s going to go live pretty soon, and that will give us additional growth in 2011. In fact, it’ll go live in the fourth quarter this year.     Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey</TAG>
Okay. And it sounds like risk management might be a place you’re focused.     Richard Smith</TAG>
Absolutely.     Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey</TAG>
Okay. And you think that’s a structural growth area. In other words, given what we’ve come through in mortgage and general consumer finance in this cycle, has that changed in structural demand?     Richard Smith</TAG>
Absolutely. In areas like our debt income and enhancements income where we help banks understand risks and understand the ability to pay an obligation. Obviously, fraud’s a big area of focus for us as well. So yes, risk, its core to who we are and a growing area as well.

Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions.  Rick, you’ve done a very good job of growing the revenue. And I just want to key in a little bit more about some of the questions that people have been asking. Specifically about the SG&A, can you just give us kind of the walk-through quarter-over-quarter, maybe this is for Lee, as to where the investments came in and where subsequently we should start to see some leverage down the line?
In other words, is there anything, can you quantify some of the onetime like deal-related costs and other items that you can consider more onetime-ish?     Richard Smith</TAG>
Sure. I’ll let Lee take that one.     Lee Adrean</TAG>
I mean, in general, in SG&A, as Rick mentioned, we are expanding our sales forces particularly in some of the international geographies. We have expanded some of our marketing activities associated with new product innovation, product development and just market examination as we are working to drive more of the organic growth that Rick was just talking about.
In terms of some of the onetime, but I’m not even sure I’d call it onetime, but we did have a step up compared to year-over-year in terms of deal costs of about $1 million primarily related to Anakam. But we’ll have step-ups that will tend to come in periodic pieces. We’re always looking at acquisition opportunities as a way to complement what we’re doing in our strategy. So you’ll see a little bit of fluctuation in that particular piece. Deal costs will tend to show up on the corporate line.
SG&A is obviously much more broadly distributed. And as I said, as we work to drive greater organic growth, what you’ve seen is some very good leverage on cost of sales line over the last couple of years, as we have really worked on LEAN and other cost initiatives and more spending, more growth on the SG&A line as we work to translate that into market revenue growth.     Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus</TAG>
And is there any way to isolate the impact of mortgage activity year-over-year on your business versus say, regular growth in ESS and some of the other things, just so someone could give a, quantitatively think about it in terms of going forward, how much that aspect will make it a tougher comp and how much we’re expecting some of the NPI to kick in.     Richard Smith</TAG>
We talk about mortgage in total, across all of our entities, as a percentage of total revenue. And it ebbs and flows, as you know, over the years to different rates. Think about it as being in the teens right now and that could be 17%, for example, this quarter. But it will ebb and flow from low teens to high teens. We expect to continue to gain share in ESS. We continue to outperform the index in the tri-merge as well.
As I mentioned in a prior question, we don’t expect the refinancing uplift that the experienced in the third quarter to continue in the fourth quarter or next year. But again, I expect to offset that by gaining share in ESS and tri-merge.     Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus</TAG>
Can you just quantify for us what was mortgage last year this quarter? And also can you talk about ESS just on an annualized basis [inaudible] you guys like to talk about it?     Richard Smith</TAG>
Roughly, the mortgage, as a total percent of our total revenue in 2009, was 13%. It’s about 17% this quarter.     Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus</TAG>
And then ESS, how much is that annualized versus last year?     Richard Smith</TAG>
We don’t break that out.

Hi. Good morning, guys. It’s Dave Lewis for Michael. I was just wondering if you could touch on, if you could give us a little more color on credit cards and banks and what you’re hearing from your customers there. I know Lee touched on a couple of the dynamics specific to TALX, but more broadly for the company. Thanks.    Richard Smith</TAG>
Sure. Let me think about it this way. What you’re hear from the banks now is, obviously, we mentioned this I think in the second quarter, is the desire to get back out there and start growing their credit card portfolios cautiously. And when I say cautiously, leveraging some of our data assets that are unique, our debt-to-income assets make sure they’re targeting the right clients. So they’re getting their feet back in the water.
You saw it with pre-screen up 14% in the quarter versus, I think, it was 6% in the second quarter, so sequentially accelerating growth from pre-screen, which is obviously a good indicator. We’re winning across all the different product lines there, again, TALX, IXI and the core credit file.
And ultimately, as you know, Dave, when pre-screen takes off, there’s a lag period of 30 to 60 days, but eventually you see the online benefiting from the pre-screen. So that’s kind of what we see.     David Lewis - JPMorgan</TAG>
Great. And then I think The Work Number is approaching about 50 million active records. And it’s up, I believe, mid-single digits this year. What’s the opportunity to increase that going forward?     Richard Smith</TAG>
It’s significant. I mean one benefactor of the active file increasing is a stability and an improvement in unemployment because obviously as unemployment rose, you went from active to inactive because you’re unemployed. So that’s one thing.
So as you think of that landscape over the next five years or so, an improving economic environment will help grow The Work Number database by itself. Beyond that, there’s a lot of things where we, Dann Adams and his team out at TALX, are doing to grow that active database from partnering with individuals to hiring more salespeople to creatively adding different value proposition for small-sized firms to give us that database. So I’m bullish on our ability to continue growing the database mid-term and long-term.     David Lewis - JPMorgan</TAG>
Thanks, Rick. And then last one from me, it looks like you guys are playing to the core U.S. credit report unit, up sequentially in Q4. It usually declines due to seasonality. What do you expect it to grow in Q4?     Richard Smith</TAG>
I gave you the forecast over; I forgot the heck it was. I thought I said it was at least 10% growth for USIS in the fourth quarter.

Right. But transactions look like from second, third quarter last year were about the same. So that’s a pretty meaningful pickup, it looks like sequentially.
What kind of update can you give us from what the GSEs are saying in terms of reviewing loans for you guys? And is that expected to be a key driver as we think about fourth quarter?     Richard Smith</TAG>
I missed that last part of your question. Does it do what for the fourth quarter?     Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets</TAG>
Is it part of a reason for an acceleration into the fourth quarter?     Richard Smith</TAG>
Obviously, the GSEs are inflicting new standards for all the underwriters of these mortgages, which benefit us. And we’re out there trying to help them with using our data assets like TALX, like IXI as well as analytics to help them determine, in fact, which mortgages are good, which ones are bad. So it’s been a benefit in the third quarter to be honest with you and I expect it to be a benefit for us in the fourth quarter as well.     Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets</TAG>
Is there any opportunity for you guys to take advantage of this kind of foreclosure debacle with all these robo-signers and the big mortgage companies going back in and having to review those documents?     Richard Smith</TAG>
Absolutely. The foreclosure debacle depends on which debacle you’re referring to, improper documentation or less than proper documentation, not necessarily, the ability to help the GSEs and the banks determine which mortgages should be put back to the banks, absolutely, we can help them there.     Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets</TAG>
Okay. So not specific to what they call these robo-signer issues recently?     Richard Smith</TAG>
No.     Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets</TAG>
Okay. And then, Rick, part of the strategy going forward and obviously historically, has been the buildup of new products, your goal has been to get to 10% of revenues. I’m wondering can you shed some light on how you think about the growth rates of really the new products relative to kind of core legacy and then also, where do you guys think you are relative to kind of outpacing what I would consider to be kind of permanently lost revenue from the recession?     Richard Smith</TAG>
That’s a very interesting question. Let me tackle then one by one.
On the vitality, we’re there now. We have reached our 10% vitality in 2010, which I’m extremely proud of. And we’re re-base lining that and setting new targets now for the next three years, which obviously will go up.
As far as the growth rate of the core versus the NPI, think about the model I just described I think it was to Andrew. If you think of the core business as growing a couple of percent, you get the total business growing 6% to 9%. Take out one or two points of M&A for the delta, which is three or four points, is with our strategic initiatives, which is largely NPI. So you’re taking a maybe a 2% growth business and making it a 5% growth, if you will, through NPI.

Well, I was just thinking about that in the same context of how much you’ve kind of permanently lost. I mean there’s a certain percentage of your revenue that will never come back because of kind of subprime applications. And I think Lee has indicated in the past that it was maybe somewhere around 25% or so of USCIS.
I’m just wondering, as we look at it, kind of the new growth initiatives outpacing that permanently lost revenue is what appears to us to start to support a more sustainable organic growth model.     Richard Smith</TAG>
Think about it this way. Think about in the context of the financial model we’ve been trying to describe to you. I don’t think we’re going to go back to the days of consumer spending or consumer lending that we had back in the 2001 to 2005 era. Having said that, you should count on us building a sustainable business model that grows 6 to 9% with organic and a little bit of inorganic, and then some margin expansion beyond that through productivity.

Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to start by asking about online consumer information solutions. I think you specifically gave us the quarter-on-quarter transaction volume increase as being 7%.
And I wondered if you might be able to do two things, one, talk about to what extent that was driven by mortgage. I mean, I understand that mortgage impacts on different parts of your business. But I’m guessing some of that 7% must have been mortgage related. And two, given what you said about pre-screen being a lead indicator, a one- to two-month lead indicator for OSIS, how confident you are of a pretty good quarter-on-quarter pickup in Q4 in that transaction volume.     Richard Smith</TAG>
Yes. The first part Lee jumped into, the first part of your question on the online. Yes, obviously, mortgage is reflected in online. But we saw kind of a broad-based performance on online, not just mortgage. Secondly, your question on pre-screen, it’s hard to predict. What we saw, though, is sequentially a pick-up in third quarter, a very substantial impact in fact, in third quarter pre-screen versus the second quarter. Again, it went from 6% to 14%.

Obviously, it is helping them find the right kind of clients to underwrite, accept as risks, versus those that are not.
