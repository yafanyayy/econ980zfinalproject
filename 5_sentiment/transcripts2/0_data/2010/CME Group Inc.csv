There has been much said about the challenges of 2009, and CME Group certainly wasn't exempt from those challenges. However, looking back at the year, we are pleased with the progress CME Group has made, and the platform we built for the future. From the start of the year, through the end, we sought opportunities amongst the challenges and we were steadfast in pursuing and executing on those opportunities. I'm tremendously excited about how CME is currently positioned to pursue future growth. To highlight a few of our key accomplishments over the past year, we successfully integrated NYMEX and COMEX into CME Group. In addition to the strong recent growth trends in energy and metals volume, which I'll discuss in greater detail in a moment, we've been working on several statistics fronts to leverage these businesses. We've implemented global sales and marketing plans that include increased education and sales outreach to energy and metals customers, cross-selling across asset classes and extending our international intensive programs to these customers. We've completed the clearing and technology integration of NYMEX and COMEX, and achieved the full $60 million in run rate synergies. We've built on the success of the CME ClearPort platform by launching 332 new products in 2009, and we have plans under development to continue adding new asset classes. We've also scaled our technology for future growth. While exercising great expense discipline, we continued our ongoing focus on providing best-in-class technology by bringing on line a new state-of-the-art data center. As part of this effort, we migrated the FX and equities complexes to new match engines and customers have benefited from significant performance improvement. We will migrate other asset classes over the next year.The flexibility of the new data center positions us well for future volume growth, ongoing performance improvements and enhanced customer services. We see technology as helping us deliver better performance to our existing customers, as well as helping to attract new customers. As we have identified in the past, we are actively pursuing a broader global customer base. Over 2009, we made progress on several fronts and moving towards this goal. We work on extending our global relevance by increasing the breadth of products we offer on Globex and developing key relationships with local regulators and market participants in several emerging geographies around the world. We continue to strengthen our BM&FBOVESPA partnership, launched the KOSPI 200 on Globex during non-Korean hours and signed an agreement with Bursa Malaysia to provide global order routing and matching services for their derivatives business, which will also provide us with the license to use their crude palm-oil settlement prices for future product development. We are very pleased with the success we've seen with these partnerships, and we believe they provide us with a strong base to aggressively market the full suite of CME Group products in those geographies. We are focused on positioning ourselves around the world to serve the customers of today, as well as the customers of tomorrow. As a measure of our global penetration, we increased our non-U.S. trading hours volume to 19% in the fourth quarter, up from 17% in the third quarter, while it is difficult to track precisely, we attribute much of this growth to targeted sales effort in Europe and Asia. Finally, on the over-the-counter front, we initiated the prelaunch of over-the-counter clear credit default swaps in December with eight dealer founding members and six buy-side founding members. We continue to actively work on several tracks to complete the steps necessary for our public launch targeted for the end of the first quarter. Most importantly, we see the progress there as a strong foundation for the long-term success of other over-the-counter offerings. Beyond all that I just described, we are also hard at work managing the core business and in spite of the difficult climate, saw significant improvements there. Total open interest at CME Group grew from $63 million at the start of 2009 to $78 million at year-end, an improvement of 24%. January has seen continued growth to $85 million. Interest-rate volumes were the most heavily affected by the credit crisis. Over the course of the year, we saw volume growth of 14% from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. More recently, January 2010 interest-rate average-daily volume of 4.8 million contracts is up 33% from January 2009.Several macroeconomic factors that drive interest rates have stabilized over the course of the year, including improvements in liquidity and credit spreads, but areas of weakness remain. The upcoming announced exit of the Fed from its mortgage-backed securities purchase program and its winding down of several temporary liquidity facilities are both a vote of confidence in the metrics that indicate a recovery is underway and a welcome step from markets that are eager to function based on fundamentals. It is difficult to predict timing, but these and other improving factors contribute to a more active interest rate environment. With macroeconomic factors beyond our control, we continue to work closely with customers on new product development, and we are pleased with the success of our most recent launch, the Ultra T Bond futures [Ultra Treasury Bond futures]. This is the most successful new interest-rate product launched in CME history in terms of volume and open-interest growth since launch. Open interest currently exceeds 40,000 contracts, and we've seen very good volume participation across multiple customer types using these products for a variety of needs. All of these factors bode well for our ability to grow this product over the long-term. Equity volume showed strength early in 2009, as lack of liquidity and other asset classes and high volatility drove volume, but were challenged by declining volatility during the third and fourth quarters. A return of volatility over the last two weeks of January brought volume to 3.5 million contracts during that time period, up 67% from volumes in the first half of January. The fourth quarter was a record quarter for energy, FX and metals volumes, which were up 21%, 57% and 59%, respectively from the third quarter. All of these product areas continue to show robust volumes in January as well. Beyond our core business and strategic-growth initiatives, the other key area of focus for management in 2010 continues to be working with our regulators to ensure that derivatives markets retain their hallmarks of effective price discovery, safety and security. Before concluding, I would like to touch briefly on the status of ELX's attempt to a rule filing with the CFTC to compel CBOT to create or liquidate open positions without any corresponding transaction permitted by CBOT rules. The CFTC has not required us to take any action or modify our rules. I want to make absolutely clear that CBOT's rules remain in full force and effect, and that CBOT and CME Clearing have not been directed to accept directions from ELX or any of its members to open, liquidate or transfer positions in accordance with ELX's rule.We are engaged in a dialogue with the CFTC regarding CBOT's rationale for its long-standing rules prohibiting these types of transaction. As always, we are working closely with the commission staff. We have and continue to take these issues seriously, and are confident that the CBOT is operating in strict compliance with its statutory self-regulatory responsibilities and the requirement of the commodity exchange act. Given the ongoing nature of our discussions with the CFTC, I do not intend to make any further comments on this issue at this time, and when we thank you in advance for respecting that.There are a variety of other additional regulatory issues under consideration at the moment. CME Group appreciates the significance of the financial-markets crisis and the ensuing focus on market regulation. We believe our politicians and elected officials and regulators fundamentally recognize the value of transparent centrally-cleared markets, and that this recognition is reflected in much of the proposed legislation currently outstanding. In the aggregate, there are few areas of potential harm to our business and many areas that are potentially favorable for CME Group and other exchanges. As always, we continue to work to educate law makers and regulators on the forces that drive our markets, and how we can best maintain secure-efficient markets. In summary, in spite of all the challenges this past year, we successfully manage the aftermath of the credit crisis, and are now emerging well positioned for future growth. With fundamental market drivers achieving sustained stability, our core products are showing improvements in volume and open interest.  We have executed on the early stages of our over-the-counter clearing and global-expansion strategies, and we look forward to continuing to build these efforts for long-term success. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jamie to discuss our financial results."

CME Group turned in a strong fourth quarter financial performance, generating more revenue than any other quarter in 2009. Our GAAP results are summarized in the press release. Today, I'm going to focus on the details for Q4 on a pro forma basis. During Q4, average-daily volume was down 1% compared to the fourth quarter 2008 to 10.2 million contracts per day. We generated $667 million in revenue, and operating expenses were up 6% from the prior quarter, slightly less than we guided to on our last call. This resulted in $409 million of operating income and diluted earnings per share of $3.37.In terms of customer segmentation, we saw numbers for the fourth quarter remain largely in line with third quarter results. Proprietary buy-side traders contributed 43% of overall volume; hedge funds accounted for 8% of volume, showing a slight increase in contribution for the third quarter in a row; bank trading accounted for 13% of volume; other member activity, 20% and non-member activity, 16%. This segmentation is for legacy CME CBOT products only. We will be providing more details for the entire CME products suite beginning next quarter. The overall pro forma rate per contracts for all CME Group volume decreased 2% to $0.849 compared with $0.866 in the fourth quarter 2008, primarily due to lower-price interest-rate volume increasing from 36% of total a year ago to 43% this quarter. Sequentially, the rates per contract increased $0.015 from $0.834 to $0.849 due to a 1% increase in the metals proportion of the product mix, and a favorable pricing impact from changes implemented in August and September of 2009.Market data revenue of $82 million for the quarter decreased 6% versus last year and was up 1% sequentially. At the end of the fourth quarter, users subscribe to 396,000-based devices across CME, CBOT and NYMEX, down 9% versus Q4 of last year and down 1% sequentially. During Q4, we had a benefit from a billing adjustment which resulted in a positive-sequential revenue growth. We have announced a professional screen [ph] fee increase from $55 to $61 per month beginning in January of 2010.I'll now take a few minutes to review expenses. Total pro forma operating expenses were $258 million for Q4, down 2% versus Q4 last year, but up $14 million or 6% sequentially. Total expense for the year was $998 million, down 8% as we delivered the NYMEX-related synergy and ratcheted down our discretionary expenses. Drilling into Q4 expenses, compensation and benefits was up $4 million sequentially to $88.6 million, due primarily to higher stock-based compensation. Stock based compensation was $9.9 million in the fourth quarter, up $3 million from Q3. We moved our stock option grant date from mid-June to mid-September, and some prior-year grants rolled off in June, resulting in lower Q3 expense. Our combined headcount at the end of Q4 stood at 2,260, up slightly relative to the prior quarter. Our fourth quarter bonus expense was $11.8 million and for the full year, the bonus expense totaled $39 million, down 13% versus 2008. Non-compensation expenses of $170 million were down $6 million versus last year and up $10 million sequentially. Comparing to last quarter, the primary increases were in the professional fees line, up $4.7 million due to fees associated with our strategic initiatives and miscellaneous litigation and in the other expense line, up $4.4 million due to increased marketing costs, primarily related to sponsored conferences and currency fluctuation.Q4 pro forma operating income was $409 million, the high-water mark for 2009. During the fourth quarter, we were able to maintain a very strong pro forma operating margin of 61%, and we finished the full year with an operating margin of 62% compared to 64% in 2008. We view this as a significant achievement in light of the challenging environment throughout last year. In the non-operating income and expense category, on the investment income line, we received a $5 million dividend from the BM&FBOVESPA in line with Q3. During Q4, we paid down $225 million in debt and as of the end of December, we had $2.3 billion of debt outstanding and $303 million of cash and marketable securities. Interest expense totaled $30.7 million in Q4. During the quarter, we continued to pay down our debt by rolling less commercial paper, which carries a rate of less than 0.3% in the quarter. We expect our interest expense to remain at a similar level to Q4 for the next two quarters.After paying off $900 million of debt during the year, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was down to 1.2%. Looking forward, we have a $300 million payment due in August, and we intend to pay off the remaining debt instruments on their maturity dates. The detail related to our debt structure is included in our earnings slide presentation on the website. For the quarter, our pro forma effective tax rate was 41.2%, bringing us to 41.1% for the year. Looking to 2010, we expect an effective tax rate of between 41% and 42%. Capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowances, totaled $43 million in the fourth quarter and $137 million in 2009, driven primarily by data center, software, equipment and facilities costs.At this point, I would like to provide some insight and guidance related to our plans for 2010. First, on operating expenses, our normal growth rate from 2001 to 2007 was 8% to 10%. In 2008, our pro forma expenses dropped 2%, followed by an 8% drop in 2009 during a period in which we benefited from the synergies captured on our recent mergers, and we compressed discretionary spending as far as we could, including some items which are one-time in nature. As the economy shows signs of emerging from the recession, our outlook on growth is improving in 2010. We expect to return to more normal expense-growth levels, resulting in annual 2010 expense of approximately $1.1 billion.Within compensation, after holding salaries flat in 2009, we expect a 5% increase due to merit and promotion adjustments for employees, and to the impact of new hires. In terms of stock-based comp, we expect a similar quarterly run rate as we saw in Q4 of approximately $10 million to $11 million per quarter. Lastly, our bonus expense totaled $39 million in 2009, down from $45 million in 2008.  Looking ahead to 2010, our target-employee bonus is approximately $54 million, based on reaching our internal 2010 cash-earnings target. If our cash earnings for the year are 20% above our cash-earnings target, employee bonuses would be approximately $82 million. If we are more than 20% below our target, the bonus would be a minimal amount for non-exempt employees. The non-comp expense increase from 2009 is expected to come in many of the technology-oriented expenses, as we are aggressively building out our new data center. In addition, marketing and other expense is expected to rise during 2010 to roughly $23 million a quarter, on average, and is likely to be more front-end loaded. This higher level is attributable to advertising, promotion and travel expenses driven by our desire to expand both our global reach and our OTC capability. Licensing and fee sharing will likely rise based on continued growth in our Energy and Equity businesses. As always, during 2010, we will continue to spend on growth. We anticipate deploying additional OTC products bringing the European clearing house online during the year and working on various other strategic initiatives. Turning to capital expenditures, as I mentioned earlier, we spent $137 million in 2009, well below our original 2009 guidance, and down from $205 million in 2008. In 2010, we anticipate between $180 million and $200 million of capital expenditures, driven by technology-related projects, as we now populate our new data center. In summary, we are proud of our results during a challenging year. We made incremental progress during 2009 after a fairly large shock to the financial system. We were very careful on expenses and at the same time, we continue to make investments in growth as reflected in our signing of various global partnerships, and laying the groundwork for a significant OTC clearing opportunity. And finally, we are optimistic about the strong start to 2010 with January volume averaging 11.2 million contracts per day, up 19% versus January 2009. We'll now open up the call for your questions. But in order to get to everyone, we are limiting all of you to one question and one follow-up, and then please feel free to get back in the queue if time permits."

On the short end of the term [ph] clearly, you need to get out of the zero-interest rate policy to really change the dynamic there. You can look at [indiscernible] some futures market to see where the market think those rates are going to substantially move before the end of the year. On the longer end of the curve though, outside of the short rates, there's a lot that's going on in the mortgage market, a lot that's going on there, a lot of the government policies, a lot of that can move without having the zero-interest rate policy change at all. So I mean the other thing to think about there, Jonathan, is as those relationships across the yield curve may change, based on how the government exits this program. So it's harder to do a point estimate of volatility, but the way we think about it is looking at it as the shape of the yield curve also may change there as well."

There has been much said about the challenges of 2009, and CME Group certainly wasn't exempt from those challenges. However, looking back at the year, we are pleased with the progress CME Group has made, and the platform we built for the future. From the start of the year, through the end, we sought opportunities amongst the challenges and we were steadfast in pursuing and executing on those opportunities. I'm tremendously excited about how CME is currently positioned to pursue future growth. To highlight a few of our key accomplishments over the past year, we successfully integrated NYMEX and COMEX into CME Group. In addition to the strong recent growth trends in energy and metals volume, which I'll discuss in greater detail in a moment, we've been working on several statistics fronts to leverage these businesses. We've implemented global sales and marketing plans that include increased education and sales outreach to energy and metals customers, cross-selling across asset classes and extending our international intensive programs to these customers. We've completed the clearing and technology integration of NYMEX and COMEX, and achieved the full $60 million in run rate synergies. We've built on the success of the CME ClearPort platform by launching 332 new products in 2009, and we have plans under development to continue adding new asset classes. We've also scaled our technology for future growth. While exercising great expense discipline, we continued our ongoing focus on providing best-in-class technology by bringing on line a new state-of-the-art data center. As part of this effort, we migrated the FX and equities complexes to new match engines and customers have benefited from significant performance improvement. We will migrate other asset classes over the next year.The flexibility of the new data center positions us well for future volume growth, ongoing performance improvements and enhanced customer services. We see technology as helping us deliver better performance to our existing customers, as well as helping to attract new customers. As we have identified in the past, we are actively pursuing a broader global customer base. Over 2009, we made progress on several fronts and moving towards this goal. We worked on extending our global relevance by increasing the breadth of products we offer on Globex and developing key relationships with local regulators and market participants in several emerging geographies around the world. We continue to strengthen our BM&FBOVESPA partnership, launched the KOSPI 200 on Globex during non-Korean hours and signed an agreement with Bursa Malaysia to provide global order routing and matching services for their derivatives business, which will also provide us with a license to use their crude palm-oil settlement prices for future product development. We are very pleased with the success we've seen with these partnerships, and we believe they provide us with a strong base to aggressively market the full suite of CME Group products in those geographies. We are focused on positioning ourselves around the world to serve the customers of today, as well as the customers of tomorrow. As a measure of our global penetration, we increased our non-U.S. trading hours volume to 19% in the fourth quarter, up from 17% in the third quarter. While it is difficult to track precisely, we attribute much of this growth to targeted sales efforts in Europe and Asia. Finally, on the over-the-counter front, we initiated the pre-launch of over-the-counter cleared credit default swaps in December with eight dealer founding members and six buy-side founding members. We continue to actively work on several tracks to complete the steps necessary for our public launch targeted for the end of the first quarter. Most importantly, we see the progress there as a strong foundation for the long-term success of other over-the-counter offerings. Beyond all that I’ve just described, we were also hard at work managing the core business and in spite of the difficult climate, saw significant improvements there. Total open interest at CME Group grew from $63 million at the start of 2009 to $78 million at year end, an improvement of 24%. January has seen continued growth to $85 million. Interest-rate volumes were the most heavily affected by the credit crisis. Over the course of the year, we saw volume growth of 14% from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. More recently, January 2010 interest rate average daily volume of 4.8 million contracts is up 33% from January 2009.Several macroeconomic factors that drive interest rates have stabilized over the course of the year, including improvements in liquidity and credit spreads, but areas of weakness remain. The upcoming announced exit of the Fed from its mortgage-backed securities purchase program and its winding down of several temporary liquidity facilities are both a vote of confidence in the metrics that indicate a recovery is underway and a welcome step from markets that are eager to function based on fundamentals. It is difficult to predict timing, but these and other improving factors contribute to a more active interest rate environment. With macroeconomic factors beyond our control, we continue to work closely with customers on new product development, and we are pleased with the success of our most recent launch, the Ultra T Bond futures [Ultra Treasury Bond futures]. This is the most successful new interest-rate product launched in CME history in terms of volume and open-interest growth since launch. Open interest currently exceeds 40,000 contracts, and we've seen very good volume participation across multiple customer types using these products for a variety of needs. All of these factors bode well for our ability to grow this product over the long term. Equities volume showed strength early in 2009, as lack of liquidity in other asset classes and high volatility drove volume, but were challenged by declining volatility during the third and fourth quarters. A return of volatility over the last two weeks of January brought volumes to 3.5 million contracts during that time period, up 67% from volumes in the first half of January. The fourth quarter was a record quarter for energy, FX and metals volumes, which were up 21%, 57% and 59%, respectively from the third quarter. All of these product areas continued to show robust volumes in January as well. Beyond our core business and strategic growth initiatives, the other key area of focus for management in 2010 continues to be working with our regulators to ensure that derivatives markets retain their hallmarks of effective price discovery, safety and security. Before concluding, I would like to touch briefly on the status of ELX's attempt to a rule filing with the CFTC to compel CBOT to create or liquidate open positions without any corresponding transaction permitted by CBOT rules. The CFTC has not required us to take any action or modify our rules. I want to make absolutely clear that CBOT's rules remain in full force and effect, and that CBOT and CME Clearing have not been directed to accept directions from ELX or any of its members to open, liquidate or transfer positions in accordance with ELX's rule.We are engaged in a dialogue with the CFTC regarding CBOT's rationale for its long-standing rules prohibiting these types of transaction. As always, we are working closely with the commission staff. We have and continue to take these issues seriously, and are confident that the CBOT is operating in strict compliance with its statutory self-regulatory responsibilities and the requirement of the commodity exchange act. Given the ongoing nature of our discussions with the CFTC, I do not intend to make any further comments on this issue at this time, and when we thank you in advance for respecting that.There are a variety of other additional regulatory issues under consideration at the moment. CME Group appreciates the significance of the financial-markets crisis and the ensuing focus on market regulation. We believe our politicians and elected officials and regulators fundamentally recognize the value of transparent centrally-cleared markets, and that this recognition is reflected in much of the proposed legislation currently outstanding. In the aggregate, there are few areas of potential harm to our business and many areas that are potentially favorable for CME Group and other exchanges. As always, we continue to work to educate law makers and regulators on the forces that drive our markets, and how we can best maintain secure-efficient markets. In summary, in spite of all the challenges this past year, we successfully manage the aftermath of the credit crisis, and are now emerging well positioned for future growth. With fundamental market drivers achieving sustained stability, our core products are showing improvements in volume and open interest.  We have executed on the early stages of our over-the-counter clearing and global-expansion strategies, and we look forward to continuing to build these efforts for long-term success. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jamie to discuss our financial results."

CME Group turned in a strong fourth quarter financial performance, generating more revenue than any other quarter in 2009. Our GAAP results are summarized in the press release. Today, I'm going to focus on the details for Q4 on a pro forma basis. During Q4, average-daily volume was down 1% compared to the fourth quarter 2008 to 10.2 million contracts per day. We generated $667 million in revenue, and operating expenses were up 6% from the prior quarter, slightly less than we guided to on our last call. This resulted in $409 million of operating income and diluted earnings per share of $3.37.In terms of customer segmentation, we saw numbers for the fourth quarter remain largely in line with third quarter results. Proprietary buy-side traders contributed 43% of overall volume; hedge funds accounted for 8% of volume, showing a slight increase in contribution for the third quarter in a row; bank trading accounted for 13% of volume; other member activity, 20% and non-member activity, 16%. This segmentation is for legacy CME CBOT products only. We will be providing more details for the entire CME Group product suite beginning next quarter. The overall pro forma rate per contract for all CME Group volume decreased 2% to $0.849 compared with $0.866 in the fourth quarter 2008, primarily due to lower priced interest rate volume increasing from 36% of total a year ago to 43% this quarter. Sequentially, the rate per contract increased $0.015 from $0.834 to $0.849 due to a 1% increase in the metals proportion of the product mix, and a favorable pricing impact from changes implemented in August and September of 2009.Market data revenue of $82 million for the quarter decreased 6% versus last year and was up 1% sequentially. At the end of the fourth quarter, users subscribe to 396,000 base devices across CME, CBOT and NYMEX, down 9% versus Q4 of last year and down 1% sequentially. During Q4, we had a benefit from a billing adjustment which resulted in a positive sequential revenue growth. We have announced a professional screen fee increase from $55 to $61 per month beginning in January of 2010.I'll now take a few minutes to review expenses. Total pro forma operating expenses were $258 million for Q4, down 2% versus Q4 last year, but up $14 million or 6% sequentially. Total expense for the year was $998 million, down 8% as we delivered the NYMEX-related synergies and ratcheted down our discretionary expenses. Drilling into Q4 expenses, compensation and benefits was up $4 million sequentially to $88.6 million, due primarily to higher stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation was $9.9 million in the fourth quarter, up $3 million from Q3. We moved our stock option grant date from mid-June to mid-September, and some prior-year grants rolled off in June, resulting in lower Q3 expense. Our combined headcount at the end of Q4 stood at 2,260, up slightly relative to the prior quarter. Our fourth quarter bonus expense was $11.8 million and for the full year, the bonus expense totaled $39 million, down 13% versus 2008. Non-compensation expenses of $170 million were down $6 million versus last year and up $10 million sequentially. Comparing to last quarter, the primary increases were in the professional fees line, up $4.7 million due to fees associated with our strategic initiatives and miscellaneous litigation and in the other expense line, up $4.4 million due to increased marketing costs, primarily related to sponsored conferences and currency fluctuation.Q4 pro forma operating income was $409 million, the high-water mark for 2009. During the fourth quarter, we were able to maintain a very strong pro forma operating margin of 61%, and we finished the full year with an operating margin of 62% compared to 64% in 2008. We view this as a significant achievement in light of the challenging environment throughout last year. In the non-operating income and expense category, on the investment income line, we received a $5 million dividend from the BM&FBOVESPA in line with Q3. During Q4, we paid down $225 million in debt and as of the end of December, we had $2.3 billion of debt outstanding and $303 million of cash and marketable securities. Interest expense totaled $30.7 million in Q4. During the quarter, we continued to pay down our debt by rolling less commercial paper, which carries a rate of less than 0.3% in the quarter. We expect our interest expense to remain at a similar level to Q4 for the next two quarters.After paying off $900 million of debt during the year, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was down to 1.2%. Looking forward, we have a $300 million payment due in August, and we intend to pay off the remaining debt instruments on their maturity dates. The detail related to our debt structure is included in our earnings slide presentation on the website. For the quarter, our pro forma effective tax rate was 41.2%, bringing us to 41.1% for the year. Looking to 2010, we expect an effective tax rate of between 41% and 42%. Capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowances, totaled $43 million in the fourth quarter and $137 million in 2009, driven primarily by data center, software, equipment and facilities costs.At this point, I would like to provide some insight and guidance related to our plans for 2010. First, on operating expenses, our normal growth rate from 2001 to 2007 was 8% to 10%. In 2008, our pro forma expenses dropped 2%, followed by an 8% drop in 2009 during a period in which we benefited from the synergies captured on our recent mergers, and we compressed discretionary spending as far as we could, including some items which are one-time in nature. As the economy shows signs of emerging from the recession, our outlook on growth is improving in 2010. We expect to return to more normal expense-growth levels, resulting in annual 2010 expense of approximately $1.1 billion.Within compensation, after holding salaries flat in 2009, we expect a 5% increase due to merit and promotion adjustments for employees, and to the impact of new hires. In terms of stock-based comp, we expect a similar quarterly run rate as we saw in Q4 of approximately $10 million to $11 million per quarter. Lastly, our bonus expense totaled $39 million in 2009, down from $45 million in 2008.  Looking ahead to 2010, our target-employee bonus is approximately $54 million, based on reaching our internal 2010 cash-earnings target. If our cash earnings for the year are 20% above our cash-earnings target, employee bonuses would be approximately $82 million. If we are more than 20% below our target, the bonus would be a minimal amount for non-exempt employees. The non-comp expense increase from 2009 is expected to come in many of the technology-oriented expenses, as we are aggressively building out our new data center. In addition, marketing and other expense is expected to rise during 2010 to roughly $23 million a quarter, on average, and is likely to be more front-end loaded. This higher level is attributable to advertising, promotion and travel expenses driven by our desire to expand both our global reach and our OTC capabilities. Licensing and fee sharing will likely rise based on continued growth in our Energy and Equity businesses. As always, during 2010, we will continue to spend on growth. We anticipate deploying additional OTC products, bringing the European clearing house online during the year and working on various other strategic initiatives. Turning to capital expenditures, as I mentioned earlier, we spent $137 million in 2009, well below our original 2009 guidance, and down from $205 million in 2008. In 2010, we anticipate between $180 million and $200 million of capital expenditures, driven by technology-related projects, as we now populate our new data center. In summary, we are proud of our results during a challenging year. We made incremental progress during 2009 after a fairly large shock to the financial system. We were very careful on expenses and at the same time, we continued to make investments in growth as reflected in our signing of various global partnerships, and laying the groundwork for a significant OTC clearing opportunity. And finally, we are optimistic about the strong start to 2010 with January volume averaging 11.2 million contracts per day, up 19% versus January 2009. We'll now open up the call for your questions. But in order to get to everyone, we are limiting all of you to one question and one follow-up, and then please feel free to get back in the queue if time permits."

What we have done though is some of the components within the index actually are trading, the Mars product in particular. So pretty much what we said would happen is happening, and we continue to look forward as the industry evolves or how it moves. I mean again, remember, Mike, that all this stuff is based off WTI pricing. So it actually is probably pretty favorable for our WTI business."

And this was the product the market needed, because the duration of all these instruments has come in quite a bit given the rate environment. This has actually been broadly used by both buying and sell side at this point. And the other thing that is encouraging is as we thought, we see people also spreading this against the 30-year Treasury bond. So this has just been a phenomenal uptake in the product. And one of the good things, as Craig mentioned, that 44,000-plus of open interest, over 5,000 of it is already in the June contract. So you're starting to see people already think about the future and what that contract will hold."

So I mean the other thing to think about there, Jonathan, is as those relationships across the yield curve may change, based on how the government exits this program. So it's harder to do a point estimate of volatility, but the way we think about it is looking at it as the shape of the yield curve also may change there as well."

There has been much said about the challenges of 2009, and CME Group certainly wasn't exempt from those challenges. However, looking back at the year, we are pleased with the progress CME Group has made, and the platform we built for the future. From the start of the year, through the end, we sought opportunities amongst the challenges and we were steadfast in pursuing and executing on those opportunities. I'm tremendously excited about how CME is currently positioned to pursue future growth. To highlight a few of our key accomplishments over the past year, we successfully integrated NYMEX and COMEX into CME Group. In addition to the strong recent growth trends in energy and metals volume, which I'll discuss in greater detail in a moment, we've been working on several statistics fronts to leverage these businesses. We've implemented global sales and marketing plans that include increased education and sales outreach to energy and metals customers, cross-selling across asset classes and extending our international intensive programs to these customers. We've completed the clearing and technology integration of NYMEX and COMEX, and achieved the full $60 million in run rate synergies. We've built on the success of the CME ClearPort platform by launching 332 new products in 2009, and we have plans under development to continue adding new asset classes. We've also scaled our technology for future growth. While exercising great expense discipline, we continued our ongoing focus on providing best-in-class technology by bringing on line a new state-of-the-art data center. As part of this effort, we migrated the FX and equities complexes to new match engines and customers have benefited from significant performance improvement. We will migrate other asset classes over the next year.The flexibility of the new data center positions us well for future volume growth, ongoing performance improvements and enhanced customer services. We see technology as helping us deliver better performance to our existing customers, as well as helping to attract new customers. As we have identified in the past, we are actively pursuing a broader global customer base. Over 2009, we made progress on several fronts and moving towards this goal. We worked on extending our global relevance by increasing the breadth of products we offer on Globex and developing key relationships with local regulators and market participants in several emerging geographies around the world. We continue to strengthen our BM&FBOVESPA partnership, launched the KOSPI 200 on Globex during non-Korean hours and signed an agreement with Bursa Malaysia to provide global order routing and matching services for their derivatives business, which will also provide us with a license to use their crude palm-oil settlement prices for future product development. We are very pleased with the success we've seen with these partnerships, and we believe they provide us with a strong base to aggressively market the full suite of CME Group products in those geographies. We are focused on positioning ourselves around the world to serve the customers of today, as well as the customers of tomorrow. As a measure of our global penetration, we increased our non-U.S. trading hours volume to 19% in the fourth quarter, up from 17% in the third quarter. While it is difficult to track precisely, we attribute much of this growth to targeted sales efforts in Europe and Asia. Finally, on the over-the-counter front, we initiated the pre-launch of over-the-counter cleared credit default swaps in December with eight dealer founding members and six buy-side founding members. We continue to actively work on several tracks to complete the steps necessary for our public launch targeted for the end of the first quarter. Most importantly, we see the progress there as a strong foundation for the long-term success of other over-the-counter offerings. Beyond all that I’ve just described, we were also hard at work managing the core business and in spite of the difficult climate, saw significant improvements there. Total open interest at CME Group grew from $63 million at the start of 2009 to $78 million at year end, an improvement of 24%. January has seen continued growth to $85 million. Interest-rate volumes were the most heavily affected by the credit crisis. Over the course of the year, we saw volume growth of 14% from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. More recently, January 2010 interest rate average daily volume of 4.8 million contracts is up 33% from January 2009.Several macroeconomic factors that drive interest rates have stabilized over the course of the year, including improvements in liquidity and credit spreads, but areas of weakness remain. The upcoming announced exit of the Fed from its mortgage-backed securities purchase program and its winding down of several temporary liquidity facilities are both a vote of confidence in the metrics that indicate a recovery is underway and a welcome step from markets that are eager to function based on fundamentals. It is difficult to predict timing, but these and other improving factors contribute to a more active interest rate environment. With macroeconomic factors beyond our control, we continue to work closely with customers on new product development, and we are pleased with the success of our most recent launch, the Ultra T Bond futures [Ultra Treasury Bond futures]. This is the most successful new interest-rate product launched in CME history in terms of volume and open-interest growth since launch. Open interest currently exceeds 40,000 contracts, and we've seen very good volume participation across multiple customer types using these products for a variety of needs. All of these factors bode well for our ability to grow this product over the long term. Equities volume showed strength early in 2009, as lack of liquidity in other asset classes and high volatility drove volume, but were challenged by declining volatility during the third and fourth quarters. A return of volatility over the last two weeks of January brought volumes to 3.5 million contracts during that time period, up 67% from volumes in the first half of January. The fourth quarter was a record quarter for energy, FX and metals volumes, which were up 21%, 57% and 59%, respectively from the third quarter. All of these product areas continued to show robust volumes in January as well. Beyond our core business and strategic growth initiatives, the other key area of focus for management in 2010 continues to be working with our regulators to ensure that derivatives markets retain their hallmarks of effective price discovery, safety and security. Before concluding, I would like to touch briefly on the status of ELX's attempt to a rule filing with the CFTC to compel CBOT to create or liquidate open positions without any corresponding transaction permitted by CBOT rules. The CFTC has not required us to take any action or modify our rules. I want to make absolutely clear that CBOT's rules remain in full force and effect, and that CBOT and CME Clearing have not been directed to accept directions from ELX or any of its members to open, liquidate or transfer positions in accordance with ELX's rule.We are engaged in a dialogue with the CFTC regarding CBOT's rationale for its long-standing rules prohibiting these types of transaction. As always, we are working closely with the commission staff. We have and continue to take these issues seriously, and are confident that the CBOT is operating in strict compliance with its statutory self-regulatory responsibilities and the requirement of the commodity exchange act. Given the ongoing nature of our discussions with the CFTC, I do not intend to make any further comments on this issue at this time, and when we thank you in advance for respecting that.There are a variety of other additional regulatory issues under consideration at the moment. CME Group appreciates the significance of the financial-markets crisis and the ensuing focus on market regulation. We believe our politicians and elected officials and regulators fundamentally recognize the value of transparent centrally-cleared markets, and that this recognition is reflected in much of the proposed legislation currently outstanding. In the aggregate, there are few areas of potential harm to our business and many areas that are potentially favorable for CME Group and other exchanges. As always, we continue to work to educate law makers and regulators on the forces that drive our markets, and how we can best maintain secure-efficient markets. In summary, in spite of all the challenges this past year, we successfully manage the aftermath of the credit crisis, and are now emerging well positioned for future growth. With fundamental market drivers achieving sustained stability, our core products are showing improvements in volume and open interest.  We have executed on the early stages of our over-the-counter clearing and global-expansion strategies, and we look forward to continuing to build these efforts for long-term success. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jamie to discuss our financial results."

CME Group turned in a strong fourth quarter financial performance, generating more revenue than any other quarter in 2009. Our GAAP results are summarized in the press release. Today, I'm going to focus on the details for Q4 on a pro forma basis. During Q4, average-daily volume was down 1% compared to the fourth quarter 2008 to 10.2 million contracts per day. We generated $667 million in revenue, and operating expenses were up 6% from the prior quarter, slightly less than we guided to on our last call. This resulted in $409 million of operating income and diluted earnings per share of $3.37.In terms of customer segmentation, we saw numbers for the fourth quarter remain largely in line with third quarter results. Proprietary buy-side traders contributed 43% of overall volume; hedge funds accounted for 8% of volume, showing a slight increase in contribution for the third quarter in a row; bank trading accounted for 13% of volume; other member activity, 20% and non-member activity, 16%. This segmentation is for legacy CME CBOT products only. We will be providing more details for the entire CME Group product suite beginning next quarter. The overall pro forma rate per contract for all CME Group volume decreased 2% to $0.849 compared with $0.866 in the fourth quarter 2008, primarily due to lower priced interest rate volume increasing from 36% of total a year ago to 43% this quarter. Sequentially, the rate per contract increased $0.015 from $0.834 to $0.849 due to a 1% increase in the metals proportion of the product mix, and a favorable pricing impact from changes implemented in August and September of 2009.Market data revenue of $82 million for the quarter decreased 6% versus last year and was up 1% sequentially. At the end of the fourth quarter, users subscribe to 396,000 base devices across CME, CBOT and NYMEX, down 9% versus Q4 of last year and down 1% sequentially. During Q4, we had a benefit from a billing adjustment which resulted in a positive sequential revenue growth. We have announced a professional screen fee increase from $55 to $61 per month beginning in January of 2010.I'll now take a few minutes to review expenses. Total pro forma operating expenses were $258 million for Q4, down 2% versus Q4 last year, but up $14 million or 6% sequentially. Total expense for the year was $998 million, down 8% as we delivered the NYMEX-related synergies and ratcheted down our discretionary expenses. Drilling into Q4 expenses, compensation and benefits was up $4 million sequentially to $88.6 million, due primarily to higher stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation was $9.9 million in the fourth quarter, up $3 million from Q3. We moved our stock option grant date from mid-June to mid-September, and some prior-year grants rolled off in June, resulting in lower Q3 expense. Our combined headcount at the end of Q4 stood at 2,260, up slightly relative to the prior quarter. Our fourth quarter bonus expense was $11.8 million and for the full year, the bonus expense totaled $39 million, down 13% versus 2008. Non-compensation expenses of $170 million were down $6 million versus last year and up $10 million sequentially. Comparing to last quarter, the primary increases were in the professional fees line, up $4.7 million due to fees associated with our strategic initiatives and miscellaneous litigation and in the other expense line, up $4.4 million due to increased marketing costs, primarily related to sponsored conferences and currency fluctuation.Q4 pro forma operating income was $409 million, the high-water mark for 2009. During the fourth quarter, we were able to maintain a very strong pro forma operating margin of 61%, and we finished the full year with an operating margin of 62% compared to 64% in 2008. We view this as a significant achievement in light of the challenging environment throughout last year. In the non-operating income and expense category, on the investment income line, we received a $5 million dividend from the BM&FBOVESPA in line with Q3. During Q4, we paid down $225 million in debt and as of the end of December, we had $2.3 billion of debt outstanding and $303 million of cash and marketable securities. Interest expense totaled $30.7 million in Q4. During the quarter, we continued to pay down our debt by rolling less commercial paper, which carries a rate of less than 0.3% in the quarter. We expect our interest expense to remain at a similar level to Q4 for the next two quarters.After paying off $900 million of debt during the year, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was down to 1.2%. Looking forward, we have a $300 million payment due in August, and we intend to pay off the remaining debt instruments on their maturity dates. The detail related to our debt structure is included in our earnings slide presentation on the website. For the quarter, our pro forma effective tax rate was 41.2%, bringing us to 41.1% for the year. Looking to 2010, we expect an effective tax rate of between 41% and 42%. Capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowances, totaled $43 million in the fourth quarter and $137 million in 2009, driven primarily by data center, software, equipment and facilities costs.At this point, I would like to provide some insight and guidance related to our plans for 2010. First, on operating expenses, our normal growth rate from 2001 to 2007 was 8% to 10%. In 2008, our pro forma expenses dropped 2%, followed by an 8% drop in 2009 during a period in which we benefited from the synergies captured on our recent mergers, and we compressed discretionary spending as far as we could, including some items which are one-time in nature. As the economy shows signs of emerging from the recession, our outlook on growth is improving in 2010. We expect to return to more normal expense-growth levels, resulting in annual 2010 expense of approximately $1.1 billion.Within compensation, after holding salaries flat in 2009, we expect a 5% increase due to merit and promotion adjustments for employees, and to the impact of new hires. In terms of stock-based comp, we expect a similar quarterly run rate as we saw in Q4 of approximately $10 million to $11 million per quarter. Lastly, our bonus expense totaled $39 million in 2009, down from $45 million in 2008.  Looking ahead to 2010, our target-employee bonus is approximately $54 million, based on reaching our internal 2010 cash-earnings target. If our cash earnings for the year are 20% above our cash-earnings target, employee bonuses would be approximately $82 million. If we are more than 20% below our target, the bonus would be a minimal amount for non-exempt employees. The non-comp expense increase from 2009 is expected to come in many of the technology-oriented expenses, as we are aggressively building out our new data center. In addition, marketing and other expense is expected to rise during 2010 to roughly $23 million a quarter, on average, and is likely to be more front-end loaded. This higher level is attributable to advertising, promotion and travel expenses driven by our desire to expand both our global reach and our OTC capabilities. Licensing and fee sharing will likely rise based on continued growth in our Energy and Equity businesses. As always, during 2010, we will continue to spend on growth. We anticipate deploying additional OTC products, bringing the European clearing house online during the year and working on various other strategic initiatives. Turning to capital expenditures, as I mentioned earlier, we spent $137 million in 2009, well below our original 2009 guidance, and down from $205 million in 2008. In 2010, we anticipate between $180 million and $200 million of capital expenditures, driven by technology-related projects, as we now populate our new data center. In summary, we are proud of our results during a challenging year. We made incremental progress during 2009 after a fairly large shock to the financial system. We were very careful on expenses and at the same time, we continued to make investments in growth as reflected in our signing of various global partnerships, and laying the groundwork for a significant OTC clearing opportunity. And finally, we are optimistic about the strong start to 2010 with January volume averaging 11.2 million contracts per day, up 19% versus January 2009. We'll now open up the call for your questions. But in order to get to everyone, we are limiting all of you to one question and one follow-up, and then please feel free to get back in the queue if time permits."

We're still in the process of examining the CFTC's proposal. I think that in general, the commission has done a good job of taking feedback and input variety of sources within the industry from the time that they first have their hearings at the convention [ph] in the fall. There's a lot of complexity and various aspects of their proposal, which we and other market participants are still digesting. And I'm expecting that not only CME Group, but certainly others will be taking the opportunity to comment rather extensively on those proposals. In general, at the moment, I do think it's not likely that the proposals, we understand them, will have any kind of significant impact on trading volumes or open interest, and so from that perspective, we're viewing that favorably.

I’m pleased to be speaking to you today from a really different place both in the macroeconomic sense, and certainly from CME’s perspective than we found ourselves during the first quarter last year.To begi",1272,"Good morning and thank you for joining us. I’m pleased to be speaking to you today from a really different place both in the macroeconomic sense, and certainly from CME’s perspective than we found ourselves during the first quarter last year.
To begin with first quarter volumes tell a positive and compelling story with 12% growth in average daily volume and a 24% increase in open interest since Q1 ’09. With the exception of equities exchange-traded volumes by asset class are up by double digit percentages from first quarter last year. April ADV of 11.6 million contracts is strong, and up from the first quarter. This notable as April has traditionally been one of the slowest months for us. Interest rates were up 33% in Q1, and this month’s volume is up 64% compared to last April.
Recognizing that Q1 ’09 was an extremely depressed volume environment for interest rates, we are very pleased with these growth percentages, but also continue to look forward for potential indicators of ongoing growth.
To that end, we continue to believe that the growing inventory of treasuries will need to be hedged in a more volatile interest rate environment. The expectation for treasury issuance this year is $2.3 trillion, up 7% from $2.1 trillion in 2009.
In addition, the Federal Reserve officially ended its $1.25 trillion program to purchase mortgage-backed securities, a plan that was one of the single largest initiatives ever undertaken by the federal government to support the US economy.
In terms of trading activity, the Fed’s participation in this market restrained hedging and futures trading as they acted to keep the mortgage market range bound. Additionally, Eurodollars have historically been used to express opinions about future Fed activity, and expectations are for a more active Fed once the zero interest rate policy draws to a close.
CME Group’s Fed funds futures are currently reflecting a 34% probability of a rate hike by September, a 52% probability of an increase in November, and a 68% increase by December. As we have mentioned before, we have seen the depth of our central limit order book significantly expand in many product areas and our average bid-ask spread has tightened, particularly in interest rates since the credit crisis.
Slide eight shows the growing liquidity available on our treasury and Eurodollar markets along with other products. The recently announced interest rate offerings from other exchanges and consortiums have captured some headlines. However, our focus has been and will continue to be fostering liquidity in our markets, which supports customer trading, helps us attract new customers and reduces overall trading costs.
Equities have been challenged in the first quarter by the weight of decreasing volatility, a slow upward rise in equity values, and difficult comparables in Q1 ’09. Low volatility has impacted the cash equities market and other futures products, such as the EURO STOXX and FTSE.
However, we have had two days over the last few weeks including this Wednesday when equity volumes exceeded 4.5 million contracts, so as equity markets become less range bound we would expect these volumes to rise as well.
In addition, we’re very pleased with the success we’ve had increasing the volume and revenue contributions from other asset classes. The FX asset class had a record revenue quarter and energy and metals were near peak from a revenue perspective. Taken together, revenue from these three asset classes was up 18% from Q1 ’09. Trends in these products during the month of April continued to show strong strength with volume up 45% compared with April last year.
I would like to now provide you with an update on our globalization strategy as this past quarter has been a very active period for us with a number of significant accomplishments. Our globalization strategy is primarily oriented to expanding our core businesses and building deep liquidity in our products 24 hours a day.
We have a multipronged effort which includes expanding our own global sales force and technology distribution, and by also partnering with leading exchanges and markets where we see high growth potential.
The partnerships allow us to accelerate our market penetration, expand our customer reach, and develop our product sales channels with local brokers. Nearly all of our products are global benchmarks that have universal appeal to customers, both domestically and internationally. We are selectively adding sales and marketing staff in the EMEA, Latin American, and Asian markets, and we now have 50 sales and marketing and business development employees outside of the US contributing to our strong progress and future growth potential in these markets.
In the first quarter, we enhanced the liquidity and volume in our core products and markets during non-US trading hours in order to better serve our European and Asian customers, which you can see on slide 10. Volumes on CME Globex during these periods grew 58% compared to Q1 ’09, with volume during European hours up 55%, and during Asian hours 75%.
Another way we measure our progress is to look at volume processed through our eight international telecommunications hubs. These low-cost, high reliability services continue to generate excellent results in our core business. Volumes through these hubs represented 12% of our overall electronic volume in Q1, up from 10% in Q1 ’09, and the hub volumes grew 35% versus the prior year, faster than our overall volume growth rate.
We are focusing on core growth in global markets, because we fundamentally believe that Asia, Latin America, and other emerging markets will experience superior economic and financial markets growth over the next decade compared with the more mature North American and European markets.
Slide 11 shows expected GDP growth rates in countries around the world between now and 2020. As I mentioned, our approach also includes launching or partnering with premier exchanges to launch more foreign products on the CME Globex platform that are attractive to our international customers. In recent months, we have been very active and successful in expanding the range of foreign products to be traded on or accessed through the CME Globex platform, including five of the world’s most actively traded equity futures contracts, the Brazilian iBovespa, the Korean KOSPI 200, the Indian Nifty 50, the Mexican IPC, and trading hours extension of our already successful Japanese Nikkei 225 contract.
Also two of the world’s most actively traded interest rate products, the Brazilian overnight interest rate contract and Mexican bond futures. And finally, all of the Malaysian and Dubai derivatives products, including the benchmark crude palm oil contract and the Oman sour crude contracts.
Our efforts to globalize our business are in an early stage, but we are encouraged by our progress to-date reflected in both the current volume numbers and the quality of the firms with whom we have partnered. Based on our track record of helping our partners prosper, we believe we are well positioned to maximize the revenue generated from the trading of our entire suite of CME Group products.
In conclusion, volume and open interest in all of our business segments with the exception of equities is considerably stronger than a year ago with double-digit growth from year ago levels.
Second, we continue to focus intently on growing our core businesses through expanding our distribution, global client acquisition, new product development, and further enhancing the technology and clearing services we provide our customers.
Finally, we believe that financial services regulatory reform will likely serve as a positive catalyst for both our core business results as well as our growth initiatives in OTC clearing services.
Now, I’d like to turn it over to Terry to discuss recent developments in this area.

I’d like to update you on the most recent developments with regulatory reform. In general, the focus continues to be consumer protection and increasing transparency and safety and soundness in the OTC derivatives market. Our transparent and regulated exchange markets continue to be the model that market users and policymakers are looking to in crafting new legislation. The following is an overview of the House and Senate derivatives provisions. Of course, the legislation process is not yet final, and these provisions as well as others could be changed as the process continues.
With respect to futures markets, the current draft bill generally provides for limited changes. First; the House bill requires the CFTC to establish position limits for physical commodities and limit exemptions to pure commercial hedgers.
It also requires that the CFTC’s position on this apply simultaneously to OTC participants and foreign boards of trade. The Senate version requires that the CFTC to establish aggregate position limits across markets for contracts based on the same underlying commodity, but preserves the authority of exchanges and swap execution facilities to establish position limits that are not higher than the maximum limits set by the CFTC. The Senate version does not limit hedge exemptions to commercial hedgers.
Apart from the draft bills, the CFTC has already proposed a position limits regime for energy markets. We continue to oppose position limits on US futures markets until such time as the Commission has imposed similar requirements on foreign boards of trade, exempt commercial markets, and OTC market participants.
Second; both the House and Senate versions propose extensive changes for the OTC markets. All swaps listed for clearing by a clearing house would be required to be cleared, as well as traded on exchanges or swap execution facilities pursuant to CFTC rules and procedures. The Senate bill would extend this requirement to foreign exchange swaps.
Both the House and Senate bills include exemptions for end users. The House bill provides an automatic exemption for legitimate hedging by parties that are not swap dealers or major swap participants. The Senate version is more limited, applying only to commercial end users hedging their own commercial risks. The Senate language provides that in the case of clear swaps between either swap dealers or major swap participants and financial entities, the financial entity has the sole right to select the clearing house at which the swap will be clear. The House bill does not include such a provision. Also, the Senate version provides that even where a swap is not required to be clearer, a financial entity or end user counterparty to such a swap can elect to have the swap cleared and has the sole right to select the clearing house at which the swap will be cleared. The House bill does not include this provision.
Both the House and the Senate language require that clearing houses must provide for open access and non-discriminatory clearing of a swap executed at an unaffiliated platform. Unlike the House bill, the Senate version stipulates that a clearing house is not required to clear any swap that adversely effects its business operations or financial position or which could pose systemic risk to the clearing house. The Senate language requires banks to spin off swap dealing activities or forego Federal protection such as deposit insurance or access to the Fed discount window. The House bill does not include such a requirement.
The Senate language prohibits Federal assistance to swap dealers. Major swap participants are exchanges and clearing houses.
This provision is counter to the Senate Banking Committee language reported in March that grants clearing houses the ability to seek loans from the Federal Reserve. The House bill does not preclude the Federal Reserve from providing assistance to clearing houses or exchanges.
Under both the House and Senate provisions, swap dealers and major swap participants will be subject to registration, recordkeeping and reporting rules, as well as capital and margin requirements.
Finally, customized non-standardized swaps would not be subject to the mandatory clearing requirement, but would be subject to higher capital requirements. While we have urged lawmakers to adopt capital and other incentives to encourage the adoption of central counterparty clearing service systems for OTC derivates versus mandatory requirements, we nevertheless believe the draft legislation will be a positive catalyst for our various OTC clearing services initiatives in interest rate swaps, OTC, FX, and credit default swaps.
We believe that our expertise in clearing, our strong financial safeguard systems, and our substantial portfolio and cross-margining capabilities, makes us well positioned to work with the swap market participants to develop clearing services that meet their needs as the OTC business evolves.
Before I turn the call over to Jamie, I would just like to note that the Senate did vote last night with the motion to proceed, so we will begin to see the debate on the Senate floor on the regulatory reform package. Jamie?

Rather this quarter we will provide our results on a GAAP basis only, and explain any unusual items which are included.

These three items increased net income by less than $2 million. Additionally, first quarter 2010 figures include the results of Dow Jones indexes beginning March 19th and there is a new line in the income statement and balance sheet related to the Dow Jones, Inc. minority interest in the CME Group Index Services business.

We also now show a new category, which is the volume from corporate participants for those we can track, with the remainder of these types of users falling in with the rest of the non-member customer category.
Slide 15 shows this new breakdown going back to the second quarter of 2009, which is as far back as the NYMEX data is available on a comparable basis. Sequentially, we saw an increase in the bank dealer and buy-side [prop] percentages, while the individual member percentage decreased.
The overall pro forma rate per contracts for all CME Group volume decreased 2% to $0.821 compared with $0.839 in the first quarter 2009, primarily due to an increase in our lower priced interest rate contracts to 44% of total volume from 37% a year ago. Sequentially, the rate per contract decreased $0.028 from $0.849 to $0.821 also due to product mix shift. We experienced higher volume from our lower priced interest rate and currency contracts, and a smaller percentage of volume originating from the ClearPort products. Additionally, the proportion of contracts traded by members increased slightly from Q4 2009 to Q1 2010.
Some of you may have noticed the decrease in our rolling three month RPC from February to March. This was driven primarily by a higher mix of member trades in the month of March versus the month of December, as member trading grew at 23%, and non-member trading grew at 9% between these two periods.
Market data revenue of $88 million for the quarter was up 7% sequentially, driven by a price increase and slightly offset by lower professional screen count. At the end of the first quarter, users subscribed to 386,000 base devices across CME, CBOT, and NYMEX, down 10% versus Q1 of last year, and down 3% sequentially.
We had a professional screen fee increase from $55 to $61 per month beginning in January of 2010. In addition, we booked $1.1 million in this category related to the Dow business during the first quarter.
I’ll now take a few minutes to review expenses. Total operating expenses were $279 million for Q1, which included $10 million in professional fees this quarter for banker and legal fees related to negotiating and closing the Dow Jones transaction. Drilling into Q1 expenses, compensation and benefits was $98.8 million, up $9.8 million from the prior quarter. This increase was due primarily to higher base comp and benefits, resulting from a $7 million sequential increase in the vacation accrual and FICA expenses and $1 million related to merit and promotion increases. Our combined headcount at the end of Q1 stood at 2,415, an increase of 25 people since the beginning of the year, plus the impact of 130 related to the Dow Jones transaction. We expect to add more resources in the coming year to support our core and non-core growth initiatives. Our first quarter bonus expense was $13 million, basically in line with target 2010 annual bonus guidance we gave of $54 million. Non-compensation expenses totaled $180 million or $170 million excluding the Dow transaction cost I mentioned earlier. Excluding the Dow, this is roughly flat versus Q4 2009.
Q1 operating income was $415 million, the high watermark since Q3 of 2008. During the first quarter, our operating margin was 60% or more than 61% excluding the Dow transaction related expenses. In the non-operating income and expense category on the investment income line, we received a $9.4 million dividend from BM&F Bovespa. Also interest expense increased due to the $612.5 million of additional debt we incurred for the Dow transaction. The normalized interest expense including the Dow-related debt is expected to trend from $38 million in Q2 to $34 million in Q4 as we plan to pay down $300 million of debt due in August. The detail related to our debt structure is available on slide 18.
In addition, as I mentioned earlier, during Q1 we had a $6 million gain from a settlement related to a currency hedge we had with Lehman. During the quarter, we repurchased 935,000 shares of CME stock, totaling $282 million at an average price of $301.25. As part of our announced transaction with BM&F Bovespa, which Craig spoke about earlier, we plan to issue them 2.2 million shares at the close of the transaction following regulatory approval, which we expect in the June-July timeframe.
For the quarter, our effective tax rate was 39.8%, which was lower than normal due to a favorable adjustment of $6 million related to the deductibility of merger cost related to the CBOT transaction. For the full year 2010, we expect an effective rate of between 41% and 42%. Capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowances, totaled $26 million in the first quarter driven primarily by hardware and software attributed to migration of trading systems to our new datacenter as well as continued build out in our office facilities.
Since we provided our previous expense guidance of $1.1 billion of full-year 2010 expense, we’ve completed the Dow transaction, which added $10 million of transaction related expense plus approximately $21 million in terms of 2010 operating expenses. For modeling purposes, the ongoing quarterly net impact on expenses related to Dow is approximately $7 million with increases spread primarily across compensation, amortization, and professional fees, and a reduction in license fees.
In addition, our share of the multi-asset class trading platform we are building with BM&FBOVESPA is expected to result in $10 million of expense in 2010, which will likely be offset in revenue from our partner. So with the addition of these recently announced transactions, we now expect full year expense of $1.13 billion to $1.14 billion. In summary, we have started the year with strong improvement in our top line and bottom line results, relative to a challenging environment in 2009. So far in April, we are averaging 11.6 million contracts per day, up 24%, despite counting Good Friday with its limited trading of 3.3 million contracts. Excluding that day, our average daily volume is up more than 30% in April versus the prior year.
We will now open up the call to your questions but in order to get to everyone, we are limiting all of you to one question and one follow-up, and then please feel free to get back in the queue if time permits.

So there’s some variety of options for people to post collateral with us. The other thing I would want to point out is that you mentioned the rate swaps and if the rate swaps came into the CME clearing house, you have to remember that the primary hedge for people who are using interest rate swaps is actually our Eurodollar futures. And so it’s very likely that combining those two pools of activity in the same clearing house would actually result overall in a substantial decrease in the amount of collateral that is required. So, I think there’s couple of elements there to factor into your thoughts.

From kind of that longer-term trend that we talked about starting last summer is you’re starting to see the interest rate differential between some of the high yielding currencies and some of the G-7 currencies are so wide, you’ve seen on a percentage basis things like the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, British pound, on a percentage basis really increase over the last year. So the other thing obviously that’s happening, and why the euro currency is trading so much is obviously to sovereign debt crisis, and in Europe, in the southern part of Europe. So, those are the kind of the macro drivers. We are actually seeing more participants in the markets. We’ve seen some of the people that had probably diminished their activity during the crisis, come back to the market in a bigger way. So we have been able to pick up some share there. And so it continues to be a good growth area for us. As far as RPC, I mean, I think if you look at this over the longer term, if you look at it over the last 10 years, you’ll get 2001 EFPs are about 31% of our volume. And if you look where we are now, it’s about 2% of our volume, and obviously the RPC on those EFPs were extremely high. That’s something we’ve been talking about for a number of years. As liquidity increases on the platform, there is less need to do those EFPs. So we’ve successfully taken that market from kind of what transparent market to a perfectly transparent market.

I'm pleased to be speaking to you today from a really different place, both in the macroeconomic sense and certainly from CME's perspective than we found ourselves during the first quarter last year. To begin",1279,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to be speaking to you today from a really different place, both in the macroeconomic sense and certainly from CME's perspective than we found ourselves during the first quarter last year. 
To begin with, first quarter volumes tell a positive and compelling story with 12% growth in average daily volume and a 24% increase in open interest since Q1 '09. With the exception of equities, exchange traded volumes by asset class are up by double-digit percentages from first quarter last year. April ADV [Average Daily Volume] of 11.6 million contract is strong and up from the first quarter. This is notable as April has traditionally been one of the slowest months for us. 
Interest rates were up 33% in Q1 and this month's volume is up 64% compared to last April. Recognizing that Q1 '09 was an extremely depressed volume environment for interest rates, we are very pleased with these growth percentages, but also continue to look forward for potential indicators of ongoing growth. 
To that end, we continue to believe that the growing inventory of treasuries will need to be hedged in a more volatile interest rate environment. The expectations for treasury issuance this year is $2.3 trillion, up 7% from $2.1 trillion in 2009. 
In addition, the Federal Reserve officially ended its $1.25 trillion program to purchase mortgage-backed securities, a plan that was one of the single largest initiatives ever undertaken by the Federal government to support the U.S. economy.  
In terms of trading activity, the Fed's participation in this market restrained hedging and futures trading as they acted to keep the mortgage market range bound. Additionally, Eurodollars have historically been used to express opinions about future Fed activity, and expectations are for a more active Fed once the zero interest rate policy draws to close. 
CME Group's Fed funds futures are currently reflecting a 34% probability of a rate hike by September, a 52% probability of an increase in November and a 68% increase by December. As we have mentioned before, we have seen the depth of our central limit order book significantly expand in many product areas and our average bid-ask spread has tightened, particularly in interest rates since the credit crisis. 
Slide 8 shows the growing liquidity available on our treasury and Eurodollar markets along with other products. The recently announced interest rate offerings from other exchanges and consortiums have captured some headlines. However, our focus has been and will continue to be fostering liquidity in our markets, which supports customer trading, helps us attract new customers and reduces overall trading costs. 
Equities have been challenged in the first quarter by the weight of decreasing volatility, a slow upward rise in equity values and difficult comparables in Q1 '09. Low volatility has impacted the cash equities markets and other futures products, such as the EURO STOXX and FTSE. 
However, we have had two days over the last few weeks, including this Wednesday when equity volumes exceeded 4.5 million contracts. So as equity markets become less range bound, we would expect these volumes to rise as well. 
In addition, we're very pleased with the success we've had increasing the volume and revenue contributions from other asset classes. The FX asset class had a really record revenue quarter and energy and metals were near peak from a revenue perspective. Taken together, revenue from these three asset classes was up 18% from Q1 '09. Trends in these products during the month of April continue to show strong strength with volume up 45% compared with April last year. 
I would like to now provide you with an update on our globalization strategy as this past quarter has been a very active period for us with a number of significant accomplishments. Our globalization strategy is primarily oriented to expanding our core businesses and building deep liquidity in our products 24 hours a day. 
We have a multi-pronged effort which includes expanding our own global sales force and technology distribution, and by also partnering with leading exchanges and markets where we see high growth potential. The partnerships allow us to accelerate our market penetration, expand our customer reach and develop our product sales channels with local brokers. Nearly all of our products are global benchmarks that have universal appeal to customers, both domestically and internationally. 
We are selectively adding sales and marketing staff in the EMEA, Latin American and Asian markets, and we now have 50 sales and marketing and business development employees outside of the U.S., contributing to our strong progress and future growth potential in these markets. 
In the first quarter, we enhanced the liquidity and volume in our core products and markets during non-U.S. trading hours in order to better serve our European and Asian customers, which you can see on Slide 10. Volumes on CME Globex during these periods grew 58% compared to Q1 '09, with volume during European hours up 55% during Asian hours and during Asian hours 75%. 
Another way we measure our progress is to look at volume processed through our eight international telecommunications hubs. These low-cost, high-reliability services continue to generate excellent results in our core business. Volumes through these hubs represented 12% of our overall electronic volume in Q1, up from 10% in Q1 '09. And the hub volumes grew 35% versus the prior year, faster than our overall volume growth rate. 
We are focusing on core growth in global markets, because we fundamentally believe that Asia, Latin America and other emerging markets will experience superior economic and financial markets growth over the next decade compared with the more mature North American and European markets. Slide 11 shows expected GDP growth rates in countries around the world between now and 2020. 
As I mentioned, our approach also includes launching or partnering with premier exchanges to launch more foreign products on the CME Globex platform that are attractive to our international customers. In recent months, we have been very active and successful in expanding the range of foreign products to be traded on or accessed through the CME Globex platform, including five of the world's most actively traded equity futures contracts, the Brazilian Ibovespa, the Korean KOSPI 200, the Indian Nifty 50, the Mexican IPC and the trading hours extension of our already successful Japanese Nikkei 225 contract. 
Also, two of the world's most actively traded interest rate products, the Brazilian overnight interest rate contract and Mexican bond futures. And finally, all of the Malaysian and Dubai derivatives products, including the benchmark crude palm oil contract and the Oman sour crude contracts. 
Our efforts to globalize our business are in an early stage, but we are encouraged by our progress to date, reflected in both the current volume numbers and the quality of the firms with whom we have partnered. Based on our track record of helping our partners prosper, we believe we are well-positioned to maximize the revenue generated from the trading of our entire suite of CME Group products. 
In conclusion, volume and open interest in all of our business segments, with the exception of equities is considerably stronger than a year ago, with double-digit growth from year-ago levels. 
Second, we continue to focus intently on growing our core businesses through expanding our distribution, global client acquisition, new product development and further enhancing the technology and clearing services we provide our customers. 
Finally, we believe that financial services regulatory reform will likely serve as a positive catalyst for both our core business results, as well as our growth initiatives in the OTC clearing services. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Terry to discuss recent developments in this area."
2004577,99577667,58765,"CME Group Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Craig. I'd like to update you on the most recent developments with regulatory reform.

I'd like to update you on the most recent developments with regulatory reform. In general, the focus continues to be consumer protection and increasing transparency and safety and soundness in the OTC derivatives market. Our transparent and regulated exchange markets continues to be the model that market users and policymakers are looking to in crafting new legislation. 
The following is an overview of the House and Senate derivatives provisions. Of course, the legislation process is not yet final, and these provisions as well as others could be changed as the process continues. 
With respect to futures markets, the current draft bill generally provides for limited changes. First, the House bill requires the CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] to establish position limits for physical commodities and limits exemptions to pure commercial hedges. It also requires that the CFTC's position on the supply simultaneously to OTC participants and foreign boards of trade. 
The Senate version requires that the CFTC to establish aggregate position limits across markets for contracts based on the same underlying commodity, but preserves the authority of exchanges and swap execution facilities to establish position limits that are not higher than the maximum limits set by the CFTC. The Senate version does not limit hedge exceptions to commercial hedgers. 
Apart from the draft bill, the CFTC has already proposed the position limits regime for energy markets. We continue to oppose position limits and U.S. futures markets until such time as the Commission has imposed similar requirements on foreign boards of trade, exempt commercial markets and OTC market participants. 
Second, both the House and Senate versions proposed extensive changes for the OTC markets. All swaps listed for clearing by a clearing house would be required to be cleared, as well as traded on exchanges or swap execution facilities pursuant to CFTC rules and procedures. The Senate bill would extend this requirement to foreign exchange swaps.  Both the House and Senate bills include exemptions for end users. 
The House bill provides an automatic exception for legitimate hedging by parties that are not swap dealers or major swap participants. The Senate version is more limited, applying only to commercial end users, hedging their own commercial risks. The Senate language provides that in the case of clear swaps between either swap dealers or major swap participants and financial entities, the financial entity has the sole right to select the clearing house at which the swap will be clear. The House bill does not include such a provision. Also, the Senate version provides that even where a swap is not required to be cleared, a financial entity or end user counterparty to such a swap can elect to have the swap cleared and has the sole right to select a clearing house at which the swap will be cleared. The House bill does not include this provision. 
Both the House and the Senate language require that clearing houses must provide for open access and non-discriminatory clearing of those swap executed at an unaffiliated platform. Unlike the House bill, the Senate version stipulates that a clearing house is not required to clear any swap that adversely effects its business operations or financial position, or which could pose systemic risk to the clearing house. 
The Senate language requires banks to spin off swap dealing activities or forego Federal protection, such as deposit and insurance or access to the Fed discount window. The House bill does not include such a requirement. The Senate language prohibits Federal assistance to swap dealers. Major swap participants or exchanges in clearing houses. 
This provision is countered to the Senate Banking Committee language reported in March that grants clearing houses the ability to seek loans from the Federal Reserve. The House bill does not preclude the Federal Reserve from providing assistance to clearing houses or exchanges. Under both the House and Senate provisions, swap dealers and major swap participants will be subject to registration, recordkeeping and reporting rules, as well as capital and margin requirements. 
Finally, customized non-standardized swaps would not be subject to the mandatory clearing requirements, but would be subject to higher capital requirements.  While we have urged lawmakers to adopt capital and other incentives to encourage the adoption of central counterparty clearing service systems for OTC derivatives versus mandatory requirements, we nevertheless believe the draft legislation will be a positive catalyst for our various OTC clearing services initiatives in interest rates swaps, OTC, FX and credit default swaps. 
We believe that our expertise in clearing, our strong financial safeguard systems and our substantial portfolio and cross-margining capabilities makes us well-positioned to work with the swap market participants to develop clearing services that meet their needs as the OTC business evolves. 
Before I turn the call over to Jamie, I would just like to note that the Senate did vote last night with a motion to proceed, so we will begin to see the debate on the Senate floor on the regulatory reform package. Jamie?"
2004577,99577667,58765,"CME Group Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. CME Group turned in a strong first quarter financial performance as average daily volume climbed to 11.5 million contracts per day, up from the 10.1 million to 10.3 million ADV range we experienced in each quarter last year, and up 12% c",1310,"Thank you, Terry. CME Group turned in a strong first quarter financial performance as average daily volume climbed to 11.5 million contracts per day, up from the 10.1 million to 10.3 million ADV range we experienced in each quarter last year, and up 12% compared to the first quarter 2009. We generated $693 million in revenue and operating expenses were up 5% sequentially. This resulted in $415 million of operating income and diluted earnings per share of $3.62. 
Since we completed the NYMEX integration in the fourth quarter last year, we are no longer providing pro forma comparisons. Rather, this quarter, we will provide our results on a GAAP basis only, and explain any unusual items which are included. First quarter 2010 results did include $6 million in non-operating income for the recovery of a bankruptcy claim, and a $6 million reduction in certain tax reserves, offset primarily by $10 million of professional fees related to establishing the company's joint venture with Dow Jones. 
These three items increased net income by less than $2 million. Additionally, first quarter 2010 figures include the results of Dow Jones indexes beginning March 19, and there's a new line in the income statement and balance sheet related to the Dow Jones minority interest in the CME Group Index Services business. 
Turning to customer segmentation, we made some enhancements to the data we provided last year by adding in the NYMEX user data and allocating the other member total more precisely to other categories, including individual members, hedge funds, et cetera. We also now show a category, which is the volume from corporate participants for those we can track, with the remainder of these types of users falling in with the rest of the non-member customer categories. 
Slide 15 shows this new breakdown going back to the second quarter of 2009, which is as far back as the NYMEX data is available on a comparable basis. Sequentially, we saw an increase in the bank dealer and the buy-side trough [ph] (24:28) percentages, while the individual member percentage decreased. 
The overall pro forma rate per contracts for all CME Group volume decreased 2% to $0.821 compared with $0.839 in the first quarter 2009, primarily due to an increase in our lower priced interest rate contract to 44% of total volume from 37% a year ago. Sequentially, the rate per contract decreased $0.028 from $0.849 to $0.821 also due to product mix shift. We experienced higher volume from our lower priced interest rate and currency contracts, and a smaller percentage of volume originating from the ClearPort products. Additionally, the proportion of contracts traded by members increased slightly from Q4 2009 to Q1 2010. 
Some of you may have noticed the decrease in our rolling three-month RPC from February to March. This was driven primarily by a higher mix of member trades in the month of March versus the month of December, as member trading grew at 23%, and non-member trading grew at 9% between these two periods. 
Market data revenue of $88 million for the quarter was up 7% sequentially, driven by a price increase and slightly offset by lower professional screen count. At the end of the first quarter, users subscribed to 386,000 base devices across CME, CBOT and NYMEX, down 10% versus Q1 of last year and down 3% sequentially. We had a professional screen fee increase from $55 to $61 per month beginning in January of 2010. In addition, we booked $1.1 million in this category related to the Dow business during the first quarter. 
I'll now take a few minutes to review expenses. Total operating expenses were $279 million for Q1, which included $10 million in professional fees this quarter for banker and legal fees related to negotiating and closing the Dow Jones transaction.  Drilling into Q1 expenses, compensation and benefits was $98.8 million, up $9.8 million from the prior quarter. This increase was due primarily to higher base comp and benefits, resulting from a $7 million sequential increase in the vacation accrual and FICA expenses and $1 million related to merit and promotion increases. Our combined headcount at the end of Q1 stood at 2,415, an increase of 25 people since the beginning of the year, plus the impact of 130 related to the Dow Jones transaction. We expect to add more resources in the coming year to support our core and non-core growth initiatives. 
Our first quarter bonus expense was $13 million, basically in line with target, 2010 annual bonus guidance we gave of $54 million. Non-compensation expenses totaled $180 million or $170 million, excluding the Dow transaction cost I mentioned earlier. Excluding the Dow, this is roughly flat versus Q4 2009. Q1 operating income was $415 million, the high watermark since Q3 of 2008. During the first quarter, our operating margin was 60% or more than 61%, excluding the Dow transaction related expense. 
In the non-operating income and expense category, on the investment income line, we received a $9.4 million dividend from BM&FBOVESPA. Also, interest expense increased due to the $612.5 million of additional debt we incurred for the Dow transaction. The normalized interest expense, including the Dow-related debt is expected to trend from $38 million in Q2 to $34 million in Q4 as we plan to pay down $300 million of debt due in August. The detail related to our debt structure is available on Slide 18. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, during Q1, we had a $6 million gain from a settlement related to currency hedge we had with Lehman. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 935,000 shares of CME stock, totaling $282 million at an average price of $301.25. As part of our announced transaction with BM&FBOVESPA, which Craig spoke about earlier, we plan to issue them 2.2 million shares at the close of the transaction following regulatory approval, which we expect in the June, July time frame. 
For the quarter, our effective tax rate was 39.8%, which was lower than normal due to a favorable adjustment of $6 million related to the deductibility of merger cost related to the CBOT transaction. For the full year 2010, we expect an effective rate of between 41% and 42%. Capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowances, totaled $26 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by hardware and software attributed to migration of trading systems to our new data center, as well as continued build out in our office facilities. 
Since we provided our previous expense guidance of $1.1 billion, a full year 2010 expense, we have completed the Dow transaction, which added $10 million of transaction-related expense, plus approximately $21 million in terms of 2010 operating expenses. For modeling purposes, the ongoing quarterly net impact on expenses related to Dow is approximately $7 million with increases spread primarily across compensation, amortization and professional fees and a reduction in license fees. 
In addition, our share of the multi-asset class trading platform we are building with BM&FBOVESPA is expected to result in $10 million of expense in 2010, which will likely be offset in revenue from our partner. So with the addition of these recently announced transactions, we now expect full year expense of $1.13 billion to $1.14 billion. 
In summary, we have started the year with strong improvement in our top line and bottom line results, relative to a challenging environment in 2009. So far in April, we are averaging 11.6 million contracts per day, up 24%, despite counting Good Friday with its limited trading of 3.3 million contracts. Excluding that day, our average daily volume is up more than 30% in April versus the prior year.

And I guess the question is in regards to either your current negotiations on say interest rate swap clearing or even as you go after CDS, where you have, it has the dealer volume right now. Do you think that, that changes the landscape where the dealers aren't going to be as powerful or have as much control, or where you don't have to negotiate 50-50 revenue sharing to get something like CDS?"

I mean from, kind of, a longer-term trend that we talked about starting last summer, as you're starting to see the interest rate differential between some of the high yielding currencies and some of the G7 currencies are so wide. You've seen on a percentage basis, things like the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, British pound, on a percentage basis, really increase over the last year or so. The other thing obviously, that's happening and why the euro currency is trading so much is obviously the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, in the southern part of Europe. So those are the kind of the macro drivers. We are actually seeing more participants in the markets. We've seen some of the people that had probably diminished their activity during the crisis come back to the market in a bigger way. So we have been able to pick up some share there. And so it continues to be a good growth area for us. As far as RPC, I mean I think if you look at this over the longer term, if you look at it over the last 10 years, if you look at 2001, the EFPs were about 31% of our volume. And if you look at where we are now, it's about 2% of our volume. And obviously, the RPC on those EFPs were extremely high. That's something we've been talking about for a number of years. As liquidity increases on the platform, there's less need to do those EFPs. So we've successfully taken that market from -- and kind of, what transparent market to a perfectly transparent market.

Because the capital requirements associated with centrally cleared over-the-counter derivatives are, I mean the Basel proposals that are out there are now are proposing a zero-risk weighting factor for the Counterparty Risk associated with using a Central Counterparty. So as more and more of that business moves to a Central Counterparty, that capital charges associated with it, will actually be significantly reduced. So there are some offsetting elements."

I'm pleased to be speaking to you today from a really different place, both in the macroeconomic sense and certainly from CME's perspective than we found ourselves during the first quarter last year. To begin",1279,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to be speaking to you today from a really different place, both in the macroeconomic sense and certainly from CME's perspective than we found ourselves during the first quarter last year. 
To begin with, first quarter volumes tell a positive and compelling story with 12% growth in average daily volume and a 24% increase in open interest since Q1 '09. With the exception of equities, exchange traded volumes by asset class are up by double-digit percentages from first quarter last year. April ADV [Average Daily Volume] of 11.6 million contract is strong and up from the first quarter. This is notable as April has traditionally been one of the slowest months for us. 
Interest rates were up 33% in Q1 and this month's volume is up 64% compared to last April. Recognizing that Q1 '09 was an extremely depressed volume environment for interest rates, we are very pleased with these growth percentages, but also continue to look forward for potential indicators of ongoing growth. 
To that end, we continue to believe that the growing inventory of treasuries will need to be hedged in a more volatile interest rate environment. The expectations for treasury issuance this year is $2.3 trillion, up 7% from $2.1 trillion in 2009. 
In addition, the Federal Reserve officially ended its $1.25 trillion program to purchase mortgage-backed securities, a plan that was one of the single largest initiatives ever undertaken by the Federal government to support the U.S. economy.  
In terms of trading activity, the Fed's participation in this market restrained hedging and futures trading as they acted to keep the mortgage market range bound. Additionally, Eurodollars have historically been used to express opinions about future Fed activity, and expectations are for a more active Fed once the zero interest rate policy draws to close. 
CME Group's Fed funds futures are currently reflecting a 34% probability of a rate hike by September, a 52% probability of an increase in November and a 68% increase by December. As we have mentioned before, we have seen the depth of our central limit order book significantly expand in many product areas and our average bid-ask spread has tightened, particularly in interest rates since the credit crisis. 
Slide 8 shows the growing liquidity available on our treasury and Eurodollar markets along with other products. The recently announced interest rate offerings from other exchanges and consortiums have captured some headlines. However, our focus has been and will continue to be fostering liquidity in our markets, which supports customer trading, helps us attract new customers and reduces overall trading costs. 
Equities have been challenged in the first quarter by the weight of decreasing volatility, a slow upward rise in equity values and difficult comparables in Q1 '09. Low volatility has impacted the cash equities markets and other futures products, such as the EURO STOXX and FTSE. 
However, we have had two days over the last few weeks, including this Wednesday when equity volumes exceeded 4.5 million contracts. So as equity markets become less range bound, we would expect these volumes to rise as well. 
In addition, we're very pleased with the success we've had increasing the volume and revenue contributions from other asset classes. The FX asset class had a really record revenue quarter and energy and metals were near peak from a revenue perspective. Taken together, revenue from these three asset classes was up 18% from Q1 '09. Trends in these products during the month of April continue to show strong strength with volume up 45% compared with April last year. 
I would like to now provide you with an update on our globalization strategy as this past quarter has been a very active period for us with a number of significant accomplishments. Our globalization strategy is primarily oriented to expanding our core businesses and building deep liquidity in our products 24 hours a day. 
We have a multi-pronged effort which includes expanding our own global sales force and technology distribution, and by also partnering with leading exchanges and markets where we see high growth potential. The partnerships allow us to accelerate our market penetration, expand our customer reach and develop our product sales channels with local brokers. Nearly all of our products are global benchmarks that have universal appeal to customers, both domestically and internationally. 
We are selectively adding sales and marketing staff in the EMEA, Latin American and Asian markets, and we now have 50 sales and marketing and business development employees outside of the U.S., contributing to our strong progress and future growth potential in these markets. 
In the first quarter, we enhanced the liquidity and volume in our core products and markets during non-U.S. trading hours in order to better serve our European and Asian customers, which you can see on Slide 10. Volumes on CME Globex during these periods grew 58% compared to Q1 '09, with volume during European hours up 55% during Asian hours and during Asian hours 75%. 
Another way we measure our progress is to look at volume processed through our eight international telecommunications hubs. These low-cost, high-reliability services continue to generate excellent results in our core business. Volumes through these hubs represented 12% of our overall electronic volume in Q1, up from 10% in Q1 '09. And the hub volumes grew 35% versus the prior year, faster than our overall volume growth rate. 
We are focusing on core growth in global markets, because we fundamentally believe that Asia, Latin America and other emerging markets will experience superior economic and financial markets growth over the next decade compared with the more mature North American and European markets. Slide 11 shows expected GDP growth rates in countries around the world between now and 2020. 
As I mentioned, our approach also includes launching or partnering with premier exchanges to launch more foreign products on the CME Globex platform that are attractive to our international customers. In recent months, we have been very active and successful in expanding the range of foreign products to be traded on or accessed through the CME Globex platform, including five of the world's most actively traded equity futures contracts, the Brazilian Ibovespa, the Korean KOSPI 200, the Indian Nifty 50, the Mexican IPC and the trading hours extension of our already successful Japanese Nikkei 225 contract. 
Also, two of the world's most actively traded interest rate products, the Brazilian overnight interest rate contract and Mexican bond futures. And finally, all of the Malaysian and Dubai derivatives products, including the benchmark crude palm oil contract and the Oman sour crude contracts. 
Our efforts to globalize our business are in an early stage, but we are encouraged by our progress to date, reflected in both the current volume numbers and the quality of the firms with whom we have partnered. Based on our track record of helping our partners prosper, we believe we are well-positioned to maximize the revenue generated from the trading of our entire suite of CME Group products. 
In conclusion, volume and open interest in all of our business segments, with the exception of equities is considerably stronger than a year ago, with double-digit growth from year-ago levels. 
Second, we continue to focus intently on growing our core businesses through expanding our distribution, global client acquisition, new product development and further enhancing the technology and clearing services we provide our customers. 
Finally, we believe that financial services regulatory reform will likely serve as a positive catalyst for both our core business results, as well as our growth initiatives in the OTC clearing services. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Terry to discuss recent developments in this area."

I'd like to update you on the most recent developments with regulatory reform. In general, the focus continues to be consumer protection and increasing transparency and safety and soundness in the OTC derivatives market. Our transparent and regulated exchange markets continues to be the model that market users and policymakers are looking to in crafting new legislation. 
The following is an overview of the House and Senate derivatives provisions. Of course, the legislation process is not yet final, and these provisions as well as others could be changed as the process continues. 
With respect to futures markets, the current draft bill generally provides for limited changes. First, the House bill requires the CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] to establish position limits for physical commodities and limits exemptions to pure commercial hedges. It also requires that the CFTC's position on the supply simultaneously to OTC participants and foreign boards of trade. 
The Senate version requires that the CFTC to establish aggregate position limits across markets for contracts based on the same underlying commodity, but preserves the authority of exchanges and swap execution facilities to establish position limits that are not higher than the maximum limits set by the CFTC. The Senate version does not limit hedge exceptions to commercial hedgers. 
Apart from the draft bill, the CFTC has already proposed the position limits regime for energy markets. We continue to oppose position limits and U.S. futures markets until such time as the Commission has imposed similar requirements on foreign boards of trade, exempt commercial markets and OTC market participants. 
Second, both the House and Senate versions proposed extensive changes for the OTC markets. All swaps listed for clearing by a clearing house would be required to be cleared, as well as traded on exchanges or swap execution facilities pursuant to CFTC rules and procedures. The Senate bill would extend this requirement to foreign exchange swaps.  Both the House and Senate bills include exemptions for end users. 
The House bill provides an automatic exception for legitimate hedging by parties that are not swap dealers or major swap participants. The Senate version is more limited, applying only to commercial end users, hedging their own commercial risks. The Senate language provides that in the case of clear swaps between either swap dealers or major swap participants and financial entities, the financial entity has the sole right to select the clearing house at which the swap will be cleared. The House bill does not include such a provision. Also, the Senate version provides that even where a swap is not required to be cleared, a financial entity or end user counterparty to such a swap can elect to have the swap cleared and has the sole right to select a clearing house at which the swap will be cleared. The House bill does not include this provision. 
Both the House and the Senate language require that clearing houses must provide for open access and non-discriminatory clearing of those swap executed at an unaffiliated platform. Unlike the House bill, the Senate version stipulates that a clearing house is not required to clear any swap that adversely affects its business operations or financial position, or which could pose systemic risk to the clearing house. 
The Senate language requires banks to spin off swap dealing activities or forego Federal protection, such as deposit and insurance or access to the Fed discount window. The House bill does not include such a requirement. The Senate language prohibits Federal assistance to swap dealers, major swap participants or exchanges in clearing houses. 
This provision is countered to the Senate Banking Committee language reported in March that grants clearing houses the ability to seek loans from the Federal Reserve. The House bill does not preclude the Federal Reserve from providing assistance to clearing houses or exchanges. Under both the House and Senate provisions, swap dealers and major swap participants will be subject to registration, recordkeeping and reporting rules, as well as capital and margin requirements. 
Finally, customized non-standardized swaps would not be subject to the mandatory clearing requirement, but would be subject to higher capital requirements.  While we have urged lawmakers to adopt capital and other incentives to encourage the adoption of central counterparty clearing service systems for OTC derivatives versus mandatory requirements, we nevertheless believe the draft legislation will be a positive catalyst for our various OTC clearing services initiatives in interest rates swaps, OTC, FX and credit default swaps. 
We believe that our expertise in clearing, our strong financial safeguard systems and our substantial portfolio and cross-margining capabilities makes us well-positioned to work with the swap market participants to develop clearing services that meet their needs as the OTC business evolves. 
Before I turn the call over to Jamie, I would just like to note that the Senate did vote last night with a motion to proceed, so we will begin to see the debate on the Senate floor on the regulatory reform package. Jamie?"
2004577,99577667,60928,"CME Group Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. CME Group turned in a strong first quarter financial performance as average daily volume climbed to 11.5 million contracts per day, up from the 10.1 million to 10.3 million ADV range we experienced in each quarter last year, and up 12% c",1309,"Thank you, Terry. CME Group turned in a strong first quarter financial performance as average daily volume climbed to 11.5 million contracts per day, up from the 10.1 million to 10.3 million ADV range we experienced in each quarter last year, and up 12% compared to the first quarter 2009. We generated $693 million in revenue and operating expenses were up 5% sequentially. This resulted in $415 million of operating income and diluted earnings per share of $3.62. 
Since we completed the NYMEX integration in the fourth quarter last year, we are no longer providing pro forma comparisons. Rather, this quarter, we will provide our results on a GAAP basis only, and explain any unusual items which are included. First quarter 2010 results did include $6 million in non-operating income for the recovery of a bankruptcy claim, and a $6 million reduction in certain tax reserves, offset primarily by $10 million of professional fees related to establishing the company's joint venture with Dow Jones. 
These three items increased net income by less than $2 million. Additionally, first quarter 2010 figures include the results of Dow Jones indexes beginning March 19, and there's a new line in the income statement and balance sheet related to the Dow Jones minority interest in the CME Group Index Services business. 
Turning to customer segmentation, we made some enhancements to the data we provided last year by adding in the NYMEX user data and allocating the other member total more precisely to other categories, including individual members, hedge funds, et cetera. We also now show a new category, which is the volume from corporate participants for those we can track, with the remainder of these types of users falling in with the rest of the non-member customer categories. 
Slide 15 shows this new breakdown going back to the second quarter of 2009, which is as far back as the NYMEX data is available on a comparable basis. Sequentially, we saw an increase in the bank dealer and the buy-side trough percentages, while the individual member percentage decreased. 
The overall pro forma rate per contracts for all CME Group volume decreased 2% to $0.821 compared with $0.839 in the first quarter 2009, primarily due to an increase in our lower priced interest rate contract to 44% of total volume from 37% a year ago. Sequentially, the rate per contract decreased $0.028 from $0.849 to $0.821 also due to product mix shift. We experienced higher volume from our lower priced interest rate and currency contracts, and a smaller percentage of volume originating from the ClearPort products. Additionally, the proportion of contracts traded by members increased slightly from Q4 2009 to Q1 2010. 
Some of you may have noticed the decrease in our rolling three-month RPC from February to March. This was driven primarily by a higher mix of member trades in the month of March versus the month of December, as member trading grew at 23%, and non-member trading grew at 9% between these two periods. 
Market data revenue of $88 million for the quarter was up 7% sequentially, driven by a price increase and slightly offset by lower professional screen count. At the end of the first quarter, users subscribed to 386,000 base devices across CME, CBOT and NYMEX, down 10% versus Q1 of last year and down 3% sequentially. We had a professional screen fee increase from $55 to $61 per month beginning in January of 2010. In addition, we booked $1.1 million in this category related to the Dow business during the first quarter. 
I'll now take a few minutes to review expenses. Total operating expenses were $279 million for Q1, which included $10 million in professional fees this quarter for banker and legal fees related to negotiating and closing the Dow Jones transaction.  Drilling into Q1 expenses, compensation and benefits was $98.8 million, up $9.8 million from the prior quarter. This increase was due primarily to higher base comp and benefits, resulting from a $7 million sequential increase in the vacation accrual and FICA expenses and $1 million related to merit and promotion increases. Our combined headcount at the end of Q1 stood at 2,415, an increase of 25 people since the beginning of the year, plus the impact of 130 related to the Dow Jones transaction. We expect to add more resources in the coming year to support our core and non-core growth initiatives. 
Our first quarter bonus expense was $13 million, basically in line with target, 2010 annual bonus guidance we gave of $54 million. Non-compensation expenses totaled $180 million or $170 million, excluding the Dow transaction cost I mentioned earlier. Excluding the Dow, this is roughly flat versus Q4 2009. Q1 operating income was $415 million, the high watermark since Q3 of 2008. During the first quarter, our operating margin was 60% or more than 61%, excluding the Dow transaction related expense. 
In the non-operating income and expense category, on the investment income line, we received a $9.4 million dividend from BM&FBOVESPA. Also, interest expense increased due to the $612.5 million of additional debt we incurred for the Dow transaction. The normalized interest expense, including the Dow-related debt is expected to trend from $38 million in Q2 to $34 million in Q4, as we plan to pay down $300 million of debt due in August. The detail related to our debt structure is available on Slide 18. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, during Q1, we had a $6 million gain from a settlement related to currency hedge we had with Lehman. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 935,000 shares of CME stock, totaling $282 million at an average price of $301.25. As part of our announced transaction with BM&FBOVESPA, which Craig spoke about earlier, we plan to issue them 2.2 million shares at the close of the transaction following regulatory approval, which we expect in the June, July time frame. 
For the quarter, our effective tax rate was 39.8%, which was lower than normal due to a favorable adjustment of $6 million related to the deductibility of merger cost related to the CBOT transaction. For the full year 2010, we expect an effective rate of between 41% and 42%. Capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowances, totaled $26 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by hardware and software attributed to migration of trading systems to our new data center, as well as continued build out in our office facilities. 
Since we provided our previous expense guidance of $1.1 billion, a full year 2010 expense, we have completed the Dow transaction, which added $10 million of transaction-related expense, plus approximately $21 million in terms of 2010 operating expenses. For modeling purposes, the ongoing quarterly net impact on expenses related to Dow is approximately $7 million with increases spread primarily across compensation, amortization and professional fees and a reduction in license fees. 
In addition, our share of the multi-asset class trading platform we are building with BM&FBOVESPA is expected to result in $10 million of expense in 2010, which will likely be offset in revenue from our partner. So with the addition of these recently announced transactions, we now expect full year expense of $1.13 billion to $1.14 billion. 
In summary, we have started the year with strong improvement in our top line and bottom line results, relative to a challenging environment in 2009. So far in April, we are averaging 11.6 million contracts per day, up 24%, despite counting Good Friday with its limited trading of 3.3 million contracts. Excluding that day, our average daily volume is up more than 30% in April versus the prior year.

We already hold a significant amount of collateral between $80 billion and $100 billion worth of collateral. And so we are very conscious of having programs that offers diversity. So there's some variety of options for people to post collateral with us. The other thing I would want to point out is that you mentioned the rate swaps. And if the rate swaps came in to the CME Clearing House, you have to remember that the primary hedge for people who are using interest rate swaps is actually our Eurodollar futures. And so it's very likely that combining those two pools of activity in the same clearing house would actually result overall in a substantial decrease in the amount of collateral that is required.

I mean from, kind of, a longer-term trend that we talked about starting last summer, as you're starting to see the interest rate differential between some of the high yielding currencies and some of the G7 currencies are so wide. You've seen on a percentage basis, things like the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, British pound, on a percentage basis, really increase over the last year or so. The other thing obviously, that's happening and why the euro currency is trading so much is obviously the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, in the southern part of Europe. So those are the kind of the macro drivers. We are actually seeing more participants in the markets. We've seen some of the people that had probably diminished their activity during the crisis come back to the market in a bigger way. So we have been able to pick up some share there. And so it continues to be a good growth area for us. As far as RPC, I mean I think if you look at this over the longer term, if you look at it over the last 10 years, if you look at 2001, the EFPs were about 31% of our volume. And if you look at where we are now, it's about 2% of our volume. And obviously, the RPC on those EFPs were extremely high. That's something we've been talking about for a number of years. As liquidity increases on the platform, there's less need to do those EFPs. So we've successfully taken that market from -- and kind of, what transparent market to a perfectly transparent market.

CME Group showed strong performance in the second quarter of 2010 with net income of $271 million, up 13% sequentially, on revenues of $814 million, up 17% sequentially. This strong performance, our best ever on",1657,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. CME Group showed strong performance in the second quarter of 2010 with net income of $271 million, up 13% sequentially, on revenues of $814 million, up 17% sequentially. This strong performance, our best ever on a GAAP basis, was driven by positive volume trends across all asset classes, with overall average daily volume of 13.5 million contracts, up 31% from Q2 '09 and up 17% from Q1 2010.
We had record revenue quarters in energy, foreign exchange and agricultural products. Additionally, interest rate revenues were up 29% from the second quarter last year and up 19% sequentially. And equity and metals volume and revenue were also strong for the quarter. 
As we’ve moved into July, we have experienced normal seasonal patterns, although it is worth pointing out that July average daily volume of 10.7 million contracts is up 11% versus July of last year and is 400,000 contracts per day higher than any quarterly ADV last year. Finally, volume across our six product areas is up for July compared to the same month last year. 
Looking at drivers of our performance, sovereign debt issues in Europe were obviously a catalyst for the second quarter volume. The stabilization we've seen since the peak of the crisis, as indicated by the plateau-ing of the LIBOR-OIS spread since May 25, among other factors, reflects favorably on the market’s ability to absorb shocks in the short-term and on the ability of local industry participants and central banks to recognize an attempt to resolve critical issues.
Partially related to the European crisis, the market shifted its Fed rate hike expectations. We have seen an associated shift in Eurodollar volumes, with those Eurodollar futures expiring 12 to 18 months from now contributing approximately 13% of overall Eurodollar futures volume in July, up 10% from the total in the first and second quarters.
We've highlighted before that Eurodollar products tend to be most heavily traded during periods with varying market expectations for rate changes. For the next several months, we expect Eurodollar volumes to reflect the current policy environment, and it is worth pointing out that transaction data positively reflects in certain key measures, such as depth of book and bid-ask spread, when compared to last year. 
CME Group energy products had an exceptional quarter, with record revenue and volumes. With volatility increasing due to ongoing forecasts for strong crude oil demand, coupled with European instability, our WTI products suite was a strong driver of this performance, boasting record volumes of 977,000 contracts per day, up 52% from Q2 '09 and up 25% from a robust first quarter.
Refined products, including heating oil and gasoline, also had record volumes for the quarter. Energy volumes in July have shown a typical seasonal slowdown, but we believe that our products in this area would continue to perform very well over the long term. 
I mentioned before that we had record revenues in our FX product line as well, and that was, of course, somewhat related to the European crisis. While cyclical factors may have impacted the second quarter volumes, we strongly believe there are many longer-running structural trends in those markets that have and will continue to be very positive for CME Group FX products. Based on the available data, one of these trends is an ongoing shift from OTC markets to CME's exchange-traded and centrally cleared FX products. Our team has worked diligently to position CME Group to take advantage of such structural shifts in the FX market place, and the volume trends over the past year show our success. CME's April volume was up 87% compared to the prior year, while in the OTC markets, as measured by preliminary regional data submitted to BIF, FX trading in the U.K. was up 31% for the same period. Activity in Japan was up 16%, and activity in the U.S. was up 43%, clearly demonstrating that we are picking up share as we outpace the growth of the overall market. 
As a side note, we're referencing April statistics there, because that is the most recent data that's available on those markets. But CME FX had strong growth since then as well, with July [audio gap] 37% from the prior July. We believe our FX team has built an exceptional platform for future growth opportunities. 
With that, I'd like to switch gears and talk a little bit about one of those opportunities in FX, and that is a new product we worked with our colleagues at Dow Jones indexes to launch. As planned, we’ve continued the Dow Jones indexing capability with the derivatives expertise and deep customer connections at CME Group. One of the early results of these efforts is our FX$INDEX futures, a contract that will provide a tool for trading the relative value of the U.S. dollar against a basket of major currencies, weighted based on current Fed data. The weighting methodology is unique to CME, and we believe it creates a strong competitive differentiator for this product. It also provides our customers with an efficient means for using the deeply liquid component currency futures to dynamically hedge FX$INDEX futures and, with our Globex distribution to FX markets participants, will enable us to attract a broad international audience. The product launched on Monday, and we are actively working to promote this to our customers. 
Additionally, our teams worked together to bring the Dow Jones long-term inflation index to market on July 15th, which uses the CME ultra-long treasury futures as an underlying component, along with long-term treasury inflation-protected securities. Like many of our product ideas, this product was developed based on significant customer input, and given the strong uptake and success of the ultra-long treasury futures, we know that market interest in longer-duration products is very high. We continue to explore other joint product development and global expansion opportunities, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the future.
We did a fairly deep dive last quarter on our international growth strategy, and we feel very positive about the work we're currently doing to build the path for future success. As you can see in our slide, in our core business, Globex volumes during non-U.S. hours saw strong growth, with volumes during European hours up 78% and volumes during Asian hours up 76% from Q2 '09. Volume from international telecommunications hubs grew 68% compared to the same quarter a year ago and represented 13% of overall Globex volume, up from 11% a year ago. 
I also want to take some time today to discuss our views on capital structure. Over the last few years, we've received valuable input from our shareholders on this important topic. We recently completed an internal assessment of our five-year strategy. We've successfully integrated the CBOT and NYMEX acquisitions, and with those assets in place, we believe we have a solid foundation to drive continued organic growth. In the near term, we do not foresee the need for additional large-scale M&A transactions to drive growth. Based on our projections, we anticipate being very well positioned to return excess cash to shareholders as early as next year. 
In the past, we have returned cash to our shareholders through regular quarterly dividends, special dividends and share buybacks, all of which we will thoroughly analyze as options for future return of cash. One of the results from our plan has been the establishment of capital structure guiding principles, which you can see on the next slide.
First, we intend to maintain a target level of cash to meet working capital requirements and our clearing house commitment. We anticipate a minimum cash level of approximately $500, million and success in our OTC initiatives would cause this amount to scale. Second, as we've stated in the past, our intention is to target a high investment-grade credit rating to demonstrate our solid financial position as a leader in the exchange and clearing industry. Third, we intend to pay a stable to growing dividend, and our board will assess that on an ongoing basis. Fourth, we have taken on debt primarily related to the NYMEX transaction, but we intend to maintain a permanent, prudent level of debt. Lastly, we intend to return excess capital in the form of dividends and share repurchases, as I mentioned early. 
Finally, I would like to share a few thoughts with you on the regulatory environment. We know that a key focus of our investors has been the ongoing developments in financial regulation, and we are fully supportive of the efforts made by all to bolster the soundness of the financial system. The passage of the Dodd-Frank Act reinforces the critical underpinnings of CME Group's markets: transparency and security. We’ve spent a lot of time in Washington over the years highlighting the value of our markets, and we will continue our efforts with government officials, regulators and market participants as the rulemaking process ensues. Throughout that process and in the timeframe following the adoption of new rules, we will be focusing very intensely on ensuring smooth implementation and providing maximum support to our customers.
In regards to direct quantifiable impacts on CME Group, we believe the new legislation is directionally positive. We look forward to engaging with our customers and regulators during this process, and in the long term, returning to what we do best: providing safe and secure, liquid and transparent markets for market participant. 
In conclusion, CME Group had strong results in the second quarter, and more importantly, we have continued to build a very strong base for future growth of our business. We have gotten where we are because of our focus on serving our customers, whether during times of high market volatility or times of sweeping change. As global financial markets evolve in the future, we are well-positioned to offer critical risk management products for our customers. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie."

Before I dive into the financials, I just wanted to note that the comments and comparisons I'll be making today will exclude the impacts of the Credit Markets Analysis, otherwise known as CMA, impairment discussed in the press release. 
CME Group turned in a strong second quarter financial performance, with average daily volume of 13.5 million contracts per day, up 31% from Q2 last year, and revenue of $814 million, up 26% from last year. From a GAAP perspective, this is the highest level of quarterly revenue we have delivered and only $3 million below Q1 of 2008, assuming we had owned NYMEX business at that point. 
We delivered $536 million of operating income and diluted earnings per share of $4.43, excluding CMA. From Q1 to Q2, our revenue grew $121 million while our expenses grew only $10 million, excluding the one-time Dow Jones transaction expense incurred in Q1. 
The overall average rate for contracts for all CME Group decreased 4% ,$0.79, compared with $0.823 in the second quarter 2009. So average daily volume was up 31% while the average rate was down 4%. The main driver of the year-over-year rate decrease was our member, non-member mix. Our lower-fee member volume grew 35% while non-member volume grew at 19%. Sequentially, the rate per contract also dropped 4%, primarily driven by a large increase in interest rate volumes, our lowest-rate product, from 5.1 million contracts per day in Q1 to 6.1 million contracts per day in Q2.
Market data revenue of $102 million for the quarter was up 17% compared to Q1. This increase is due to the inclusion of a full quarter of CME Group index services revenue. At the end of the second quarter, users of CME, CBOT and NYMEX data subscribed to 385,000 base devices. This count was down only 1,000 screens from the prior quarter, representing some stabilization relative to the trends we have seen since the credit crisis. 
And I'll take a few minutes to review expenses. Drilling into Q2, compensation and benefits was $103 million, up $4 million from the prior quarter. This increase was attributable to an increase in our bonus accrual due to strong cash earnings performance. Our combined headcount at the end of Q2 stood at 2,460, an increase of 50 people during the second quarter.
We reiterate our full-year expense guidance of $1.13 billion to $1.14 billion, excluding the CMA impairment, which implies second-half expense of $573 million to $583 million. 
Q2 operating income was $536 million, the high-water mark since Q1 of 2008. For the second quarter, our operating margin was 66%. In the non-operating income and expense category, on the investment income line, we recorded $5.5 million in dividends, down $4 million versus Q1. Also interest expense increased due to the full quarter impact of the $613 million of additional debt we incurred for the Dow Jones transaction.
In the second quarter, we paid down $300 million of commercial paper, bringing our total debt to $2.8 billion. We will be paying down our next maturity in August, bringing our debt down to $2.5 billion and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to approximately 1.3x. A detailed illustration of our debt structure is included in our earnings slides.
In the second quarter, we repurchased 46,000 CME Group shares. In addition, in the month of July, we repurchased more than 1 million shares of CME Group stocks totaling $279 million at an average price of $272 per share. As part of our announced transaction with BM&FBOVESPA, we issued to them $2.2 million CME Group shares on July 16 and received $607 million. So we have nearly offset the dilution associated with the share issuance. As Craig mentioned earlier, longer-term, we plan to return excess capital to shareholders in an efficient way beginning as early as next year. For the quarter, our effective tax rate was 41.7%, excluding the CME impairment. For the full year 2010, we expect an effective rate of between 41% and 42% on a GAAP basis.
Capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowances, totaled $28 million in the second quarter, driven primarily by hardware and software attributed to migration of trading systems to our new data center as well as continued build-out in our office facilities. Our full year guidance remains at $180 million to $200 million, with data center and facility build-out continuing in the second half of the year.
In summary, the second quarter was tremendous. We excelled on a top line and delivered virtually all of the incremental revenue to the bottom line. We look forward to leveraging our platform like this in the future and delivering profitable growth.

There will be some changes to that, but it may not be, in fact, very revolutionary or transformational.

There are different provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that apply to swaps clearing, and then the provision that I believe you're referring to is a provision that is intended to reduce the systemic risk potential of credit relationships between and among clearinghouses in the listed derivatives markets, maybe to begin with. So on the over-the-counter product side, there is what we call the kind of non-discriminatory open-access provision. And generally speaking, I mean, I think there’s a lot of confusion about those in the first instance in that they absolutely do not provide for inter-operability and fundability per se. It's probably a little bit too arcane to get into in this call. But that's the one side of it. And then the provision that you're referring to is limited to the listed derivative markets, and it really is intended to ensure that there isn't a kind of systemic-risk domino effect by forcing linkages between clearinghouses.

You'll probably remember that since the inception of the discussions about position limits in energy and metals markets, we've always maintained the view that it would not make sense to impose position limits on already-regulated, reportable and surveyed markets if you didn't also impose those limits on foreign markets or OTC market participants. And I think one of the useful things in the Dodd-Frank Act is it does clearly establish that parity. So first of all, the level-playing-field concerns, I think, have been largely eliminated. Secondly, in looking at, at least the initial proposal from the CFTC, I think, based on the feedback that they got from not only ourselves but other industry participants, I think they've tried to develop a regime and set those limits at a level where they're not going to grossly encumber current market participants’ use of our markets. So I think a lot of those concerns have gone away. Obviously, we still have are of the view that position limits in terms of being mandated are not really that useful and certainly not warranted by the evidence that exists, not only the CFTC's own studies but our own studies of what drove pricing dynamics and crude oil in commodity markets during that summer.

CME Group showed strong performance in the second quarter of 2010 with net income of $271 million, up 13% sequentially, on revenues of $814 million, up 17% sequentially. This strong performance, our best ever on",1657,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. CME Group showed strong performance in the second quarter of 2010 with net income of $271 million, up 13% sequentially, on revenues of $814 million, up 17% sequentially. This strong performance, our best ever on a GAAP basis, was driven by positive volume trends across all asset classes, with overall average daily volume of 13.5 million contracts, up 31% from Q2 '09 and up 17% from Q1 2010.
We had record revenue quarters in energy, foreign exchange and agricultural products. Additionally, interest rate revenues were up 29% from the second quarter last year and up 19% sequentially. And equity in metals volume and revenue were also strong for the quarter. 
As we’ve moved into July, we have experienced normal seasonal patterns, although it is worth pointing out that July average daily volume of 10.7 million contracts is up 11% versus July of last year and is 400,000 contracts per day higher than any quarterly ADV last year. Finally, volume across our six product areas is up for July compared to the same month last year. 
Looking at drivers of our performance, sovereign debt issues in Europe were obviously a catalyst for the second quarter volume. The stabilization we've seen since the peak of the crisis, as indicated by the plateauing of the LIBOR-OIS spread since May 25, among other factors, reflects favorably on the market’s ability to absorb shocks in the short-term and on the ability of local industry participants and central banks to recognize and attempt to resolve critical issues.
Partially related to the European crisis, the market shifted its Fed rate hike expectations. We have seen an associated shift in Eurodollar volumes, with those Eurodollar futures expiring 12 to 18 months from now contributing approximately 13% of overall Eurodollar futures volume in July, up 10% from the total in the first and second quarters.
We've highlighted before that Eurodollar products tend to be most heavily traded during periods with varying market expectations for rate changes. For the next several months, we expect Eurodollar volumes to reflect the current policy environment, and it is worth pointing out that transaction data positively reflects in certain key measures, such as depth of book and bid-ask spreads, when compared to last year. 
CME Group energy products had an exceptional quarter, with record revenue and volumes. With volatility increasing due to ongoing forecasts for strong crude oil demand coupled with European instability, our WTI product suite was a strong driver of this performance, boasting record volumes of 977,000 contracts per day, up 52% from Q2 '09 and up 25% from a robust first quarter.
Refined products, including heating oil and gasoline, also had record volumes for the quarter. Energy volumes in July have shown a typical seasonal slowdown, but we believe that our products in this area would continue to perform very well over the long term. 
I mentioned before that we had record revenues in our FX product line as well, and that was, of course, somewhat related to the European crisis. While cyclical factors may have impacted the second quarter volumes, we strongly believe there are many longer-running structural trends in those markets that have and will continue to be very positive for CME Group FX products. Based on the available data, one of these trends is an ongoing shift from OTC markets to CME's exchange-traded and centrally cleared FX products. Our team has worked diligently to position CME Group to take advantage of such structural shifts in the FX marketplace, and the volume trends over the past year show our success. CME's April volume was up 87% compared to the prior year, while in the OTC markets, as measured by preliminary regional data submitted to BIS, FX trading in the U.K. was up 31% for the same period. Activity in Japan was up 16%, and activity in the U.S. was up 43%, clearly demonstrating that we are picking up share as we outpace the growth of the overall market. 
As a side note, we're referencing April statistics there, because that is the most recent data that's available on those markets. But CME FX has had strong growth since then as well, with July [audio gap] 37% from the prior July. We believe our FX team has built an exceptional platform for future growth opportunities. 
With that, I'd like to switch gears and talk a little bit about one of those opportunities in FX, and that is a new product we worked with our colleagues at Dow Jones Indexes to launch. As planned, we’ve continued the Dow Jones indexing capability with the derivatives expertise and deep customer connections at CME Group. One of the early results of these efforts is our FX$INDEX futures, a contract that will provide a tool for trading the relative value of the U.S. dollar against a basket of major currencies, weighted based on current Fed data. The weighting methodology is unique to CME, and we believe it creates a strong competitive differentiator for this product. It also provides our customers with an efficient means for using the deeply liquid component currency futures to dynamically hedge FX$INDEX futures and, with our Globex distribution to FX markets participants, will enable us to attract a broad international audience. The product launched on Monday, and we are actively working to promote this to our customers. 
Additionally, our teams worked together to bring the Dow Jones long-term inflation index to market on July 15th, which uses the CME ultra-long treasury futures as an underlying component, along with long-term treasury inflation-protected securities. Like many of our product ideas, this product was developed based on significant customer input, and given the strong uptake and success of the ultra-long treasury futures, we know that market interest in longer-duration products is very high. We continue to explore other joint product development and global expansion opportunities, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the future.
We did a fairly deep dive last quarter on our international growth strategy, and we feel very positive about the work we're currently doing to build the path for future success. As you can see in our slide, in our core business, Globex volumes during non-U.S. hours saw strong growth, with volumes during European hours up 78% and volumes during Asian hours up 76% from Q2 '09. Volume from international telecommunications hubs grew 68% compared to the same quarter a year ago and represented 13% of overall Globex volume, up from 11% a year ago. 
I also want to take some time today to discuss our views on capital structure. Over the last few years, we've received valuable input from our shareholders on this important topic. We recently completed an internal assessment of our five-year strategy. We've successfully integrated the CBOT and NYMEX acquisitions, and with those assets in place, we believe we have a solid foundation to drive continued organic growth. In the near term, we do not foresee the need for additional large-scale M&A transactions to drive growth. Based on our projections, we anticipate being very well positioned to return excess cash to shareholders as early as next year. 
In the past, we have returned cash to our shareholders through regular quarterly dividends, special dividends and share buybacks, all of which we will thoroughly analyze as options for future return of cash. One of the results from our plan has been the establishment of capital structure guiding principles, which you can see on the next slide.
First, we intend to maintain a target level of cash to meet working capital requirements and our clearing house commitment. We anticipate a minimum cash level of approximately $500, million and success in our OTC initiatives would cause this amount to scale. Second, as we've stated in the past, our intention is to target a high investment-grade credit rating to demonstrate our solid financial position as a leader in the exchange and clearing industry. Third, we intend to pay a stable to growing dividend, and our board will assess that on an ongoing basis. Fourth, we have taken on debt primarily related to the NYMEX transaction, but we intend to maintain a permanent, prudent level of debt. Lastly, we intend to return excess capital in the form of dividends and share repurchases, as I mentioned early. 
Finally, I would like to share a few thoughts with you on the regulatory environment. We know that a key focus of our investors has been the ongoing developments in financial regulation, and we are fully supportive of the efforts made by all to bolster the soundness of the financial system. The passage of the Dodd-Frank Act reinforces the critical underpinnings of CME Group's markets: transparency and security. We’ve spent a lot of time in Washington over the years highlighting the value of our markets, and we will continue our efforts with government officials, regulators and market participants as the rulemaking process ensues. Throughout that process and in the timeframe following the adoption of new rules, we will be focusing very intensely on ensuring smooth implementation and providing maximum support to our customers.
In regards to direct quantifiable impacts on CME Group, we believe the new legislation is directionally positive. We look forward to engaging with our customers and regulators during this process, and in the long term, returning to what we do best: providing safe and secure, liquid and transparent markets for market participant. 
In conclusion, CME Group had strong results in the second quarter, and more importantly, we have continued to build a very strong base for future growth of our business. We have gotten where we are because of our focus on serving our customers, whether during times of high market volatility or times of sweeping change. As global financial markets evolve in the future, we are well-positioned to offer critical risk management products for our customers. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie."

Before I dive into the financials, I just wanted to note that the comments and comparisons I'll be making today will exclude the impacts of the Credit Markets Analysis, otherwise known as CMA, impairment discussed in the press release. 
CME Group turned in a strong second quarter financial performance, with average daily volume of 13.5 million contracts per day, up 31% from Q2 last year, and revenue of $814 million, up 26% from last year. From a GAAP perspective, this is the highest level of quarterly revenue we have delivered and only $3 million below Q1 of 2008, assuming we had owned NYMEX business at that point. 
We delivered $536 million of operating income and diluted earnings per share of $4.43, excluding CMA. From Q1 to Q2, our revenue grew $121 million while our expenses grew only $10 million, excluding the one-time Dow Jones transaction expense incurred in Q1. 
The overall average rate for contracts for all CME Group decreased 4% ,$0.79, compared with $0.823 in the second quarter 2009. So average daily volume was up 31% while the average rate was down 4%. The main driver of the year-over-year rate decrease was our member, non-member mix. Our lower-fee member volume grew 35% while non-member volume grew at 19%. Sequentially, the rate per contract also dropped 4%, primarily driven by a large increase in interest rate volumes, our lowest-rate product, from 5.1 million contracts per day in Q1 to 6.1 million contracts per day in Q2.
Market data revenue of $102 million for the quarter was up 17% compared to Q1. This increase is due to the inclusion of a full quarter of CME Group index services revenue. At the end of the second quarter, users of CME, CBOT and NYMEX data subscribed to 385,000 base devices. This count was down only 1,000 screens from the prior quarter, representing some stabilization relative to the trends we have seen since the credit crisis. 
And I'll take a few minutes to review expenses. Drilling into Q2, compensation and benefits was $103 million, up $4 million from the prior quarter. This increase was attributable to an increase in our bonus accrual due to strong cash earnings performance. Our combined headcount at the end of Q2 stood at 2,460, an increase of 50 people during the second quarter.
We reiterate our full-year expense guidance of $1.13 billion to $1.14 billion, excluding the CMA impairment, which implies second-half expense of $573 million to $583 million. 
Q2 operating income was $536 million, the high-water mark since Q1 of 2008. For the second quarter, our operating margin was 66%. In the non-operating income and expense category, on the investment income line, we recorded $5.5 million in dividends, down $4 million versus Q1. Also interest expense increased due to the full quarter impact of the $613 million of additional debt we incurred for the Dow Jones transaction.
In the second quarter, we paid down $300 million of commercial paper, bringing our total debt to $2.8 billion. We will be paying down our next maturity in August, bringing our debt down to $2.5 billion and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to approximately 1.3x. A detailed illustration of our debt structure is included in our earnings slides.
In the second quarter, we repurchased 46,000 CME Group shares. In addition, in the month of July, we repurchased more than 1 million shares of CME Group stocks totaling $279 million at an average price of $272 per share. As part of our announced transaction with BM&FBOVESPA, we issued to them $2.2 million CME Group shares on July 16 and received $607 million. So we have nearly offset the dilution associated with the share issuance. As Craig mentioned earlier, longer-term, we plan to return excess capital to shareholders in an efficient way beginning as early as next year. For the quarter, our effective tax rate was 41.7%, excluding the CME impairment. For the full year 2010, we expect an effective rate of between 41% and 42% on a GAAP basis.
Capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowances, totaled $28 million in the second quarter, driven primarily by hardware and software attributed to migration of trading systems to our new data center as well as continued build-out in our office facilities. Our full year guidance remains at $180 million to $200 million, with data center and facility build-out continuing in the second half of the year.
In summary, the second quarter was tremendous. We excelled on a top line and delivered virtually all of the incremental revenue to the bottom line. We look forward to leveraging our platform like this in the future and delivering profitable growth.

Well, I think you're aware that we've had underway for quite some time a application to establish a registered clearing house in the U.K. We're continuing to make, I think, very good progress on the completion of our application there and, hopefully, expecting approval very shortly. That will be an enabler for us on couple of different fronts. We’re envisioning that being an opportunity for us to offer more clearing choice to our customers in our core business. So for example, our application includes a large number of energy contracts that we believe there's demand from European customers to clear locally there. And then also, we do envision it will support our efforts to be a broad-based provider across asset classes and across geographies of over-the-counter swaps, clearing services. So we're not feeling any kind of protectionism in that regard. We're going through a professional process and believe we’re being treated very fairly by the local authorities there."

There are different provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that apply to swaps clearing, and then the provision that I believe you're referring to is a provision that is intended to reduce the systemic risk potential of credit relationships between and among clearing houses in the listed derivatives markets, maybe to begin with. So on the over-the-counter product side, there is what we call the kind of non-discriminatory open-access provision. And generally speaking, I mean, I think there’s a lot of confusion about those in the first instance in that they absolutely do not provide for interoperability and fungibility per se. It's probably a little bit too arcane to get into in this call. But that's the one side of it. And then the provision that you're referring to is limited to the listed derivative markets, and it really is intended to ensure that there isn't a kind of systemic-risk domino effect by forcing linkages between clearing houses. And then, maybe the third part is just that I don't think it really has any bearing on the EFF issues, which are not clearing house transfers of positions between clearing houses with credit relationships.

You'll probably remember that since the inception of the discussions about position limits in energy and metals markets, we've always maintained the view that it would not make sense to impose position limits on already-regulated, reportable and surveyed markets if you didn't also impose those limits on foreign markets or OTC market participants. And I think one of the useful things in the Dodd-Frank Act is it does clearly establish that parity. So first of all, the level-playing-field concerns, I think, have been largely eliminated. Secondly, in looking at, at least the initial proposal from the CFTC, I think, based on the feedback that they got from not only ourselves but other industry participants, I think they've tried to develop a regime and set those limits at a level where they're not going to grossly encumber current market participants’ use of our markets. So I think a lot of those concerns have gone away. Obviously, we still have are of the view that position limits in terms of being mandated are not really that useful and certainly not warranted by the evidence that exists, not only the CFTC's own studies but our own studies of what drove pricing dynamics and crude oil in commodity markets during that summer. But I think in general, it's come out better in terms of addressing some of our concerns."

CME Group showed strong performance in the second quarter of 2010 with net income of $271 million, up 13% sequentially, on revenues of $814 million, up 17% sequentially. This strong performance, our best ever on",1657,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. CME Group showed strong performance in the second quarter of 2010 with net income of $271 million, up 13% sequentially, on revenues of $814 million, up 17% sequentially. This strong performance, our best ever on a GAAP basis, was driven by positive volume trends across all asset classes, with overall average daily volume of 13.5 million contracts, up 31% from Q2 '09 and up 17% from Q1 2010.
We had record revenue quarters in energy, foreign exchange and agricultural products. Additionally, interest rate revenues were up 29% from the second quarter last year and up 19% sequentially. And equity in metals volume and revenue were also strong for the quarter. 
As we’ve moved into July, we have experienced normal seasonal patterns, although it is worth pointing out that July average daily volume of 10.7 million contracts is up 11% versus July of last year and is 400,000 contracts per day higher than any quarterly ADV last year. Finally, volume across our six product areas is up for July compared to the same month last year. 
Looking at drivers of our performance, sovereign debt issues in Europe were obviously a catalyst for the second quarter volume. The stabilization we've seen since the peak of the crisis, as indicated by the plateauing of the LIBOR-OIS spread since May 25, among other factors, reflects favorably on the market’s ability to absorb shocks in the short-term and on the ability of local industry participants and central banks to recognize and attempt to resolve critical issues.
Partially related to the European crisis, the market shifted its Fed rate hike expectations. We have seen an associated shift in Eurodollar volumes, with those Eurodollar futures expiring 12 to 18 months from now contributing approximately 13% of overall Eurodollar futures volume in July, up 10% from the total in the first and second quarters.
We've highlighted before that Eurodollar products tend to be most heavily traded during periods with varying market expectations for rate changes. For the next several months, we expect Eurodollar volumes to reflect the current policy environment, and it is worth pointing out that transaction data positively reflects in certain key measures, such as depth of book and bid-ask spreads, when compared to last year. 
CME Group energy products had an exceptional quarter, with record revenue and volumes. With volatility increasing due to ongoing forecasts for strong crude oil demand coupled with European instability, our WTI product suite was a strong driver of this performance, boasting record volumes of 977,000 contracts per day, up 52% from Q2 '09 and up 25% from a robust first quarter.
Refined products, including heating oil and gasoline, also had record volumes for the quarter. Energy volumes in July have shown a typical seasonal slowdown, but we believe that our products in this area would continue to perform very well over the long term. 
I mentioned before that we had record revenues in our FX product line as well, and that was, of course, somewhat related to the European crisis. While cyclical factors may have impacted the second quarter volumes, we strongly believe there are many longer-running structural trends in those markets that have and will continue to be very positive for CME Group FX products. Based on the available data, one of these trends is an ongoing shift from OTC markets to CME's exchange-traded and centrally cleared FX products. Our team has worked diligently to position CME Group to take advantage of such structural shifts in the FX marketplace, and the volume trends over the past year show our success. CME's April volume was up 87% compared to the prior year, while in the OTC markets, as measured by preliminary regional data submitted to BIS, FX trading in the U.K. was up 31% for the same period. Activity in Japan was up 16%, and activity in the U.S. was up 43%, clearly demonstrating that we are picking up share as we outpace the growth of the overall market. 
As a side note, we're referencing April statistics there, because that is the most recent data that's available on those markets. But CME FX has had strong growth since then as well, with July [audio gap] 37% from the prior July. We believe our FX team has built an exceptional platform for future growth opportunities. 
With that, I'd like to switch gears and talk a little bit about one of those opportunities in FX, and that is a new product we worked with our colleagues at Dow Jones Indexes to launch. As planned, we’ve continued the Dow Jones indexing capability with the derivatives expertise and deep customer connections at CME Group. One of the early results of these efforts is our FX$INDEX futures, a contract that will provide a tool for trading the relative value of the U.S. dollar against a basket of major currencies, weighted based on current Fed data. The weighting methodology is unique to CME, and we believe it creates a strong competitive differentiator for this product. It also provides our customers with an efficient means for using the deeply liquid component currency futures to dynamically hedge FX$INDEX futures and, with our Globex distribution to FX markets participants, will enable us to attract a broad international audience. The product launched on Monday, and we are actively working to promote this to our customers. 
Additionally, our teams worked together to bring the Dow Jones long-term inflation index to market on July 15th, which uses the CME ultra-long treasury futures as an underlying component, along with long-term treasury inflation-protected securities. Like many of our product ideas, this product was developed based on significant customer input, and given the strong uptake and success of the ultra-long treasury futures, we know that market interest in longer-duration products is very high. We continue to explore other joint product development and global expansion opportunities, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the future.
We did a fairly deep dive last quarter on our international growth strategy, and we feel very positive about the work we're currently doing to build the path for future success. As you can see in our slide, in our core business, Globex volumes during non-U.S. hours saw strong growth, with volumes during European hours up 78% and volumes during Asian hours up 76% from Q2 '09. Volume from international telecommunications hubs grew 68% compared to the same quarter a year ago and represented 13% of overall Globex volume, up from 11% a year ago. 
I also want to take some time today to discuss our views on capital structure. Over the last few years, we've received valuable input from our shareholders on this important topic. We recently completed an internal assessment of our five-year strategy. We've successfully integrated the CBOT and NYMEX acquisitions, and with those assets in place, we believe we have a solid foundation to drive continued organic growth. In the near term, we do not foresee the need for additional large-scale M&A transactions to drive growth. Based on our projections, we anticipate being very well positioned to return excess cash to shareholders as early as next year. 
In the past, we have returned cash to our shareholders through regular quarterly dividends, special dividends and share buybacks, all of which we will thoroughly analyze as options for future return of cash. One of the results from our plan has been the establishment of capital structure guiding principles, which you can see on the next slide.
First, we intend to maintain a target level of cash to meet working capital requirements and our clearing house commitment. We anticipate a minimum cash level of approximately $500, million and success in our OTC initiatives would cause this amount to scale. Second, as we've stated in the past, our intention is to target a high investment-grade credit rating to demonstrate our solid financial position as a leader in the exchange and clearing industry. Third, we intend to pay a stable to growing dividend, and our board will assess that on an ongoing basis. Fourth, we have taken on debt primarily related to the NYMEX transaction, but we intend to maintain a permanent, prudent level of debt. Lastly, we intend to return excess capital in the form of dividends and share repurchases, as I mentioned early. 
Finally, I would like to share a few thoughts with you on the regulatory environment. We know that a key focus of our investors has been the ongoing developments in financial regulation, and we are fully supportive of the efforts made by all to bolster the soundness of the financial system. The passage of the Dodd-Frank Act reinforces the critical underpinnings of CME Group's markets: transparency and security. We’ve spent a lot of time in Washington over the years highlighting the value of our markets, and we will continue our efforts with government officials, regulators and market participants as the rulemaking process ensues. Throughout that process and in the timeframe following the adoption of new rules, we will be focusing very intensely on ensuring smooth implementation and providing maximum support to our customers.
In regards to direct quantifiable impacts on CME Group, we believe the new legislation is directionally positive. We look forward to engaging with our customers and regulators during this process, and in the long term, returning to what we do best: providing safe and secure, liquid and transparent markets for market participant. 
In conclusion, CME Group had strong results in the second quarter, and more importantly, we have continued to build a very strong base for future growth of our business. We have gotten where we are because of our focus on serving our customers, whether during times of high market volatility or times of sweeping change. As global financial markets evolve in the future, we are well-positioned to offer critical risk management products for our customers. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie."

Before I dive into the financials, I just wanted to note that the comments and comparisons I'll be making today will exclude the impacts of the Credit Markets Analysis, otherwise known as CMA, impairment discussed in the press release.",816,"Thank you, Craig. Before I dive into the financials, I just wanted to note that the comments and comparisons I'll be making today will exclude the impacts of the Credit Markets Analysis, otherwise known as CMA, impairment discussed in the press release. 
CME Group turned in a strong second quarter financial performance, with average daily volume of 13.5 million contracts per day, up 31% from Q2 last year, and revenue of $814 million, up 26% from last year. From a GAAP perspective, this is the highest level of quarterly revenue we have delivered and only $3 million below Q1 of 2008, assuming we had owned NYMEX business at that point. 
We delivered $536 million of operating income and diluted earnings per share of $4.43, excluding CMA. From Q1 to Q2, our revenue grew $121 million while our expenses grew only $10 million, excluding the one-time Dow Jones transaction expense incurred in Q1. 
The overall average rate for contracts for all CME Group decreased 4% ,$0.79, compared with $0.823 in the second quarter 2009. So average daily volume was up 31% while the average rate was down 4%. The main driver of the year-over-year rate decrease was our member, non-member mix. Our lower-fee member volume grew 35% while non-member volume grew at 19%. Sequentially, the rate per contract also dropped 4%, primarily driven by a large increase in interest rate volumes, our lowest-rate product, from 5.1 million contracts per day in Q1 to 6.1 million contracts per day in Q2.
Market data revenue of $102 million for the quarter was up 17% compared to Q1. This increase is due to the inclusion of a full quarter of CME Group index services revenue. At the end of the second quarter, users of CME, CBOT and NYMEX data subscribed to 385,000 base devices. This count was down only 1,000 screens from the prior quarter, representing some stabilization relative to the trends we have seen since the credit crisis. 
And I'll take a few minutes to review expenses. Drilling into Q2, compensation and benefits was $103 million, up $4 million from the prior quarter. This increase was attributable to an increase in our bonus accrual due to strong cash earnings performance. Our combined headcount at the end of Q2 stood at 2,460, an increase of 50 people during the second quarter.
We reiterate our full-year expense guidance of $1.13 billion to $1.14 billion, excluding the CMA impairment, which implies second-half expense of $573 million to $583 million. 
Q2 operating income was $536 million, the high-water mark since Q1 of 2008. For the second quarter, our operating margin was 66%. In the non-operating income and expense category, on the investment income line, we recorded $5.5 million in dividends, down $4 million versus Q1. Also interest expense increased due to the full quarter impact of the $613 million of additional debt we incurred for the Dow Jones transaction.
In the second quarter, we paid down $300 million of commercial paper, bringing our total debt to $2.8 billion. We will be paying down our next maturity in August, bringing our debt down to $2.5 billion and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to approximately 1.3x. A detailed illustration of our debt structure is included in our earnings slides.
In the second quarter, we repurchased 46,000 CME Group shares. In addition, in the month of July, we repurchased more than 1 million shares of CME Group stocks totaling $279 million at an average price of $272 per share. As part of our announced transaction with BM&FBOVESPA, we issued to them $2.2 million CME Group shares on July 16 and received $607 million. So we have nearly offset the dilution associated with the share issuance. As Craig mentioned earlier, longer-term, we plan to return excess capital to shareholders in an efficient way beginning as early as next year. For the quarter, our effective tax rate was 41.7%, excluding the CME impairment. For the full year 2010, we expect an effective rate of between 41% and 42% on a GAAP basis.
Capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowances, totaled $28 million in the second quarter, driven primarily by hardware and software attributed to migration of trading systems to our new data center as well as continued build-out in our office facilities. Our full year guidance remains at $180 million to $200 million, with data center and facility build-out continuing in the second half of the year.
In summary, the second quarter was tremendous. We excelled on a top line and delivered virtually all of the incremental revenue to the bottom line. We look forward to leveraging our platform like this in the future and delivering profitable growth.

But that does not represent an effort on our part to get involved in sort of the execution component of the market. But we do expect that we'll have a wide array of potential customers that will look to us for clearing services in the interest rate swaps clearing area. What ERIS is planning on doing is, really, trading, basically, swap futures contracts, so variance of traditional swap contracts and interest rates."

There will be some changes to that, but it may not be, in fact, very revolutionary or transformational.

You'll probably remember that since the inception of the discussions about position limits in energy and metals markets, we've always maintained the view that it would not make sense to impose position limits on already-regulated, reportable and surveyed markets if you didn't also impose those limits on foreign markets or OTC market participants. And I think one of the useful things in the Dodd-Frank Act is it does clearly establish that parity. So first of all, the level-playing-field concerns, I think, have been largely eliminated. Secondly, in looking at, at least the initial proposal from the CFTC, I think, based on the feedback that they got from not only ourselves but other industry participants, I think they've tried to develop a regime and set those limits at a level where they're not going to grossly encumber current market participants’ use of our markets. So I think a lot of those concerns have gone away. Obviously, we still have are of the view that position limits in terms of being mandated are not really that useful and certainly not warranted by the evidence that exists, not only the CFTC's own studies but our own studies of what drove pricing dynamics and crude oil in commodity markets during that summer. But I think in general, it's come out better in terms of addressing some of our concerns."

I'll be discussing our performance in the third quarter and providing updates on a few of our strategic initiatives before turning things over to Jamie to review the financials. CME posted soli",1875,"Thank you, John, and thank you for joining us this morning. I'll be discussing our performance in the third quarter and providing updates on a few of our strategic initiatives before turning things over to Jamie to review the financials. 
CME posted solid third quarter results with average daily volume up 14% from the same period last year. Net income of 21% to $244 million and earnings per share of $3.66, up 20%. The foundation of our performance lies in our product diversity. Energy and metals contribute 32% of transaction fee revenues; interest rates, 27%; equities, 21%; and foreign exchange and commodity products contribute the remainder. 
The breadth and diversity of our product line is beneficial when we face macro economic headwinds, in particular, market segment. Importantly, I'll note that though we've seen volume performance within the individual asset classes varies throughout the year, we have continued to see open interest build from quarter-to-quarter in everyone of our product lines. Open interest currently sits at 92.4 million contracts, up 12% compared to the same period last year and just below the all-time record of 95 million. 
To review some of our volume statistics, third quarter average daily volume was up 14% versus the same period last year and was down 15% versus the second quarter of this year, due to extraordinary performance in Q2 and the typical impacts of seasonality during July and August.
Turning to interest rates. Diminished activity in short-term rates was significantly offset by strong growth in our Treasury products, as I will describe in a moment. Average daily Eurodollar volume was down 7%, however, longer dated Eurodollar contracts with expirations beyond September 2012 saw record average daily volume of 320,000 contracts, up 32% from the prior year as there continues to be more volatility at the long end of the curve. Eurodollar mix curve options, which are short-dated expirations on longer-dated futures contracts, have also experienced impressive volume growth this quarter from approximately 6,000 average daily volume last year to 87,000 this quarter and with open interest growing from 330,000 contracts to 1.2 million contracts today at quarter end. 
Importantly, Eurodollar opened interest across the whole yield curve continues to grow including in the first two years. While short-term interest rates continued to be affected by monetary policy, it is important to recognize that Eurodollar products represent only 12% of total transaction fees at CME Group. 
As I mentioned, Treasury products had a very strong third quarter with average daily volumes up 38% in futures and with options volumes up 62%. As we've seen expectations for interest rate increases move out on the curve, products at the longer end of the curve are seeing greater activity. An additional positive to the strong Treasury volume is that the Treasury's weight for contract is generally higher than that Eurodollar RPC. We continue also to successfully innovate new products and product extensions that meet customers needs and enhance our performance in this segment of our business. We've had tremendous success with our Ultra Long Bond Treasury features, which posted average daily volumes of 33,000 contracts in Q3 and open interest of 222,000 contracts. 
Just this week, we also launched our on-the-run Treasury futures contracts, which our customers are very excited about. The robust liquidity and diversed customer base in our core Treasury products enabled us to effectively develop these product extensions, which in turn allows us to provide our customers with more trading opportunities at CME Group. 
In other product areas, average daily volume in our equity products was up 6% for the quarter, outperforming cash equity market volumes and reflecting asset allocation preferences and the outflow of funds from equities to fixed income market throughout 2010. 
Average daily volume in our FX products was up 31% over third quarter last year and open interest trends remained positive with current levels at a near record of $1.6 million. Growth in CME FX is coming from diversed sources. We saw 40% volume growth in the Australian and Canadian dollar markets, which historically had been less actively traded currency pairs at CME. Additionally, FX activity was up 54% during non-U.S. trading hours and this asset class continues to be our fastest growing segment during non-U.S. hours.  FX options also continued to perform extremely well with average daily volume up 182% over third quarter 2009 and open interest growth of 101% versus the same period a year ago.
Finally, another positive indicator for our FX business came out of the recently released BIS tri-annual survey, which shows that the global FX market grew 20% from April 2007 to April 2010, while CME FX volume grew 94% in that same period, clearly demonstrating the increasing importance of our products to the global FX marketplace. 
The BIS survey also indicated that global FX options declined 2%, while CME FX option volumes grew 250%. We believe there are three factors driving this out performance. First, CME central counter-party clearing, which enables wider participation by a diversed set of buy-side customers. Second, our significantly expanding liquidity across a broad range of CME currency pairs as our FX markets have indeed become a major source of liquidity in global FX market. And third, electronic access to both futures and options on our CME Globex electronic trading platform. Together, these factors should continue to drive growth in our FX business.
To round out our other asset classes, our agricultural commodity, energy and metals products have all shown outstanding growth year-to-date and also are on track for a strong fourth quarter. These products tend to earn our highest rates per contract but growth here is very accretive. Agricultural commodities had a strong quarter with volumes up 33% versus last year, led by outstanding growth in corn and wheat volumes of 56% and 72% respectively. Energy was up 12% to 1.7 million contracts per day, our second highest quarterly volume and energy open interest remains at near record levels.
Finally, metals average daily volume was up 28%. I'd also like to touch on continued growth in international volumes in our core product lines. During the third quarter, we saw strong growth of 37% in Globex volumes during non-U.S. hours. Volume from our various international hubs also grew 15% compared to the same quarter a year ago and now represents 15% of overall Globex volume. We continued to focus on globalization of our core business as we expect growth in emerging markets to outpace growth in more developed markets.
One example of our commitment to achieving growth from globalization is our recently announced enhancements to our global client development and sales organization. Our new structure will better enable us to cross sell all CME Group products and services to our global customers, while also allowing us to better understand and meet the needs of our largest customer segments including banks, intermediaries, asset managers, hedge funds, proprietary trading firms and of course commercial participant. The new structure has been designed to better target cross asset sales across client segments to drive international growth, specifically in Asia and Europe, and to generate new client participation across all regions. The ultimate goal is to more effectively serve our clients and enhance our global sales and marketing efforts for the entire suite of CME Group products. 
During the quarter, we hired a new head of Global Client Development and Sales, Alice Hacket, former Managing Director and Co-Head of Global Prime Finance at Citigroup. Alice joins us and will oversee our worldwide clients development and sales efforts.
Moving on to our strategic initiatives, we were very pleased to extend our OTC clearing services into interest rate on October 18. This offering provides the extensive counter party, risk reduction and transparency of CME clearing while preserving the prevailing execution processes, technology platform and economic structures used in the bilateral IRS market today. As the Clearing Only provider in this space, we are execution-agnostic and offer operational flexibility to our customers by accepting trades from a variety of venues. 
Finally, as we continue to build our OTC offerings and other asset classes, CME Group has a significant lead in providing a comprehensive multi-asset class clearing solutions to the market for the maximum operational ease and capital efficiency that comes with connecting to a single clearing house. 
To date, we've cleared $660 million in interest rates swaps and have $648 million in open interest, with participation across a wide variety of firms. We see this effort as being in the very early stages and recognize that many clients are waiting for greater clarity on final rules before moving forward with cleared interest rate swaps. Currently, we're focused on delivering key additions to the offering in order to make it possible for more users to access our services. Some of the details we are working towards include receiving approval for a structure to allow cross margining with exchange-traded futures and options and finalizing regulatory approvals allowing certain types of neutral funds post collateral. We are also working on expanding the product scope to offer more product flexibility and swaps denominated in additional currencies. 
I'd also like to share an update on the development of our co-location services offering for all CME Group customers. Our offering will allow customers to co-locate their servers in CME Group's new state-of-the-art data center. Co-location will create the lowest possible latency hosting environment for our customers. The offering is available to all customers and all customers will be treated equally with transparent and market-based pricing. 
Equidistant access points will also ensure fair and equal access. The uptake during our initial application period has been positive, and we are in the process of allocating space to our customers. Once customers' base for this space is allocated, we will begin to built out the facilities and are planning for an early 2012 go-live date. Based on current indications of interest from our customers, we expect this service to add approximately $30 million to $40 million in revenue in 2012 and to further scale from there.
Finally, I'd like to offer a brief regulatory update. We are participating actively in the Dod-Frank will-making processes being undertaken by the CFTC and other financial and markets regulators. Our team is working with them and our customers to ensure that new regulations create a fair and level playing field for all market participants and that U.S. markets are not disadvantaged compared to other global markets centers. The CFTC and other regulators will be issuing a real proposal in many areas over the next few months. Like many of you, we are already engaging in the public comment process and anticipate a robust and healthy dialogue about the many issues that regulators are addressing. We will continue to keep you posted on these critical topics as they develop. 
In conclusion, CME Group continues to be successful in managing our core business and executing on our strategies to further global our entire business and expand our capabilities into OTC market. While the macroeconomic climate has been challenging for everyone, our performance over the past two years has proven that we can leverage our diverse product set to deliver results in a variety of cyclical and economic environment. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jamie."

CME Group posted solid third quarter financial results with average daily volume of 11.6 million contracts per day, up 14% versus Q3 of last year, driving a 13% increase in revenue to $733 million. We delivered $443 million of operating",755,"Thank you, Craig. CME Group posted solid third quarter financial results with average daily volume of 11.6 million contracts per day, up 14% versus Q3 of last year, driving a 13% increase in revenue to $733 million. We delivered $443 million of operating income, a 60% operating margin, diluted earnings per share of $3.66.
The overall rate per contract decreased 3% to $0.81 compared with $0.0834 in the third quarter of 2009, due to higher growth for members versus non-members in higher-tiered discounts. Sequentially, the rate per contract increased 3% due to favorable mix factors including a stronger participation from our highest paying non-members.
Market data revenue of $101 million for the quarter was down less than 1%, compared to Q2, due to a decrease in the Dow Jones Indexes revenue attributable primarily to lower equity assets under management. Drivers to CME, CBOT and NYMEX data increased our activity somewhat in Q3 with the total terminal count of slightly to 385,000. This was the first increase in sequential screen count since Q2 of 2008 signaling some stabilization relative to the trend we have seen since the credit crisis began.
Lastly, with respect to the other revenue line in Q3, we recognized $5.1 million from BM&FBOVESPA related to a build out of our multi-asset class trading platform.
I'll now take a few minutes to review expenses. Drilling into Q3 expenses, compensation and benefits was $110 million, up $7 million from the prior quarter. $5.1 million of this increase was based on a sequential change in deferred compensation expense. Remember there is a one-for-one offset in the investment income line for this item so there's no bottom line impact. In addition, our combined headcount at the end of Q3 stood at 2,520, an increase of 60 people during the third quarter, reflecting our continued investment in growth opportunities.
Q3 marketing and other expense included approximately $4.7 million related to resolving customer losses associated with the CME Globex and trade issue which occurred in September, while there were a $2.1 million tax and operating accrual adjustment which decreased occupancy and building expenses for the quarter. We now expect our second half of 2010 expenses to come in near the top end of our prior guidance of $573 million to $583 million, with the one-time cost of the end trade and higher deferred compensation pushing us to that level.
In the non-operating income and expense category, investment income was up $8 million, sequentially, due to a $3 million increase in the BM&FBOVESPA dividend plus the $5 million in deferred comp earnings mentioned earlier. Equity and losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries reflect a $2 million increase, due to writing down to zero our investment OneChicago, our single-stock futures JV.
In the third quarter, we paid down $300 million of debt, bringing our total debt to $2.5 billion, which reduced interest expense by $2 million. Our debt to EBITDA ratio is now under 1.3x. A detailed illustration of our debt structure is included in our earnings slide. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $630 million of cash in marketable securities on our balance sheet. For the quarter, our effective tax rate was 41.2%, and we expect our tax rate to fall between 41% and 42% in total for the year. 
Capital expenditures net of lease hold improvement allowances totaled $44 million in the third quarter, driven primarily by hardware and software purchases tied to the migration of our Globex trading system to our new data center, additional investment in the data center related to our co-location offering, as well as continued build out of our office facility. We expect our capital expenditures to come in near the low end of our full year guidance of $180 million to $200 million. 
Turning to recent volumes. So far in October, ADV is tracking a similar level to Q3 at 11.4 million contracts up 9% compared to the same time frame last year. In summary, we added to our solid 2010 financial performance in the third quarter. So far this year, we have generated over $800 million of cash earnings while investing significantly in growth initiatives and paying down $400 million of debt. We are well on our way to returning excess capital to shareholders as early as next year. So I'll now open up the call for your questions. In order to get to everyone, we are limiting all of you to one question and one follow-up, and please feel free to get back in the queue if time permits."

I have always said for a long time now, especially when I testify in D.C. as it relates to high-frequency trading, these people are truly liquidity providers. They are not looking for long term direction of anyone particular market at all. They're mostly competing for the build-out or to lay out in other marketplaces, which deepens the pools of liquidity for people who are trying to manage risks. So when I go to Congress and remind them that most participants in the U.S. equity market or anything else, they are not competing for the build-out. They're competing for their portfolio risk management for six weeks, six months or six years, they need to have that deep liquidity and that's exactly what HFT traders provide. And when you walk them through how they provide this liquidity, the regulators and legislators start to get it. So it's a new phenomenon in high-frequency trading and I think people are trying to understand that more than anything else, so the natural thing is when you don't understand something is to blame something. So I think that's what we're seeing right now but I think people will realize that this is very valuable liquidity as time continues."

But at the same time, also facilitating capital and margin efficiencies that are valuable to market participants. So I mean those are at a high-level, I think the issues that the industry and the regulators are really focused on.

One of the things that we are working together on, and which has been very successful, is that as customers begin to become active in the BM&FBOVESPA market through our order-routing linkage, they also then do gravitate toward actual co-location where they are participating kind of directly on a co-location basis in the Brazilian market.

We're continuing to see interest in that building. We have a pipeline of participants who are becoming increasingly aware of the efficiencies and the value of accessing in the BM&FBOVESPA market.

Although I would point out that these are existing resources that also support the operation and growth of our core business activities as well.

I'll be discussing our performance in the third quarter and providing updates on a few of our strategic initiatives before turning things over to Jamie to review the financials. 
CME posted solid third quarter results with average daily volume up 14% from the same period last year. Net income of 21% to $244 million and earnings per share of $3.66, up 20%. The foundation of our performance lies in our product diversity. Energy and metals contribute 32% of transaction fee revenues; interest rates, 27%; equities, 21%; and foreign exchange and commodity products contribute the remainder. 
The breadth and diversity of our product line is beneficial when we face macro-economic headwinds, in particular, market segment. Importantly, I'll note that though we've seen volume performance within the individual asset classes vary throughout the year, we have continued to see open interest build from quarter-to-quarter in everyone of our product lines. Open interest currently sits at 92.4 million contracts, up 12% compared to the same period last year and just below the all-time record of 95 million.
To review some of our volume statistics, third quarter average daily volume was up 14% versus the same period last year and was down 15% versus the second quarter of this year, due to extraordinary performance in Q2 and the typical impacts of seasonality during July and August.
Turning to interest rates. Diminished activity in short-term rates was significantly offset by strong growth in our Treasury products, as I will describe in a moment. Average daily Eurodollar volume was down 7%, however, longer dated Eurodollar contracts with expirations beyond September 2012 saw record average daily volume of 320,000 contracts, up 32% from the prior year as there continues to be more volatility at the long end of the curve. Eurodollar Mid-Curve options, which are short-dated expirations on longer-dated futures contracts, have also experienced impressive volume growth this quarter from approximately 6,000 average daily volume last year to 87,000 this quarter and with open interest growing from 330,000 contracts to 1.2 million contracts today at quarter end. 
Importantly, Eurodollar open interest across the whole yield curve continues to grow including in the first two years. While short-term interest rates continued to be affected by monetary policy, it is important to recognize that Eurodollar products represent only 12% of total transaction fees at CME Group. 
As I mentioned, Treasury products had a very strong third quarter with average daily volumes up 38% in futures and with options volumes up 62%. As we've seen expectations for interest rate increases move out on the curve, products at the longer end of the curve are seeing greater activity. An additional positive to the strong Treasury volume is that the Treasury's rate for contract is generally higher than that Eurodollar RPC. We continue also to successfully innovate new products and product extensions that meet customer needs and enhance our performance in this segment of our business. We've had tremendous success with our Ultra Long Bond Treasury features, which posted average daily volumes of 33,000 contracts in Q3 and open interest of 222,000 contracts. 
Just this week, we also launched our on-the-run Treasury futures contracts, which our customers are very excited about. The robust liquidity and diverse customer base in our core Treasury products enabled us to effectively develop these product extensions, which in turn allows us to provide our customers with more trading opportunities at CME Group. 
In other product areas, average daily volume in our equity products was up 6% for the quarter, outperforming cash equity market volume and reflecting asset allocation preferences and the outflow of funds from equities to fixed income market throughout 2010. 
Average daily volume in our FX products was up 31% over third quarter last year and open interest trends remained positive with current levels at a near record of $1.6 million. Growth in CME FX is coming from diverse sources. We saw 40% volume growth in the Australian and Canadian dollar markets, which historically had been less actively traded currency pairs at CME. Additionally, FX activity was up 54% during non-U.S. trading hours and this asset class continues to be our fastest growing segment during non-U.S. hours.  FX options also continued to perform extremely well with average daily volume up 182% over third quarter 2009 and open interest growth of 101% versus the same period a year ago.
Finally, another positive indicator for our FX business came out of the recently released BIS tri-annual survey, which shows that the global FX market grew 20% from April 2007 to April 2010, while CME FX volume grew 94% in that same period, clearly demonstrating the increasing importance of our products to the global FX marketplace. 
The BIS survey also indicated that global FX options declined 2%, while CME FX option volumes grew 250%. We believe there are three factors driving this out performance. First, CME central counter-party clearing, which enables wider participation by a diverse set of buy-side customers. Second, our significantly expanding liquidity across a broad range of CME currency pairs as our FX markets have indeed become a major source of liquidity in global FX market. And third, electronic access to both futures and options on our CME Globex electronic trading platform. Together, these factors should continue to drive growth in our FX business.
To round out our other asset classes, our agricultural commodity, energy and metals products have all shown outstanding growth year-to-date and also are on track for a strong fourth quarter. These products tend to earn our highest rates per contract but growth here is very accretive. Agricultural commodities had a strong quarter with volumes up 33% versus last year, led by outstanding growth in corn and wheat volumes of 56% and 72% respectively. Energy was up 12% to 1.7 million contracts per day, our second highest quarterly volume and energy open interest remains at near record levels.
Finally, metals average daily volume was up 28%. I'd also like to touch on continued growth in international volumes in our core product lines. During the third quarter, we saw strong growth of 37% in Globex volumes during non-U.S. hours. Volume from our various international hubs also grew 15% compared to the same quarter a year ago and now represents 15% of overall Globex volume. We continued to focus on globalization of our core business as we expect growth in emerging markets to outpace growth in more developed markets.
One example of our commitment to achieving growth from globalization is our recently announced enhancements to our global client development and sales organization. Our new structure will better enable us to cross sell all CME Group products and services to our global customers, while also allowing us to better understand and meet the needs of our largest customer segments including banks, intermediaries, asset managers, hedge funds, proprietary trading firms and of course commercial participant. The new structure has been designed to better target cross asset sales across client segments to drive international growth, specifically in Asia and Europe, and to generate new client participation across all regions. The ultimate goal is to more effectively serve our clients and enhance our global sales and marketing efforts for the entire suite of CME Group products. 
During the quarter, we hired a new head of Global Client Development and Sales, Alice Hacket, former Managing Director and Co-Head of Global Prime Finance at Citigroup. Alice joins us and will oversee our worldwide clients development and sales efforts.
Moving on to our strategic initiatives, we were very pleased to extend our OTC clearing services into interest rate on October 18. This offering provides the extensive counter party, risk reduction and transparency of CME clearing while preserving the prevailing execution processes, technology platform and economic structures used in the bilateral IRS market today. As the Clearing Only provider in this space, we are execution-agnostic and offer operational flexibility to our customers by accepting trades from a variety of venues. 
Finally, as we continue to build our OTC offerings and other asset classes, CME Group has a significant lead in providing a comprehensive multi-asset class clearing solutions to the market for the maximum operational ease and capital efficiency that comes with connecting to a single clearing house. 
To date, we've cleared $660 million in interest rates swaps and have $648 million in open interest, with participation across a wide variety of firms. We see this effort as being in the very early stages and recognize that many clients are waiting for greater clarity on final rules before moving forward with cleared interest rate swaps. Currently, we're focused on delivering key additions to the offering in order to make it possible for more users to access our services. Some of the details we are working towards include receiving approval for a structure to allow cross margining with exchange-traded futures and options and finalizing regulatory approvals allowing certain types of mutual funds post collateral. We are also working on expanding the product scope to offer more product flexibility and swaps denominated in additional currencies. 
I'd also like to share an update on the development of our co-location services offering for all CME Group customers. Our offering will allow customers to co-locate their servers in CME Group's new state-of-the-art data center. Co-location will create the lowest possible latency hosting environment for our customers. The offering is available to all customers and all customers will be treated equally with transparent and market-based pricing. 
Equidistant access points will also ensure fair and equal access. The uptake during our initial application period has been positive, and we are in the process of allocating space to our customers. Once customers' base for this space is allocated, we will begin to build out the facilities and are planning for an early 2012 go-live date. Based on current indications of interest from our customers, we expect this service to add approximately $30 million to $40 million in revenue in 2012 and to further scale from there.
Finally, I'd like to offer a brief regulatory update. We are participating actively in the Dod-Frank rule-making processes being undertaken by the CFTC and other financial and markets regulators. Our team is working with them and our customers to ensure that new regulations create a fair and level playing field for all market participants and that U.S. markets are not disadvantaged compared to other global markets centers. The CFTC and other regulators will be issuing a real proposal in many areas over the next few months. Like many of you, we are already engaging in the public comment process and anticipate a robust and healthy dialogue about the many issues that regulators are addressing. We will continue to keep you posted on these critical topics as they develop. 
In conclusion, CME Group continues to be successful in managing our core business and executing on our strategies to further globalize our entire business and expand our capabilities into OTC market. While the macroeconomic climate has been challenging for everyone, our performance over the past two years has proven that we can leverage our diverse product set to deliver results in a variety of cyclical and economic environments. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jamie."

CME Group posted solid third quarter financial results with average daily volume of 11.6 million contracts per day, up 14% versus Q3 of last year, driving a 13% increase in revenue to $733 million. We delivered $443 million of operating income, a 60% operating margin, diluted earnings per share of $3.66.
The overall rate per contract decreased 3% to $0.81 compared with $0.0834 in the third quarter of 2009, due to higher growth from members versus non-members in higher-tiered discounts. Sequentially, the rate per contract increased 3% due to favorable mix factors including a stronger participation from our highest paying non-members.
Market data revenue of $101 million for the quarter was down less than 1%, compared to Q2, due to a decrease in the Dow Jones Indexes revenue attributable primarily to lower equity assets under management. Drivers to CME, CBOT and NYMEX data increased their activity somewhat in Q3 with the total terminal count of slightly to 385,000. This was the first increase in sequential screen count since Q2 of 2008 signaling some stabilization relative to the trend we have seen since the credit crisis began.
Lastly, with respect to the other revenue line in Q3, we recognized $5.1 million from BM&FBOVESPA related to a build out of our multi-asset class trading platform.
I'll now take a few minutes to review expenses. Drilling into Q3 expenses, compensation and benefits was $110 million, up $7 million from the prior quarter. $5.1 million of this increase was based on a sequential change in deferred compensation expense. Remember there is a one-for-one offset in the investment income line for this item so there's no bottom line impact. In addition, our combined headcount at the end of Q3 stood at 2,520, an increase of 60 people during the third quarter, reflecting our continued investment in growth opportunities.
Q3 marketing and other expense included approximately $4.7 million related to resolving customer losses associated with the CME Globex and trade issue which occurred in September, while there were a $2.1 million tax and operating accrual adjustment which decreased occupancy and building expenses for the quarter. We now expect our second half 2010 expenses to come in near the top end of our prior guidance of $573 million to $583 million, with the one-time cost of the error in trade and higher deferred compensation pushing us to that level.
In the non-operating income and expense category, investment income was up $8 million, sequentially, due to a $3 million increase in the BM&FBOVESPA dividend plus the $5 million in deferred comp earnings mentioned earlier. Equity and losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries reflect a $2 million increase, due to writing down to zero our investment OneChicago, our single-stock futures JV.
In the third quarter, we paid down $300 million of debt, bringing our total debt to $2.5 billion, which reduced interest expense by $2 million. Our debt to EBITDA ratio is now under 1.3x. A detailed illustration of our debt structure is included in our earnings slide. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $613 million of cash in marketable securities on our balance sheet. For the quarter, our effective tax rate was 41.2%, and we expect our tax rate to fall between 41% and 42% in total for the year. 
Capital expenditures net of lease hold improvement allowances totaled $44 million in the third quarter, driven primarily by hardware and software purchases tied to the migration of our Globex trading system to our new data center, additional investment in the data center related to our co-location offering, as well as continued build out of our office facility. We expect our capital expenditures to come in near the low end of our full year guidance of $180 million to $200 million. 
Turning to recent volumes. So far in October, ADV is tracking a similar level to Q3 at 11.4 million contracts up 9% compared to the same time frame last year. In summary, we added to our solid 2010 financial performance in the third quarter. So far this year, we have generated over $800 million of cash earnings while investing significantly in growth initiatives and paying down $400 million of debt. We are well on our way to returning excess capital to shareholders as early as next year. So I'll now open up the call for your questions. In order to get to everyone, we are limiting all of you to one question and one follow-up, and please feel free to get back in the queue if time permits."

One of the things that we are working together on, and which has been very successful, is that as customers begin to become active in the BM&FBOVESPA market through our order-routing linkage, they also then do gravitate toward actual co-location where they are participating kind of directly on a co-location basis in the Brazilian market. So that's beneficial to both of us as well and we collaborate in that sort of transitioning from just pure order routing to direct access through co-location. We're continuing to see interest in that building. We have a pipeline of participants who are becoming increasingly aware of the efficiencies and the value of accessing the BM&FBOVESPA market. So I do think there's a lot of continued sort of benefits there. You've seen us working with other exchanges as well on cross listing of products in different currencies and that's certainly another area of opportunity for us in terms of BM&FBOVESPA. And then just lastly, I would say that we're making great progress on the development of our new multi-asset class trading platforms, which ultimately will be deployed by BM&FBOVESPA and I think the increase for the scalability and capacity and speed advances of that new platform should be further attractive to our customer base."

And so we do have significant number of people deployed on that, that's been true for a couple years now, both as it relates to interest rate swaps clearing as well as credit default swaps clearing, which is still I think in a very early stage particularly in the dealer to client sort of segment, so that's an area where we do have substantial resources devoted. Although I would point out that these are existing resources that also support the operation and growth of our core business activities as well. On the FX side, obviously we're also waiting to see ultimately kind of what develops in terms of whether the exemptive authority by the Treasury Secretary will be exercised in order to treat foreign exchange swaps or options or forward differently than other financial swap instruments. I don't have any particular insights into that. I've seen the arguments on both sides. But that will be something that will be awaiting just as the rest of the market is as well.

It doesn't need a law to mandate it. As Craig said, we did not pursue mandating any of these things to begin with.

I'll be discussing our performance in the third quarter and providing updates on a few of our strategic initiatives before turning things over to Jamie to review the financials. CME posted soli",1873,"Thank you, John, and thank you for joining us this morning. I'll be discussing our performance in the third quarter and providing updates on a few of our strategic initiatives before turning things over to Jamie to review the financials. 
CME posted solid third quarter results with average daily volume up 14% from the same period last year. Net income of 21% to $244 million and earnings per share of $3.66, up 20%. The foundation of our performance lies in our product diversity. Energy and metals contribute 32% of transaction fee revenues; interest rates, 27%; equities, 21%; and foreign exchange and commodity products contribute the remainder. 
The breadth and diversity of our product line is beneficial when we face macro-economic headwinds, in particular, market segment. Importantly, I'll note that though we've seen volume performance within the individual asset classes vary throughout the year, we have continued to see open interest build from quarter-to-quarter in everyone of our product lines. Open interest currently sits at 92.4 million contracts, up 12% compared to the same period last year and just below the all-time record of 95 million.
To review some of our volume statistics, third quarter average daily volume was up 14% versus the same period last year and was down 15% versus the second quarter of this year, due to extraordinary performance in Q2 and the typical impacts of seasonality during July and August.
Turning to interest rates. Diminished activity in short-term rates was significantly offset by strong growth in our Treasury products, as I will describe in a moment. Average daily Eurodollar volume was down 7%, however, longer dated Eurodollar contracts with expirations beyond September 2012 saw record average daily volume of 320,000 contracts, up 32% from the prior year as there continues to be more volatility at the long end of the curve. Eurodollar Mid-Curve options, which are short-dated expirations on longer-dated futures contracts, have also experienced impressive volume growth this quarter from approximately 6,000 average daily volume last year to 87,000 this quarter and with open interest growing from 330,000 contracts to 1.2 million contracts today at quarter end. 
Importantly, Eurodollar open interest across the whole yield curve continues to grow including in the first two years. While short-term interest rates continued to be affected by monetary policy, it is important to recognize that Eurodollar products represent only 12% of total transaction fees at CME Group. 
As I mentioned, Treasury products had a very strong third quarter with average daily volumes up 38% in futures and with options volumes up 62%. As we've seen expectations for interest rate increases move out on the curve, products at the longer end of the curve are seeing greater activity. An additional positive to the strong Treasury volume is that the Treasury's rate for contract is generally higher than that Eurodollar RPC. We continue also to successfully innovate new products and product extensions that meet customer needs and enhance our performance in this segment of our business. We've had tremendous success with our Ultra Long Bond Treasury features, which posted average daily volumes of 33,000 contracts in Q3 and open interest of 222,000 contracts. 
Just this week, we also launched our on-the-run Treasury futures contracts, which our customers are very excited about. The robust liquidity and diverse customer base in our core Treasury products enabled us to effectively develop these product extensions, which in turn allows us to provide our customers with more trading opportunities at CME Group. 
In other product areas, average daily volume in our equity products was up 6% for the quarter, outperforming cash equity market volume and reflecting asset allocation preferences and the outflow of funds from equities to fixed income market throughout 2010. 
Average daily volume in our FX products was up 31% over third quarter last year and open interest trends remained positive with current levels at a near record of $1.6 million. Growth in CME FX is coming from diverse sources. We saw 40% volume growth in the Australian and Canadian dollar markets, which historically had been less actively traded currency pairs at CME. Additionally, FX activity was up 54% during non-U.S. trading hours and this asset class continues to be our fastest growing segment during non-U.S. hours.  FX options also continued to perform extremely well with average daily volume up 182% over third quarter 2009 and open interest growth of 101% versus the same period a year ago.
Finally, another positive indicator for our FX business came out of the recently released BIS tri-annual survey, which shows that the global FX market grew 20% from April 2007 to April 2010, while CME FX volume grew 94% in that same period, clearly demonstrating the increasing importance of our products to the global FX marketplace. 
The BIS survey also indicated that global FX options declined 2%, while CME FX option volumes grew 250%. We believe there are three factors driving this out performance. First, CME central counter-party clearing, which enables wider participation by a diverse set of buy-side customers. Second, our significantly expanding liquidity across a broad range of CME currency pairs as our FX markets have indeed become a major source of liquidity in global FX market. And third, electronic access to both futures and options on our CME Globex electronic trading platform. Together, these factors should continue to drive growth in our FX business.
To round out our other asset classes, our agricultural commodity, energy and metals products have all shown outstanding growth year-to-date and also are on track for a strong fourth quarter. These products tend to earn our highest rates per contract but growth here is very accretive. Agricultural commodities had a strong quarter with volumes up 33% versus last year, led by outstanding growth in corn and wheat volumes of 56% and 72% respectively. Energy was up 12% to 1.7 million contracts per day, our second highest quarterly volume and energy open interest remains at near record levels.
Finally, metals average daily volume was up 28%. I'd also like to touch on continued growth in international volumes in our core product lines. During the third quarter, we saw strong growth of 37% in Globex volumes during non-U.S. hours. Volume from our various international hubs also grew 15% compared to the same quarter a year ago and now represents 15% of overall Globex volume. We continued to focus on globalization of our core business as we expect growth in emerging markets to outpace growth in more developed markets.
One example of our commitment to achieving growth from globalization is our recently announced enhancements to our global client development and sales organization. Our new structure will better enable us to cross sell all CME Group products and services to our global customers, while also allowing us to better understand and meet the needs of our largest customer segments including banks, intermediaries, asset managers, hedge funds, proprietary trading firms and of course commercial participant. The new structure has been designed to better target cross asset sales across client segments to drive international growth, specifically in Asia and Europe, and to generate new client participation across all regions. The ultimate goal is to more effectively serve our clients and enhance our global sales and marketing efforts for the entire suite of CME Group products. 
During the quarter, we hired a new head of Global Client Development and Sales, Alice Hacket, former Managing Director and Co-Head of Global Prime Finance at Citigroup. Alice joins us and will oversee our worldwide clients development and sales efforts.
Moving on to our strategic initiatives, we were very pleased to extend our OTC clearing services into interest rate on October 18. This offering provides the extensive counter party, risk reduction and transparency of CME clearing while preserving the prevailing execution processes, technology platform and economic structures used in the bilateral IRS market today. As the Clearing Only provider in this space, we are execution-agnostic and offer operational flexibility to our customers by accepting trades from a variety of venues. 
Finally, as we continue to build our OTC offerings and other asset classes, CME Group has a significant lead in providing a comprehensive multi-asset class clearing solutions to the market for the maximum operational ease and capital efficiency that comes with connecting to a single clearing house. 
To date, we've cleared $660 million in interest rates swaps and have $648 million in open interest, with participation across a wide variety of firms. We see this effort as being in the very early stages and recognize that many clients are waiting for greater clarity on final rules before moving forward with cleared interest rate swaps. Currently, we're focused on delivering key additions to the offering in order to make it possible for more users to access our services. Some of the details we are working towards include receiving approval for a structure to allow cross margining with exchange-traded futures and options and finalizing regulatory approvals allowing certain types of mutual funds post collateral. We are also working on expanding the product scope to offer more product flexibility and swaps denominated in additional currencies. 
I'd also like to share an update on the development of our co-location services offering for all CME Group customers. Our offering will allow customers to co-locate their servers in CME Group's new state-of-the-art data center. Co-location will create the lowest possible latency hosting environment for our customers. The offering is available to all customers and all customers will be treated equally with transparent and market-based pricing. 
Equidistant access points will also ensure fair and equal access. The uptake during our initial application period has been positive, and we are in the process of allocating space to our customers. Once customers' base for this space is allocated, we will begin to build out the facilities and are planning for an early 2012 go-live date. Based on current indications of interest from our customers, we expect this service to add approximately $30 million to $40 million in revenue in 2012 and to further scale from there.
Finally, I'd like to offer a brief regulatory update. We are participating actively in the Dodd-Frank rule-making processes being undertaken by the CFTC and other financial and markets regulators. Our team is working with them and our customers to ensure that new regulations create a fair and level playing field for all market participants and that U.S. markets are not disadvantaged compared to other global markets centers. The CFTC and other regulators will be issuing a real proposal in many areas over the next few months. Like many of you, we are already engaging in the public comment process and anticipate a robust and healthy dialogue about the many issues that regulators are addressing. We will continue to keep you posted on these critical topics as they develop. 
In conclusion, CME Group continues to be successful in managing our core business and executing on our strategies to further globalize our entire business and expand our capabilities into OTC market. While the macroeconomic climate has been challenging for everyone, our performance over the past two years has proven that we can leverage our diverse product set to deliver results in a variety of cyclical and economic environments. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jamie."

We delivered $443 million of operating",755,"Thank you, Craig. CME Group posted solid third quarter financial results with average daily volume of 11.6 million contracts per day, up 14% versus Q3 of last year, driving a 13% increase in revenue to $733 million. We delivered $443 million of operating income, a 60% operating margin, diluted earnings per share of $3.66.
The overall rate per contract decreased 3% to $0.81 compared with $0.0834 in the third quarter of 2009, due to higher growth from members versus non-members in higher-tiered discounts. Sequentially, the rate per contract increased 3% due to favorable mix factors including a stronger participation from our highest paying non-members.
Market data revenue of $101 million for the quarter was down less than 1%, compared to Q2, due to a decrease in the Dow Jones Indexes revenue attributable primarily to lower equity assets under management. Drivers to CME, CBOT and NYMEX data increased their activity somewhat in Q3 with the total terminal count of slightly to 385,000. This was the first increase in sequential screen count since Q2 of 2008 signaling some stabilization relative to the trend we have seen since the credit crisis began.
Lastly, with respect to the other revenue line in Q3, we recognized $5.1 million from BM&FBOVESPA related to a build out of our multi-asset class trading platform.
I'll now take a few minutes to review expenses. Drilling into Q3 expenses, compensation and benefits was $110 million, up $7 million from the prior quarter. $5.1 million of this increase was based on a sequential change in deferred compensation expense. Remember there is a one-for-one offset in the investment income line for this item so there's no bottom line impact. In addition, our combined headcount at the end of Q3 stood at 2,520, an increase of 60 people during the third quarter, reflecting our continued investment in growth opportunities.
Q3 marketing and other expense included approximately $4.7 million related to resolving customer losses associated with the CME Globex and trade issue which occurred in September, while there were a $2.1 million tax and operating accrual adjustment which decreased occupancy and building expenses for the quarter. We now expect our second half 2010 expenses to come in near the top end of our prior guidance of $573 million to $583 million, with the one-time cost of the error in trade and higher deferred compensation pushing us to that level.
In the non-operating income and expense category, investment income was up $8 million, sequentially, due to a $3 million increase in the BM&FBOVESPA dividend plus the $5 million in deferred comp earnings mentioned earlier. Equity and losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries reflect a $2 million increase, due to writing down to zero our investment OneChicago, our single-stock futures JV.
In the third quarter, we paid down $300 million of debt, bringing our total debt to $2.5 billion, which reduced interest expense by $2 million. Our debt to EBITDA ratio is now under 1.3x. A detailed illustration of our debt structure is included in our earnings slide. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $613 million of cash in marketable securities on our balance sheet. For the quarter, our effective tax rate was 41.2%, and we expect our tax rate to fall between 41% and 42% in total for the year. 
Capital expenditures net of lease hold improvement allowances totaled $44 million in the third quarter, driven primarily by hardware and software purchases tied to the migration of our Globex trading system to our new data center, additional investment in the data center related to our co-location offering, as well as continued build out of our office facility. We expect our capital expenditures to come in near the low end of our full year guidance of $180 million to $200 million. 
Turning to recent volumes. So far in October, ADV is tracking a similar level to Q3 at 11.4 million contracts up 9% compared to the same time frame last year. In summary, we added to our solid 2010 financial performance in the third quarter. So far this year, we have generated over $800 million of cash earnings while investing significantly in growth initiatives and paying down $400 million of debt. We are well on our way to returning excess capital to shareholders as early as next year. So I'll now open up the call for your questions. In order to get to everyone, we are limiting all of you to one question and one follow-up, and please feel free to get back in the queue if time permits."

We're confident that we have a range of alternatives that will continue to make ClearPort very valuable to customers.

I have always said for a long time now, especially when I testify in D.C. as it relates to high-frequency trading, these people are truly liquidity providers.

So when I go to Congress and remind them that most participants in the U.S. equity market or anything else, they are not competing for the build offer; they're competing for their portfolio risk management for six weeks, six months or six years, they need to have that deep liquidity and that's exactly what HFT traders provide. And when you walk them through how they provide this liquidity, the regulators and legislators start to get it. So it's a new phenomenon in high-frequency trading and I think people are trying to understand that more than anything else, so the natural thing is when you don't understand something is to blame something.

You clearly see people moving farther up the yield curve and so we are benefited by the diversity of the range of interest-rate products that we've provide and certainly the increased activity in treasuries, which has been substantial, has helped to ameliorate or offset some of the difficulties in the kind of short-term interest rate market in Eurodollar futures but I'll go back to the point that I made before which is we're seeing open interest building significantly in all of our interest-rate products including, even in the very near-term, short-term contract, so we'll wait and see sort of what the sort of the next round of quantitative easing really involves, but I guess it's very difficult for me to speculate on what that means for volume and what other factors might come into play that could be either incrementally positive or negative for interest rates."
