Thanks for joining us for this year end teleconference call. I have Mike Walen with me, Scott Schroeder, Jeff Hutton and Chuck Smyth. Before we start, let me say the standard boilerplate forward-looking statements in",2996,"Thank you, Stephanie and good morning. Thanks for joining us for this year end teleconference call. I have Mike Walen with me, Scott Schroeder, Jeff Hutton and Chuck Smyth. Before we start, let me say the standard boilerplate forward-looking statements included on the press release as applied in my comments today. At this time, we do have many things to cover and expand on from three press releases that were issued last night, I'll briefly cover the year-end financials, year-end reserve metrics and then a more in-depth discussion on the operations and our plans for 2010. We'll make every effort to be brief to allow ample time for questions.Cabot Oil & Gas reported strong financial results for the year, with earnings just under $150 million. And with cash flow exceeding $600 million, the company was able to pursue its investment objectives and deliver growth, while still maintaining a strong financial structure. From a clean earning perspective, net income was $178 million. The selected items include a loss on sale, impairment, stock compensation and mark-to-market for 2012 basis hedges. Debt decreased slightly from 2008 levels to $805 million and our capitalization ratio remains around 30%. The producing property impairment relates to two fields, one was in the Rockies and the other in South Texas. All in all, really after a turbulent start of the year due to the world economic condition, these 2009 results fall into the top quartile for our historic results.Let's move to reserve metrics, from a value added perspective, one of the key metrics to any organization's growth in our industry [ph] is the ability to stack up reserves at an economic investment level. Cabot once again was successful, growing reserves 6% year over year after fully complying with the new SEC reserve rules. Of the old methodology, reserve growth would've been 17%. The company was able to add 463 Bcfe before production and revision adjustments for the year, all from our organic effort.  With all of the 2009 increases coming from our organic program, the corresponding drilling and funding [ph] cost was $0.83 per Mcfe. Let me get a bit more grain or as it relates to reserves. Clearly, the significant noise in the interpretation of the new rules, what Cabot did was remove all our vintage PUDs that fell outside of the five-year development window, in other words, the PUDs put prior to 2005. The only exception is 16 Bcfe, which are delayed by external factors.In terms of the expanded PUD definition that has been translated by industry into significant PUD bookings, we look at it as a balancing act future capital needs, finding cost metrics of our long-term and a realistic assessment of how much PUD drilling we want in our future programs. Cabot's new reserve benchmark is just under 2.1 Tcfe. The company replaced 450% of its production at a finding cost of $1.28 in Mcfe. This finding cost includes a capital investment on leases including Susquehanna County, which will certainly pay dividends for years to come. Excluding these lease investments, the company's finding cost fell below the $1 mark at $0.97 per Mcfe. The company still maintains a modest PUD booking level of only 36%.As a sensitivity under the old methodology, Cabot would record reserves of just under 2.3 Tcfe or up 17% year-over-year. The new standard impacts the company's year-end reserves and the revision category by reducing our reserves by 222 Bcfe, which is partially offset by 22 Bcfe positive performance revision. This revision reflects two requirements. First, instead of using the December 31 price of $5.79, under the new SEC rules, the company must now utilize the average price for the first of each month, which is $3.87 for 2009. This 1/3 drop in natural gas price reduces the company's 2009 reserves by 102 Bcfe, all being tail reserves. Clearly, Cabot's reserve bookings at 98% natural gas adversely impacted year-end reserves more so than oil renames [ph] had actually experienced a higher oil price under the new SEC rules.The second SEC change impacting this year's reserves is the enforcement of the comment that proved undeveloped reserves must be developed within five years from initial booking. Our enormous drillings success in PA and East Texas, the company has allocated its capital program to primarily develop those assets requiring a deferral of previously booked PUDs out beyond the five-year window. This change in development strategy requires the company to reclassify 120 Bcfe reserves from the proved undeveloped category to the probable category.  Fortunately for Cabot, all of these related to areas where the acreage is held by production.From our investment program during the year, we added over 30,000 acres to our leasehold in Pennsylvania and East Texas. Both of these areas continue to see significant levels of activity. 70% of the 2010 program focused in Pennsylvania and the remainder in East Texas. In terms of production, the company reached a milestone with full-year production number of 103 Bcfe or 8% increase over 2008. Last night, we posted updates to our guidance for 2010, that held our guidance growth rate, 18% to 22%. In regards to our 2010 expense guidance, we did adjust for DD&A to take into account reserve changes and the additional lease amortization.Let's move to operations. 2009 was an eventful year, a pivotal year for Cabot, as the company was almost purely a resource-driven company. It was the first year where a vast majority of our investment was earmarked for reputable low-risk targets in East Texas and the Marcellus Shale in Northeastern PA. Our total 2009 capital program was split 60-40 in each area, respectively. Now let's move to Marcellus. This area is the centerpiece for Cabot's future strategy. It is developing into a true company maker, and it's a world-class resource. Early on, we were conservative with our judgment regarding the potential of this play, now it has met and exceeded all our expectations. And we know it will be a driving force for Cabot for years to come. Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation's leased over 190,000 gross and net acres in the Northeast PA play with most of that acreage focused in Susquehanna County. By and large, we have five year renewable leases with a 12.5% royalty. Our strategy was from day one, to focus on one area where we believe the geology supported an effort to concentrate our leasing, knowing that all of Marcellus acreage is not created equally. Subsequently, we were able to mass essentially a single block of Marcellus acreage. We're confident that this strategy will result in growing efficiencies and drilling completions and pipelining as the play expands.During 2009, we drilled 30 horizontal wells. We have 14 of those wells in line. We utilized up to six fit-for-purpose rigs to accomplish the program. Our well cost have stayed relatively constant between $3.5 million to $3.8 million completed depending on the length of the laterals and the number of stimulation stages.  Since the first of 2009, our drilling best practices program has reduced the time to reach total depth on a horizontal well, approximately 62% to 21 days. More work needs to be done to reduce further the cost. We view this accomplishment as certainly a good start. Now let's talk about the bottom-line production and reserves. We're very pleased with the results of our well so far. We ended 2009 producing about 72 million cubic foot of gas per day. Average delays due to weather and delays associated with a pipeline right away stream [ph] crossing permits somewhat reduced our 2009 exit rates. We estimate that just weighing on the stream crossing permits delayed approximately 10 million cubic foot of gas per day from two wells. Anyway, with those issues resolved, we can report that our current gross production rate is greater than 100 million cubic foot of gas per day flowing through our Teel Station. The majority of that coming from just 19 horizontal wells .Also at this time, we had 22 additional wells that are waiting to be cased and completed. 17 of these 22 are horizontal wells. Obviously, the Marcellus is an exceptional reservoir. Our 2009 program had an IP average of 7.5 million per day and a 30 day average of 6.9 million cubic foot per day. The estimated ultimate recovery has increased from 4.5 Bcfe to north of 5.5 Bcfe per well. We've seen no diminishing results as we step out and feel that our drilling and that of our peers has essentially de-risked our entire acreage block. There's a room for enhancing our programs, certainly, we think there is. We have achieved these results while completing laterals that average only 2,800 feet so far, with an average of eight stimulation stages. As we lengthen our laterals, and we recently finished one at 4,500 feet, and we increase our frac stages, which we plan on getting up to about 15, we expect to realize continued improvement in rates and EURs. The upside is definitely there as we recently completed our last well with a 39-foot lateral, 12-stage simulation and is flowing to fill 16.1 million a day in over 1,600 pounds flow-casing [ph]  Pressure.We plan to expand our program to approximately 73 horizontal wells in 2010 with a proposed plan of 100 wells in 2011. We will expand our drilling fleet by approximately two rigs per year going forward to meet this goal. We also anticipate that this program will yield over a tripling of our 2010 productions and a doubling again of our production in 2011. A new rig [ph] to the Marcellus play has also emerged. As you may recall, we mentioned that future developments may be impacted with the potential horizontal completion in the upper Marcellus and the Purcell limestone. The Purcell lies between the upper and lower Marcellus. In some ways, it allocates to the middle bakken in North Dakota. We had an initiative to drill a horizontal Purcell well last year, and just recently completed that well and started flowing back. We're very pleased with the results today. The well has a 30 day average of 7.3 million cubic foot per day. We ran a micro-sized survey. As we stimulated the well and found the stimulation had predominantly gone to the Purcell and the upper Marcellus. While this is still early,  it might suggest that we will be able to access the reservoirs without interfering with our lower Marcellus development. That may mean that additional horizontal wells targeting these intervals will be placed on our current and future pads.  While still early, this revelation may suggest an increase in as the resource potential on our acreage. Additional testing is obviously planned in the future to evaluate this thesis. Physical takeaway and firm pipeline capacity continues to expand. We have recently tweaked our Teel Station and can now physically produce approximately 110 million cubic foot per day. Our Lathrop Station is under way also. Our plan is to have that station at a point free flow into sales by early March, weather permitting. And the initial compression set up is expected to be competed in May, capable of flowing and 60 million cubic foot per day. At that time with final stage finished, and they're ready for sales in August at a total rate of 165 million cubic foot per day.The company's Marcellus operation will have a total physical capacity of 275 million cubic foot per day at that time in August. Remember that we are moving pipeline quality gas, and therefore, did not have to install extensive and time-consuming liquid-stripping plants. Today, the company has 95 million cubic per day of firm pipeline capacity,  70 million of which is the backhaul arrangement on Tennessee pipe. Last night, we announced that we have agreed to a new pipeline expansion to the south that will move a minimum of 150 million cubic foot of our production on a firm basis to Transco. This expansion is expected in the middle of 2011, bringing our firm takeaway capacity at that time in the middle of 2011 to 275 million cubic foot per day. This is a huge positive for our operation and our expansion plans for the Marcellus.Marcellus operation is the real deal, and this expansion will fit well within our growth plan. Our first vertical well was completed in July of 2007 at about 1 million cubic foot per day. First horizontal, December 2008 at 6.4 million cubic foot per day. Production year end 2008, 16 million a day; production year end 2009, 72 million a day; and today, as I've mentioned, we are over 100 million cubic foot today with a significant backlog of wells ready to be completed. Firm production is coming from only 48 wells. Of those, 19 are horizontal. Also, we had 1,500 to 2,000 locations remaining to do build in this area. We'll be in the Marcellus, in this area for many years to come.Now let's move to East Texas. The focus of our East Texas activity is obviously on Haynesville Shale, the outstanding results of the common resource borough as well, which we had a 42% and the Devon Cardell, which we took an overwriting royalty interest in service activity in the area. Cabot Oil & Gas drilled it's first operated Haynesville horizontal shale well over the new year. The well is a total depth and has encased.  Completion operations are now underway. We will report test results as they are available.  We had hoped to report those results today, but completion services had tightened up considerably in this particular area since we started of 2010. When we get somewhat a result of the drill in case wells at the end of 2009 and then now going to completion. Additionally, Cabot is this participating with our third Haynesville AMI well where Cabot has 20% working interest and a fourth AMI well where we have 29% working interest third last week. Additionally, we have committed to join three other outside operating wells in the area, and we'll spot our second operating well in March. Cabot holds approximately 63,000 gross, 33,000 net acres in the Haynesville play with comparable holding around 50% 60% working interest and these wells do eat up a lot of resources at 10 million plus each.In our Mountain [ph] area, Cabot has recently completed our confirmation well offsetting the tail of horizontal tests. We had drilled last year. This will has a 30 day average of 5.9 million cubic foot per day with estimated gross reserves of approximately six Bcf. Our initial well up there had an EUR of 6.7 Bcf. Drilling and finding cost of these wells is about $1.49 in Mcfe with excellent rate of returns even at $5. In fact, the economics of these wells is second only to our Marcellus well in the company portfolio. We've identified at least 50 additional locations on our many acreage and we're currently drilling our third horizontal well.  The company completed two Pettet 2010 oil wells with an average IPO of 840 barrels a day and 2.1 million cubic for today. We have drilled 11 Pettets this year with one well flowing back,  with two wells completed, two drilling and four wells to be drilled. In the James, we had a couple of completions in the County Line area. These wells were tested at 8.8 million and 7.8 million per day. Four more wells are waiting on completion and four are planned for the rest of 2010. I'm sure you're wondering where and if Cabot would show up in the Eagle Ford play. We have been studying the play for a while. We've actually drilled our first well in the up tip portion of the oil lake. That well has been cased and is being stimulated as we speak. We will report the result of that operation at a later date.To date, we had 38,000 and about 33,000 net acres under lease and have another 28,000 acres that were in final negotiations in the Eagle Ford. This acreage is located either in the drag-ass [ph] window or the oil window. We continue to lease and expand our position while certainly waiting with anticipation of the results of our first wildcat. The budget we've prepared in October of 2008, 2009 for our 2010 year program using $5.50 per gas, $55 per oil remains intact although we have added an option for additional lease and seismic acquisition. This is continued on success and if successful, the program would move up our capital program by about $65 million.  This forecast would put it at approximately $650 million, including the land acquisition. Approximately 70% is going to be focused in the North region. The drilling component remains similar to that reported in October at $443 million. This forecast together with the addition of our and 2010 hedges above budget is now estimated at 116% of our anticipated cash flow. With our balance sheet, this is well within our comfort zone. In terms of hedges, we did add to our position, which means, we are now hedged for 2010 at approximately 33% of our anticipated midpoint production.One last point I do want to bring up before I get the questions, I'd be remiss. I did not take this opportunity to thank Mike Walen and Chuck Smyth for the many years of dedicated service to Cabot. Mike, has certainly seen and experienced many significant events in our history, most of which, he was directly involved in or in some cases, fully responsible for. We want to thank him for all his efforts. We will miss him, but we do have him for a couple more months. Chuck, as our Principal Accounting Officer has seen a lot of changes in his tenure in the accounting world, and through it all, he always made a comfortable with the final product. And Chuck, I want to thank you for that also. Stephanie, with those comments, I will turn it back to you for any questions."

We do find ourselves kind of at a maximum rate between now and when we get the Lathrop Station fully operational. But we do expect in the middle of March, once we got our plumbing hooked up, were not going to have full compression capabilities. But in March, we should be able to enhance and flow through that system about additional 65 million cubic foot. And then, as we move into May with hooking up all the compression be able to up and increase that number. So our number's going to be fairly steady and not just kind of backloaded."

Before we start, let me say the standard boilerplate forward-looking statements in",2996,"Thank you, Stephanie and good morning. Thanks for joining us for this year end teleconference call. I have Mike Walen with me, Scott Schroeder, Jeff Hutton and Chuck Smyth. Before we start, let me say the standard boilerplate forward-looking statements included on the press release as applied in my comments today. At this time, we do have many things to cover and expand on from three press releases that were issued last night, I'll briefly cover the year-end financials, year-end reserve metrics and then a more in-depth discussion on the operations and our plans for 2010. We'll make every effort to be brief to allow ample time for questions.Cabot Oil & Gas reported strong financial results for the year, with earnings just under $150 million. And with cash flow exceeding $600 million, the company was able to pursue its investment objectives and deliver growth, while still maintaining a strong financial structure. From a clean earning perspective, net income was $178 million. The selected items include a loss on sale, impairment, stock compensation and mark-to-market for 2012 basis hedges. Debt decreased slightly from 2008 levels to $805 million and our capitalization ratio remains around 30%. The producing property impairment relates to two fields, one was in the Rockies and the other in South Texas. All in all, really after a turbulent start of the year due to the world economic condition, these 2009 results fall into the top quartile for our historic results.Let's move to reserve metrics, from a value added perspective, one of the key metrics to any organization's growth in our industry is the ability to stack up reserves at an economic investment level. Cabot once again was successful, growing reserves 6% year over year after fully complying with the new SEC reserve rules. Of the old methodology, reserve growth would've been 17%. The company was able to add 463 Bcfe before production and revision adjustments for the year, all from our organic effort.  With all of the 2009 increases coming from our organic program, the corresponding drilling and finding cost was $0.83 per Mcfe. Let me get a bit more grain or as it relates to reserves. Clearly, the significant noise in the interpretation of the new rules, what Cabot did was remove all our vintage PUDs that fell outside of the five-year development window, in other words, the PUDs put prior to 2005. The only exception is 16 Bcfe, which are delayed by external factors.In terms of the expanded PUD definition that has been translated by industry into significant PUD bookings, we look at it as a balancing act future capital needs, finding cost metrics of our long-term and a realistic assessment of how much PUD drilling we want in our future programs. Cabot's new reserve benchmark is just under 2.1 Tcfe. The company replaced 450% of its production at a finding cost of $1.28 in Mcfe. This finding cost includes a capital investment on leases including Susquehanna County, which will certainly pay dividends for years to come. Excluding these lease investments, the company's finding cost fell below the $1 mark at $0.97 per Mcfe. The company still maintains a modest PUD booking level of only 36%.As a sensitivity under the old methodology, Cabot would record reserves of just under 2.3 Tcfe or up 17% year-over-year. The new standard impacts the company's year-end reserves and the revision category by reducing our reserves by 222 Bcfe, which is partially offset by 22 Bcfe positive performance revision. This revision reflects two requirements. First, instead of using the December 31 price of $5.79, under the new SEC rules, the company must now utilize the average price for the first of each month, which is $3.87 for 2009. This 1/3 drop in natural gas price reduces the company's 2009 reserves by 102 Bcfe, all being tail reserves. Clearly, Cabot's reserve bookings at 98% natural gas adversely impacted year-end reserves more so than oil renames [ph] had actually experienced a higher oil price under the new SEC rules.The second SEC change impacting this year's reserves is the enforcement of the comment that proved undeveloped reserves must be developed within five years from initial booking. Our enormous drillings success in PA and East Texas, the company has allocated its capital program to primarily develop those assets requiring a deferral of previously booked PUDs out beyond the five-year window. This change in development strategy requires the company to reclassify 120 Bcfe reserves from the proved undeveloped category to the probable category.  Fortunately for Cabot, all of these related to areas where the acreage is held by production.From our investment program during the year, we added over 30,000 acres to our leasehold in Pennsylvania and East Texas. Both of these areas continue to see significant levels of activity. 70% of the 2010 program focused in Pennsylvania and the remainder in East Texas. In terms of production, the company reached a milestone with full-year production number of 103 Bcfe or 8% increase over 2008. Last night, we posted updates to our guidance for 2010, that held our guidance growth rate, 18% to 22%. In regards to our 2010 expense guidance, we did adjust for DD&A to take into account reserve changes and the additional lease amortization.Let's move to operations. 2009 was an eventful year, a pivotal year for Cabot, as the company was almost purely a resource-driven company. It was the first year where a vast majority of our investment was earmarked for reputable low-risk targets in East Texas and the Marcellus Shale in Northeastern PA. Our total 2009 capital program was split 60-40 in each area, respectively. Now let's move to the Marcellus. This area is the centerpiece for Cabot's future strategy. It is developing into a true company maker, and it's a world-class resource. Early on, we were conservative with our judgment regarding the potential of this play. Now it has met and exceeded all our expectations. And we know it will be a driving force for Cabot for years to come. Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation has leased over 190,000 gross and net acres in the Northeast PA play, with most of that acreage focused in Susquehanna County. By and large, we have five-year renewable leases with a 12 1/2% royalty. Our strategy was from day one, to focus on one area where we believe the geology supported an effort to concentrate our leasing, knowing that all of Marcellus acreage is not created equally. Subsequently, we were able to mass essentially a single block of Marcellus acreage. We're confident that this strategy will result in growing efficiencies and drilling completions and pipelining as the play expands.During 2009, we drilled 30 horizontal wells. We have 14 of those wells in line. We utilized up to six fit-for-purpose rigs to accomplish the program. Our well cost have stayed relatively constant between, say, $3.5 million to $3.8 million completed depending on the length of the laterals and the number of stimulation stages.  Since the first of 2009, our drilling best practices program has reduced the time to reach total depth on a horizontal well approximately 62% to 21 days. More work needs to be done to reduce further the cost. We view this accomplishment as certainly a good start. Now let's talk about the bottom line production and reserves. We're very pleased with the results of our well so far. We ended 2009 producing about 72 million cubic foot of gas per day. Our average delay is due to weather and delays associated with a pipeline right away. Stream-crossing permits somewhat reduced our 2009 exit rates. We estimate that just waiting on the stream-crossing permit delayed approximately 10 million cubic foot of gas per day from two wells. Anyway, with those issues resolved, we can report that our current gross production rate is greater than 100 million cubic foot of gas per day flowing through our Teel Station, the majority of that coming from just 19 horizontal wells .Also at this time, we have 22 additional wells that are waiting to be cased and completed. 17 of these 22 are horizontal wells. Obviously, the Marcellus is an exceptional reservoir. Our 2009 program had an IP average of 7.5 million per day and a 30-day average of 6.9 million cubic foot per day. The estimated ultimate recovery has increased from 4.5 Bcfe to north of 5.5 Bcfe per well. We've seen no diminishing results as we step out and feel that our drilling and that of our peers has essentially derisked our entire acreage block. There's a room for enhancing our programs. Certainly, we think there is. We have achieved these results while completing laterals that average only 2,800 feet so far, with an average of eight stimulation stages. As we lengthen our laterals, and we recently finished one at 4,500 feet, and we increase our frac stages, which we plan on getting up to about 15, we expect to realize continued improvement in rates and EURs. The upside is definitely there, as we recently completed our last well with a 39-foot lateral, 12-stage stimulation and it flowed and is flowing to fill 16.1 million a day in over 1,600 pounds flow casing pressure.We plan to expand our program to approximately 73 horizontal wells in 2010 with a proposed plan of 100 wells in 2011. We will expand our drilling fleet by approximately two rigs per year going forward to meet this goal. We also anticipate that this program will yield over a tripling of our 2010 productions and a doubling again of our production in 2011. A new angle to the Marcellus play has also emerged. As you may recall, we mentioned that future developments may be impacted with the potential horizontal completion in the upper Marcellus and the Purcell limestone. The Purcell lies between the upper and lower Marcellus. In some ways, it allocates to the middle bakken in North Dakota. We had an initiative to drill a horizontal Purcell well last year, and just recently completed that well and started flowing back. We're very pleased with the results today. The well has a 30 day average of 7.3 million cubic foot per day. We ran a micro-sized survey. As we stimulated the well and found the stimulation had predominantly gone to the Purcell and the upper Marcellus. While this is still early,  it might suggest that we will be able to access the reservoirs without interfering with our lower Marcellus development. That may mean that additional horizontal wells targeting these intervals will be placed on our current and future pads.  While still early, this revelation may suggest an increase in as the resource potential on our acreage. Additional testing is obviously planned in the future to evaluate this thesis. Physical takeaway and firm pipeline capacity continues to expand. We have recently tweaked our Teel Station and can now physically produce approximately 110 million cubic foot per day. Our Lathrop Station is under way also. Our plan is to have that station at a point free flow into sales by early March, weather permitting. And the initial compression set up is expected to be competed in May, capable of flowing and 60 million cubic foot per day. At that time with final stage finished, and they're ready for sales in August at a total rate of 165 million cubic foot per day.The company's Marcellus operation will have a total physical capacity of 275 million cubic foot per day at that time in August. Remember that we are moving pipeline quality gas, and therefore, did not have to install extensive and time-consuming liquid-stripping plants. Today, the company has 95 million cubic per day of firm pipeline capacity,  70 million of which is the backhaul arrangement on Tennessee pipe. Last night, we announced that we have agreed to a new pipeline expansion to the south that will move a minimum of 150 million cubic foot of our production on a firm basis to Transco. This expansion is expected in the middle of 2011, bringing our firm takeaway capacity at that time in the middle of 2011 to 275 million cubic foot per day. This is a huge positive for our operation and our expansion plans for the Marcellus.Marcellus operation is the real deal, and this expansion will fit well within our growth plan. Our first vertical well was completed in July of 2007 at about 1 million cubic foot per day. First horizontal, December 2008 at 6.4 million cubic foot per day. Production year end 2008, 16 million a day; production year end 2009, 72 million a day; and today, as I've mentioned, we are over 100 million cubic foot today with a significant backlog of wells ready to be completed. Firm production is coming from only 48 wells. Of those, 19 are horizontal. Also, we had 1,500 to 2,000 locations remaining to do build in this area. We'll be in the Marcellus, in this area for many years to come.Now let's move to East Texas. The focus of our East Texas activity is obviously on Haynesville Shale, the outstanding results of the common resource borough as well, which we had a 42% and the Devon Cardell, which we took an overwriting royalty interest in service activity in the area. Cabot Oil & Gas drilled it's first operated Haynesville horizontal shale well over the new year. The well is a total depth and has encased.  Completion operations are now underway. We will report test results as they are available.  We had hoped to report those results today, but completion services had tightened up considerably in this particular area since we started of 2010. When we get somewhat a result of the drill in case wells at the end of 2009 and then now going to completion. Additionally, Cabot is this participating with our third Haynesville AMI well where Cabot has 20% working interest and a fourth AMI well where we have 29% working interest third last week. Additionally, we have committed to join three other outside operating wells in the area, and we'll spot our second operating well in March. Cabot holds approximately 63,000 gross, 33,000 net acres in the Haynesville play with comparable holding around 50% 60% working interest and these wells do eat up a lot of resources at 10 million plus each.In our Minden area, Cabot has recently completed our confirmation well offsetting the tail of horizontal tests. We had drilled last year. This will has a 30 day average of 5.9 million cubic foot per day with estimated gross reserves of approximately six Bcf. Our initial well up there had an EUR of 6.7 Bcf. Drilling and finding cost of these wells is about $1.49 in Mcfe with excellent rate of returns even at $5. In fact, the economics of these wells is second only to our Marcellus well in the company portfolio. We've identified at least 50 additional locations on our many acreage and we're currently drilling our third horizontal well.  The company completed two Pettet 2010 oil wells with an average IPO of 840 barrels a day and 2.1 million cubic for today. We have drilled 11 Pettets this year with one well flowing back,  with two wells completed, two drilling and four wells to be drilled. In the James, we had a couple of completions in the County Line area. These wells were tested at 8.8 million and 7.8 million per day. Four more wells are waiting on completion and four are planned for the rest of 2010. I'm sure you're wondering where and if Cabot would show up in the Eagle Ford play. We have been studying the play for a while. We've actually drilled our first well in the up tip portion of the oil lake. That well has been cased and is being stimulated as we speak. We will report the result of that operation at a later date.To date, we had 38,000 and about 33,000 net acres under lease and have another 28,000 acres that were in final negotiations in the Eagle Ford. This acreage is located either in the dry gas window or the oil window. We continue to lease and expand our position while certainly waiting with anticipation of the results of our first wildcat. The budget we've prepared in October of 2008, 2009 for our 2010 year program using $5.50 per gas, $55 per oil remains intact although we have added an option for additional lease and seismic acquisition. This is continued on success and if successful, the program would move up our capital program by about $65 million.  This forecast would put it at approximately $650 million, including the land acquisition. Approximately 70% is going to be focused in the North region. The drilling component remains similar to that reported in October at $443 million. This forecast together with the addition of our and 2010 hedges above budget is now estimated at 116% of our anticipated cash flow. With our balance sheet, this is well within our comfort zone. In terms of hedges, we did add to our position, which means, we are now hedged for 2010 at approximately 33% of our anticipated midpoint production.One last point I do want to bring up before I get the questions, I'd be remiss. I did not take this opportunity to thank Mike Walen and Chuck Smyth for the many years of dedicated service to Cabot. Mike, has certainly seen and experienced many significant events in our history, most of which, he was directly involved in or in some cases, fully responsible for. We want to thank him for all his efforts. We will miss him, but we do have him for a couple more months. Chuck, as our Principal Accounting Officer has seen a lot of changes in his tenure in the accounting world, and through it all, he always made a comfortable with the final product. And Chuck, I want to thank you for that also.Stephanie, with those comments, I will turn it back to you for any questions."

We do find ourselves kind of at a maximum rate between now and when we get the Lathrop Station fully operational. But we do expect in the middle of March, once we got our plumbing hooked up, were not going to have full compression capabilities. But in March, we should be able to enhance and flow through that system about additional 65 million cubic foot. And then, as we move into May with hooking up all the compression be able to up and increase that number. So our number's going to be fairly steady and not just kind of backloaded."

So it is early, but I think what's really relevant is the fact that the stimulation suggested that the fracs are going to be climbing and stimulating the Marcellus and the upper Marcellus, it doesn't appear to have everything that's growing downward into the lower Marcellus. And that would certainly suggest going forward that we would need to drill twin wells, if you will, on the same path to those lower Marcellus to access those reserves. Now this is early time. We don't have a lot of history yet, and we only have one well. So we still have to look forward cautiously. But overall, we're pretty excited about the idea that it seemed to have worked out, and we may be just be stacked in more reserves on top of the lower Marcellus potential."

Thanks for joining us for this year-end teleconference call. I have Mike Walen with me, Scott Schroeder, Jeff Hutton and Chuck Smyth. Before we start, let me say the standard boilerplate forward-looking statements i",3009,"Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning. Thanks for joining us for this year-end teleconference call. I have Mike Walen with me, Scott Schroeder, Jeff Hutton and Chuck Smyth. Before we start, let me say the standard boilerplate forward-looking statements included on the press release as applied in my comments today. At this time, we do have many things to cover and expand on from three press releases that were issued last night. I'll briefly cover the year-end financials, year-end reserve metrics and then a more in-depth discussion on the operations and our plans for 2010. We'll make every effort to be brief to allow ample time for questions.Cabot Oil & Gas reported strong financial results for the year, with earnings just under $150 million and with cash flow exceeding $600 million. The company was able to pursue its investment objectives and deliver growth, while still maintaining a strong financial structure. From a claims earning perspective, net income was $178 million. The selected items include a loss on sale, impairment, stock compensation and mark-to-market for 2012 basis hedges. Debt decreased slightly from 2008 levels to $805 million, and our capitalization ratio remains around 30%. The producing property impairment relates to two fields, one was in the Rockies, and the other in South Texas. All in all, really after a turbulent start of the year due to the world economic condition, these 2009 results fall into the top quartile for our historic results.Straight to reserve metrics. From a value-added perspective, one of the key metrics to any organization's growth in our industry is the ability to stack up reserves at an economic investment level. Cabot once again was successful, growing reserves 6% year-over-year after fully complying with the new SEC reserve rules. Under the old methodology, reserve growth would have been 17%. The company was able to add 463 Bcfe [billions of cubic feet equivalent] before production and revision adjustments for the year, all from our organic effort. With all of the 2009 increases coming from our organic program, the corresponding drilling finding cost was $0.83 per Mcfe [thousand cubic feet equivalent]. Let me get a bit more granular as it relates to reserves. Clearly, there is significant noise in the interpretation of the new rules. What Cabot did was remove all our vintage PUDs that fell outside of the five-year development window. In other words, the PUDs [Prove Undeveloped] put prior to 2005. The only exception is 16 Bcfe, which are delayed by external factors. In terms of the expanded PUD definition that has been translated by industry into significant PUD bookings, we look at it as a balancing act, future capital needs, finding cost metrics over the long term, and a realistic assessment of how much PUD drilling we want in our future programs. Cabot's new reserve benchmark is just under 2.1 Tcfe [trillion cubic feet equivalents]. The company replaced 450% of its production at a finding cost of $1.28 in Mcfe. This finding cost includes a capital investment on leases, including Susquehanna County, which will certainly pay dividends for years to come. Excluding these lease investments, the company's finding cost fell below the $1 mark at $0.97 per Mcfe. The company still maintains a modest PUD booking level of only 36%.Having sensitivity under the old methodology, Cabot would record reserves of just under 2.3 Tcfe or up 17% year-over-year. The new standard impacts the company's year-end reserves and the revision category by reducing our reserves by 222 Bcfe, which is partially offset by 22 Bcfe positive performance revision. This revision reflects two requirements. First, instead of using the December 31 price of $5.79, under the new SEC rules, the company must now utilize the average price for the first of each month, which is $3.87 for 2009. This 1/3 drop in natural gas price reduces the company's 2009 reserves by 102 Bcfe, all being tail reserves. Clearly, Cabot's reserve bookings at 98% natural gas adversely impacted year-end reserves more so than oily names that actually experienced a higher oil price under the new SEC rules.The second SEC change impacting this year's reserves is the enforcement of the requirement that proved undeveloped reserves must be developed within five years from initial booking. Our enormous drilling success in PA and East Texas, the company has allocated its capital program to primarily develop those assets requiring a deferral of previously booked PUDs out beyond the five-year window. This change in development strategy requires the company reclassify 120 Bcfe reserves from the proved undeveloped category to the probable category.  Fortunately for Cabot, all of these related to areas where the acreage is held by production.From our investment program during the year, we added over 30,000 acres to our leasehold in Pennsylvania and East Texas. Both of these areas continue to see significant levels of activity. 70% of the 2010 program focused in Pennsylvania and the remainder in East Texas. In terms of production, the company reached a milestone with full-year production number of 103 Bcfe or 8% increase over 2008. Last night, we posted updates to our guidance for 2010 that held our guidance growth rate of 18% to 22%. In regards to our 2010 expense guidance, we did adjust for DD&A [Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization] to take into account, reserve changes and the additional lease amortization.Let's move to operations. 2009 was an eventful year, a pivotal year for Cabot, as the company was almost purely a resource-driven company. It was the first year where the vast majority of our investment was earmarked for reputable low-risk targets in East Texas and the Marcellus Shale in Northeastern PA. Our total 2009 capital program was split 60-40 in each area, respectively. Now let's move to the Marcellus. This area is the centerpiece for Cabot's future strategy. It is developing into a true company maker, and it's a world-class resource. Early on, we were conservative with our judgment regarding the potential of this play. Now it has met and exceeded all our expectations, and we know it will be the driving force for Cabot for years to come. Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation has leased over 190,000 gross and net acres in the Northeast PA play, with most of that acreage focused in Susquehanna County. By and large, we have five-year renewable leases with a 12 1/2% royalty. Our strategy was from day one, to focus on one area where we believe the geology supported an effort to concentrate our leasing, knowing that all of Marcellus acreage is not created equally. Subsequently, we were able to mass essentially a single block of Marcellus acreage. We're confident that this strategy will result in growing efficiencies and drilling completions and pipelining as the play expands.During 2009, we drilled 30 horizontal wells, and have 14 of those wells in line. We utilized up to six fit-for-purpose rigs to accomplish the program. Our well cost have stayed relatively constant between, say, $3.5 million to $3.8 million completed depending on the length of the laterals and the number of stimulation stages. Since the first of 2009, our drilling best practices program has reduced the time to reach total depth on a horizontal well approximately 62% to 21 days. More work needs to be done to reduce further the cost. But we view this accomplishment as certainly a good start. Now let's talk about the bottom line production and reserves. We're very pleased with the results of our wells so far. We ended 2009 producing about 72 million cubic foot of gas per day. Our average delay is due to weather and delays associated with a pipeline right away, and stream-crossing permits somewhat reduced our 2009 exit rates. We estimate that just waiting on the stream-crossing permit delayed approximately 10 million cubic foot of gas per day from two wells. Anyway, with those issues resolved, we can report that our current gross production rate is greater than 100 million cubic foot of gas per day flowing through our Teel Station, the majority of that coming from just 19 horizontal wells.Also at this time, we have 22 additional wells that are waiting to be cased and completed. 17 of these 22 are horizontal wells. Obviously, the Marcellus is an exceptional reservoir. Our 2009 program had an IP average of 7.5 million per day and a 30-day average of 6.9 million cubic foot per day. The estimated ultimate recovery has increased from 4.5 Bcfe to north of 5.5 Bcfe per well. We have seen no diminishing results as we step out and feel that our drilling, and that of our peers, has essentially derisked our entire acreage block. There's a room for enhancing our programs. Certainly, we think there is. We have achieved these results while completing laterals that average only 2,800 feet so far, with an average of eight stimulation stages. As we lengthen our laterals, and we recently finished one at 4,500 feet, and we increase our frac stages, which we plan on getting up to about 15, we expect to realize continued improvement in rates and EURs. The upside is definitely there, as we recently completed our last well with a 39-foot lateral, 12-stage stimulation and it flowed and is flowing to fill at 16.1 million a day in over 1,600 pounds flow casing pressure.We plan to expand our program to approximately 73 horizontal wells in 2010 with a proposed plan of 100 wells in 2011. We will expand our drilling fleet by approximately two rigs per year going forward to meet this goal. We also anticipate that this program will yield over a tripling of our 2010 productions and a doubling again of our production in 2011. A new angle to the Marcellus play has also emerged. As you may recall, we mentioned that future developments may be impacted with the potential horizontal completion in the upper Marcellus and the Purcell limestone. The Purcell lies between the upper and lower Marcellus. In some ways, it allocates to the middle bakken in North Dakota. We undertook an initiative to drill like horizontal Purcell well last year, and just recently completed that well and started flowing back. We're very pleased with the results today. The well has a 30-day average of 7.3 million cubic foot per day. We ran micro-sized survey as we stimulated the well and found the stimulation had predominantly gone to the Purcell and the upper Marcellus. While this is still early, it might suggest that we will be able to access the reservoirs without interfering with our lower Marcellus development. That may mean that additional horizontal wells targeting these intervals will be placed on our current and future pads. While still early, this revelation may suggest an increase in the resource potential on our acreage. Additional testing is obviously planned in the future to evaluate this thesis. Physical takeaway and firm pipeline capacity continues to expand. We have recently tweaked our Teel Station and can now physically produce approximately 110 million cubic foot per day. Our Lathrop station is under way also. Our plan is to have that station at a point free flow into sales by early March, weather permitting, and the initial compression set up is expected to be completed in May, capable of flowing and 60 million cubic foot per day. At that time with final stage finished, and they're ready for sales in August at a total rate of 165 million cubic foot per day.The company's Marcellus operation will have a total physical capacity of 275 million cubic foot per day at that time in August. Remember that we are moving pipeline quality gas, and therefore, did not have to install extensive and time-consuming liquid-stripping plants. Today, the company has 95 million cubic foot per day of firm pipeline capacity, 70 million of which is the backhaul arrangement on Tennessee pipe. Last night, we announced that we have agreed to a new pipeline expansion to the South that will move a minimum of 150 million cubic foot of our production on a firm basis to Transco. This expansion is expected in the middle of 2011, bringing our firm takeaway capacity at that time in the middle of 2011 to 275 million cubic foot per day. This is a huge positive for our operation and our expansion plans for the Marcellus.Marcellus operation is the real deal, and this expansion will fit well within our growth plan. Our first vertical well was completed in July of 2007 at about 1 million cubic foot per day. First horizontal, December 2008 at 6.4 million cubic foot per day. Production year end 2008, 16 million a day; production year end 2009, 72 million a day; and today, as I've mentioned, we are over 100 million cubic foot a day with a significant backlog of wells ready to be completed. Current production is coming from only 48 wells. Of those, 19 are horizontal. Also, we had 1,500 to 2,000 locations remaining to be drilled in this area. We'll be in the Marcellus, in this area for many years to come.Now let's move to East Texas. The focus of our East Texas activity is obviously on Haynesville Shale, the outstanding results of the common resource bodes well, which we had a 42%; and the Devon Cardell, which we took an overwriting royalty interest in certainly spurred in the area. Cabot Oil & Gas drilled it's first operated Haynesville horizontal shale well over the new year. The well is at total depth and has been cased.  Completion operations are now underway. We will report test results as they are available.  We had hoped to report those results today, but completion services have tightened up considerably in this particular area since we started of 2010. We think it's somewhat a result of the drill in case wells at the end of 2009 and they're now going to completion. Additionally, Cabot is participating with our third Haynesville AMI well where Cabot has 20% working interest and a fourth AMI well, where we have 29% working interest spud last week. Additionally, we have committed to join three other outside operating wells in the area, and we'll spot our second operating well in March. Cabot holds approximately 63,000 gross, 33,000 net acres in the Haynesville play with comparable holding around 50%, 60% working interest as these wells do eat up a lot of resources at 10 million plus each.In our Minden area, Cabot has recently completed our confirmation well, offsetting the tail of horizontal tests that we had drilled last year. This well has a 30-day average of 5.9 million cubic foot per day, with estimated gross reserves of approximately 6 Bcf. Our initial well up there had an EUR of 6.7 Bcf. Drilling, finding cost of these wells is about $1.49 in Mcfe with excellent rate of returns even at $5. In fact, the economics of these wells is second only to our Marcellus well in the company portfolio. We've identified at least 50 additional locations on our Minden acreage, and we're currently drilling our third horizontal Taylor well.  The company completed two 2010 Pettet oil wells with an average IP of 840 barrels a day and 2.1 million cubic foot a day. We have drilled 11 Pettets this year, with one well flowing back,  two wells completed, two drilling and four wells to be drilled. In the James, we had a couple of completions in the county-line area. These wells were tested at 8.8 million and 7.8 million per day. Four more wells are waiting on completion and four are planned for the rest of 2010. I'm sure you're wondering where and if Cabot would show up in the Eagle Ford play. We have been studying the play for a while. Have actually drilled our first well in the updip portion of the oil lake. That well has been cased and is being stimulated, as we speak. We will report the results of that operation at a later date.To date, we had 38,000 and about 33,000 net acres under lease and have another 28,000 acres that were in final negotiations in the Eagle Ford. This acreage is located either in the dry gas window or the oil window. We continue to lease and expand our position while certainly waiting with anticipation of the results of our first wildcat. The budget we prepared in October of 2008, 2009 for our 2010 year program using $5.50 for gas, $55 for oil, remains intact although we have added an option for additional lease and seismic acquisition. This is continued on success, and if successful, the program would move up our capital program by about $65 million. This forecast would put it at approximately $650 million, including the land acquisition. Approximately 70% is going to be focused in the North region. The drilling component remains similar to that reported in October at $443 million. This forecast together with the addition of our 2010 hedges above budget is now estimated at 116% of our anticipated cash flow. With our balance sheet, this is well within our comfort zone. In terms of hedges, we did add to our position, which means, we are now hedged for 2010 at approximately 33% of our anticipated midpoint production.One last point I do want to bring up before I get the questions, I'd be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to thank Mike Walen and Chuck Smyth for the many years of dedicated service to Cabot. Mike has certainly seen and experienced many significant events in our history, most of which, he was directly involved in or in some cases, fully responsible for. We want to thank him for all his efforts. We will miss him, but we do have him for a couple more months. Chuck, as our Principal Accounting Officer has seen a lot of change in his tenure in the accounting world, and through it all, he always made us comfortable with the final product. And Chuck, I want to thank you for that also.Stephanie, with those comments, I will turn it back to you for any questions."

We do find ourselves kind of at a maximum rate between now and when we get the Lathrop Station fully operational. But we do expect in the middle of March, once we get our plumbing hooked up, we're not going to have full compression capabilities. But in March, we should be able to enhance and flow through that system about additional 65 million cubic foot. And then, as we move into May, with hooking up all the compression, be able to up and increase that number. So at least it's going to be fairly steady and not just kind of backloaded."

So it is early. But I think what's really relevant is the fact that the stimulation suggested that the fracs are going to be climbing and stimulating the Marcellus and the upper Marcellus. It doesn't appear to have anything that's growing downward into the lower Marcellus. And that would certainly suggest, going forward, that we would need to drill twin wells, if you will, on the same path to those lower Marcellus to access those reserves. Now this is early time. We don't have a lot of history yet, and we only have one well. So we still have to look forward cautiously. But overall, we're pretty excited about the idea that it seemed to have worked out, and we may be just be stacked to more reserves on top of the lower Marcellus potential."

And so that was a little bit more flurry of completion activity over and above just the wells that have rigs on them right now.

And so we won't have runaway on the cost. Rigs are and specifically, fit-for-purpose rigs are going to be the rig of choice up in PA. And it's a long move for some of the rigs to get up there, but we do expect those rates have seen a mild increase in the day rate.

Thank you for joining us for Cabot's first quarter teleconference call. With me today are several members or our management team including Mike Walen, Scott Schroeder, Jeff Hutton, and Mat Reid, our BP Regional Manager and others. This will be Mike's last public appearance for Cabot as he retires tomorrow and again I want to thank Mike for his many years of dedicated service and contribution. Mike we are certainly going to miss you.
Before we start, let me say the standard border plate language and forward-looking statements included in the press releases applied in my comments today. We have many things to cover and expand on from the two press releases that we issued last night. I will briefly cover the financial results, the recent operation milestones and our progress in the matter with the Pennsylvania DEP.
I will be brief so as to allow ample time for Q&A following my comments. For financial results Cabot Oil & Gas reported financial results last night that exceeded consensus expectations, However lower natural gas prices even with higher production could not offset the previous year. As the softness in gas, in the natural gas market continues from a clean earnings perspective, net income was $30 million, select items for 2010 include primarily stock compensation and mark-to-market basis hedges.
As stated lower natural gas price realizations were the main factor in the lower net income. On the balance sheet our debt level increased to $110 million from yearend to $915 million as we established a sizeable footprint in the Eagle Ford Shale and continued blocking our Marcellus position, both of which are certainly key areas going forward. In terms of production as we mentioned on the yearend call, we will be towards the low end of our guidance for the first quarter due to the delays in permitting, stream crossings earlier in the year and the capacity constraints in the second half of the quarter for our Marcellus production.
You may recall we reached maximum capacity at the Peale station up in Susquehanna around the middle of February and commenced free flowing Marcellus gas at our Lathrop station in early April. Production for the total company at yearend ended at 295 million cubic foot equivalent per day and now at quarter end we are at 325 million cubic foot equivalent per day and growing. On the operations, let me expand on the operations release. We have numerous wells that strengthen our position in core areas in the Marcellus, in Haynesville and the Pettit. So we also have our best well in the Cotton Valley Taylor sand, confirming a good rate of return project in Minden and we also had success on our initial oil drilling in the Eagle Ford, another good rate of return project for our portfolio.
Now let me move into some of the details. In the Eagle Ford in South Texas the company has completed its first horizontal Eagle Ford well. This well, a 100% working interest well had a lateral length of nearly 3000 feet and was stimulated with 14 stages. The well tested at a rate of 334 barrels of oil a day and 142 Mcf per day. Cabot holds approximately 61,000 gross, 52,000 net acres in the oil win of the play with approximately 300 to 350 potential locations and a resource potential of 60 million to 140 million Boe.
A second company operated well as scheduled to spud in early to mid summer with three additional wells being drilled in 2010. This is exciting as we continue to build our position. We've had initial success and the concept was significantly reinforced by recent peer presentation along trends with our acreage. Let's move to East Texas, we continue to focus on two main areas there. The Haynesville and Bossier Shale Play and Pettit Oil program. In the Haynesville as previously announced Cabot has successfully drilled and completed its first Haynesville well. The King number one which we had 69% working interest was drilled to a depth of $18,364 feet and a lateral of 4487 after 14-stage stimulation the well tested as we previously reported at 19 million per day and a new data point for us is its 30 day average of 15.2 million cubic foot per day. 
Drilling operations are underway on our second operated well, the long, the Walters No 1, we have 54% in this well and Cabot is also participating in three outside operated wells that are currently drilling with working interest between 20% and 41%. Cabot has participated in the drilling of additional outside operated wells that has been an additional operated well that has been drilled and cased. We have 29% of this well and we are waiting on completion. With Cabot just starting its Haynesville drilling, we anticipate getting into the stimulation queue sometime in June or July for our well.
We are encouraged by the Haynesville wells with the high initial rates and certainly excellent recoverable reserves and we are particularly excited about the middle Bossier potential on our acreage in Shelby in St. Augustine County.
Moving to the Pettit. In our Pettit oil play in this area the Warsham Oil number one and the Warsham Oil Unit B number one were stimulated with 10 and 14 stages in the lateral lengths of 5500 feet and 5471 feet respectively. The Warsham Unit A number 1 is currently flowing back. The Warsham Unit B number 1 produced at initial rates of 1209 barrels of oil per day. With these results Cabot has increased the number of Pettit wells to be drilled in 2010 to 13. In 2010 four wells have been drilled and completed, one well is waiting on completion and 8 wells remained to be drilled.
Average initial production from the wells drilled in the field is 485 barrels of oil per day and 2 million cubic foot per day. With prices 20 times higher for oil and natural gas, we look to drill more Pettit, which has the added value of holding our developed acreage to all depths.
Our James, brief comment at County Line, we had five James wells that were drilled and cased, but not completed in 2009. Those have now been completed. The wells had an average initial production rate of 6.1 million cubic foot per day. Moving up to Minden our third Cotton Valley Taylor of horizontal well has been successfully drilled and completed. The Birdwell (inaudible), a 100% Cabot well was completed in mid April and initially tested at a rate of 11.1 million cubic foot per day. This is a higher rate in the first two horizontal Cotton Valley Taylor sand wells that we drilled; they had initial rates of 9.5 and 8.9 million cubic foot equivalent per day. These wells continue to provide superior economics returns with EURs of 6 Bcfe to 7 Bcfe and a very low finding cost.
In addition this acreage is HBP, so we will be very selective as to our timing and think of more opportune time to drill more tailored wells and the returns are very compelling. Now let's move to the north of Marcellus. Obviously continues to be our crown jewel for Cabot and certainly is developing into a true company maker with exceptional economics. Since we started we have paid millions of dollars in lease bonus and royalty and we've also hired 64 new employees with many additional positions yet to be filled. 
We continue to lease acreage in our core area and have increased our position to nearly 200,000 net and gross acreage. More importantly, our Marcellus program continues to yield exceptional well results and production is ramping up quickly. We are currently producing at a maximum infrastructure capacity of approximately 115 million cubic foot per day from the field. Phase one of our Lathrop station is complete which allows us to free flow gas into the Tennessee line as the press release highlighted.
Phase 2 which is the compressor start up phase is well underway with the compressors and dehigh equipment set on the site and start up schedule for late May. I know some of you have expected higher production rates for the quarter, but we are close to ramping up our production. At this time we have 18 wells in various stages of completion and a number of wells with 50 frac stages will be ready to turn in line immediately at the compressor start up. Cabot plans to drill 81 wells total in 2010 although we may adjust the schedule by a couple of wells depending on our capture rate of new leasing.
Year-to-date in Susquehanna we have drilled 11 horizontal wells for a total of 12 wells for the quarter. Cabot recently added a sixth fit-for-purpose rig in April and has a seventh rig scheduled to arrive in May to fulfill our program. At the end of 2009, Cabot set forth a series of 2010 initiatives to continue to improve our results and efficiencies in the Marcellus, three of those initiatives were completed in the first quarter.
We recently drilled and cased our longest collateral well to-date at 5,000 feet. We drilled our first well in 17 days from spud to rig release and that well had 4,300 foot lateral and lastly we completed a 15 stage frac that went into line at 14.6 million cubic foot per day and 1730 pounds location pressure. 
This well was curtailed due to current sales point capacity limits as we've discussed and it's been flowing less than 30 days so it was not included in the population highlighted in the press release. With robust production rates that we're seeing, we have taken additional steps to ensure that we have adequate physical takeaway capacity with the execution of three thorough transportation agreements. You will recall that we announced in our last operational update the partnership with Williams to build a 20 inch pipeline to the south that guarantees us a minimum of 150 million cubic foot a day of firm capacity from our Susquehanna compressor stations to Transco.
Last month we executed a binding agreement with a private midstream company that also provides for a minimum of 50 million cubic foot per day of firm capacity with expansion opportunities. This time we're going to go to the north. This project will enable us to move a rig to the northern tier of our acreage position and establish production up there. 
The pipeline project is slated for completion in early 2011. Also we executed two binding agreements that will allow an additional 50 million cubic foot a day to flow directly to millennium pipeline in New York via the Tennessee gas pipeline. Completion of this expansion is expected approximately November 2011. 
Regarding the Pennsylvania DEP matter Cabot takes safety in all environmental matters extremely seriously. As Cabot announced Tuesday night in a press release, we will continue to cooperate fully with the Pennsylvania DEP to remedy hence and resolve the items from the consent order. I am not going to rehash the order or the first or second responses from us publicly, but I am happy to answer questions on this issue during the Q&A session. 
Finally on our guidance last night, we posted updates to our guidance for 2010 that held full year production equivalent guidance in the previously disclosed range at a growth rate of 18% to 22%. Our initial liquid guides from October of 2009 expected a little bit more Pettit volumes at this stage than has occurred but this is offset by our better than expected natural gas production. 
We exited the quarter at 325 million cubic foot equivalent per day and in terms of expenses and capital, those were left unchanged. I would note however that with leasing success the potential $65 million wedge should be added. Additionally, we continue to look for good leasing opportunities in our core areas. 
I am very excited about our program that we have out in front of us in the regions. As you can see we are flush with opportunities, good rate of return opportunities for years to come. Additionally we have several other ancient projects that are in its early stages of evaluation. Stephanie with that I'll be more than happy to answer any questions the group has.

We moved up the construction of the Lathrop station because we saw early success and as we have continued to expand and we continue to improve our initiatives up there are long and laterals, more fracs and quicker drill rates and efficiencies.
We have just overtaken the timeframe of our infrastructure in start up date and which is a high class problem, again we anticipate us putting a significant volume of gas into the Lathrop station once we can crank up the three compressors on side and initially I might add the initial phase which is, while we are calling a second phase is to start-up the compressors, we have three compressors that we'll be starting up early on. That will be about 65 million cubic foot of additional capacity and then towards middle of the summer we'll have three additional compressors that we plan on cranking up there also which would get us up to total for the facility 165 million cubic foot per day and obviously its going to be our intent to fill that in capacity as quickly as we can

This will be Mike's last public appearance for Cabot as he retires tomorrow. And again, I want to thank Mike for his many years of dedicated service and contributions. Mike, we're certainly going to miss you.
Before we start, let me say the standard border plate language and forward-looking statements included in the press releases apply to my comments today. We have many things to cover and expand on from the two press releases that we issued last night. I will briefly cover the financial results, the recent operation milestones and our progress in the matter with the Pennsylvania DEP [Department of Environmental Protection]. I will be brief so as to allow ample time for Q&A following my comments. 
For the financial results, Cabot Oil & Gas reported financial results last night that exceeded consensus expectations. However, lower natural gas prices even with higher production could not offset the previous year as the softness in the natural gas market continues. From a clean earnings perspective, net income was $30 million, select items for 2010 include primarily stock compensation and mark-to-market basis hedges. 
As stated, lower natural gas price realizations were the main factor in the lower net income. For the balance sheet, our debt level increased to $110 million from year end to $915 million as we established a sizable footprint in the Eagle Ford Shale and continued blocking our Marcellus position, both of which are certainly key areas going forward. 
In terms of production, as we've mentioned on the year-end call, we would be towards the low end of our guidance for the first quarter due to the delays in permitting, stream crossings earlier in the year and the capacity constraints in the second half of the quarter for our Marcellus production.
You may recall, we reached maximum capacity at the Teel Station, up in Susquehanna, around the middle of February and commenced free-flowing Marcellus gas at our Lathrop Station in early April. Production for the total company at year end ended at 295 million cubic foot equivalent per day, and now at quarter end, we're at 325 million cubic foot equivalent per day and growing. 
On the operations, let me expand on the operations release. We have numerous wells that strengthen our position in core areas in the Marcellus, in Haynesville and the Pettet. We also have our best well in the Taylor Cotton Valley sand, confirming a good rate of return project in Minden, and we also have success on our initial oil drilling in the Eagle Ford, another good rate of return project for our portfolio.
Now let me move into some of the details. In the Eagle Ford, in South Texas, the company has completed its first horizontal Eagle Ford well. This well, a 100% working interest well, had a lateral length of nearly 3,000 feet and was stimulated with 14 stages. The well tested at a rate of 334 barrels of oil a day and 142 Mcf [thousand cubic feet] per day. Cabot holds approximately 61,000 gross, 52,000 net acres in the oil win of the play, with approximately 300 to 350 potential locations and a resource potential of 60 million to 140 million BOE [barrels of oil equivalent]. A second company-operated well is scheduled to spud in early to mid-summer with three additional wells being drilled in 2010. This is exciting as we continue to build our position. We've had initial success, and the concept was significantly reinforced by recent pure presentation along trend with our acreage. 
Let's move to East Texas. We continue to focus on two main areas there, the Haynesville and Bossier Shale play and our Pettet Oil program. In Haynesville, as previously announced, Cabot has successfully drilled and completed its first Haynesville well, the King #1, which we had 69% working interest, was drilled to a depth of 18,364 feet and a lateral of 4,487. After 14-stage stimulation, the well tested, as we previously reported, at 19 million per day, and a new data point for us is its 30-day average of 15.2 million cubic foot per day.
Drilling operations are underway on our second-operated well, the Walters No. 1, we have 54% in this well. And Cabot is also participating in three outside-operated wells that are currently drilling with working interest between 20% and 41%. Cabot has participated in the drilling of additional operated well that has been drilled and cased. We have 29% of this well and we're waiting on completion. With Cabot just starting its Haynesville drilling, we anticipate getting into the stimulation queue sometime in June or July for our well. We're encouraged by the Haynesville wells with the high initial rates and certainly excellent recoverable reserves, and we're particularly excited about the middle Bossier potential on our acreage in Shelby in San Augustine County. 
Moving to the Pettet. In our Pettet Oil play in this area, the Worsham OU #1 and the Worsham unit B #1 [Worsham OU B #1] were stimulated with 10 and 14 stages in the lateral lengths of 5,500 feet and 5,471 respectively. The Worsham unit A #1 [Worsham OU A #1] is currently flowing back. The Worsham unit B #1 produced at initial rate of 1,209 barrels of oil per day. With these results, Cabot has increased the number of Pettet wells to be drilled in 2010 to '13. In 2010, four wells had been drilled and completed, one well is waiting on completion and eight wells remain to be drilled.
Average initial production from the wells drilled in the field is 485 barrels of oil per day and 2 million cubic foot per day. With prices 20x higher for our oil and natural gas, we look to drill more at Pettet, which has the added value of holding our undeveloped acreage to all depths. 
Our James brief comment, at County Line, we had five James wells that were drilled and cased but not completed in 2009. Those have now been completed. The wells had an average initial production rate of 6.1 million cubic foot per day. 
Moving up to Minden, our third Cotton Valley Taylor of horizontal well has been successfully drilled and completed. The Birdwell #11H, a 100% Cabot well was completed in mid-April and initially tested at a rate of 11.1 million cubic foot per day. This is a higher rate than the first two horizontal Cotton Valley Taylor sand wells that we drilled. They had initial rates of 9.5 and 8.9 million cubic foot equivalent per day. These wells continue to provide superior economic returns with EURs [estimated ultimately recoverables] of six to seven Bcfe [billions of cubic feet equivalent] and a very low finding costs. In addition, this acreage is HBP [held by production], so we'll be very selective as to our timing and think of more opportune time to drill more tailored wells and the returns are very compelling.
Now let's move to the north of Marcellus, obviously it continues to be our crown jewel for Cabot, and certainly is developing into a true company maker with exceptional economics. Since we started, we have paid millions of dollars in lease bonus and royalty, and we've also hired 64 new employees with many additional positions yet to be filled. We continue to lease acreage in our core area and have increased our position to nearly 200,000 net and gross acreage. More importantly, our Marcellus program continues to yield exceptional well results and production is ramping up quickly. We're currently producing at a maximum infrastructure capacity of approximately 115 million cubic foot per day from the field. 
Phase I of our Lathrop Station is complete, which allows us to free-flow gas into the Tennessee line as the press release highlighted. Phase II, which is the compressor start-up phase, is well underway with the compressors and the high equipment set on the site and start-up schedule for late May. I know some of you have expected higher production rates for the quarter, but we are close to ramping up our production. At this time, we have 18 wells in various stages of completion. And a number of wells with 50-frac stages will be ready to turn in line immediately at the compressor startup. Cabot plans to drill 81 wells total in 2010, although we may adjust this schedule by a couple of wells depending on our capture rate of new leasing.
Year-to-date, in Susquehanna, we have drilled 11 horizontal wells for a total of 12 wells for the quarter. Cabot recently added a sixth fit-for-purpose rig in April and has a seventh rig scheduled to arrive in May to fulfill our program. At the end of 2009, Cabot set forth a series of 2010 initiatives to continue to improve our results and efficiencies in the Marcellus. Three of those initiatives were completed in the first quarter. We recently drilled and cased our longest lateral well to date at 5,000 feet. We drilled our first well in 17 days from spud to rig release, and that well has a 4,300-foot lateral. And lastly, we completed a 15-stage frac that went in the line at 14.6 million cubic foot per day and 1,730 pounds location pressure. This well was curtailed due to current sales point capacity limits, as we've discussed, and has been flowing less than 30 days, so it was not included in the population highlighted in the press release. 
With robust production rates that we're seeing, we have taken additional steps to ensure that we have adequate physical takeaway capacity with the execution of three thorough transportation agreements. You'll recall that we announced in our last operational update, the partnership with Williams to build a 20-inch pipeline to the south that guarantees us a minimum of 150 million cubic foot a day of firm capacity from our Susquehanna compressor stations to Transco. 
Last month, we executed a binding agreement with a private midstream company that also provides for a minimum of 50 million cubic foot per day of firm capacity with expansion opportunities. This time, we're going to go to the north. This project will enable us to move a rig to the northern tier of our acreage position and establish production up there. The pipeline project is slated for completion in early 2011. 
Also, we executed two binding agreements that will allow an additional 50 million cubic foot a day to flow directly to Millennium Pipeline in New York via the Tennessee Gas Pipeline. Completion of this expansion is expected approximately November 2011. 
Regarding the Pennsylvania DEP matter, Cabot takes safety in all environmental matters extremely seriously. As Cabot announced Tuesday night in a press release, we will continue to cooperate fully with the Pennsylvania DEP to remedy and resolve the items from the consent order. I'm not going to rehash the order or the first or second responses from us publicly, but I am happy to answer questions on this issue during the Q&A session.
Finally, on our guidance last night, we've posted updates to our guidance for 2010 that held full year production equivalent guidance in the previously disclosed range at a growth rate of 18% to 22%. Our initial liquid guides from October of 2009 expected a little bit more Pettet volumes at this stage that has occurred but this is offset by our better-than-expected natural gas production.
We exited the quarter at 325 million cubic foot equivalent per day. And in terms of expenses and capital, those were left unchanged. I would note however, that with our leasing success, the potential $65 million wedge should be added. Additionally, we continue to look for good leasing opportunities in our core areas. I'm very excited about our program that we have out in front of us in the regions. As you can see, we are flush with opportunities, good rate of return opportunities for years to come. Additionally, we have several other ancient projects that are in its early stages of evaluation. 
Tiffany, with that, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions the group has."

We have just overtaken the time frame of our infrastructure start-up date, which is a high-class problem.

That'll be about to 65 million cubic foot of additional capacity.

I have Scott Schroeder with me, I have Matt Reid who some of you all have met, VP of our south region, I have Phil Stalnaker, VP of our North region.
Also the forward-looking statements included in our press release will apply to my comments today. First and foremost, before I commence my prepared remarks, let me say this unequivocally we will not issue equity to fund our capital program. I know there was a significant level of rhetoric around this today and let me emphasize that the equity issue has been and will continue be for the value creation of opportunities we might see and not simply to reload our balance sheet. I will also make some comments regarding our capital spending later.
On the prepared remarks, Cabot reported financial results this morning that were in line in consensus expectations. When you compare these numbers against the previous year, lower natural gas prices, and even with our higher production cannot match the previous year numbers. From a clean earnings perspective, net income was approximately $20 million with the selected items for this quarter including a gain on sale stock compensation and a mark to market basis hedges.
Certainly highlight of the quarter and I think a very positive trend that will continue was the near 20% production growth that we experiences. A couple of notations to make when you do look at this 20% growth is the fact that last year comparable production volumes included Canada production, which was sold in April 30th of 2009. Pro forma growth is 30% for the quarter and 29% for the year-to-date period. Also, we had forecast our Lathrop station to start sooner than it did and this obviously delayed some of our production volumes in the second quarter. In a moment, I will discuss the volumes we are now moving the Lathrop station and the increase to our production guidance as a result of that.
Natural gas price realizations experience 25% decline and as mentioned impacted margins for the quarter. In terms of our balance sheet, we had a debt level increase of $100 million from last quarter as we continue to acquire select acreage mainly in Susquehanna and also drilled to place our primary term acreage in HBP status. I think many in our industry are continuing to drill primary term acreage and this certainly has been a catalyst for the rig count. However, I do think the number of rigs necessary to accomplish this goal is beginning to peak.
In terms of current production, our total company daily levels are approximately 375 million cubic foot equivalent a day and as our press release indicated, we have numerous well in various stages of completion that will continue to add to our production profile. Today, we posted new guidance for the third and fourth quarters. That combined with actual production for the first half generate a 21% to 25% reported growth. Clearly, pro forma numbers would be greater also because of several quarters of better cost results. We have made improvements in guidance for several of our cost metrics. I also anticipate some organic cost will continue to come down.
We also moved our capital guidance higher. This spending increase was done for solid business reasons. About one-third of the increase is allocated to Marcellus in-field leasing, which allows more efficient development up there. I will expand on this more later. The other two-thirds is for drilling primarily as a result of partner well proposals ion the Bossier or Haynesville and to a lesser extent a couple of oil wells associated with the new joint venture in the Eagle Ford we just executed. We do not want to stand out of the Haynesville Bossier wells and lose the opportunity to participate in an additional three to five wells in each of the proposed units in the future. This would cause the loss of a significant resource potential for our shareholders estimated in each unit from the Bossier and Haynesville to be in the range of 48 to 100 Bcfe, again, the reason why we are staying in those particular wells.
As you can see, our balance sheet is not overleveraged. Let me add that the 2010 growth program we have can be accomplished without any additional new funding. That being said, let me add that we will explore adding to our credit facility or select asset sales, any one of which can be accomplished within our existing borrowing base and without overleveraging the Company.
Now, let me move to operations. As I mentioned, we have numerous wells that strengthen our position in our areas of most, the Marcellus, Haynesville, and Eagle Ford. In the Eagle Ford, South Texas, the Company has drilled its second horizontal Eagle Ford oil well. That well is a 100% Cabot operated well located in (inaudible) county and it was drilled to a depth of 14,660 with an 80 - excuse me, a 5800-foot lateral. The well is scheduled to be stimulated in late August. The rig is moving to a third location with drilling anticipated to begin next week on that third well.
Cabot holds, as you will recall, about 52,000 net acres in the oil window of the play with 300 - 350 potential locations and a large resource potential also. Also in the oil window, but approximately 40 miles east of the well we just drilled, Cabot has entered into approximately 18,000 acre area of mutual interest with EOG. Each company contributed 50% of the acreage in the JV with EOG as operator. Drilling is anticipated to begin in the fourth quarter of this year following the acquisition of a new 3D seismic shoot.
Moving to East Texas, in the Haynesville Bossier, as previously announced, Cabot has successfully drilled and completed its second operated horizontal shale well, Walters 1 [ph]. COG had 54%, it was drilled to a depth of 18,946, with a lateral length of 4900 plus feet after 16 stage stimulation, the well, which was placed on production in July 9th and tested at 20 million cubic foot per day.
Cabot is also participating in nine outside operated Haynesville Bossier wells that are currently drilling, completing, or waiting on completion with our working interest generally between the 10% to 40% range. Haynesville wells in the area continue to produce at high rates with excellent recoverable reserves. We are also encouraged by what we are seeing in the middle Bossier potential on our acreage position in both Shelby and St. Augustine County with two outside operated wells presently performing completions and those will be our first completion opportunities in the Bossier.
Several recent industry Bossier wells in the area have performed equal to or better than Haynesville completions. With the information we have in hand, we think our acreage is located in a core area for both zones. And this is the reason we continue to participate in these wells.
We are still allocating some capital to our Petit James play. There was a brief break in drilling Petit oil wells in order to use the rig to drill four shallow James wells. These four wells were drilled for the James production, but also we hold approximately 1700 acres of Haynesville Bossier rights.
The Petit oil program has resumed and during the quarter one well was drilled to a depth of 12,100 feet with a 3900 foot lateral. The well had initial potential of 832 barrels of oil per day and 1.5 million cubic foot per day. One well is presently waiting on completion and two wells are drilling. Six additional Petit wells are planned between now and the remainder of the year.
Moving to the North, in the Marcellus, that effort continues to exceed all our expectations with production for the second quarter increasing approximately 39% from first quarter of 2010. Production was averaging approximately 165 million cubic foot gross over the last 30 days or so. This past weekend we brought a couple of more wells online and since the weekend we have averaged over 180 million cubic foot gross per day.
With the number of well we have in the completion stage and due to the strength of our wells, as we continue to lengthen the laterals and increase the average number of fracs, we have increased our production guidance for the third and fourth quarters. It is important to note this guidance is set based on the available existing capacity we have with our three current compressors at Lathrop. As we stated in the previous press release, the Lathrop station started June 17th. Due to the strength of our new wells coming online we were able to free flow approximately 87 million cubic foot per day through the station instead of our original estimate of 60 million cubic foot per day. We are reconfiguring the cylinders on the three existing compressors to enable more throughput at an elevated suction pressure. We expect this work to be completed in early August, giving us a capacity of 125 million cubic foot per day through this station from these three current compressors that is over the 60 million a day we had originally thought we would get out of these three compressors.
As most of you are aware, we have been anticipating approval of the air quality permit for three additional compressors at Lathrop. Permit approval has been delayed because the DEP is evaluating a change in air permitting policy with regard to oil and gas projects. At the time, we filed for the compressor permit back in February of 2010. The DEP viewed the compressors as a single source of emission for permitting purposed. Because Cabot’s permit application was submitted and reviewed by the DEP prior to consideration of the new policy, we are hopeful and have conversations going with the DEP that they will grant the permit even though the possible change and (inaudible) are under consideration. We do understand they have done this for others.
Cabot could then potentially revise its guidance further with increased volume capacity attributable to additional compression. During the second quarter, Cabot also added a seventh fit-for-purpose rig and we are on pace to add 75 wells drilled by the end of 2010. Operationally, we continue to see improvement in our well results. A recent well experienced the highest 24-hour IP to-date of 18.4 million at a flowing pressure 1140 pounds from 15-stage frac. As I mentioned, we continue to make every effort to optimize our completions and increase the number of frac stages per well. We recently performed completions on two wells with 18-stage frac and during the third quarter we had some planned with 19 stages each.
As the press release highlighted, we have a significant inventory of wells in various stages of completion. On our seismic front, Cabot has completed shooting 250 square miles of 3D seismic date which covers more than 50% of our acreage position in the Marcellus. Right now we have 165 square miles of data in house being interpreted. Though we have been really successful on picking locations without this 3D, we do anticipate that this data set will allow us to become a little bit more efficient on picking locations and improving our results.
I would be remiss not to mention the macro comments regarding the regulatory oversight that has escalated as a result of the BP disaster. Our industry is seeing additional regulations/policies both onshore and offshore to implement best practices from well bore design to well cost efforts and completion safeguards. However, when you evaluate procedures that the majority of our industry implements in the conduct of this operations best practices are being used to mitigate operational risk.
As you are aware, Cabot has been working with the PADEP as a result of a lawsuit abetting a nine square mile area in Susquehanna. I think this issue has cast uncertainty with the Street on Cabot’s ability to conduct operations in Pennsylvania. As our press release indicated, we continue to make progress to resolve this issue. Specifically, we are now receiving our drilling permits located outside this affected area.
Various process of working with and getting to know the DEP and its personnel, it is clear to me the DEP is regulating the gas industry with a common goal to mitigate the inherent risk of a large growth industry and also to protect the constituents of the commonwealth. The entire Marcellus effort has a significant learning curve taking place, both by operators and regulators, and I am convinced that just like the mining industry, the steel industry, and chemical industries, the development of the Marcellus will continue and has the potential to make Pennsylvania one of the most prosperous states in our nation.
Also Cabot will continue to work with the DEP and the families affected by the operations to the complete satisfaction and a good conclusion. As we continue to execute our program in both our regions I am confident that we will be able to meet or exceeds growth projections in the future and accomplish that goal without issuing equity or overleveraging our balance sheet.
I am very happy and pleased with our program out of both regions. Certainly have a lot opportunities out in front of us. And with that, Cynthia, I will answer any questions.

Again, let’s think about - let me clarify, I had this question several times today. The issue is not - the $725 million remember is not comparable to the investment number on your cash flow statement. The investment number on your cash flow statement represents any money that’s been spent at the time it actually goes out the door. There was a larger than normal carry over balance from 2009 into to 2010 relating to both Marcellus and in particular the initial leasing around the Eagle Ford that while it was fully approved on the yearend balance sheet, shows up as a cash outflow in the investing category for 2010. That number is in the $80 million range. So the $450 million you are seeing in investing when you compare that to $725 million, you could easily make that assumption that, yes, you would have to slow down spending significantly to ratchet that back to go from $450 million to $725 million.
The point I am making is the $450 million includes what we had in our guidance for capital in 2009, part of that carried over into 2010. Take the 80 plus million out; you are at about $360 million, $370 million. So you are basically going to have a repeat of the second half of the year.

Appreciate you joining us for this third quarter teleconference call.  I have Scott Schroeder, our CFO; Jeff Hutton, VP of Marketing; Matt Reid, VP of our South Region; and Phil Stalnaker, VP of our North Region joining me today for the call. 
Before we start, forward-looking statements included in the press release apply to my comments today.
Now let’s get into our releases last night for the quarter.  Cabot Oil & Gas reported clean net income of approximately $32 million or $0.31 per share, which exceeded consensus expectations.  When you compare these numbers against the previous year third quarter, lower natural gas prices, even with our higher production, did not match the previous year numbers.  The selected items for the quarter were mainly an impairment and pension termination-related expenses.  The impairment includes two legacy South Texas fields that have not received any capital and we have no planned operations for 2011.  The pension charge relates to the acceleration of costs for the plan which the Company terminated September 30, 2010.  This amortization will occur for the next five quarters as we go through the regulatory process to unwind the plan.
A highlight of the quarter and, I think, a very positive trend was 41% production growth versus last year’s comparable production volumes for the third quarter.  Sequentially from the second quarter, production grew 18%, another significant accomplishment as the Company exceeded its production guidance targets.  Additionally year-to-date growth levels are 22% over last year’s first nine months; and in fact yesterday our year-to-date production matched the full year level reported for 2009, so our production for the remainder of the year will represent year-over-year growth.
Natural gas prices, everybody’s aware, very soft.  The realization’s experienced a 27% decline for the quarter while oil prices remain strong.  Both realizations were positively impacted by hedges for the quarter.  
In terms of hedging, we remain relatively unhedged for 2011 but we did add a costless collar contract for all of 2011, which is indicated on our website.
In our guidance - we did post new guidance increasing fourth quarter production for 2010 and established 2009 guidance.  The full year expectation for 2010 is now about 25% reported growth.  As we move into 2011 and with the second phase of Lathrop still pending, we are providing volumes for the first quarter of 2011 only.  However, with no additional capacity from Lathrop, growth expectations are approximately 20% for 2011 full year, and depending on the ultimate timing with Lathrop, percentage growth would only increase from that floor.  As soon as we have full clarity on this point, we will communicate the timing and fine-tune further growth expectations.
The new guidance for costs highlights the impact of the expanding production base combined with operations focused in just three basins for 2011.  Additionally, the capital program changes are identified, establishing 2011 at 600 million and moving the remainder of 2010 up 65 million to 790 million.  The two main reasons for the capital increase are our participation in non-operated wells in the Haynesville/Bossier combined with the increased cost of pumping services the industry is seeing across the board.
To assist with capital allocation in 2011 in the Haynesville/Bossier area, we are working on a joint venture to fund this area for 2011.  Additionally we have provided for an increase to our estimates for pumping services commensurate with current levels, plus added a factor for inflation.  Also, we will reduce our rig activity in both regions next year; however, we will still be able to realize our production growth projections established in our guidance.
Now let’s move to operations.  While we currently have operations ongoing in the Marcellus, Haynesville and Eagle Ford for 2011, we will concentrate our capital allocation in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford.  In the South Region for the remainder of 2010, Cabot is participating in 16 outside operated Haynesville/Bossier wells that are currently drilling, completing, or waiting on completion with working interests generally ranging from 10 to 20%.  Results today in the play continue to show production at high initial rates with excellent recoverable reserves.  This is true for both the Haynesville and Bossier formations, so we continue to be encouraged by the Bossier wells on and around our acreage.  
Cabot has participated in four Bossier wells in this area.  Two of the wells have been completed and have performed equal to or better than the Haynesville completions.  The other two remaining wells are scheduled to be completed before year-end.  This recent success reinforces our belief that our acreage is located in a core area for both zones.  Though unpopular today, our capital allocated this play continues to capture a significant resource potential for the future.
As I previously mentioned, Cabot is seeking a 33% working interest in non-operated—non-operating partner in our Haynesville/Bossier acreage.  This joint venture would potentially include some upfront consideration plus a capital carry and an AMI which allows for participation in future acreage acquisition.  This process is moving forward as we speak.
Moving down further South Texas, as reported last night, the Company successfully completed its third Eagle Ford well, the Arminius Energy Trust #2H, which is a 100% operated Cabot well.  Located in Frio County, it was drilled to a total depth of 13,175 with a 4,325 foot lateral and is cleaning up, and hit a peak rate of over 600 barrels equivalent yesterday.  This well is located in our Buckhorn area.  The fourth Company-operated well, the Cromwell Ranch 1H, another 100% Cabot well located in La Salle County, was drilled with a lateral length of 6,000 feet and is scheduled for completion in the next couple of weeks.  Additionally, additional drilling in the prospect area is scheduled for later this quarter.  Cabot holds approximately 53,000 net acres in the oil window of the play and has over 300 net potential locations.
Also in the Eagle Ford oil trend, drilling on our 18,000 acre area of mutual interest with EOG is scheduled to begin by year-end.  Each company, as you might be aware, contributed 50% of the acreage in the JV with the operator EOG.  The current plan is to keep at least one rig active in the JV area throughout 2011.  With our South Region capital being allocated between our operated Buckhorn area and the EOG JV, we anticipate potentially doubling our oil volumes in 2011 from 2010.  
Now let’s move up to the North Region.  In the Marcellus we achieved a new production high of 245 million cubic foot gross per day, predominantly from 43 horizontal wells, and had an outstanding quarter with production growth for the third quarter increasing approximately 74% over the second quarter of 2010.  During the quarter, Cabot had two wells exceed the 20 million a day rate for a 24-hour initial production period.  One well had a lateral of 4,659 feet in 18 stages while the other had a lateral of 3,960 feet with 15 stages.  
Also during the quarter, Cabot completed a three well pad with a total of 55 frac stages, and the three wells are producing a combined 47 million cubic foot, which was highlighted also in the press release last night.  Cabot continues to run seven fit for purpose rigs in the Marcellus.  Today we have a total of 44 stages currently being completed, 93 stages waiting on pipelines, and 336 stages waiting on completion.  With the prolific nature of the wells and completions that we are drilling, coupled with balancing our capital allocation, we will be adjusting our rig count in 2011 to five rigs.  Right now we are planning 54 horizontal wells in Susquehanna in 2011 which will provide for a significant growth profile.
On a seismic front, Cabot has completed shooting 250 square miles of 3D seismic data and has participated in the acquisition of an additional 85 square miles of 3D seismic in Susquehanna.  Right now, we have all of the 335 miles of 3D data in house being interpreted, which covers approximately 60% of our acreage position in the Marcellus.  As many of you are aware, at our Lathrop compression station Cabot is still waiting on the air quality permit for our three additional compressors, which was discussed last quarter.  Cabot continues to have discussions with the Pennsylvania DEP to resolve this issue.
On a positive note, we believe with further engineering we can tweak Lathrop Phase 1 to add 10 to 20 million cubic foot more per day.  Additionally, we are working towards the development of three additional compressor sites, two of which will be in limited operation during the latter part of 2011.  Our expectation is, at a minimum, we will be able to free flow gas through both of these new compressor sites.  None of these potential upsides are in our 20% gross sales forecast for 2011.
Our Marcellus is quite a remarkable resource, and even with lower natural gas prices and gas being out of favor with investors, our economic returns are in the top quartile of the food chain.  Case in point, while we have seen many strong wells, particularly most recently, our EUR guidance is still only 5.5 Bcf.  At the current EUR, 5.5 Bcf, and current pricing, our rate of return will compete with most oil and wet gas projects very favorably.  We will update our EUR for Marcellus after our year-end reserve bookings.
Also, Cabot continues to evaluate, along with expert consultants, a nine-square mile area in Susquehanna where the Pennsylvania DEP suspended drilling and fracking operations almost a year ago.  Cabot had compiled records of the existence of methane in and around the Dimock area long before Cabot began drilling for natural gas.  Additionally, Cabot provided copies of sworn affidavits from residents along Carter Road and other areas who acknowledged they had always had methane in their water and even ignited their water prior to Cabot drilling in their community.  Cabot has demonstrated it can remediate the preexisting methane in the water wells by installing methane separations systems.  In a technical meeting between the Pennsylvania DEP and Cabot just three days prior to the DEP’s announced pipeline plan, the DEP acknowledged to Cabot that methane separators have worked in other areas in the state and will work in Dimock.  This proven technology is a quicker, cost effective, permanent solution to treat the preexisting methane condition.  The Cabot offensive has been required to offset the sudden change in the direction of the preferred solution by the Pennsylvania DEP.  
Now let’s move back to operations.  In the Rocky Mountains in the North Region, our initial rank wildcat in Nevada was dry but it did provide us information to carry to our other two areas in Nevada.  It did not condemn our original prospect concept; we just encountered the section a little bit shallower than anticipated.  We do plan on shooting additional seismic and continuing our evaluation out there.  
In regards to our Montana Heath play, we should be moving a rig in, in the next week or so.  
As we continue to execute our program in both regions and look ahead to 2011, we are very well positioned to weather this commodity cycle while still economically building the Company.  We have a focus on the Marcellus and Eagle Ford for 2011 with a program that is geared towards cash flow expectations.  We are fully aware of concerns of over-extending cash flows in this market—in this type of market, and we will manage these concerns.  Additionally, even in this soft natural gas pricing environment, the vast majority of our capital scheduled to be allocated towards the Marcellus and Eagle Ford will deliver very good rate of returns for our shareholders.
Christy, with that we’ll be more than happy to take any questions.

We’re uncertain about all that, and there hasn’t been clear definition provided to industry to answer that question.

We think the EURs up there are going to be a little bit less, but we also think the drilling and completion costs, because it’s a little shallower, will be less also.  So that particular acreage up there - and there’s about 10,000-something acres up there - that particular area up there is going to take a little bit of the valuation from industry and a couple of wells up there to determine the returns and economics for that particular acreage.

Compression—in any shale play area that has gas, compression is going to be needed, so approval of this type of facility is going to be done if they want production.  It’s just that easy.  So if in fact we find that the Pennsylvania DEP has made decisions that they don’t want compression up there, I think you’re going to make see industry make a wholesale change, and not spend as much capital up there would be one of them.

I appreciate you joining us for this third quarter teleconference call. I have Scott Schroeder, our CFO; Jeff Kotkin, VP of Marketing; Matt Reid, VP of our South region; and Phil Stalnaker, VP of our North region joining",1950,"Thanks, Christy. And good morning. I appreciate you joining us for this third quarter teleconference call. I have Scott Schroeder, our CFO; Jeff Kotkin, VP of Marketing; Matt Reid, VP of our South region; and Phil Stalnaker, VP of our North region joining me today for the call. Before we start, forward-looking statements included in the press release apply to my comments today.
Now let's get into our releases last night for the quarter. Cabot Oil & Gas reported claim net income of approximately $32 million or $0.31 per share, which exceeded consensus expectations. When you compare these numbers against the previous year third quarter, lower natural gas prices even with our higher production, did not match the previous year numbers. 
The selected item for the quarter were mainly an impairment and pension termination related expenses. The impairment includes 2 legacy South Texas fields that have not received any capital, and we have no planned operations for 2011. The pension charge relates to the acceleration of cost for the plant, which the company terminated September 30, 2010. This amortization will occur for the next 5 quarters as we go through the regulatory process to unwind the plant.
A highlight of the quarter and I think a very positive trend was 41% production growth versus last year's comparable production volumes for the third quarter. Sequentially, from the second quarter, production grew 18%. Another significant accomplishment as the company exceeded its production guidance target. Additionally, year-to-date growth levels are 22% over last year's first 9 months. And in fact yesterday, our year-to-date production matched the full year level reported for 2009, so our production for the remainder of the year will represent year-over-year growth. 
Natural gas prices were very soft, the realizations experienced a 27% decline for the quarter while oil prices remain strong. Both realizations were positively impacted by hedges for the quarter. In terms of hedging, we remain relatively unhedged for 2011. But we did add a -- contract for all of 2011, which is indicated on our website.
In our guidance, we did post new guidance, increasing fourth quarter production for 2010 and established 2009 guidance. The full year expectation for 2010 is now about 25% reported growth as we move into 2011. And with the second phase of Lathrop spill still pending, we are providing volumes for the first quarter of 2011 only. However, with no additional capacity from Lathrop, growth expectations are approximately 20% for 2011 full year and depending on the ultimate timing with Lathrop, percentage growth would only increase from that floor. As soon as we have full clarity on this point, we will communicate the timing and fine-tune further growth expectations.
The new guidance for cost highlight, the impact of the expanding production base combined with operations focused in just 3 basins for 2011. Additionally, the capital program changes are identified, establishing 2011 at $600 million and moving the remainder of 2010 up $65 million to $790 million. 
The 2 main reasons for the capital increase are our participation in nonoperated wells in the Haynesville/Bossier combined with the increased cost of pumping services industry is seeing across the board. Capital allocation in 2011, the Haynesville/Bossier area, we are working on a joint venture to fund this area for 2011. Additionally, we have provided for an increase to our estimates for pumping services commensurate with current levels plus added a factor for inflation. Also, we will reduce our rig activity in both regions next year. However, we will still be able to realize our production growth projections established in our guidance.
Now let's move to operations. While we currently have operations ongoing in the Marcellus, Haynesville and Eagle Ford, for 2011, we will concentrate our capital allocation in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford. In the South region for the remainder of 2010, Cabot is participating in 16 outside operated Haynesville/Bossier wells that are currently drilling, completing or waiting on completion, with working interest generally ranging from 10% to 20%. 
Results to date in the play continues to show production at high initial rates with excellent recoverable reserves. This is true for both the Haynesville and Bossier formation. So we continue to be encouraged by the Bossier wells on and around our acreage. Cabot has participated in 4 Bossier wells in this area, 2 of the wells have been completed and have performed equal to or better than the Haynesville completions. The other 2 remaining wells are scheduled to be completed before year end. 
These recent success reinforces our belief that our acreage is located in a core area for both. Though unpopular today, our capital allocated display continues to capture a significant resource potential for the future.
As I previously mentioned, Cabot is seeking a 33% working interest nonoperating partner in our Haynesville/Bossier acreage. This joint venture will potentially include some upfront consideration plus a capital carry and an AMI, which allows for participation in future acreage acquisition. This process is moving forward as we speak.
Moving down further South Texas, as reported last night, the company successfully completed its third Eagle Ford well. The Armenia Energy Trust 2H [ph] which is 100% operated Cabot well located in Frio County was drilled to a total depth of 13, 175 with a 4325-foot lateral, and is cleaning up and hit a peak rate of over 600 barrels equivalent yesterday. 
This well is located in our Buckhorn area. The fourth company operated well, the Cromwell Ranch 1H, another 100% Cabot well located in the County was drilled with a lateral length of 6,000 feet and is schedule for completion in the next couple of weeks.
Additionally, additional drilling in the prospect area is scheduled for later this quarter. Cabot holds approximately 53,000 net acres in the oil and window of the play and has over 300 net potential locations. Also in Eagle Ford oil trend, drilling on our 18,000-acre area of mutual interest with EOG is scheduled to begin by year end. 
Each company as you might be aware contributed 50% of the acreage in the JV with the operator EOG. The current plan is to keep at least one rig active in the JV area throughout 2011. With our South region capital being allocated between our operated Buckhorn area and the EOG JV, we anticipate potentially doubling our oil volumes in 2011 from 2010.
Now let's move up to the North region. In the Marcellus, we achieved a new production high of 245 million cubic foot gross per day, predominantly from 43 horizontal wells and had an outstanding quarter with production growth for the third quarter increasing approximately 74% over the second quarter of 2010. 
During the quarter, Cabot had 2 wells exceed the 20 million a day rate for a 24-hour initial production period. One well had a lateral of 4,659 feet in 18 stages while the other had a lateral of 3,960 feet with 15 stages. Also during the quarter, Cabot completed a 3-well pad with a total of 55 frac stages and 3 wells are producing a combined 47 million cubic foot, which was highlighted also in the press release last night.
Cabot continues to run 7 fit for purpose rigs in the Marcellus. Today we have a total of 44 stages currently being completed. 93 stages waiting on pipeline and 336 stages waiting on completion. But with the prolific nature of the wells and completions that we're drilling, coupled with balancing our capital allocation, we will be adjusting our rig count in 2011 to 5 rigs. Right now, we are planning 54 horizontal wells in Susquehanna in 2011, which will provide for a significant growth profile. 
On the seismic front, Cabot has completed shooting 250 square miles of 3D seismic data and has participated in the acquisition of an additional 85 square miles of 3D seismic in Susquehanna. Right now, we have all of the 335 miles of 3D data in-house being interpreted, which covers approximately 60% of our acreage position in the Marcellus. 
As many of you are aware, at our Lathrop compressor station Cabot is still waiting on the air quality permit for 3 additional compressors, which was discussed last quarter. Cabot continues to have discussions with the Pennsylvania DEP to resolve this issue.
On a positive note, we believe with further engineering we can tweak Lathrop Phase I to add 10 million to 20 million cubic foot more per day. Additionally, we are working towards the development of 3 additional compressors sites, 2 of which will be in limited operation during the latter part of 2011. Our expectation is at a minimum we will be able to free flow passed through both of these new compressor site. None of these potential upside are in our 20% growth sales forecast for 2011.
Our Marcellus is quite remarkable resource and even with lower natural gas prices and gas being out of favor with investors, our economic returns are in the top quartile of the food chain. Case in point: While we have seen many strong wells particularly most recently, our EUR guidance is still only 5.5 Bcf. At the current EUR, 5.5 Bcf in current pricing, our rate of return will compete with most oil and gas projects very favorably. 
We will update our EUR from Marcellus after our year end reserves bookings. Also Cabot continues to evaluate along with expert consultants a 9 square mile area in Susquehanna where the Pennsylvania DEP suspended drilling and frac-ing operations almost a year ago. Cabot has compiled records of the existence of methane in and around the -- area long before Cabot began drilling for natural gas. 
Additionally, Cabot provided copies of sworn affidavits from residents along Carter Road and other areas to acknowledge they had always had methane in their water and even ignited their water prior to Cabot drilling in their community. Cabot has demonstrated it can remediate the preexisting methane in the water wells by installing methane separation system in a technical meeting between the Pennsylvania DEP and Cabot just 3 days prior to the DEP's announced pipeline planned. The DEP acknowledged to Cabot that methane separators have worked in other areas in the state and will work in Demic [ph]. 
This proven technology is a quicker, cost effective permanent solution to treat the pre-existing methane condition. Cabot has the required to offset the sudden change in the direction of the preferred solution by the Pennsylvania DEP.
Now let's move back to operations. In the Rocky Mountains and the North region, our initial -- in the Nevada was dry but it did provide us information to carry to our other 2 areas in Nevada. It did not condemn our original prospect concepts. We just encountered a section little bit shallower than anticipated. 
We do plan on shooting additional seismic and continuing our evaluation out there. In regards to our Montana Heath play, we should be moving a rig in in the next week or so. As we continue to execute our program in both regions and look ahead to 2011, we are very well positioned to weather this commodity cycle while still economically building the company. 
We have a focus on the Marcellus and Eagle Ford for 2011 with a program that is geared towards cash flow expectations. We are fully aware of concerns of overextending cash flows in this market in this type of market, and we will manage these concerns. 
Additionally, even in the soft natural gas pricing environment, the vast majority of our capital scheduled to be allocated towards the Marcellus and Eagle Ford will deliver very good rate of returns for our shareholders. Christy, what with that, we'll be more than happy to take any questions."

I appreciate you joining us for this third quarter teleconference call. I have Scott Schroeder, our CFO; Jeff Hutton, VP of Marketing; Matt Reid, VP of our South Region; and Phil Stalnaker, VP of our North Region, joinin",1960,"Thanks, Christy, and good morning. I appreciate you joining us for this third quarter teleconference call. I have Scott Schroeder, our CFO; Jeff Hutton, VP of Marketing; Matt Reid, VP of our South Region; and Phil Stalnaker, VP of our North Region, joining me today for the call. Before we start, forward-looking statements including the press release apply to my comments today.
Now let's get into our releases last night for the quarter. Cabot Oil & Gas reported clean net income of approximately $32 million or $0.31 per share, which exceeded consensus expectations. When you compare these numbers against the previous year third quarter, lower natural gas prices even with our higher production, did not match the previous year numbers. 
The selected item for the quarter were mainly an impairment and pension termination related expenses. The impairment includes 2 legacy South Texas fields that have not received any capital and we have no planned operations for 2011. The pension charge relates to the acceleration of cost for the plant, which the company terminated September 30, 2010. This amortization will occur for the next 5 quarters as we go through the regulatory process to unwind the plant.
A highlight of the quarter and I think a very positive trend was a 41% production growth versus last year's comparable production volumes for the third quarter. Sequentially, from the second quarter, production grew 18%. Another significant accomplishment as the company exceeded its production guidance targets. Additionally, year-to-date growth levels are 22% over last year's first 9 months. And in fact yesterday, our year-to-date production matched the full year level reported for 2009, so our production for the remainder of the year will represent year-over-year growth. 
Natural gas prices, everybody is aware, very soft. The realizations experienced a 27% decline for the quarter while oil prices remain strong. Both realizations were positively impacted by hedges for the quarter. In terms of hedging, we remain relatively unhedged for 2011. But we did add a costless collar contract for all of 2011, which is indicated on our website.
In our guidance, we did post new guidance, increasing fourth quarter production for 2010 and established 2009 guidance. The full year expectation for 2010 is now about 25% reported growth as we move into 2011. And with the second phase of Lathrop still pending, we are providing volumes for the first quarter of 2011 only. However, with no additional capacity from Lathrop, growth expectations are approximately 20% for 2011 full year and depending on the ultimate timing with Lathrop, percentage growth would only increase from that floor. As soon as we have full clarity on this point, we will communicate the timing and fine-tune further growth expectations.
The new guidance for cost highlight, the impact of the expanding production base combined with operations focused in just 3 basins for 2011. Additionally, the capital program changes are identified, establishing 2011 at $600 million and moving the remainder of 2010 up $65 million to $790 million. 
The 2 main reasons for the capital increase are our participation in non-operated wells in the Haynesville/Bossier combined with the increased cost of pumping services industry is seeing across the board. To assist with capital allocation in 2011, the Haynesville/Bossier area, we are working on a joint venture to fund this area for 2011. Additionally, we have provided for an increase to our estimates for pumping services commensurate with current levels plus added a factor for inflation. Also, we will reduce our rig activity in both regions next year. However, we will still be able to realize our production growth projections established in our guidance.
Now let's move to operations. While we currently have operations ongoing in the Marcellus, Haynesville and Eagle Ford, for 2011, we will concentrate our capital allocation in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford. In the South region for the remainder of 2010, Cabot is participating in 16 outside operated Haynesville/Bossier wells that are currently drilling, completing or waiting on completion, with working interest generally ranging from 10% to 20%. 
Results to date in the play continues to show production at high initial rates, with excellent recoverable reserves. This is true for both the Haynesville and Bossier formation. So we continue to be encouraged by the Bossier wells on and around our acreage. Cabot has participated in 4 Bossier wells in this area, 2 of the wells have been completed and have performed equal to or better than the Haynesville completions. The other 2 remaining wells are scheduled to be completed before year end. 
These recent success reinforces our belief that our acreage is located in a core area for both zones. Though unpopular today, our capital allocated display continues to capture a significant resource potential for the future.
As I previously mentioned, Cabot is seeking a 33% working interest in non-operated -- non-operating partner in our Haynesville/Bossier acreage. This joint venture will potentially include some upfront consideration plus a capital carry and an AMI, which allows for participation in future acreage acquisition. This process is moving forward as we speak.
Moving down further South Texas, as reported last night, the company successfully completed its third Eagle Ford well. The Arminius Energy Trust #2H, which is 100% operated Cabot well located in Frio County was drilled to a total depth of 13, 175 with a 4,325-foot lateral, and is cleaning up and hit a peak rate of over 600 barrels equivalent yesterday. 
This well is located in our Buckhorn area. The fourth company operated well, the Cromwell Ranch 1H, another 100% Cabot well located in La Salle County was drilled with a lateral length of 6,000 feet and is schedule for completion in the next couple of weeks.
Additionally, additional drilling in the prospect area is scheduled for later this quarter. Cabot holds approximately 53,000 net acres in the oil window of the play and has over 300 net potential locations. Also in Eagle Ford oil trend, drilling on our 18,000-acre area of mutual interest with EOG is scheduled to begin by year end. Each company, as you might be aware, contributed 50% of the acreage in the JV with the operator, EOG. The current plan is to keep at least 1 rig active in the JV area throughout 2011. With our South Region capital being allocated between our operated Buckhorn area and the EOG JV, we anticipate potentially doubling our oil volumes in 2011 from 2010.
Now let's move up to the North region. In the Marcellus, we achieved a new production high of 245 million cubic foot gross per day, predominantly from 43 horizontal wells and had an outstanding quarter with production growth for the third quarter increasing approximately 74% over the second quarter of 2010. 
During the quarter, Cabot had 2 wells exceed the 20 million a day rate for a 24-hour initial production period. One well had a lateral of 4,659 feet in 18 stages while the other had a lateral of 3,960 feet with 15 stages. Also during the quarter, Cabot completed a 3-well pad with a total of 55 frac stages and the 3 wells are producing a combined 47 million cubic foot, which was highlighted also in the press release last night.
Cabot continues to run 7 fit-for-purpose rigs in the Marcellus. Today, we have a total of 44 stages currently being completed. 93 stages waiting on pipeline and 336 stages waiting on completion. But with the prolific nature of the wells and completions that we're drilling, coupled with balancing our capital allocation, we will be adjusting our rig count in 2011 to 5 rigs. Right now, we are planning 54 horizontal wells in Susquehanna in 2011, which will provide for a significant growth profile. 
On the seismic front, Cabot has completed shooting 250 square miles of 3D seismic data and has participated in the acquisition of an additional 85 square miles of 3D seismic in Susquehanna. Right now, we have all of the 335 miles of 3D data in-house being interpreted, which covers approximately 60% of our acreage position in the Marcellus. 
As many of you are aware, at our Lathrop compression station, Cabot is still waiting on the air quality permit for 3 additional compressors, which was discussed last quarter. Cabot continues to have discussions with the Pennsylvania DEP to resolve this issue.
On a positive note, we believe with further engineering, we can tweak Lathrop Phase I to add 10 million to 20 million cubic foot more per day. Additionally, we are working towards the development of 3 additional compressor sites, 2 of which will be in a limited operation during the latter part of 2011. Our expectation is at a minimum, we will be able to free flow gas through both of these new compressor sites. None of these potential upsides are in our 20% growth sales forecast for 2011.
Our Marcellus is quite remarkable resource and even with lower natural gas prices and gas being out of favor with investors, our economic returns are in the top quartile of the food chain. Case in point: While we have seen many strong wells particularly, most recently, our EUR guidance is still only 5.5 Bcf. At the current EUR, 5.5 Bcf in current pricing, our rate of return will compete with most oil and wet gas projects very favorably. We will update our EUR for Marcellus after our year end reserves bookings. 
Also, Cabot continues to evaluate along with expert consultants, a 9 square mile area in Susquehanna, where the Pennsylvania DEP suspended drilling and frac-ing operations almost a year ago. Cabot has compiled records of the existence of methane in and around the Dimock area long before Cabot began drilling for natural gas. Additionally, Cabot provided copies of sworn affidavits from residents along Carter Road and other areas who acknowledge they had always had methane in their water and even ignited their water prior to Cabot drilling in their community. Cabot has demonstrated it can remediate the pre-existing methane in the water wells by installing methane separation systems in a technical meeting between the Pennsylvania DEP and Cabot just 3 days prior to the DEP's announced pipeline plan. The DEP acknowledged to Cabot that methane separators have worked in other areas in the state and will work in Dimock. 
This proven technology is a quicker, cost-effective, permanent solution to treat the pre-existing methane condition. The Cabot offensive has been required to offset the sudden change in the direction of the preferred solution by the Pennsylvania DEP.
Now let's move back to operations. In the Rocky Mountain in the North region, our initial rank wildcat in the Nevada was dry but it did provide us information to carry to our other 2 areas in Nevada. It did not condemn our original prospect concept. We just encountered the section little bit shallower than anticipated. 
We do plan on shooting additional seismic and continuing our evaluation out there. In regards to our Montana Heath play, we should be moving a rig in, in the next week or so. As we continue to execute our program in both regions and look ahead to 2011, we are very well positioned to weather this commodity cycle, while still economically building the company. 
We have a focus on the Marcellus and Eagle Ford for 2011 with a program that is geared towards cash flow expectations. We are fully aware of concerns of overextending cash flows in this market in this type of market, and we will manage these concerns. 
Additionally, even in the soft natural gas pricing environment, the vast majority of our capital scheduled to be allocated towards the Marcellus and Eagle Ford will deliver very good rate of returns for our shareholders. 
Christy, what with that, we'll be more than happy to take any questions."

In other words, the calculation to be done at Lathrop station. And that was pursuant to regulations and the requirements. Somewhere in approximately May timeframe, the DEP indicated that the determination of issuing air quality permits will be based on an aggregation calculation, and that means to aggregate not only the Lathrop emissions but also aggregate it with the Teel compressor site also. And in an aggregation sense, there has not been any clarity on that particular process. And in fact, we're uncertain on whether or not this aggregation means that every well that is hooked up to the pipelines in the compressor station, does that have to be included, and does future wells that would be hooked up to that pipeline have to be included. We're uncertain about all of that, and there hasn't been clear definition provided to industry to answer that question. So boiling it down, its bottom line is are they making a decision as regulations had provided for on a single source, air quality permit? Or are they going to consider aggregation as their requirements to issue air quality permits. That's the defining question."

And we are evaluating in our area in Zavala, we're just evaluating the industry activity up there. We think the EURs up there are going to be a little bit less. We also think the drilling and completion cost because it's a little shallower, will be less also. So that particular acreage up there and there's about 10,000 something acres up there. That particular area up there is going to take a little bit of devaluation from industry and a couple of wells up there to determine the returns and economics for that particular acreage.

258181,114113699,163462,"Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Coterra Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Christy, and good morning. I appreciate you joining us for this third quarter teleconference call. I have Scott Schroeder, our CFO; Jeff Hutton, VP of Marketing; Matt Reid, VP of our South Region; and Phil Stalnaker, VP of our North Region, in joi",1960,"Thanks, Christy, and good morning. I appreciate you joining us for this third quarter teleconference call. I have Scott Schroeder, our CFO; Jeff Hutton, VP of Marketing; Matt Reid, VP of our South Region; and Phil Stalnaker, VP of our North Region, in joining me today for the call. Before we start, forward-looking statements included the press release apply to my comments today.
Now let's get into our releases last night for the quarter. Cabot Oil & Gas reported clean net income of approximately $32 million or $0.31 per share, which exceeded consensus expectations. When you compare these numbers against the previous year third quarter, lower natural gas prices even with our higher production, did not match the previous year numbers. 
The selected item for the quarter were mainly in impairment and pension termination-related expenses. The impairment includes 2 legacy South Texas fields that have not received any capital, and we have no planned operations for 2011. The pension charge relates to the acceleration of cost for the plan, which the company terminated September 30, 2010. This amortization will occur for the next 5 quarters as we go through the regulatory process to unwind the plan.
A highlight of the quarter and I think a very positive trend was the 41% production growth versus last year's comparable production volumes for the third quarter. Sequentially, from the second quarter, production grew 18%. Another significant accomplishment was the company exceeded its production guidance targets. Additionally, year-to-date growth levels are 22% over last year's first 9 months. And in fact yesterday, our year-to-date production matched the full year level reported for 2009, so our production for the remainder of the year will represent year-over-year growth. 
Natural gas prices, everybody's aware, very soft. The realizations experienced a 27% decline for the quarter while oil prices remained strong. Both realizations were positively impacted by hedges for the quarter. In terms of hedging, we remain relatively unhedged for 2011. But we did add a costless collar contract for all of 2011, which is indicated on our website.
In our guidance, we did post new guidance, increasing fourth quarter production for 2010 and established 2009 guidance. The full year expectation for 2010 is now about 25% reported growth.  As we move into 2011, and with the second phase of Lathrop still pending, we are providing volumes for the first quarter of 2011 only. However, with no additional capacity from Lathrop, growth expectations are approximately 20% for 2011 full year, and depending on the ultimate timing with Lathrop, percentage growth would only increase from that floor. As soon as we have full clarity on this point, we will communicate the timing and fine-tune further growth expectations.
The new guidance for cost highlights, the impact of the expanding production base combined with operations focused in just 3 basins for 2011. Additionally, the capital program changes are identified, establishing 2011 at $600 million and moving the remainder of 2010 up $65 million to $790 million. 
The 2 main reasons for the capital increase are our participation in non-operated wells in the Haynesville/Bossier combined with the increased cost of pumping services industry is seeing across the board. To assist with capital allocation in 2011, the Haynesville/Bossier area, we are working on a joint venture to fund this area for 2011. Additionally, we have provided for an increase to our estimates for pumping services commensurate with current levels plus added a factor for inflation. Also, we will reduce our rig activity in both regions next year. However, we will still be able to realize our production growth projections established in our guidance.
Now let's move to operations. And while we currently have operations ongoing in the Marcellus, Haynesville and Eagle Ford, for 2011, we will concentrate our capital allocation in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford. In the South region for the remainder of 2010, Cabot is participating in 16 outside operated Haynesville/Bossier wells that are currently drilling, completing or waiting on completion, with working interest generally ranging from 10% to 20%. 
Results to date in the play continues to show production at high initial rates, with excellent recoverable reserves. This is true for both the Haynesville and Bossier formation. So we continue to be encouraged by the Bossier wells on and around our acreage. Cabot has participated in 4 Bossier wells in this area.  2 of the wells have been completed and have performed equal to or better than the Haynesville completions. The other 2 remaining wells are scheduled to be completed before year end. 
This recent success reinforces our belief that our acreage is located in a core area for both zones. Though unpopular today, our capital allocated to this play continues to capture a significant resource potential for the future.
As I previously mentioned, Cabot is seeking a 33% working interest in non-operated -- non-operating partner in our Haynesville/Bossier acreage. This joint venture would potentially include some upfront consideration plus a capital carry and an AMI, which allows for participation in future acreage acquisition. This process is moving forward as we speak.
Moving down further South Texas. As reported last night, the company successfully completed its third Eagle Ford well. The Arminius Energy Trust 2H, which is 100% operated Cabot well located in Frio County, was drilled to a total depth of 13,175 with a 4,325-foot lateral, and is cleaning up and hit a peak rate of over 600 barrels equivalent yesterday. 
This well is located in our Buckhorn area. The fourth company-operated well, the Cromwell Ranch 1H, another 100% Cabot well, located in La Salle County was drilled with a lateral length of 6,000 feet and is schedule for completion in the next couple of weeks.
Additionally, additional drilling in the prospect area is scheduled for later this quarter. Cabot holds approximately 53,000 net acres in the oil window of the play and has over 300 net potential locations. Also in the Eagle Ford oil trend, drilling on our 18,000-acre area of mutual interest with EOG is scheduled to begin by year end. Each company, as you might be aware, contributed 50% of the acreage in the JV with the operator, EOG. The current plan is to keep at least 1 rig active in the JV area throughout 2011. With our South Region capital being allocated between our operated Buckhorn area and the EOG JV, we anticipate potentially doubling our oil volumes in 2011 from 2010.
Now let's move up to the North region. In the Marcellus, we achieved a new production high of 245 million cubic foot gross per day, predominantly from 43 horizontal wells, and had an outstanding quarter with production growth for the third quarter increasing approximately 74% over the second quarter of 2010. 
During the quarter, Cabot had 2 wells exceed the 20 million a day rate for a 24-hour initial production period. One well had a lateral of 4,659 feet in 18 stages while the other had a lateral of 3,960 feet with 15 stages. Also during the quarter, Cabot completed a 3-well pad with a total of 55 frac stages, and the 3 wells are producing a combined 47 million cubic foot, which was highlighted also in the press release last night.
Cabot continues to run 7 fit-for-purpose rigs in the Marcellus. Today, we have a total of 44 stages currently being completed, 93 stages waiting on pipeline and 336 stages waiting on completion. But this -- with the prolific nature of the wells and completions that we're drilling, coupled with balancing our capital allocation, we will be adjusting our rig count in 2011 to 5 rigs. Right now, we are planning 54 horizontal wells in Susquehanna in 2011, which will provide for a significant growth profile. 
On the seismic front, Cabot has completed shooting 250 square miles of 3D seismic data and has participated in the acquisition of an additional 85 square miles of 3D seismic in Susquehanna. Right now, we have all of the 335 miles of 3D data in-house being interpreted, which covers approximately 60% of our acreage position in the Marcellus. 
As many of you are aware, at our Lathrop compression station, Cabot is still waiting on the air quality permit for 3 additional compressors, which was discussed last quarter. Cabot continues to have discussions with the Pennsylvania DEP to resolve this issue.
On a positive note, we believe with further engineering, we can tweak Lathrop Phase I to add 10 million to 20 million cubic foot more per day. Additionally, we are working towards the development of 3 additional compressor sites, 2 of which will be in limited operation during the latter part of 2011. Our expectation is at a minimum, we will be able to free flow gas through both of these new compressor sites. None of these potential upsides are in our 20% growth sales forecast for 2011.
Our Marcellus is quite remarkable resource, and even with lower natural gas prices and gas being out of favor with investors, our economic returns are in the top quartile of the food chain. Case in point: While we have seen many strong wells, particularly, most recently, our EUR guidance is still only 5.5 Bcf. At the current EUR, 5.5 Bcf, and current pricing, our rate of return will compete with most oil and wet gas projects very favorably. We will update our EUR for Marcellus after our year-end reserve bookings. 
Also, Cabot continues to evaluate, along with expert consultants, a 9 square mile area in Susquehanna where the Pennsylvania DEP suspended drilling and frac-ing operations almost a year ago. Cabot has compiled records of the existence of methane in and around the Dimock area long before Cabot began drilling for natural gas. Additionally, Cabot provided copies of sworn affidavits from residents along Carter Road and other areas who acknowledge they had always had methane in their water and even ignited their water prior to Cabot drilling in their community. Cabot has demonstrated it can remediate the pre-existing methane in the water wells by installing methane separation systems.  In a technical meeting between the Pennsylvania DEP and Cabot just 3 days prior to the DEP's announced pipeline plan, the DEP acknowledged to Cabot that methane separators have worked in other areas in the state and will work in Dimock. 
This proven technology is a quicker, cost-effective, permanent solution to treat the pre-existing methane condition. The Cabot offensive has been required to offset the sudden change in the direction of the preferred solution by the Pennsylvania DEP.
Now let's move back to operations. In the Rocky Mountain in the North region, our initial rank wildcat in Nevada was dry, but it did provide us information to carry to our other 2 areas in Nevada. It did not condemn our original prospect concept. We just encountered the section a little bit shallower than anticipated.  We do plan on shooting additional seismic and continuing our evaluation out there. 
In regards to our Montana Heath play, we should be moving a rig in, in the next week or so. As we continue to execute our program in both regions and look ahead to 2011, we are very well positioned to weather this commodity cycle, while still economically building the company. 
We have a focus on the Marcellus and Eagle Ford for 2011 with a program that is geared towards cash flow expectations. We are fully aware of concerns of overextending cash flows in this market, in this type of market, and we will manage these concerns. 
Additionally, even in this soft natural gas pricing environment, the vast majority of our capital scheduled to be allocated towards the Marcellus and Eagle Ford will deliver very good rate of returns for our shareholders. 
Christy, with that, we'll be more than happy to take any questions."

In other words, the calculation to be done at Lathrop station. And that was pursuant to regulations and the requirements. Somewhere in approximately May time frame, the DEP indicated that the determination of issuing air quality permits will be based on an aggregation calculation.  And that means to aggregate not only the Lathrop emissions but also aggregate it with the Teel compressor site also. And in an aggregation sense, there's not been any clarity on that particular process. And in fact, we're uncertain on whether or not does aggregation mean that every well that is hooked up to the pipelines in the compressor station, does that have to be included, and does future wells that would be hooked up to that pipeline have to be included. We're uncertain about all of that, and there hasn't been clear definition provided to industry to answer that question. So boiling it down, it's -- bottom line is are they making a decision as regulations had provided for on a single-source air quality permit? Or are they going to consider aggregation as their requirements to issue air quality permits. That's the defining question."
