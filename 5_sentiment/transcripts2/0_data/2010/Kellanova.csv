We're pleased to report another strong year of sustainable dependable performance to the Kellogg company. Our business model and focus strategy are helping us weather the tough consumer and customer environment",395,"Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong year of sustainable dependable performance to the Kellogg company. Our business model and focus strategy are helping us weather the tough consumer and customer environment and positioning us for growth now and well into the future despite the current economic backdrop. Our focus has been and will continue to be to sustainably grow the top line, drive investment in our brands, build an effective and cost-efficient infrastructure and consistently deliver solid results for the long-term.As I said last quarter and I think it bears repeating, 2009 has certainly presented us with challenges, and yet at the same time, given us opportunities to build an even stronger Kellogg Company. The weaker global economic environment has lessened the inflationary pressure on pricing and increased the stress level on consumers, which is translated into moderating top-line growth. However, consumers are seeking ways to maximize value and trading into some of that core categories such as cereal in markets like the U.S. and the U.K. Consumers recognize that our brands represent value, great taste and good nutrition. So that positions us well for the future.Another benefit of the weaker economy is media deflation in key markets. As a result, our increased investment in advertising has significantly grown our underlying impressions. On an internal basis, our advertising grew 15% in the back half of the year and nearly 7% for the full year.As discussed at our Investor Day and on previous earnings calls, we've being focusing on improving productivity and reducing costs. We've completed the first year of our three-year billion dollar plus cost-reduction program. In 2009, we exceeded our expectations in cost savings now adding a plus to the billion dollar challenge. The result, strong earnings per share growth and record cash flow for 2009.Benefiting from the 2009 momentum, we entered 2010 with a solid pipeline of innovation and renovation, as well as a renewed commitment to productivity and cost savings. We continue to focus on building a Kellogg Company resilient to economic conditions and poised to forge ahead. With excellent financial visibility into our future financial performance, we remain confident in our ability to deliver another year of sustainable and dependable growth. And with that, I'd now like to introduce our newly appointed CFO, Ron Dissinger, for the review of our financials. Ron, over to you."
283356,84162255,48590,"Kellogg Company, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2010",2010-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our 2009 financial results on Slide 4. As David said, despite the challenges of a weak economy and a competitive landscape, we had a good year. We met or exceeded our 2009 guidance on g",1663,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our 2009 financial results on Slide 4. As David said, despite the challenges of a weak economy and a competitive landscape, we had a good year. We met or exceeded our 2009 guidance on growth rates of 3% to 4% internal net sales, 8% to 10% internal operating profit and 10% to 12% currency-neutral earnings per share. In 2009, our internal net sales grew 3%, with strong operating profit growth at the top end of our range. As you are aware, our internal numbers exclude the effect of foreign exchange acquisitions and a 53rd week in 2008.Our net sales growth reflects a particularly strong year in Retail Cereal and a solid year in Retail Snacks, which helped to offset the pressures we experienced in our Food Service business due to industry trends and the supply disruption in our Eggo Waffle business. We continue to invest in our brands. And we increased our up-front cost investments to $0.26 per share for the full year compared with $0.14 per share in 2008. Our solid sales performance, combined with our cost savings and productivity initiatives, as well as moderating commodity inflation drove 10% internal operating profit growth for the year.This resulted in our full year 2009 earnings per share of $3.16, a 6% increase on a reported basis and a 13% increase on a currency neutral basis. As we've said on our third quarter call, we expected below-the-line items to negatively impact our full year and fourth quarter results. The primary drivers include, full year interest expense of $295 million, which includes the cost of the bond tender offer completed in December 2009. This enabled us to refinance a portion of our 2011 bond maturity at an attractive interest rate. Impacting the other income and expense line was a charitable contribution in the fourth quarter. In addition, we took an approximate $0.02 hit to our earnings per share in the fourth quarter from the impact of Venezuela.The situation in Venezuela is changing rapidly. However, profits from this business are only 1% to 2% of total company results. And we think we are appropriately positioned. Partially offsetting these expenses, we benefited from some discrete favorable tax items in 2009 lowering our tax rate to 28.2%.On Slide 5, we'll walk through the components of our internal sales growth for the fourth quarter and full year. Year-over-year reported net sales for the full year 2009 declined by 1.9%. On an internal basis, net sales grew 3%. The following components contributed to our sales performance. Our tonnage declined by 7/10 of a point during the year. Much of this decline came from our continued transition away from low margin products in Russia and China and the Eggo supply disruption. This decline masks a strong volume performance in Cereal. Price and mix contributed 3.7 points of growth to the business. Currency reduced our reported growth by 3.7 points. And acquisitions increased our reported growth by a modest 3/10 of a point. Also note that the 53rd week in the fourth quarter of 2008 impacted our reported sales growth unfavorably by 1.5% for the full year.Each of our operating segments contributed to net sales growth for the year. Internal net sales for North America increased 2.8%. Europe rose 1.6%, and Latin America grew 6.8%, while Asia-Pacific improved by 5%. Our fourth quarter internal net sales grew approximately 2%. Now let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss cost pressures. As expected, commodity prices moderated during the year reducing our cost pressures and cost of goods sold to approximately 3%. This compares to much higher inflation rates of the past several years. Our billion dollar plus challenge cost reduction initiatives, combined with price execution early in the year more than offset these cost pressures in 2009 and improved our gross margin during the year.For 2010, we expect cost pressures to remain at approximately 3%.For 2009, our gross profit was $5.4 billion. On an internal basis, our gross profit grew 6% for the year. Gross margin increased 100 basis points to 42.9% due to price increases as well as savings initiatives and cost of goods sold and these more than offset inflation and higher up-front costs. Internal gross margin was up 120 basis points. And if we exclude the impact of up-front costs, gross margin was up 160 basis points for the year. For 2010, we expect gross margin improvement of approximately 100 basis points.As you can see on Slide 8, we have continued our commitment to reinvesting in our brands through advertising. It remains a key component of our business model, and we believe essential to achieving our long-term goals. As we have said, we experienced media deflation in the year. Lower prices, combined with increased media efficiencies and increased investment resulted in a significant increase in impressions. In 2010, we expect our advertising to grow at a higher rate than sales, even with expected media deflation in key markets.Slide 9 highlights our internal operating profit growth by area. Despite heavy investment in the advertising and up-front costs, our North American business still delivered 11% internal operating profit growth. And in the fourth quarter, North America internal operating profit increased by a healthy 25%. While Europe delivered moderate sales growth for the year, both operating efficiencies and media deflation contribute to a strong 7% internal operating profit increase for the year. In the fourth quarter, Europe delivered 13% internal operating profit growth.Latin America showed strong internal sales growth for the year. However, internal operating profit declined by 2%. Significantly higher input costs and increased advertising contributed to the full year decline. In addition, a December reduction in trade inventory impacted both full year and fourth quarter sales and profits. This trade inventory reduction increased advertising investment and higher upfront costs contributed to a 52% decline in internal operating profit for the fourth quarter. And in Asia-Pacific, internal operating profit increased by 14% for the full year, driven by sales performance. However, increased advertising contributed to a 21% decline in fourth quarter internal operating profit.Now let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss cash flow. Managing for cash continues to be a key operating principle for Kellogg. We are focused on growing net earnings and remain disciplined about core working capital and our balance sheet. We delivered record cash flow of $1.27 billion in 2009. Our strong cash flow generation has given us flexibility to support our business and continue to return cash to shareholders. Capital spending declined to 3% of net sales in 2009, versus 3.6% in 2008. As we said on our third quarter call for 2010, we expect capital spending to be approximately $500 million at the high end of our 3% to 4% range, driven by capacity increases on our Eggo Waffle network and cost to reimplement SAP across our Americas' business is.Also in the fourth quarter, we reduced our commercial paper significantly, and took our net debt to one of the lowest levels since the Keebler acquisition providing us with a strong liquidity position. Given the potential for continued volatility in the economy, we believe this positions us very well for the future. For 2010, we expect our cash flow to be comparable to 2009, given the increase in capital spending. In sum, we were pleased with our 2009 performance, posting solid sales growth and effectively managing our cost structure, while at the same time increasing our investment and advertising and up-front costs. We posted a double-digit increase in internal operating profit, invested in our future growth and improved our financial visibility. It was a very good year for Kellogg, delivering high quality earnings and a very difficult economic environment. Another year of sustainable and dependable performance.Now let's turn to Slide 12 for our expectations for 2010. We remain confident in our ability to deliver another year of sustainable and dependable growth. And we are raising our 2010 currency-neutral EPS forecast. We expect to continue to drive volume and mix to grow internal net sales to 2% to 3%. Our focus on productivity and expected moderate inflationary environment and a lower up-front cost should result in approximately 100 basis points of gross margin expansion. 2010 upfront investments are projected to be approximately $0.16 per share. About half of these costs are allocated to the cabling manufacturing initiative.Lower up-front costs should help accelerate our internal operating profit growth to 8% to 10%, which is above our long-term targets. Below the line, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $250 million to $260 million. Our effective tax rate is projected to be between 30% to 31%.Shares outstanding are expected to decline as we execute the remaining $463 million of the 2009 share repurchase authorization, plus the $650 million we authorized for 2010. We expect to lower shares outstanding by 2% to 3% for 2010. Our guidance for earnings per share has increased and is now 11% to 13% growth on a currency-neutral basis. To understand the impact of foreign exchange on our 2009 results and in 2010, please turn to Slide 13.  As we discussed on previous calls, moving from currency neutral to reported earnings per share guidance requires us to estimate the impact of foreign exchange on our earnings per share performance. The full year 2009 adverse impact of translational foreign exchange was $0.22 on EPS, up from our November estimate of $0.21.Slide 13 shows our key current currencies with 2009 actual rates and current spot rates as of February 1, 2010. Based on these spot rates, foreign exchange is estimated to be flat compared with our earlier estimate of a favorable $0.08. Approximately one-half of the change is related to the devaluation of the currency in Venezuela. As you are well aware, foreign exchange is a moving target. So we're prepared to update you on the impact on a quarterly basis. And now, I'd like to turn it over to John to discuss our business operations."

We delivered strong results in 2009 and are well-positioned to deliver another year of sustainable, dependable performance in 2010. As you can see on Slide 14, our 2009 North America internal sales grew 3% versus 6",1169,"Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in 2009 and are well-positioned to deliver another year of sustainable, dependable performance in 2010. As you can see on Slide 14, our 2009 North America internal sales grew 3% versus 6% last year. It was a particularly strong year for both Retail Cereal and Snacks. However, weakness in Frozen and Food Service, which I will address in a moment, dampened net sales for the year and particularly in the fourth quarter. As we look forward to 2010, we expect that North American sales growth will be in the low single-digits range. Let me discuss each business in greater detail, beginning with Cereal on Slide 15. Ready-to-Eat Cereal continues to be a strong category, responding well to brand building, nutrition and innovation. Cereal is also a great value. And we are seeing growth in all of our core markets around the world. By our estimate, the Ready-to-Eat Cereal category in the U.S. grew around 2% to 3% for the quarter, and approximately 3% for the full year. Our category share increased approximately 20 to 40 basis points for the quarter, and 10 to 20 basis points for the year. We continue to drive growth and support for our top eight brands, plus Kashi, which on a combined basis grew more than 7% in the quarter and even more for the full year.Our North American Ready-to-Eat Cereal business delivered a healthy 4% internal net sales growth for the full year, and was up 6% for the quarter driven by a double-digit increase in advertising. In addition to the growth in our large brands, there are two other factors, which impacted our North America Cereal shipments in the fourth quarter. Firstly, as we have mentioned before, we continue to manage the tail of our portfolio, axing On-The-Go and Straws because performance was not meeting expectations.Secondly, we did build our trade inventories at the end of the quarter in preparation to January events. We believe about 2% of our fourth quarter North America cereal shipments was due to trade inventory. Our innovation and renovation pipeline is solid. Froot Loops and Apple Jacks with fiber hit store shelves in August. Frosted Mini-Wheats, Little Bites Original flavor, Special K Granola and Cinnabon cereal will be introduced in the first quarter. Kashi is also introducing GOLEAN Crisp! and two new BearNaked granolas. Kellogg Canada also continued to perform well in the Cereal category with share growth for both the quarter and the year. Kashi's performance was particularly strong in Canada.Turning to our North America Snack business. We posted a full year internal net sales increased of 3% and 5% in the fourth quarter. On Slide 17, you can see that we achieved broad-based growth across our North America Snack business. Our Pop-Tarts brand is performing well, delivering mid-single digit internal net sales growth for the year.Crackers grew mid-single digits for the year driven by another strong year from Cheez-It. In the first quarter, we are launching two new SKUs of Wheatables Nut Crisps and two new SKUs of Cheez-Its. Cookies posted a slight gain for the year driven by the Fudge Shoppe and Mothers brand. And we saw some softness in the fourth quarter due to heavy promotional activity and ranging.Within snacks, our best performing category was wholesome snacks, which grew double-digit for the year and achieved strong share gains. The introduction of FiberPlus, Special K Chocolatey Pretzel and Cinnabon Bars helped drive wholesome snack growth for the year.Turning to the Frozen and Specialty Channels business. We experienced a tough 2009. The negative trends in the food service industry and the Eggo supply disruption contributed to a 13% decline in the quarter to finish the year down 1%. A combination of a flood and extensive enhancements and repairs at our Eggo facilities significantly impacted production in the second half of the year. While all of our plants are operational, we have not been able to achieve previous capacity levels. So demand continues to exceed supply. We are evaluating our inventory plans and working hard to increase capacity. However, as a result of the supply disruption, the impact on the top line will continue through the first half of 2010, and the estimated impact is included in our 2010 guidance. On a more positive note, Morningstar Farms Veggie Food net sales grew over 3% for the year, gaining over one share point. Kashi frozen meals grew over 10% for the year, capturing almost 25% of the natural organic meal category. Our Food Away From Home business posted lower sales for the year and the quarter reflecting the weak economic environment and the impact that this has had on the food service industry. We don't expect to see significant improvement in this business until the middle of 2010.Please turn to Slide 19. We will discuss the international business. Outside North America, our international business continues to perform well, delivering 3% internal sales growth for the year. In Europe, the operating environment remains difficult. As anticipated, the first half of 2009 was flat due to custom issues, but regained momentum in the back half of the year. Europe delivered 2% internal net sales growth for the year and 2% for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, Europe achieved share gains in the U.K., France, and Italy supported by an increase in brand impressions. Crunchy Nut and Rice Krispies in the U.K., and Extra and Drizzle throughout the continent, contributed to this growth. In Russia, we continued to transition away from bulk to higher margin packaged biscuits and cereal. And we also achieved significant package share gains in those categories. However, the large reduction in the bulk business adversely impacted the overall volume picture in Europe and for the entire company. In 2010, Europe is expected to deliver low single-digit sales growth despite a continuing tough economic environment.Turning to Latin America. We delivered strong results with 7% internal net sales growth for the year, despite flat internal net sales in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we reduced trade inventories in Mexico and the Caribbean and experienced supply constraints in Venezuela. In Mexico, we gained share growth in the quarter and the full year aided by the success of newly launched All-Bran Yogufibra and a new long-target media campaign, the Zucaritas. Looking to 2010, Latin America is projected to deliver mid-single digits growth in internal sales. We entered the year with healthy trade inventory levels, good consumption momentum and strong commercial plants.For the full year, our Asia-Pacific business delivered 5% internal net sales growth, building upon last year's growth of 8%. Our businesses in South Korea, Australia, and India all had strong cereal performance. In China, we continue to move away from lower margin volume, which impacted the fourth quarter and will continue to impact the first half of 2010. For Asia-Pacific, we expect to see top line growth in the mid-single digit range in 2010. And now, I'd like to turn it over to David for closing remarks."

In summary, we're pleased with our 2009 performance. We entered 2010 with confidence in our business model and focused strategy, yet at the same time, we're realistic given the headwinds of a volatile economy and consumer struggling under significant stress. While current conditions are unusual, we'll continue to drive the business to overcome these challenges. Our financial performance for 2010 will be strong, given our cost savings and productivity momentum and the investments we are making. The top line is expected to be in line with our long-term guidance and we have a clear focus to leverage the current tough environment to take advantage to build Kellogg into an even stronger company for the future.We're planning to grow our top line through exciting innovation and renovation and continued investment in advertising. We're optimizing our global organization and striving for enhanced effectiveness in many areas of our business. We're off to a great start with the completion of the first year of our three-year billion dollar plus challenge. We've significantly increased our investment in upfront costs, which will help grow our efficiency gains, help offset commodity and energy inflation in future periods and provide the fuel to sustain our momentum.

And I think that's putting a lot of pressure on them as costs rise, and yet in many areas they're absolute sales are actually dropping a little bit. And I think that's an area where most retailers are now looking to see how can they drive greater efficiency and effectiveness through this supply chains and through this system. We have been working with many of them, cutting our own SKUs, looking to work with them to see where we can drive further efficiency. As far as talking about a particular retailer, I think a number of retailers have looked to clean up their stores a little bit. I think the impact of that is typically more felt back in the DSD type area, where you have the ability and have normally been able to build incremental displays. So where customers are cutting back on that, probably in our DSD area, we're feeling a little bit more than anywhere else. And most of that, we'll feel a little bit of impact of that probably through the first half and then most of the activity started mid-2009. So not material, but probably a little bit of an impact. But in general terms, I think when you look at the overall retailing environment, very challenging given what's going on with some of the big segments and somewhat deflation rate."

I think on the call when we did this call a year ago, we said we hadn't seen that. Our inventory levels were relatively stable and where we expect them to be. This year, however, in the Cereal business, for a variety of reasons, we did notice that in Q4, our shipments were 6%, our consumption was probably around 4-ish and as we look at our inventory, slightly higher then we believe our customers would like them to be. So on a shipment base, we'll see a couple of percent. What we saw in fourth quarter come out in first quarter. It's nothing more than, making sure we manage our inventory levels to an appropriate level on behalf of our retail partners. And then the other impacts that you'll see probably in the first, second quarter for us is, we mentioned the Eggo disruption, which will impact through the first half. And Food Service, probably because it started to hit us in the back half of '09, given we're pretty much non-commercial food service versus the restaurant-type trade. That'll have an impact through the first half too, but that's all balanced into the full year guidance of 2% to 3%."

So I'm just wondering if you think about 2010, you talked about ad spending growing faster than sales growth, but how meaningful does ad spending maybe have to step up again, especially now that you're lapping the media deflation that you probably guided in 2009 as well?"

So while advertising will be above sales, our impressions will be significantly enhanced by that assumption that we're very comfortable with. So again, when you look at the base dollar spend, if you take 2009, I mean, you could add 5%, 6%, 7%, 8% from a dollar spend to our true impression and therefore in market impact. And likewise for 2010, that deflation is really going to help us get a lot more impressions for a much lower cost. Our view is that the, I think, strategic approach of investing behind your brands in this sort of market is clearly one that most other major brand new companies recognize support and are trying to catch up on."

We're pleased to report another strong year of sustainable dependable performance to the Kellogg company. Our business model and focus strategy are helping us weather the tough consumer and customer environment",395,"Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong year of sustainable dependable performance to the Kellogg company. Our business model and focus strategy are helping us weather the tough consumer and customer environment and positioning us for growth now and well into the future despite the current economic backdrop. Our focus has been and will continue to be to sustainably grow the top line, drive investment in our brands, build an effective and cost-efficient infrastructure and consistently deliver solid results for the long-term.As I said last quarter and I think it bears repeating, 2009 has certainly presented us with challenges, and yet at the same time, given us opportunities to build an even stronger Kellogg Company. The weaker global economic environment has lessened the inflationary pressure on pricing and increased the stress level on consumers, which is translated into moderating top-line growth. However, consumers are seeking ways to maximize value and trading into some of that core categories such as cereal in markets like the U.S. and the U.K. Consumers recognize that our brands represent value, great taste and good nutrition. So that positions us well for the future.Another benefit of the weaker economy is media deflation in key markets. As a result, our increased investment in advertising has significantly grown our underlying impressions. On an internal basis, our advertising grew 15% in the back half of the year and nearly 7% for the full year.As discussed at our Investor Day and on previous earnings calls, we've being focusing on improving productivity and reducing costs. We've completed the first year of our three-year billion dollar plus cost-reduction program. In 2009, we exceeded our expectations in cost savings now adding a plus to the billion dollar challenge. The result, strong earnings per share growth and record cash flow for 2009.Benefiting from the 2009 momentum, we entered 2010 with a solid pipeline of innovation and renovation, as well as a renewed commitment to productivity and cost savings. We continue to focus on building a Kellogg Company resilient to economic conditions and poised to forge ahead. With excellent financial visibility into our future financial performance, we remain confident in our ability to deliver another year of sustainable and dependable growth. And with that, I'd now like to introduce our newly appointed CFO, Ron Dissinger, for the review of our financials. Ron, over to you."

Let me begin with a summary of our 2009 financial results on Slide 4. As David said, despite the challenges of a weak economy and a competitive landscape, we had a good year. We met or exceeded our 2009 guidance on g",1663,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our 2009 financial results on Slide 4. As David said, despite the challenges of a weak economy and a competitive landscape, we had a good year. We met or exceeded our 2009 guidance on growth rates of 3% to 4% internal net sales, 8% to 10% internal operating profit and 10% to 12% currency-neutral earnings per share. In 2009, our internal net sales grew 3%, with strong operating profit growth at the top end of our range. As you are aware, our internal numbers exclude the effect of foreign exchange acquisitions and a 53rd week in 2008.Our net sales growth reflects a particularly strong year in Retail Cereal and a solid year in Retail Snacks, which helped to offset the pressures we experienced in our Food Service business due to industry trends and the supply disruption in our Eggo Waffle business. We continue to invest in our brands. And we increased our up-front cost investments to $0.26 per share for the full year compared with $0.14 per share in 2008. Our solid sales performance, combined with our cost savings and productivity initiatives, as well as moderating commodity inflation drove 10% internal operating profit growth for the year.This resulted in our full year 2009 earnings per share of $3.16, a 6% increase on a reported basis and a 13% increase on a currency neutral basis. As we've said on our third quarter call, we expected below-the-line items to negatively impact our full year and fourth quarter results. The primary drivers include, full year interest expense of $295 million, which includes the cost of the bond tender offer completed in December 2009. This enabled us to refinance a portion of our 2011 bond maturity at an attractive interest rate. Impacting the other income and expense line was a charitable contribution in the fourth quarter. In addition, we took an approximate $0.02 hit to our earnings per share in the fourth quarter from the impact of Venezuela.The situation in Venezuela is changing rapidly. However, profits from this business are only 1% to 2% of total company results. And we think we are appropriately positioned. Partially offsetting these expenses, we benefited from some discrete favorable tax items in 2009 lowering our tax rate to 28.2%.On Slide 5, we'll walk through the components of our internal sales growth for the fourth quarter and full year. Year-over-year reported net sales for the full year 2009 declined by 1.9%. On an internal basis, net sales grew 3%. The following components contributed to our sales performance. Our tonnage declined by 7/10 of a point during the year. Much of this decline came from our continued transition away from low margin products in Russia and China and the Eggo supply disruption. This decline masks a strong volume performance in Cereal. Price and mix contributed 3.7 points of growth to the business. Currency reduced our reported growth by 3.7 points. And acquisitions increased our reported growth by a modest 3/10 of a point. Also note that the 53rd week in the fourth quarter of 2008 impacted our reported sales growth unfavorably by 1.5% for the full year.Each of our operating segments contributed to net sales growth for the year. Internal net sales for North America increased 2.8%. Europe rose 1.6%, and Latin America grew 6.8%, while Asia-Pacific improved by 5%. Our fourth quarter internal net sales grew approximately 2%. Now let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss cost pressures. As expected, commodity prices moderated during the year reducing our cost pressures and cost of goods sold to approximately 3%. This compares to much higher inflation rates of the past several years. Our billion dollar plus challenge cost reduction initiatives, combined with price execution early in the year more than offset these cost pressures in 2009 and improved our gross margin during the year.For 2010, we expect cost pressures to remain at approximately 3%.For 2009, our gross profit was $5.4 billion. On an internal basis, our gross profit grew 6% for the year. Gross margin increased 100 basis points to 42.9% due to price increases as well as savings initiatives and cost of goods sold and these more than offset inflation and higher up-front costs. Internal gross margin was up 120 basis points. And if we exclude the impact of up-front costs, gross margin was up 160 basis points for the year. For 2010, we expect gross margin improvement of approximately 100 basis points.As you can see on Slide 8, we have continued our commitment to reinvesting in our brands through advertising. It remains a key component of our business model, and we believe essential to achieving our long-term goals. As we have said, we experienced media deflation in the year. Lower prices, combined with increased media efficiencies and increased investment resulted in a significant increase in impressions. In 2010, we expect our advertising to grow at a higher rate than sales, even with expected media deflation in key markets.Slide 9 highlights our internal operating profit growth by area. Despite heavy investment in the advertising and up-front costs, our North American business still delivered 11% internal operating profit growth. And in the fourth quarter, North America internal operating profit increased by a healthy 25%. While Europe delivered moderate sales growth for the year, both operating efficiencies and media deflation contribute to a strong 7% internal operating profit increase for the year. In the fourth quarter, Europe delivered 13% internal operating profit growth.Latin America showed strong internal sales growth for the year. However, internal operating profit declined by 2%. Significantly higher input costs and increased advertising contributed to the full year decline. In addition, a December reduction in trade inventory impacted both full year and fourth quarter sales and profits. This trade inventory reduction increased advertising investment and higher upfront costs contributed to a 52% decline in internal operating profit for the fourth quarter. And in Asia-Pacific, internal operating profit increased by 14% for the full year, driven by sales performance. However, increased advertising contributed to a 21% decline in fourth quarter internal operating profit.Now let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss cash flow. Managing for cash continues to be a key operating principle for Kellogg. We are focused on growing net earnings and remain disciplined about core working capital and our balance sheet. We delivered record cash flow of $1.27 billion in 2009. Our strong cash flow generation has given us flexibility to support our business and continue to return cash to shareholders. Capital spending declined to 3% of net sales in 2009, versus 3.6% in 2008. As we said on our third quarter call for 2010, we expect capital spending to be approximately $500 million at the high end of our 3% to 4% range, driven by capacity increases on our Eggo Waffle network and cost to reimplement SAP across our Americas' business is.Also in the fourth quarter, we reduced our commercial paper significantly, and took our net debt to one of the lowest levels since the Keebler acquisition providing us with a strong liquidity position. Given the potential for continued volatility in the economy, we believe this positions us very well for the future. For 2010, we expect our cash flow to be comparable to 2009, given the increase in capital spending. In sum, we were pleased with our 2009 performance, posting solid sales growth and effectively managing our cost structure, while at the same time increasing our investment in advertising and up-front costs. We posted a double-digit increase in internal operating profit, invested in our future growth and improved our financial visibility. It was a very good year for Kellogg, delivering high quality earnings in a very difficult economic environment. Another year of sustainable and dependable performance.Now let's turn to Slide 12 for our expectations for 2010. We remain confident in our ability to deliver another year of sustainable and dependable growth. And we are raising our 2010 currency-neutral EPS forecast. We expect to continue to drive volume and mix to grow internal net sales to 2% to 3%. Our focus on productivity and expected moderate inflationary environment and a lower up-front cost should result in approximately 100 basis points of gross margin expansion. 2010 upfront investments are projected to be approximately $0.16 per share. About half of these costs are allocated to the K-LEAN manufacturing initiative.Lower up-front costs should help accelerate our internal operating profit growth to 8% to 10%, which is above our long-term targets. Below the line, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $250 million to $260 million. Our effective tax rate is projected to be between 30% to 31%.Shares outstanding are expected to decline as we execute the remaining $463 million of the 2009 share repurchase authorization, plus the $650 million we authorized for 2010. We expect to lower shares outstanding by 2% to 3% for 2010. Our guidance for earnings per share has increased and is now 11% to 13% growth on a currency-neutral basis. To understand the impact of foreign exchange on our 2009 results and in 2010, please turn to Slide 13.  As we discussed on previous calls, moving from currency neutral to reported earnings per share guidance requires us to estimate the impact of foreign exchange on our earnings per share performance. The full year 2009 adverse impact of translational foreign exchange was $0.22 on EPS, up from our November estimate of $0.21.Slide 13 shows our key current currencies with 2009 actual rates and current spot rates as of February 1, 2010. Based on these spot rates, foreign exchange is estimated to be flat compared with our earlier estimate of a favorable $0.08. Approximately 1/2 of the change is related to the devaluation of the currency in Venezuela. As you are well aware, foreign exchange is a moving target. So we're prepared to update you on the impact on a quarterly basis. And now, I'd like to turn it over to John to discuss our business operations."

We delivered strong results in 2009 and are well-positioned to deliver another year of sustainable, dependable performance in 2010. As you can see on Slide 14, our 2009 North America internal sales grew 3% versus 6",1169,"Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in 2009 and are well-positioned to deliver another year of sustainable, dependable performance in 2010. As you can see on Slide 14, our 2009 North America internal sales grew 3% versus 6% last year. It was a particularly strong year for both Retail Cereal and Snacks. However, weakness in Frozen and Food Service, which I will address in a moment, dampened net sales for the year and particularly in the fourth quarter. As we look forward to 2010, we expect that North American sales growth will be in the low single-digits range. Let me discuss each business in greater detail, beginning with Cereal on Slide 15. Ready-to-Eat Cereal continues to be a strong category, responding well to brand building, nutrition and innovation. Cereal is also a great value. And we are seeing growth in all of our core markets around the world. By our estimate, the Ready-to-Eat Cereal category in the U.S. grew around 2% to 3% for the quarter, and approximately 3% for the full year. Our category share increased approximately 20 to 40 basis points for the quarter, and 10 to 20 basis points for the year. We continue to drive growth and support for our top eight brands, plus Kashi, which on a combined basis grew more than 7% in the quarter and even more for the full year.Our North American Ready-to-Eat Cereal business delivered a healthy 4% internal net sales growth for the full year, and was up 6% for the quarter driven by a double-digit increase in advertising. In addition to the growth in our large brands, there are two other factors, which impacted our North America Cereal shipments in the fourth quarter. Firstly, as we have mentioned before, we continue to manage the tail of our portfolio, axing On-The-Go and Straws because performance was not meeting expectations.Secondly, we did build our trade inventories at the end of the quarter in preparation to January events. We believe about 2% of our fourth quarter North America cereal shipments was due to trade inventory. Our innovation and renovation pipeline is solid. Froot Loops and Apple Jacks with fiber hit store shelves in August. Frosted Mini-Wheats, Little Bites Original flavor, Special K Granola and Cinnabon cereal will be introduced in the first quarter. Kashi is also introducing GOLEAN Crisp! and two new BearNaked granolas. Kellogg Canada also continued to perform well in the Cereal category with share growth for both the quarter and the year. Kashi's performance was particularly strong in Canada.Turning to our North America Snack business. We posted a full year internal net sales increased of 3% and 5% in the fourth quarter. On Slide 17, you can see that we achieved broad-based growth across our North America Snack business. Our Pop-Tarts brand is performing well, delivering mid-single digit internal net sales growth for the year.Crackers grew mid-single digits for the year driven by another strong year from Cheez-It. In the first quarter, we are launching two new SKUs of Wheatables Nut Crisps and two new SKUs of Cheez-Its. Cookies posted a slight gain for the year driven by the Fudge Shoppe and Mothers brand. And we saw some softness in the fourth quarter due to heavy promotional activity and ranging.Within snacks, our best performing category was wholesome snacks, which grew double-digit for the year and achieved strong share gains. The introduction of FiberPlus, Special K Chocolatey Pretzel and Cinnabon Bars helped drive wholesome snack growth for the year.Turning to the Frozen and Specialty Channels business. We experienced a tough 2009. The negative trends in the food service industry and the Eggo supply disruption contributed to a 13% decline in the quarter to finish the year down 1%. A combination of a flood and extensive enhancements and repairs at our Eggo facilities significantly impacted production in the second half of the year. While all of our plants are operational, we have not been able to achieve previous capacity levels. So demand continues to exceed supply. We are evaluating our inventory plans and working hard to increase capacity. However, as a result of the supply disruption, the impact on the top line will continue through the first half of 2010, and the estimated impact is included in our 2010 guidance. On a more positive note, Morningstar Farms Veggie Food net sales grew over 3% for the year, gaining over one share point. Kashi frozen meals grew over 10% for the year, capturing almost 25% of the natural organic meal category. Our Food Away From Home business posted lower sales for the year and the quarter reflecting the weak economic environment and the impact that this has had on the food service industry. We don't expect to see significant improvement in this business until the middle of 2010.Please turn to Slide 19. We will discuss the international business. Outside North America, our international business continues to perform well, delivering 3% internal sales growth for the year. In Europe, the operating environment remains difficult. As anticipated, the first half of 2009 was flat due to custom issues, but regained momentum in the back half of the year. Europe delivered 2% internal net sales growth for the year and 2% for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, Europe achieved share gains in the U.K., France, and Italy supported by an increase in brand impressions. Crunchy Nut and Rice Krispies in the U.K., and Extra and Drizzle throughout the continent, contributed to this growth. In Russia, we continued to transition away from bulk to higher margin packaged biscuits and cereal. And we also achieved significant package share gains in those categories. However, the large reduction in the bulk business adversely impacted the overall volume picture in Europe and for the entire company. In 2010, Europe is expected to deliver low single-digit sales growth despite a continuing tough economic environment.Turning to Latin America. We delivered strong results with 7% internal net sales growth for the year, despite flat internal net sales in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we reduced trade inventories in Mexico and the Caribbean and experienced supply constraints in Venezuela. In Mexico, we gained share growth in the quarter and the full year aided by the success of newly launched All-Bran Yogufibra and a new long-target media campaign, the Zucaritas. Looking to 2010, Latin America is projected to deliver mid-single digits growth in internal sales. We entered the year with healthy trade inventory levels, good consumption momentum and strong commercial plants.For the full year, our Asia-Pacific business delivered 5% internal net sales growth, building upon last year's growth of 8%. Our businesses in South Korea, Australia, and India all had strong cereal performance. In China, we continue to move away from lower margin volume, which impacted the fourth quarter and will continue to impact the first half of 2010. For Asia-Pacific, we expect to see top line growth in the mid-single digit range in 2010. And now, I'd like to turn it over to David for closing remarks."

In summary, we're pleased with our 2009 performance. We entered 2010 with confidence in our business model and focused strategy, yet at the same time, we're realistic given the headwinds of a volatile economy and consumer struggling under significant stress. While current conditions are unusual, we'll continue to drive the business to overcome these challenges. Our financial performance for 2010 will be strong, given our cost savings and productivity momentum and the investments we are making. The top line is expected to be in line with our long-term guidance and we have a clear focus to leverage the current tough environment to take advantage to build Kellogg into an even stronger company for the future.We're planning to grow our top line through exciting innovation and renovation and continued investment in advertising. We're optimizing our global organization and striving for enhanced effectiveness in many areas of our business. We're off to a great start with the completion of the first year of our three-year billion dollar plus challenge. We've significantly increased our investment in upfront costs, which will help grow our efficiency gains, help offset commodity and energy inflation in future periods and provide the fuel to sustain our momentum. And we will continue to reinvest heavily in the future of our business as we did in 2009.All these elements combined with excellent financial visibility support our increased confidence that we're on track to deliver our targeted rates of growth in 2010 and beyond. We've demonstrated our commitment to manage the business the right way, for long-term, sustainable, dependable performance. And I'd like to thank our shareholders for their continued interest in Kellogg. And I'd like to acknowledge and thank the Kellogg employees around the world for their dedication to the company and commitment to excellence as we begin 2010.

And I think that's putting a lot of pressure on them as costs rise, and yet in many areas they're absolute sales are actually dropping a little bit. And I think that's an area where most retailers are now looking to see how can they drive greater efficiency and effectiveness through this supply chains and through this system. We have been working with many of them, cutting our own SKUs, looking to work with them to see where we can drive further efficiency. As far as talking about a particular retailer, I think a number of retailers have looked to clean up their stores a little bit. I think the impact of that is typically more felt back in the DSD type area, where you have the ability and have normally been able to build incremental displays. So where customers are cutting back on that, probably in our DSD area, we're feeling a little bit more than anywhere else. And most of that, we'll feel a little bit of impact of that probably through the first half and then most of the activity started mid-2009. So not material, but probably a little bit of an impact. But in general terms, I think when you look at the overall retailing environment, very challenging given what's going on with some of the big segments and somewhat deflation rate."

So on a shipment base, we'll see a couple of percent. What we saw in fourth quarter come out in first quarter.

And for 2010, their expectation is that Latin America will continue to grow at mid-single digits. So while the quarter might look a little lag, we don't have any worries about Latin America for 2010. See it growing strongly again."

We're pleased to report another strong year of sustainable dependable performance to the Kellogg company. Our business model and focus strategy are helping us weather the tough consumer and customer environment",395,"Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong year of sustainable dependable performance to the Kellogg company. Our business model and focus strategy are helping us weather the tough consumer and customer environment and positioning us for growth now and well into the future despite the current economic backdrop. Our focus has been and will continue to be to sustainably grow the top line, drive investment in our brands, build an effective and cost-efficient infrastructure and consistently deliver solid results for the long-term.As I said last quarter and I think it bears repeating, 2009 has certainly presented us with challenges, and yet at the same time, given us opportunities to build an even stronger Kellogg Company. The weaker global economic environment has lessened the inflationary pressure on pricing and increased the stress level on consumers, which is translated into moderating top-line growth. However, consumers are seeking ways to maximize value and trading into some of that core categories such as cereal in markets like the U.S. and the U.K. Consumers recognize that our brands represent value, great taste and good nutrition. So that positions us well for the future.Another benefit of the weaker economy is media deflation in key markets. As a result, our increased investment in advertising has significantly grown our underlying impressions. On an internal basis, our advertising grew 15% in the back half of the year and nearly 7% for the full year.As discussed at our Investor Day and on previous earnings calls, we've being focusing on improving productivity and reducing costs. We've completed the first year of our three-year billion dollar plus cost-reduction program. In 2009, we exceeded our expectations in cost savings now adding a plus to the billion dollar challenge. The result, strong earnings per share growth and record cash flow for 2009.Benefiting from the 2009 momentum, we entered 2010 with a solid pipeline of innovation and renovation, as well as a renewed commitment to productivity and cost savings. We continue to focus on building a Kellogg Company resilient to economic conditions and poised to forge ahead. With excellent financial visibility into our future financial performance, we remain confident in our ability to deliver another year of sustainable and dependable growth. And with that, I'd now like to introduce our newly appointed CFO, Ron Dissinger, for the review of our financials. Ron, over to you."

Let me begin with a summary of our 2009 financial results on Slide 4. As David said, despite the challenges of a weak economy and a competitive landscape, we had a good year. We met or exceeded our 2009 guidance on g",1663,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our 2009 financial results on Slide 4. As David said, despite the challenges of a weak economy and a competitive landscape, we had a good year. We met or exceeded our 2009 guidance on growth rates of 3% to 4% internal net sales, 8% to 10% internal operating profit and 10% to 12% currency-neutral earnings per share. In 2009, our internal net sales grew 3%, with strong operating profit growth at the top end of our range. As you are aware, our internal numbers exclude the effect of foreign exchange acquisitions and a 53rd week in 2008.Our net sales growth reflects a particularly strong year in Retail Cereal and a solid year in Retail Snacks, which helped to offset the pressures we experienced in our Food Service business due to industry trends and the supply disruption in our Eggo Waffle business. We continue to invest in our brands. And we increased our up-front cost investments to $0.26 per share for the full year compared with $0.14 per share in 2008. Our solid sales performance, combined with our cost savings and productivity initiatives, as well as moderating commodity inflation drove 10% internal operating profit growth for the year.This resulted in our full year 2009 earnings per share of $3.16, a 6% increase on a reported basis and a 13% increase on a currency neutral basis. As we've said on our third quarter call, we expected below-the-line items to negatively impact our full year and fourth quarter results. The primary drivers include, full year interest expense of $295 million, which includes the cost of the bond tender offer completed in December 2009. This enabled us to refinance a portion of our 2011 bond maturity at an attractive interest rate. Impacting the other income and expense line was a charitable contribution in the fourth quarter. In addition, we took an approximate $0.02 hit to our earnings per share in the fourth quarter from the impact of Venezuela.The situation in Venezuela is changing rapidly. However, profits from this business are only 1% to 2% of total company results. And we think we are appropriately positioned. Partially offsetting these expenses, we benefited from some discrete favorable tax items in 2009 lowering our tax rate to 28.2%.On Slide 5, we'll walk through the components of our internal sales growth for the fourth quarter and full year. Year-over-year reported net sales for the full year 2009 declined by 1.9%. On an internal basis, net sales grew 3%. The following components contributed to our sales performance. Our tonnage declined by 7/10 of a point during the year. Much of this decline came from our continued transition away from low margin products in Russia and China and the Eggo supply disruption. This decline masks a strong volume performance in Cereal. Price and mix contributed 3.7 points of growth to the business. Currency reduced our reported growth by 3.7 points. And acquisitions increased our reported growth by a modest 3/10 of a point. Also note that the 53rd week in the fourth quarter of 2008 impacted our reported sales growth unfavorably by 1.5% for the full year.Each of our operating segments contributed to net sales growth for the year. Internal net sales for North America increased 2.8%. Europe rose 1.6%, and Latin America grew 6.8%, while Asia-Pacific improved by 5%. Our fourth quarter internal net sales grew approximately 2%. Now let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss cost pressures. As expected, commodity prices moderated during the year reducing our cost pressures and cost of goods sold to approximately 3%. This compares to much higher inflation rates of the past several years. Our billion dollar plus challenge cost reduction initiatives, combined with price execution early in the year more than offset these cost pressures in 2009 and improved our gross margin during the year.For 2010, we expect cost pressures to remain at approximately 3%.For 2009, our gross profit was $5.4 billion. On an internal basis, our gross profit grew 6% for the year. Gross margin increased 100 basis points to 42.9% due to price increases as well as savings initiatives and cost of goods sold and these more than offset inflation and higher up-front costs. Internal gross margin was up 120 basis points. And if we exclude the impact of up-front costs, gross margin was up 160 basis points for the year. For 2010, we expect gross margin improvement of approximately 100 basis points.As you can see on Slide 8, we have continued our commitment to reinvesting in our brands through advertising. It remains a key component of our business model, and we believe essential to achieving our long-term goals. As we have said, we experienced media deflation in the year. Lower prices, combined with increased media efficiencies and increased investment resulted in a significant increase in impressions. In 2010, we expect our advertising to grow at a higher rate than sales, even with expected media deflation in key markets.Slide 9 highlights our internal operating profit growth by area. Despite heavy investment in the advertising and up-front costs, our North American business still delivered 11% internal operating profit growth. And in the fourth quarter, North America internal operating profit increased by a healthy 25%. While Europe delivered moderate sales growth for the year, both operating efficiencies and media deflation contribute to a strong 7% internal operating profit increase for the year. In the fourth quarter, Europe delivered 13% internal operating profit growth.Latin America showed strong internal sales growth for the year. However, internal operating profit declined by 2%. Significantly higher input costs and increased advertising contributed to the full year decline. In addition, a December reduction in trade inventory impacted both full year and fourth quarter sales and profits. This trade inventory reduction increased advertising investment and higher upfront costs contributed to a 52% decline in internal operating profit for the fourth quarter. And in Asia-Pacific, internal operating profit increased by 14% for the full year, driven by sales performance. However, increased advertising contributed to a 21% decline in fourth quarter internal operating profit.Now let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss cash flow. Managing for cash continues to be a key operating principle for Kellogg. We are focused on growing net earnings and remain disciplined about core working capital and our balance sheet. We delivered record cash flow of $1.27 billion in 2009. Our strong cash flow generation has given us flexibility to support our business and continue to return cash to shareholders. Capital spending declined to 3% of net sales in 2009, versus 3.6% in 2008. As we said on our third quarter call for 2010, we expect capital spending to be approximately $500 million at the high end of our 3% to 4% range, driven by capacity increases on our Eggo Waffle network and cost to reimplement SAP across our Americas' business is.Also in the fourth quarter, we reduced our commercial paper significantly, and took our net debt to one of the lowest levels since the Keebler acquisition providing us with a strong liquidity position. Given the potential for continued volatility in the economy, we believe this positions us very well for the future. For 2010, we expect our cash flow to be comparable to 2009, given the increase in capital spending. In sum, we were pleased with our 2009 performance, posting solid sales growth and effectively managing our cost structure, while at the same time increasing our investment in advertising and up-front costs. We posted a double-digit increase in internal operating profit, invested in our future growth and improved our financial visibility. It was a very good year for Kellogg, delivering high quality earnings in a very difficult economic environment. Another year of sustainable and dependable performance.Now let's turn to Slide 12 for our expectations for 2010. We remain confident in our ability to deliver another year of sustainable and dependable growth. And we are raising our 2010 currency-neutral EPS forecast. We expect to continue to drive volume and mix to grow internal net sales to 2% to 3%. Our focus on productivity and expected moderate inflationary environment and a lower up-front cost should result in approximately 100 basis points of gross margin expansion. 2010 upfront investments are projected to be approximately $0.16 per share. About half of these costs are allocated to the K-LEAN manufacturing initiative.Lower up-front costs should help accelerate our internal operating profit growth to 8% to 10%, which is above our long-term targets. Below the line, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $250 million to $260 million. Our effective tax rate is projected to be between 30% to 31%.Shares outstanding are expected to decline as we execute the remaining $463 million of the 2009 share repurchase authorization, plus the $650 million we authorized for 2010. We expect to lower shares outstanding by 2% to 3% for 2010. Our guidance for earnings per share has increased and is now 11% to 13% growth on a currency-neutral basis. To understand the impact of foreign exchange on our 2009 results and in 2010, please turn to Slide 13.  As we discussed on previous calls, moving from currency neutral to reported earnings per share guidance requires us to estimate the impact of foreign exchange on our earnings per share performance. The full year 2009 adverse impact of translational foreign exchange was $0.22 on EPS, up from our November estimate of $0.21.Slide 13 shows our key current currencies with 2009 actual rates and current spot rates as of February 1, 2010. Based on these spot rates, foreign exchange is estimated to be flat compared with our earlier estimate of a favorable $0.08. Approximately 1/2 of the change is related to the devaluation of the currency in Venezuela. As you are well aware, foreign exchange is a moving target. So we're prepared to update you on the impact on a quarterly basis. And now, I'd like to turn it over to John to discuss our business operations."

We delivered strong results in 2009 and are well-positioned to deliver another year of sustainable, dependable performance in 2010. As you can see on Slide 14, our 2009 North America internal sales grew 3% versus 6",1169,"Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in 2009 and are well-positioned to deliver another year of sustainable, dependable performance in 2010. As you can see on Slide 14, our 2009 North America internal sales grew 3% versus 6% last year. It was a particularly strong year for both Retail Cereal and Snacks. However, weakness in Frozen and Food Service, which I will address in a moment, dampened net sales for the year and particularly in the fourth quarter. As we look forward to 2010, we expect that North American sales growth will be in the low single-digits range. Let me discuss each business in greater detail, beginning with Cereal on Slide 15. Ready-to-Eat Cereal continues to be a strong category, responding well to brand building, nutrition and innovation. Cereal is also a great value. And we are seeing growth in all of our core markets around the world. By our estimate, the Ready-to-Eat Cereal category in the U.S. grew around 2% to 3% for the quarter, and approximately 3% for the full year. Our category share increased approximately 20 to 40 basis points for the quarter, and 10 to 20 basis points for the year. We continue to drive growth and support for our top eight brands, plus Kashi, which on a combined basis grew more than 7% in the quarter and even more for the full year.Our North American Ready-to-Eat Cereal business delivered a healthy 4% internal net sales growth for the full year, and was up 6% for the quarter driven by a double-digit increase in advertising. In addition to the growth in our large brands, there are two other factors, which impacted our North America Cereal shipments in the fourth quarter. Firstly, as we have mentioned before, we continue to manage the tail of our portfolio, axing On-The-Go and Straws because performance was not meeting expectations.Secondly, we did build our trade inventories at the end of the quarter in preparation to January events. We believe about 2% of our fourth quarter North America cereal shipments was due to trade inventory. Our innovation and renovation pipeline is solid. Froot Loops and Apple Jacks with fiber hit store shelves in August. Frosted Mini-Wheats, Little Bites Original flavor, Special K Granola and Cinnabon cereal will be introduced in the first quarter. Kashi is also introducing GOLEAN Crisp! and two new BearNaked granolas. Kellogg Canada also continued to perform well in the Cereal category with share growth for both the quarter and the year. Kashi's performance was particularly strong in Canada.Turning to our North America Snack business. We posted a full year internal net sales increased of 3% and 5% in the fourth quarter. On Slide 17, you can see that we achieved broad-based growth across our North America Snack business. Our Pop-Tarts brand is performing well, delivering mid-single digit internal net sales growth for the year.Crackers grew mid-single digits for the year driven by another strong year from Cheez-It. In the first quarter, we are launching two new SKUs of Wheatables Nut Crisps and two new SKUs of Cheez-Its. Cookies posted a slight gain for the year driven by the Fudge Shoppe and Mothers brand. And we saw some softness in the fourth quarter due to heavy promotional activity and ranging.Within snacks, our best performing category was wholesome snacks, which grew double-digit for the year and achieved strong share gains. The introduction of FiberPlus, Special K Chocolatey Pretzel and Cinnabon Bars helped drive wholesome snack growth for the year.Turning to the Frozen and Specialty Channels business. We experienced a tough 2009. The negative trends in the food service industry and the Eggo supply disruption contributed to a 13% decline in the quarter to finish the year down 1%. A combination of a flood and extensive enhancements and repairs at our Eggo facilities significantly impacted production in the second half of the year. While all of our plants are operational, we have not been able to achieve previous capacity levels. So demand continues to exceed supply. We are evaluating our inventory plans and working hard to increase capacity. However, as a result of the supply disruption, the impact on the top line will continue through the first half of 2010, and the estimated impact is included in our 2010 guidance. On a more positive note, Morningstar Farms Veggie Food net sales grew over 3% for the year, gaining over one share point. Kashi frozen meals grew over 10% for the year, capturing almost 25% of the natural organic meal category. Our Food Away From Home business posted lower sales for the year and the quarter reflecting the weak economic environment and the impact that this has had on the food service industry. We don't expect to see significant improvement in this business until the middle of 2010.Please turn to Slide 19. We will discuss the international business. Outside North America, our international business continues to perform well, delivering 3% internal sales growth for the year. In Europe, the operating environment remains difficult. As anticipated, the first half of 2009 was flat due to custom issues, but regained momentum in the back half of the year. Europe delivered 2% internal net sales growth for the year and 2% for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, Europe achieved share gains in the U.K., France, and Italy supported by an increase in brand impressions. Crunchy Nut and Rice Krispies in the U.K., and Extra and Drizzle throughout the continent, contributed to this growth. In Russia, we continued to transition away from bulk to higher margin packaged biscuits and cereal. And we also achieved significant package share gains in those categories. However, the large reduction in the bulk business adversely impacted the overall volume picture in Europe and for the entire company. In 2010, Europe is expected to deliver low single-digit sales growth despite a continuing tough economic environment.Turning to Latin America. We delivered strong results with 7% internal net sales growth for the year, despite flat internal net sales in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we reduced trade inventories in Mexico and the Caribbean and experienced supply constraints in Venezuela. In Mexico, we gained share growth in the quarter and the full year aided by the success of newly launched All-Bran Yogufibra and a new long-target media campaign, the Zucaritas. Looking to 2010, Latin America is projected to deliver mid-single digits growth in internal sales. We entered the year with healthy trade inventory levels, good consumption momentum and strong commercial plants.For the full year, our Asia-Pacific business delivered 5% internal net sales growth, building upon last year's growth of 8%. Our businesses in South Korea, Australia, and India all had strong cereal performance. In China, we continue to move away from lower margin volume, which impacted the fourth quarter and will continue to impact the first half of 2010. For Asia-Pacific, we expect to see top line growth in the mid-single digit range in 2010. And now, I'd like to turn it over to David for closing remarks."

We're optimizing our global organization and striving for enhanced effectiveness in many areas of our business. We're off to a great start with the completion of the first year of our three-year billion dollar plus challenge.

As far as talking about a particular retailer, I think a number of retailers have looked to clean up their stores a little bit. I think the impact of that is typically more felt back in the DSD type area, where you have the ability and have normally been able to build incremental displays. So where customers are cutting back on that, probably in our DSD area, we're feeling a little bit more than anywhere else. And most of that, we'll feel a little bit of impact of that probably through the first half and then most of the activity started mid-2009. So not material, but probably a little bit of an impact. But in general terms, I think when you look at the overall retailing environment, very challenging given what's going on with some of the big segments and somewhat deflation rate."

I think on the call when we did this call a year ago, we said we hadn't seen that. Our inventory levels were relatively stable and where we expect them to be. This year, however, in the Cereal business, for a variety of reasons, we did notice that in Q4, our shipments were 6%, our consumption was probably around 4-ish and as we look at our inventory, slightly higher then we believe our customers would like them to be. So on a shipment base, we'll see a couple of percent. What we saw in fourth quarter come out in first quarter. It's nothing more than that, making sure we manage our inventory levels to an appropriate level on behalf of our retail partners. And then the other impacts that you'll see probably in the first, second quarter for us is, we mentioned the Eggo disruption, which will impact through the first half. And Food Service, probably because it started to hit us in the back half of '09, given we're pretty much non-commercial food service versus the restaurant-type trade. That'll have an impact through the first half too, but that's all balanced into the full year guidance of 2% to 3%."

We're pleased to report another strong year of sustainable dependable performance to the Kellogg company. Our business model and focus strategy are helping us weather the tough consumer and customer environment and positioning us for growth now and well into the future despite the current economic backdrop. Our focus has been and will continue to be to sustainably grow the top line, drive investment in our brands, build an effective and cost-efficient infrastructure and consistently deliver solid results for the long-term.As I said last quarter and I think it bears repeating, 2009 has certainly presented us with challenges, and yet at the same time, given us opportunities to build an even stronger Kellogg Company. The weaker global economic environment has lessened the inflationary pressure on pricing and increased the stress level on consumers, which is translated into moderating top-line growth. However, consumers are seeking ways to maximize value and trading into some of that core categories such as cereal in markets like the U.S. and the U.K. Consumers recognize that our brands represent value, great taste and good nutrition. So that positions us well for the future.Another benefit of the weaker economy is media deflation in key markets. As a result, our increased investment in advertising has significantly grown our underlying impressions. On an internal basis, our advertising grew 15% in the back half of the year and nearly 7% for the full year.As discussed at our Investor Day and on previous earnings calls, we've being focusing on improving productivity and reducing costs. We've completed the first year of our three-year billion dollar plus cost-reduction program. In 2009, we exceeded our expectations in cost savings now adding a plus to the billion dollar challenge. The result, strong earnings per share growth and record cash flow for 2009.Benefiting from the 2009 momentum, we entered 2010 with a solid pipeline of innovation and renovation, as well as a renewed commitment to productivity and cost savings. We continue to focus on building a Kellogg Company resilient to economic conditions and poised to forge ahead. With excellent financial visibility into our future financial performance, we remain confident in our ability to deliver another year of sustainable and dependable growth. And with that, I'd now like to introduce our newly appointed CFO, Ron Dissinger, for the review of our financials. Ron, over to you."

Let me begin with a summary of our 2009 financial results on Slide 4. As David said, despite the challenges of a weak economy and a competitive landscape, we had a good year. We met or exceeded our 2009 guidance on g",1663,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our 2009 financial results on Slide 4. As David said, despite the challenges of a weak economy and a competitive landscape, we had a good year. We met or exceeded our 2009 guidance on growth rates of 3% to 4% internal net sales, 8% to 10% internal operating profit and 10% to 12% currency-neutral earnings per share. In 2009, our internal net sales grew 3%, with strong operating profit growth at the top end of our range. As you are aware, our internal numbers exclude the effect of foreign exchange acquisitions and a 53rd week in 2008.Our net sales growth reflects a particularly strong year in Retail Cereal and a solid year in Retail Snacks, which helped to offset the pressures we experienced in our Food Service business due to industry trends and the supply disruption in our Eggo Waffle business. We continue to invest in our brands. And we increased our up-front cost investments to $0.26 per share for the full year compared with $0.14 per share in 2008. Our solid sales performance, combined with our cost savings and productivity initiatives, as well as moderating commodity inflation drove 10% internal operating profit growth for the year.This resulted in our full year 2009 earnings per share of $3.16, a 6% increase on a reported basis and a 13% increase on a currency neutral basis. As we've said on our third quarter call, we expected below-the-line items to negatively impact our full year and fourth quarter results. The primary drivers include, full year interest expense of $295 million, which includes the cost of the bond tender offer completed in December 2009. This enabled us to refinance a portion of our 2011 bond maturity at an attractive interest rate. Impacting the other income and expense line was a charitable contribution in the fourth quarter. In addition, we took an approximate $0.02 hit to our earnings per share in the fourth quarter from the impact of Venezuela.The situation in Venezuela is changing rapidly. However, profits from this business are only 1% to 2% of total company results. And we think we are appropriately positioned. Partially offsetting these expenses, we benefited from some discrete favorable tax items in 2009 lowering our tax rate to 28.2%.On Slide 5, we'll walk through the components of our internal sales growth for the fourth quarter and full year. Year-over-year reported net sales for the full year 2009 declined by 1.9%. On an internal basis, net sales grew 3%. The following components contributed to our sales performance. Our tonnage declined by 7/10 of a point during the year. Much of this decline came from our continued transition away from low margin products in Russia and China and the Eggo supply disruption. This decline masks a strong volume performance in Cereal. Price and mix contributed 3.7 points of growth to the business. Currency reduced our reported growth by 3.7 points. And acquisitions increased our reported growth by a modest 3/10 of a point. Also note that the 53rd week in the fourth quarter of 2008 impacted our reported sales growth unfavorably by 1.5% for the full year.Each of our operating segments contributed to net sales growth for the year. Internal net sales for North America increased 2.8%. Europe rose 1.6%, and Latin America grew 6.8%, while Asia-Pacific improved by 5%. Our fourth quarter internal net sales grew approximately 2%. Now let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss cost pressures. As expected, commodity prices moderated during the year reducing our cost pressures and cost of goods sold to approximately 3%. This compares to much higher inflation rates of the past several years. Our billion dollar plus challenge cost reduction initiatives, combined with price execution early in the year more than offset these cost pressures in 2009 and improved our gross margin during the year.For 2010, we expect cost pressures to remain at approximately 3%.For 2009, our gross profit was $5.4 billion. On an internal basis, our gross profit grew 6% for the year. Gross margin increased 100 basis points to 42.9% due to price increases as well as savings initiatives and cost of goods sold and these more than offset inflation and higher up-front costs. Internal gross margin was up 120 basis points. And if we exclude the impact of up-front costs, gross margin was up 160 basis points for the year. For 2010, we expect gross margin improvement of approximately 100 basis points.As you can see on Slide 8, we have continued our commitment to reinvesting in our brands through advertising. It remains a key component of our business model, and we believe essential to achieving our long-term goals. As we have said, we experienced media deflation in the year. Lower prices, combined with increased media efficiencies and increased investment resulted in a significant increase in impressions. In 2010, we expect our advertising to grow at a higher rate than sales, even with expected media deflation in key markets.Slide 9 highlights our internal operating profit growth by area. Despite heavy investment in the advertising and up-front costs, our North American business still delivered 11% internal operating profit growth. And in the fourth quarter, North America internal operating profit increased by a healthy 25%. While Europe delivered moderate sales growth for the year, both operating efficiencies and media deflation contribute to a strong 7% internal operating profit increase for the year. In the fourth quarter, Europe delivered 13% internal operating profit growth.Latin America showed strong internal sales growth for the year. However, internal operating profit declined by 2%. Significantly higher input costs and increased advertising contributed to the full year decline. In addition, a December reduction in trade inventory impacted both full year and fourth quarter sales and profits. This trade inventory reduction increased advertising investment and higher upfront costs contributed to a 52% decline in internal operating profit for the fourth quarter. And in Asia-Pacific, internal operating profit increased by 14% for the full year, driven by sales performance. However, increased advertising contributed to a 21% decline in fourth quarter internal operating profit.Now let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss cash flow. Managing for cash continues to be a key operating principle for Kellogg. We are focused on growing net earnings and remain disciplined about core working capital and our balance sheet. We delivered record cash flow of $1.27 billion in 2009. Our strong cash flow generation has given us flexibility to support our business and continue to return cash to shareholders. Capital spending declined to 3% of net sales in 2009, versus 3.6% in 2008. As we said on our third quarter call for 2010, we expect capital spending to be approximately $500 million at the high end of our 3% to 4% range, driven by capacity increases on our Eggo Waffle network and cost to reimplement SAP across our Americas' business is.Also in the fourth quarter, we reduced our commercial paper significantly, and took our net debt to one of the lowest levels since the Keebler acquisition providing us with a strong liquidity position. Given the potential for continued volatility in the economy, we believe this positions us very well for the future. For 2010, we expect our cash flow to be comparable to 2009, given the increase in capital spending. In sum, we were pleased with our 2009 performance, posting solid sales growth and effectively managing our cost structure, while at the same time increasing our investment in advertising and up-front costs. We posted a double-digit increase in internal operating profit, invested in our future growth and improved our financial visibility. It was a very good year for Kellogg, delivering high quality earnings in a very difficult economic environment. Another year of sustainable and dependable performance.Now let's turn to Slide 12 for our expectations for 2010. We remain confident in our ability to deliver another year of sustainable and dependable growth. And we are raising our 2010 currency-neutral EPS forecast. We expect to continue to drive volume and mix to grow internal net sales to 2% to 3%. Our focus on productivity and expected moderate inflationary environment and a lower up-front cost should result in approximately 100 basis points of gross margin expansion. 2010 upfront investments are projected to be approximately $0.16 per share. About half of these costs are allocated to the K-LEAN manufacturing initiative.Lower up-front costs should help accelerate our internal operating profit growth to 8% to 10%, which is above our long-term targets. Below the line, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $250 million to $260 million. Our effective tax rate is projected to be between 30% to 31%.Shares outstanding are expected to decline as we execute the remaining $463 million of the 2009 share repurchase authorization, plus the $650 million we authorized for 2010. We expect to lower shares outstanding by 2% to 3% for 2010. Our guidance for earnings per share has increased and is now 11% to 13% growth on a currency-neutral basis. To understand the impact of foreign exchange on our 2009 results and in 2010, please turn to Slide 13.  As we discussed on previous calls, moving from currency neutral to reported earnings per share guidance requires us to estimate the impact of foreign exchange on our earnings per share performance. The full year 2009 adverse impact of translational foreign exchange was $0.22 on EPS, up from our November estimate of $0.21.Slide 13 shows our key current currencies with 2009 actual rates and current spot rates as of February 1, 2010. Based on these spot rates, foreign exchange is estimated to be flat compared with our earlier estimate of a favorable $0.08. Approximately 1/2 of the change is related to the devaluation of the currency in Venezuela. As you are well aware, foreign exchange is a moving target. So we're prepared to update you on the impact on a quarterly basis. And now, I'd like to turn it over to John to discuss our business operations."

We delivered strong results in 2009 and are well-positioned to deliver another year of sustainable, dependable performance in 2010. As you can see on Slide 14, our 2009 North America internal sales grew 3% versus 6",1169,"Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in 2009 and are well-positioned to deliver another year of sustainable, dependable performance in 2010. As you can see on Slide 14, our 2009 North America internal sales grew 3% versus 6% last year. It was a particularly strong year for both Retail Cereal and Snacks. However, weakness in Frozen and Food Service, which I will address in a moment, dampened net sales for the year and particularly in the fourth quarter. As we look forward to 2010, we expect that North American sales growth will be in the low single-digits range. Let me discuss each business in greater detail, beginning with Cereal on Slide 15. Ready-to-Eat Cereal continues to be a strong category, responding well to brand building, nutrition and innovation. Cereal is also a great value. And we are seeing growth in all of our core markets around the world. By our estimate, the Ready-to-Eat Cereal category in the U.S. grew around 2% to 3% for the quarter, and approximately 3% for the full year. Our category share increased approximately 20 to 40 basis points for the quarter, and 10 to 20 basis points for the year. We continue to drive growth and support for our top eight brands, plus Kashi, which on a combined basis grew more than 7% in the quarter and even more for the full year.Our North American Ready-to-Eat Cereal business delivered a healthy 4% internal net sales growth for the full year, and was up 6% for the quarter driven by a double-digit increase in advertising. In addition to the growth in our large brands, there are two other factors, which impacted our North America Cereal shipments in the fourth quarter. Firstly, as we have mentioned before, we continue to manage the tail of our portfolio, axing On-The-Go and Straws because performance was not meeting expectations.Secondly, we did build our trade inventories at the end of the quarter in preparation to January events. We believe about 2% of our fourth quarter North America cereal shipments was due to trade inventory. Our innovation and renovation pipeline is solid. Froot Loops and Apple Jacks with fiber hit store shelves in August. Frosted Mini-Wheats, Little Bites Original flavor, Special K Granola and Cinnabon cereal will be introduced in the first quarter. Kashi is also introducing GOLEAN Crisp! and two new BearNaked granolas. Kellogg Canada also continued to perform well in the Cereal category with share growth for both the quarter and the year. Kashi's performance was particularly strong in Canada.Turning to our North America Snack business. We posted a full year internal net sales increased of 3% and 5% in the fourth quarter. On Slide 17, you can see that we achieved broad-based growth across our North America Snack business. Our Pop-Tarts brand is performing well, delivering mid-single digit internal net sales growth for the year.Crackers grew mid-single digits for the year driven by another strong year from Cheez-It. In the first quarter, we are launching two new SKUs of Wheatables Nut Crisps and two new SKUs of Cheez-Its. Cookies posted a slight gain for the year driven by the Fudge Shoppe and Mothers brand. And we saw some softness in the fourth quarter due to heavy promotional activity and ranging.Within snacks, our best performing category was wholesome snacks, which grew double-digit for the year and achieved strong share gains. The introduction of FiberPlus, Special K Chocolatey Pretzel and Cinnabon Bars helped drive wholesome snack growth for the year.Turning to the Frozen and Specialty Channels business. We experienced a tough 2009. The negative trends in the food service industry and the Eggo supply disruption contributed to a 13% decline in the quarter to finish the year down 1%. A combination of a flood and extensive enhancements and repairs at our Eggo facilities significantly impacted production in the second half of the year. While all of our plants are operational, we have not been able to achieve previous capacity levels. So demand continues to exceed supply. We are evaluating our inventory plans and working hard to increase capacity. However, as a result of the supply disruption, the impact on the top line will continue through the first half of 2010, and the estimated impact is included in our 2010 guidance. On a more positive note, Morningstar Farms Veggie Food net sales grew over 3% for the year, gaining over one share point. Kashi frozen meals grew over 10% for the year, capturing almost 25% of the natural organic meal category. Our Food Away From Home business posted lower sales for the year and the quarter reflecting the weak economic environment and the impact that this has had on the food service industry. We don't expect to see significant improvement in this business until the middle of 2010.Please turn to Slide 19. We will discuss the international business. Outside North America, our international business continues to perform well, delivering 3% internal sales growth for the year. In Europe, the operating environment remains difficult. As anticipated, the first half of 2009 was flat due to custom issues, but regained momentum in the back half of the year. Europe delivered 2% internal net sales growth for the year and 2% for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, Europe achieved share gains in the U.K., France, and Italy supported by an increase in brand impressions. Crunchy Nut and Rice Krispies in the U.K., and Extra and Drizzle throughout the continent, contributed to this growth. In Russia, we continued to transition away from bulk to higher margin packaged biscuits and cereal. And we also achieved significant package share gains in those categories. However, the large reduction in the bulk business adversely impacted the overall volume picture in Europe and for the entire company. In 2010, Europe is expected to deliver low single-digit sales growth despite a continuing tough economic environment.Turning to Latin America. We delivered strong results with 7% internal net sales growth for the year, despite flat internal net sales in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we reduced trade inventories in Mexico and the Caribbean and experienced supply constraints in Venezuela. In Mexico, we gained share growth in the quarter and the full year aided by the success of newly launched All-Bran Yogufibra and a new long-target media campaign, the Zucaritas. Looking to 2010, Latin America is projected to deliver mid-single digits growth in internal sales. We entered the year with healthy trade inventory levels, good consumption momentum and strong commercial plants.For the full year, our Asia-Pacific business delivered 5% internal net sales growth, building upon last year's growth of 8%. Our businesses in South Korea, Australia, and India all had strong cereal performance. In China, we continue to move away from lower margin volume, which impacted the fourth quarter and will continue to impact the first half of 2010. For Asia-Pacific, we expect to see top line growth in the mid-single digit range in 2010. And now, I'd like to turn it over to David for closing remarks."

While current conditions are unusual, we'll continue to drive the business to overcome these challenges. Our financial performance for 2010 will be strong, given our cost savings and productivity momentum and the investments we are making. The top line is expected to be in line with our long-term guidance and we have a clear focus to leverage the current tough environment to take advantage to build Kellogg into an even stronger company for the future.We're planning to grow our top line through exciting innovation and renovation and continued investment in advertising. We're optimizing our global organization and striving for enhanced effectiveness in many areas of our business. We're off to a great start with the completion of the first year of our three-year billion dollar plus challenge. We've significantly increased our investment in upfront costs, which will help grow our efficiency gains, help offset commodity and energy inflation in future periods and provide the fuel to sustain our momentum.

And I think that's putting a lot of pressure on them as costs rise, and yet in many areas they're absolute sales are actually dropping a little bit. And I think that's an area where most retailers are now looking to see how can they drive greater efficiency and effectiveness through this supply chains and through this system. We have been working with many of them, cutting our own SKUs, looking to work with them to see where we can drive further efficiency. As far as talking about a particular retailer, I think a number of retailers have looked to clean up their stores a little bit. I think the impact of that is typically more felt back in the DSD type area, where you have the ability and have normally been able to build incremental displays. So where customers are cutting back on that, probably in our DSD area, we're feeling a little bit more than anywhere else. And most of that, we'll feel a little bit of impact of that probably through the first half and then most of the activity started mid-2009. So not material, but probably a little bit of an impact. But in general terms, I think when you look at the overall retailing environment, very challenging given what's going on with some of the big segments and somewhat deflation rate."

So on a shipment base, we'll see a couple of percent. What we saw in fourth quarter come out in first quarter. It's nothing more than that, making sure we manage our inventory levels to an appropriate level on behalf of our retail partners. And then the other impacts that you'll see probably in the first, second quarter for us is, we mentioned the Eggo disruption, which will impact through the first half.

We did get significant productivity benefits in 2009 plus a lot of cost saving benefits. While you're looking at the number for the year around 7%, I mean, our impressions were significantly higher. We see that as a very positive thing. The Cereal category remains strong. We gained share in Q4 and for the year just a little. We did see Quaker to a lesser extent Post come back quite heavily. But you've got to remember that this is always been a competitive category, nothing unusual. And Quaker had been out of the market for, I think, the back half of 2008 because of the floods, so for them, that was just the return to be in the market. And Post have some disruptions through the first half, so that would probably just getting back into a little too, so nothing that unusual.

In both China and Russia, we're trying to move our business to a higher margin, more Premium Package Foods business from low margin or both business in some of those markets. What that is doing is actually means that we're moving away from some pretty big chunks of volume. And then of course the Frozen issued Eggo disruption impacted our volume.

I'm pleased to report a good start to 2010. Solid top line growth and robust operating profit led to healthy 27% earnings per share growth on a currency neutral basis.

Solid top line growth and robust operating profit led to healthy 27% earnings per share growth on a currency neutral basis. These results were delivered against the backdrop of challenging macroeconomics. Consumers are still feeling uncertain and are looking to be more frugal, buying more on promotion and shifting channels to get the best deal. However, none of these short-term challenges alter our current agenda or our long-term strategy. We are confident that by adhering to our focused strategy and business approach, we will continue to deliver sustainable, dependable results. Our business faced various pressures this quarter and delivered solid top line growth. We remain excited about our brands and our categories as we continue to focus on building our business through innovation and renovation.
As we enter the second year of our three-year $1 billion-plus cost savings program, we continue to look for opportunities to reduce costs and increase efficiencies. As we've said before, the goal of these programs is not a one-time benefit, but a sustainable drive for visibility, well into the future. The positive ongoing impact to our gross margin performance is evident. Moderating cost inflation, combined with cost savings initiatives, contributed to the improvement in our gross profit margin of 190 basis points in the quarter. Gross profit improvement, combined with the timing of advertising expenses, contributed to our strong internal operating profit growth. 
Our advertising spending was down in the first quarter due to the absence of Eggo spending and is not reflective of our commitment to reinvest in the business and the importance of brand building. As we discussed at CAGNY, we expect to increase our advertising investments in the mid-single-digit range for the full year. We delivered earnings per share growth well ahead of expectations, supported by increased operating profit and discrete tax benefits. Our focus has been, and will continue to be, to sustainably grow the top line, drive investment in our brands, build an effective and cost-efficient infrastructure and consistently deliver solid results for the long term. And with that, I'd now like to turn it over to our CFO, Ron Dissinger for a review of our financials. Ron?"

Let me begin with the summary of our first quarter results on Slide 4. As we mentioned on the fourth quarter call and at CAGNY, we expected to have some difficult top line comparisons in the first half, but still",1478,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with the summary of our first quarter results on Slide 4. As we mentioned on the fourth quarter call and at CAGNY, we expected to have some difficult top line comparisons in the first half, but still grow earnings per share. 
We delivered solid sales growth this quarter and our earnings exceeded expectations. For the quarter, reported net sales grew 5% and internal net sales grew 2%, in line with our full year 2010 guidance of 2% to 3% internal net sales growth and our long-term guidance of low single-digit net sales growth. The first quarter top line reflected the continuing impact of the Eggo supply disruption. In addition, supply disruptions in Brazil and Venezuela impacted our results. Also, remember that we were lapping the impact of the peanut butter-related recalls in the first quarter of last year. The impact of these items on net sales year-over-year was relatively offsetting. 
As David mentioned, our advertising spend decreased during the quarter as a result of the absence of Eggo advertising and the timing of investments from Q1 to the balance of the year. Our solid sales performance, combined with our continuing cost savings and productivity initiatives, as well as moderating cost inflation drove internal operating profit growth of 17% for the quarter. Also in the first quarter, we recorded discrete favorable tax benefits, which reduced our tax rate to 27% and contributed approximately $0.05 to our earnings per share. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we now expect to have a full year tax rate of 29% to 30%. Our strong operating profit performance and these discrete tax benefits resulted in a 30% increase in our reported earnings per share and a 27% increase in earnings per share on a currency neutral basis.
On Slide 5, we'll walk through the components of our net sales growth. On a reported basis, our first quarter net sales grew by 4.7% year-over-year. On an internal basis, net sales increased 1.8%. The following components contributed to the overall growth rate. Our total company tonnage increased by half a point, primarily driven by strong cereal volume growth, up approximately two points. This was partially offset by the impact of the transition from bulk to packaged formats in Russia and by the shift away from low margin business in China. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, we expected the impact of these items to continue through the first half of 2010. The impact on volume from Eggo, as well as our supply disruptions in Brazil and Venezuela were broadly offset by the benefit of lapping the peanut butter-related recalls of first quarter 2009.
Price and mix contributed 1.3 points of growth, and currency contributed 2.9 points of growth. Acquisitions had no impact on the quarter. All of our operating segments contributed to net sales growth for the quarter. North America and Europe each contributed 2% to net sales growth on an internal basis. Latin America and Asia Pacific each increased internal net sales by 1%.
Now let me turn to Slide 6 to discuss gross profit. On an internal basis, gross profit rose 7% in the first quarter. Gross margin increased 190 basis points to 43%. There were several drivers of our gross margin improvement. First, we had some benefit from price increases. Second, our cost reduction initiatives were greater than the underlying rate of inflation. And third, we were lapping the impact of the peanut butter-related recall. It is important to note for the year, we're approximately 80% hedged on commodities, but our outlook does include commodity inflation in future quarters as we begin to lap lower costs in 2009. For 2010, we expect cost pressures to be in the range of 3% to 4%. Gross margin is expected to expand by approximately 100 basis points due to cost savings initiatives.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss advertising. Our commitment to strengthen our brand equities through advertising remains a key facet of our business model. However, during the quarter, internal advertising declined 3%, driven primarily by timing of North America advertising campaigns, shifting from the first quarter to later in the year, as well as the absence of Eggo advertising.  In the U.S., advertising for our top eight cereal brands was up in the quarter. Europe advertising increased and was lapping easy year-over-year comparisons due to media deflation in 2009. Latin America also increased advertising, particularly in Mexico Cereal business, which was on top of strong growth last year. We now expect full year advertising to be up mid-single digits with heavier investments as we progress into Q2 and Q3.
Slide 8 highlights our internal operating profit growth by area. First quarter internal operating profit rose 17%, driven by positive internal sales growth, moderating cost inflation, continued cost savings initiatives and slightly lower advertising spending. Upfront costs are comparable to last year at approximately $0.03 of earnings per share. North America internal operating profit grew a healthy 22% as a result of solid sales growth, gross margin expansion and timing of advertising investment. This compares favorably to last year's increase of 1.6%, which reflected the 2009 peanut butter-related recalls. Europe's internal operating profit rose 4% due to solid sales growth and improved cost of goods, partially offset by investments in advertising. Latin America's internal operating profit rose less than 1%. The impact of supply disruptions in Brazil and Venezuela masked the strength of Latin America's business, especially in Mexico. And in Asia Pacific, internal operating profit grew 10%, reflecting an improvement in gross margin and timing of advertising spending.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss cash flow. Managing for cash remains a key operating principle for Kellogg. In the first quarter, cash flow was $190 million, up $18 million over the first quarter of 2009. For the full year, we anticipate another year of delivering strong cash flow. As we said in our fourth quarter call, we expect to spend approximately $500 million in capital expenditures for 2010. And we expect our cash flow to be comparable to full year 2009's record cash flow.
Now let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss the impact of foreign exchange on earnings per share. Because our guidance is on a currency neutral basis, we'd like to provide an estimate of foreign currency impact on our 2010 earnings. Slide 10 shows our key currencies with 2009 actual rates and current spot rates as of April 26, 2010. Based on April 26 spot rates, we estimate full year foreign exchange to be unfavorable $0.02 compared with our earlier estimate of flat. So while we have good news from foreign currency in the first quarter, these current spot rates indicate we will have a negative impact over the next three quarters. We also recognize that foreign currency has become very volatile, especially in Europe, although the last several days, the spot rates for the euro and the pound have declined against the U.S. dollar. These changes are not reflected in the April 26 spot rates. We will continue to update you on the impact of foreign exchange on a quarterly basis.
Now let's turn to Slide 11 to discuss our full year outlook. In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance. We delivered solid net sales growth and exceeded our expectations for earnings. However, we experienced favorability in Q1 due to discrete tax benefits and timing of investments. We expect our investments to increase as we progress through the year. As a result, we are affirming our 2010 full year guidance growth rates for internal net sales, internal operating profit and currency neutral earnings per share. We expect internal net sales growth of 2% to 3%, in line with our long-term targets. Internal operating profit is anticipated to grow 8% to 10%, which is above our long-term targets. This then includes an expectation to increase our advertising investment as we progress through the balance of the year, resulting in mid-single-digit advertising growth for the full year. We still expect gross margin to increase approximately 100 basis points and upfront costs to be approximately $0.16.
Consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareowners, our Board of Directors authorized a new three-year share buyback program totaling $2.5 billion across the years 2010 through 2012, replacing all other authorizations. The $148 million of shares purchased in the first quarter 2010 falls under this new authorization. As we review the balance of 2010, we now expect average shares outstanding to be relatively flat compared to the end of 2009. We remain confident in our visibility to achieve currency neutral earnings per share growth of 11% to 13%, which is above our long-term annual targets. And now, I'd like to turn it over to John Bryant to cover our North America and international results."

I'd like to give you some more color on our business performance in the first quarter, starting with North America, which delivered solid internal net sales growth of 2% compared to 4% growth last year. Let me disc",1029,"Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to give you some more color on our business performance in the first quarter, starting with North America, which delivered solid internal net sales growth of 2% compared to 4% growth last year. Let me discuss each business in greater detail, beginning with cereal on Slide 13.
The U.S. and Canadian Cereal categories continued to operate in a competitive environment and lapped tough growth comparisons from a year ago, where category growth was 6% to 7% in the U.S. and 8% in Canada. While the North American category is down slightly in the quarter, we expect improvement through the back half of the year. Our North America cereal sales were up slightly in the first quarter against tough comparisons. 
Taking a close look at the U.S., our core brands continue to do well, growing 4% across all channels. If you look across all channels, our share was slightly down, roughly 20 basis points. Within alternate channels, particularly Club and Dollar, our gains were strong. First quarter innovation include the well-received Special K granola, and we have strong innovation in the second half, including FiberPlus cereal. 
As we said in the fourth quarter call, we built cereal trade inventory at the end of 2009. However, given the timing of both Easter and several April promotions, we continue to hold slightly elevated trade inventory at the end of the first quarter. We anticipate that this inventory will be reduced across the second and third quarters. Our Canadian Cereal business delivered a good quarter, with half a point share gain and good sales growth against tough comparisons a year ago. 
Let's turn to Slide 14 to discuss the North American snack performance. We posted first quarter internal net sales growth of 5% compared to 2% a year earlier. The strong results reflected broad-based growth across Pop-Tarts, crackers, cookies and wholesome snacks. Our Pop-Tarts business posted another strong quarter with mid-single-digit internal net sales growth and over a three-point increase in market share. 
Our store-door cracker sales were up a robust 4% against strong first quarter 2009 comparisons of 11%. Our sales growth was driven by our three big brands and introduction of Italian Four Cheese Cheez-Its and Wheatables Nut Crisps in the quarter. Cookie sales are also up for the quarter, and we gained 60 basis points of share. The Fudge Shoppe Cheesecake Middles introduction, Mother's brand and strong growth in Kashi cookies contributed to the performance in the quarter. Sustained momentum in our Wholesome Snacks business resulted in a greater than three-point increase in share and widened our share leadership in this growing category. We are very pleased with the successful introduction of Special K Fruit Crisps at the end of 2009 and strong performance of FiberPlus bars.
Turning to our Frozen and Specialty Channels business, Frozen and Specialty Channels first quarter sales declined 3% compared to last year's increase of 6%. Over the past several months, we have made significant progress in increasing Eggo production levels, and we have nearly reached previous capacity levels. We continue to build our inventory and our customers' inventory. The impact on the top line will continue through the first half of 2010 and is included in our 2010 guidance. Morningstar Farms' veggie foods continue to perform well, growing internal net sales 5% in the quarter and Kashi frozen meals also delivered healthy growth. The pressure on our Food Away From Home business is moderating. The business posted flat sales this quarter, reflecting improving trends in the food service industry.
Please turn to Slide 17 for a discussion of the International business. Outside North America, our International business continued to perform well, delivering 2% internal net sales growth for the quarter. European internal net sales grew 2% during the first quarter, driven by cereal share gains in the U.K., France and Italy and an inventory build at the end of the quarter in preparation for April promotions in the U.K. The healthy mid-single-digit growth in cereal sales and volume was driven by strong innovation. The introduction of Krave in the U.K., as well as solid performance in Tresor and Extra on the continent. We were pleased with our European performance, given that in the first quarter of 2009, the Cereal category in the U.K., our largest European market was up 6%. However, the continued migration from bulk to packaged snacks in Russia destroyed Europe's overall volume performance. We expect this impact to continue throughout the first half of 2010. 
Latin America internal net sales rose 1% during Q1 on top of 8% growth last year. A highlight of the quarter was the high single-digit sales growth in Mexico, driven by cereal. Mexico's strength was offset by a sales decline in Brazil due to the excessive rains, which resulted in water damage and temporary closure of our Brazilian manufacturing facility. While the plant is now up and running, it will take some time to return to full capacity. Lower inventory levels will continue to impact results through the second quarter. In addition, Venezuela's performance was impacted by intermittent supply disruptions, driven by various government policies. We continue to expect internal net sales growth for the Latin American region to be in the mid-single-digit range for the full year.
In Asia Pacific, first quarter internal net sales grew 1% on top of strong growth in the first quarter of last year of 11% and was driven by strong cereal sales in the region. However, as mentioned on the fourth quarter call, we continue to transition our Chinese business from a lower margin business to a branded model. This will result in volume loss through the first half of the year. Australia was also down modestly as it lapped high single-digit comps from a year ago, and we had no promotional activity with one of our largest retailers during the quarter. Although Australia is facing challenges similar to other developed markets, we anticipate seeing stronger sales growth for the remainder of the year. In Asia Pacific, we still expect to deliver mid-single-digit internal net sales growth for the region in 2010. Now let me turn it back over to David."

The top line is expected to be in line with our 201",298,"Thanks, John. In summary, we're pleased with our first quarter performance. We expect that the pressure on our top line this quarter will continue during Q2 and then improve in the back half of the year. The top line is expected to be in line with our 2010 and long-term guidance of 2% to 3%. We're focused on leveraging the current environment to our advantage, to build Kellogg into an even stronger company for the future. We will continue to renovate our current products and draw out new innovation to address consumer's growing and evolving needs while differentiating and enhancing our portfolio. We're optimizing our global organization and striving for enhanced effectiveness in many areas of our business. And as we have said, we'll continue to invest in brand building and in other areas of the business to make Kellogg stronger. 
Our 2010 financial performance will be driven by moderate top line growth, coupled with our cost savings, productivity momentum and continued investments. We've almost reached the halfway point of our three-year $1 billion-plus cost challenge. We're on track, and these savings will help us drive efficiency gains, offset future commodity and energy inflation and provide the fuel to sustain our momentum.
All of these elements, combined with excellent financial visibility, support our increased confidence that we're on track to deliver on our 2010 guidance. While we feel good about the future, we're also pragmatic about the current consumer, customer and comparative dynamics and the impact on our business during 2010.

We thought inventories would come down in U.S. Cereal and because of the timing of Easter and April promotions, that did not occur. So that'll probably come out in Q2, Q3. We also saw in the U.K. probably about a one-point impact on our performance across Europe because of strong inventory build for promotions in April and the timing of Easter there, as well.

So even if you add back at least a couple of points for that, it would indicate that the first month of the year, the second month of the year and the third month of the year, round out the quarter, the category was showing a degree of softness relative to year ago. And I think our view on that is primarily that relates to, as we said, the comps versus a year ago in the category grew 6% to 7%, which to be quite frank, I think was a demonstration of the shift we've seen in consumer patterns:  More people eating at home, more people actually buying cereal because it was great value. The category got a significant bump this year, not that, that is necessarily turned around. That comp makes it difficult. You've got retailers driving traffic to their stores, consumers being a lot more sensitive to value, buying on deal, channel shifting. All of those things in combination meant that the category is down slightly. But as we said, we think that may be the case in the second quarter.

Solid top line growth and robust operating profit led to healthy 27% earnings per share growth on a currency neutral basis. These results were delivered against the backdrop of challenging macroeconomics. Consumers are still feeling uncertain and are looking to be more frugal, buying more on promotion and shifting channels to get the best deal. However, none of these short-term challenges alter our current agenda or our long-term strategy. We are confident that by adhering to our focused strategy and business approach, we will continue to deliver sustainable, dependable results. Our business faced various pressures this quarter and delivered solid top line growth. We remain excited about our brands and our categories as we continue to focus on building our business through innovation and renovation.
As we enter the second year of our three-year $1 billion-plus cost savings program, we continue to look for opportunities to reduce costs and increase efficiencies. As we've said before, the goal of these programs is not a one-time benefit, but a sustainable drive for visibility, well into the future. The positive ongoing impact to our gross margin performance is evident. Moderating cost inflation, combined with cost savings initiatives, contributed to the improvement in our gross profit margin of 190 basis points in the quarter. Gross profit improvement, combined with the timing of advertising expenses, contributed to our strong internal operating profit growth. 
Our advertising spending was down in the first quarter due to the absence of Eggo spending and is not reflective of our commitment to reinvest in the business and the importance of brand building. As we discussed at CAGNY, we expect to increase our advertising investments in the mid-single-digit range for the full year. We delivered earnings per share growth well ahead of expectations, supported by increased operating profit and discrete tax benefits. Our focus has been, and will continue to be, to sustainably grow the top line, drive investment in our brands, build an effective and cost-efficient infrastructure and consistently deliver solid results for the long term. And with that, I'd now like to turn it over to our CFO, Ron Dissinger for a review of our financials. Ron?"

Let me begin with the summary of our first quarter results on Slide 4. As we mentioned on the fourth quarter call and at CAGNY, we expected to have some difficult top line comparisons in the first half, but still",1478,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with the summary of our first quarter results on Slide 4. As we mentioned on the fourth quarter call and at CAGNY, we expected to have some difficult top line comparisons in the first half, but still grow earnings per share. 
We delivered solid sales growth this quarter and our earnings exceeded expectations. For the quarter, reported net sales grew 5% and internal net sales grew 2%, in line with our full year 2010 guidance of 2% to 3% internal net sales growth and our long-term guidance of low single-digit net sales growth. The first quarter top line reflected the continuing impact of the Eggo supply disruption. In addition, supply disruptions in Brazil and Venezuela impacted our results. Also, remember that we were lapping the impact of the peanut butter-related recalls in the first quarter of last year. The impact of these items on net sales year-over-year was relatively offsetting. 
As David mentioned, our advertising spend decreased during the quarter as a result of the absence of Eggo advertising and the timing of investments from Q1 to the balance of the year. Our solid sales performance, combined with our continuing cost savings and productivity initiatives, as well as moderating cost inflation drove internal operating profit growth of 17% for the quarter. Also in the first quarter, we recorded discrete favorable tax benefits, which reduced our tax rate to 27% and contributed approximately $0.05 to our earnings per share. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we now expect to have a full year tax rate of 29% to 30%. Our strong operating profit performance and these discrete tax benefits resulted in a 30% increase in our reported earnings per share and a 27% increase in earnings per share on a currency neutral basis.
On Slide 5, we'll walk through the components of our net sales growth. On a reported basis, our first quarter net sales grew by 4.7% year-over-year. On an internal basis, net sales increased 1.8%. The following components contributed to the overall growth rate. Our total company tonnage increased by half a point, primarily driven by strong cereal volume growth, up approximately two points. This was partially offset by the impact of the transition from bulk to packaged formats in Russia and by the shift away from low margin business in China. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, we expected the impact of these items to continue through the first half of 2010. The impact on volume from Eggo, as well as our supply disruptions in Brazil and Venezuela were broadly offset by the benefit of lapping the peanut butter-related recalls of first quarter 2009.
Price and mix contributed 1.3 points of growth, and currency contributed 2.9 points of growth. Acquisitions had no impact on the quarter. All of our operating segments contributed to net sales growth for the quarter. North America and Europe each contributed 2% to net sales growth on an internal basis. Latin America and Asia Pacific each increased internal net sales by 1%.
Now let me turn to Slide 6 to discuss gross profit. On an internal basis, gross profit rose 7% in the first quarter. Gross margin increased 190 basis points to 43%. There were several drivers of our gross margin improvement. First, we had some benefit from price increases. Second, our cost reduction initiatives were greater than the underlying rate of inflation. And third, we were lapping the impact of the peanut butter-related recall. It is important to note for the year, we're approximately 80% hedged on commodities, but our outlook does include commodity inflation in future quarters as we begin to lap lower costs in 2009. For 2010, we expect cost pressures to be in the range of 3% to 4%. Gross margin is expected to expand by approximately 100 basis points due to cost savings initiatives.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss advertising. Our commitment to strengthen our brand equities through advertising remains a key facet of our business model. However, during the quarter, internal advertising declined 3%, driven primarily by timing of North America advertising campaigns, shifting from the first quarter to later in the year, as well as the absence of Eggo advertising.  In the U.S., advertising for our top eight cereal brands was up in the quarter. Europe advertising increased and was lapping easy year-over-year comparisons due to media deflation in 2009. Latin America also increased advertising, particularly in Mexico Cereal business, which was on top of strong growth last year. We now expect full year advertising to be up mid-single digits with heavier investments as we progress into Q2 and Q3.
Slide 8 highlights our internal operating profit growth by area. First quarter internal operating profit rose 17%, driven by positive internal sales growth, moderating cost inflation, continued cost savings initiatives and slightly lower advertising spending. Upfront costs are comparable to last year at approximately $0.03 of earnings per share. North America internal operating profit grew a healthy 22% as a result of solid sales growth, gross margin expansion and timing of advertising investment. This compares favorably to last year's increase of 1.6%, which reflected the 2009 peanut butter-related recalls. Europe's internal operating profit rose 4% due to solid sales growth and improved cost of goods, partially offset by investments in advertising. Latin America's internal operating profit rose less than 1%. The impact of supply disruptions in Brazil and Venezuela masked the strength of Latin America's business, especially in Mexico. And in Asia Pacific, internal operating profit grew 10%, reflecting an improvement in gross margin and timing of advertising spending.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss cash flow. Managing for cash remains a key operating principle for Kellogg. In the first quarter, cash flow was $190 million, up $18 million over the first quarter of 2009. For the full year, we anticipate another year of delivering strong cash flow. As we said in our fourth quarter call, we expect to spend approximately $500 million in capital expenditures for 2010. And we expect our cash flow to be comparable to full year 2009's record cash flow.
Now let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss the impact of foreign exchange on earnings per share. Because our guidance is on a currency neutral basis, we'd like to provide an estimate of foreign currency impact on our 2010 earnings. Slide 10 shows our key currencies with 2009 actual rates and current spot rates as of April 26, 2010. Based on April 26 spot rates, we estimate full year foreign exchange to be unfavorable $0.02 compared with our earlier estimate of flat. So while we have good news from foreign currency in the first quarter, these current spot rates indicate we will have a negative impact over the next three quarters. We also recognize that foreign currency has become very volatile, especially in Europe, although the last several days, the spot rates for the euro and the pound have declined against the U.S. dollar. These changes are not reflected in the April 26 spot rates. We will continue to update you on the impact of foreign exchange on a quarterly basis.
Now let's turn to Slide 11 to discuss our full year outlook. In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance. We delivered solid net sales growth and exceeded our expectations for earnings. However, we experienced favorability in Q1 due to discrete tax benefits and timing of investments. We expect our investments to increase as we progress through the year. As a result, we are affirming our 2010 full year guidance growth rates for internal net sales, internal operating profit and currency neutral earnings per share. We expect internal net sales growth of 2% to 3%, in line with our long-term targets. Internal operating profit is anticipated to grow 8% to 10%, which is above our long-term targets. This then includes an expectation to increase our advertising investment as we progress through the balance of the year, resulting in mid-single-digit advertising growth for the full year. We still expect gross margin to increase approximately 100 basis points and upfront costs to be approximately $0.16.
Consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareowners, our Board of Directors authorized a new three-year share buyback program totaling $2.5 billion across the years 2010 through 2012, replacing all other authorizations. The $148 million of shares purchased in the first quarter 2010 falls under this new authorization. As we review the balance of 2010, we now expect average shares outstanding to be relatively flat compared to the end of 2009. We remain confident in our visibility to achieve currency neutral earnings per share growth of 11% to 13%, which is above our long-term annual targets. And now, I'd like to turn it over to John Bryant to cover our North America and international results."

Let me disc",1029,"Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to give you some more color on our business performance in the first quarter, starting with North America, which delivered solid internal net sales growth of 2% compared to 4% growth last year. Let me discuss each business in greater detail, beginning with cereal on Slide 13.
The U.S. and Canadian Cereal categories continued to operate in a competitive environment and lapped tough growth comparisons from a year ago, where category growth was 6% to 7% in the U.S. and 8% in Canada. While the North American category is down slightly in the quarter, we expect improvement through the back half of the year. Our North America cereal sales were up slightly in the first quarter against tough comparisons. 
Taking a close look at the U.S., our core brands continue to do well, growing 4% across all channels. If you look across all channels, our share was slightly down, roughly 20 basis points. Within alternate channels, particularly Club and Dollar, our gains were strong. First quarter innovation include the well-received Special K granola, and we have strong innovation in the second half, including FiberPlus cereal. 
As we said in the fourth quarter call, we built cereal trade inventory at the end of 2009. However, given the timing of both Easter and several April promotions, we continue to hold slightly elevated trade inventory at the end of the first quarter. We anticipate that this inventory will be reduced across the second and third quarters. Our Canadian Cereal business delivered a good quarter, with half a point share gain and good sales growth against tough comparisons a year ago. 
Let's turn to Slide 14 to discuss the North American snack performance. We posted first quarter internal net sales growth of 5% compared to 2% a year earlier. The strong results reflected broad-based growth across Pop-Tarts, crackers, cookies and wholesome snacks. Our Pop-Tarts business posted another strong quarter with mid-single-digit internal net sales growth and over a three-point increase in market share. 
Our store-door cracker sales were up a robust 4% against strong first quarter 2009 comparisons of 11%. Our sales growth was driven by our three big brands and introduction of Italian Four Cheese Cheez-Its and Wheatables Nut Crisps in the quarter. Cookie sales are also up for the quarter, and we gained 60 basis points of share. The Fudge Shoppe Cheesecake Middles introduction, Mother's brand and strong growth in Kashi cookies contributed to the performance in the quarter. Sustained momentum in our Wholesome Snacks business resulted in a greater than three-point increase in share and widened our share leadership in this growing category. We are very pleased with the successful introduction of Special K Fruit Crisps at the end of 2009 and strong performance of FiberPlus bars.
Turning to our Frozen and Specialty Channels business, Frozen and Specialty Channels first quarter sales declined 3% compared to last year's increase of 6%. Over the past several months, we have made significant progress in increasing Eggo production levels, and we have nearly reached previous capacity levels. We continue to build our inventory and our customers' inventory. The impact on the top line will continue through the first half of 2010 and is included in our 2010 guidance. Morningstar Farms' veggie foods continue to perform well, growing internal net sales 5% in the quarter and Kashi frozen meals also delivered healthy growth. The pressure on our Food Away From Home business is moderating. The business posted flat sales this quarter, reflecting improving trends in the food service industry.
Please turn to Slide 17 for a discussion of the International business. Outside North America, our International business continued to perform well, delivering 2% internal net sales growth for the quarter. European internal net sales grew 2% during the first quarter, driven by cereal share gains in the U.K., France and Italy and an inventory build at the end of the quarter in preparation for April promotions in the U.K. The healthy mid-single-digit growth in cereal sales and volume was driven by strong innovation. The introduction of Krave in the U.K., as well as solid performance in Tresor and Extra on the continent. We were pleased with our European performance, given that in the first quarter of 2009, the Cereal category in the U.K., our largest European market was up 6%. However, the continued migration from bulk to packaged snacks in Russia destroyed Europe's overall volume performance. We expect this impact to continue throughout the first half of 2010. 
Latin America internal net sales rose 1% during Q1 on top of 8% growth last year. A highlight of the quarter was the high single-digit sales growth in Mexico, driven by cereal. Mexico's strength was offset by a sales decline in Brazil due to the excessive rains, which resulted in water damage and temporary closure of our Brazilian manufacturing facility. While the plant is now up and running, it will take some time to return to full capacity. Lower inventory levels will continue to impact results through the second quarter. In addition, Venezuela's performance was impacted by intermittent supply disruptions, driven by various government policies. We continue to expect internal net sales growth for the Latin American region to be in the mid-single-digit range for the full year.
In Asia Pacific, first quarter internal net sales grew 1% on top of strong growth in the first quarter of last year of 11% and was driven by strong cereal sales in the region. However, as mentioned on the fourth quarter call, we continue to transition our Chinese business from a lower margin business to a branded model. This will result in volume loss through the first half of the year. Australia was also down modestly as it lapped high single-digit comps from a year ago, and we had no promotional activity with one of our largest retailers during the quarter. Although Australia is facing challenges similar to other developed markets, we anticipate seeing stronger sales growth for the remainder of the year. In Asia Pacific, we still expect to deliver mid-single-digit internal net sales growth for the region in 2010. Now let me turn it back over to David."

The top line is expected to be in line with our 201",298,"Thanks, John. In summary, we're pleased with our first quarter performance. We expect that the pressure on our top line this quarter will continue during Q2 and then improve in the back half of the year. The top line is expected to be in line with our 2010 and long-term guidance of 2% to 3%. We're focused on leveraging the current environment to our advantage, to build Kellogg into an even stronger company for the future. We will continue to renovate our current products and draw out new innovation to address consumer's growing and evolving needs while differentiating and enhancing our portfolio. We're optimizing our global organization and striving for enhanced effectiveness in many areas of our business. And as we have said, we'll continue to invest in brand building and in other areas of the business to make Kellogg stronger. 
Our 2010 financial performance will be driven by moderate top line growth, coupled with our cost savings, productivity momentum and continued investments. We've almost reached the halfway point of our three-year $1 billion-plus cost challenge. We're on track, and these savings will help us drive efficiency gains, offset future commodity and energy inflation and provide the fuel to sustain our momentum.
All of these elements, combined with excellent financial visibility, support our increased confidence that we're on track to deliver on our 2010 guidance. While we feel good about the future, we're also pragmatic about the current consumer, customer and comparative dynamics and the impact on our business during 2010. And we believe that we're addressing and reflecting this environment in our outlook. Our business model and strategy remain relevant and resilient. We remain committed to managing our business to cash and long-term sustainable and dependable growth. And I'd now like to open it up for questions."

I mean, you think about the sales gross margin areas, a couple of things are likely to happen there. We thought inventories would come down in U.S. Cereal and because of the timing of Easter and April promotions, that did not occur. So that'll probably come out in Q2, Q3. We also saw in the U.K. probably about a one-point impact on our performance across Europe because of strong inventory build for promotions in April and the timing of Easter there, as well. But we're off to a great start for the year. We plan to invest back to build the company, to make ourselves stronger in this environment. And we remain very confident in hitting our numbers."

Consumers buying more on deal as in channel shifting, people looking to get the best value they can.

The category got a significant bump this year, not that, that is necessarily turned around. That comp makes it difficult. You've got retailers driving traffic to their stores, consumers being a lot more sensitive to value, buying on deal, channel shifting.

I'm pleased to report a good start to 2010. Solid top line growth and robust operating profit led to healthy 27% earnings per share growth on a currency neutral basis. These results were delivered against the b",374,"Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report a good start to 2010. Solid top line growth and robust operating profit led to healthy 27% earnings per share growth on a currency neutral basis. These results were delivered against the backdrop of challenging macroeconomics. Consumers are still feeling uncertain and are looking to be more frugal, buying more on promotion and shifting channels to get the best deal. However, none of these short-term challenges alter our current agenda or our long-term strategy. 
We are confident that, by adhering to our focused strategy and business approach, we will continue to deliver sustainable, dependable results. Our business faced various pressures this quarter and delivered solid top line growth. We remain excited about our brands and our categories as we continue to focus on building our business through innovation and renovation.
As we enter the second year of our three-year $1 billion-plus cost savings program, we continue to look for opportunities to reduce costs and increase efficiencies. As we've said before, the goal of these programs is not a one-time benefit, but a sustainable drive for visibility, well into the future. 
The positive ongoing impact to our gross margin performance is evident. Moderating cost inflation, combined with cost savings initiatives, contributed to the improvement in our gross profit margin of 190 basis points in the quarter. Gross profit improvement, combined with the timing of advertising expenses, contributed to our strong internal operating profit growth. 
Our advertising spending was down in the first quarter due to the absence of Eggo spending and is not reflective of our commitment to reinvest in the business and the importance of brand building. As we discussed at CAGNY, we expect to increase our advertising investments in the mid-single digit range for the full year. We delivered earnings per share growth well ahead of expectations, supported by increased operating profit and discrete tax benefits. 
Our focus has been, and will continue to be, to sustainably grow the top line, drive investment in our brands, build an effective and cost-efficient infrastructure and consistently deliver solid results for the long term. And with that, I'd now like to turn it over to our CFO, Ron Dissinger for a review of our financials. Ron?"

Let me begin with the summary of our first quarter results on Slide 4. As we mentioned on the fourth quarter call and at CAGNY, we expected to have some difficult top line comparisons in the first half, but still",1478,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with the summary of our first quarter results on Slide 4. As we mentioned on the fourth quarter call and at CAGNY, we expected to have some difficult top line comparisons in the first half, but still grow earnings per share. 
We delivered solid sales growth this quarter and our earnings exceeded expectations. For the quarter, reported net sales grew 5% and internal net sales grew 2%, in line with our full year 2010 guidance of 2% to 3% internal net sales growth and our long-term guidance of low single-digit net sales growth. 
The first quarter top line reflected the continuing impact of the Eggo supply disruption. In addition, supply disruptions in Brazil and Venezuela impacted our results. Also, remember that we were lapping the impact of the peanut butter-related recalls in the first quarter of last year. The impact of these items on net sales year-over-year was relatively offsetting. 
As David mentioned, our advertising spend decreased during the quarter as a result of the absence of Eggo advertising and the timing of investments from Q1 to the balance of the year. Our solid sales performance, combined with our continuing cost savings and productivity initiatives, as well as moderating cost inflation drove internal operating profit growth of 17% for the quarter. 
Also, in the first quarter, we recorded discrete favorable tax benefits, which reduced our tax rate to 27% and contributed approximately $0.05 to our earnings per share. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we now expect to have a full year tax rate of 29% to 30%. Our strong operating profit performance and these discrete tax benefits resulted in a 30% increase in our reported earnings per share and a 27% increase in earnings per share on a currency neutral basis.
On Slide 5, we'll walk through the components of our net sales growth. On a reported basis, our first quarter net sales grew by 4.7% year-over-year. On an internal basis, net sales increased 1.8%. The following components contributed to the overall growth rate. 
Our total company tonnage increased by half a point, primarily driven by strong cereal volume growth, up approximately two points. This was partially offset by the impact of the transition from bulk to packaged formats in Russia and by the shift away from low margin business in China. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, we expected the impact of these items to continue through the first half of 2010. The impact on volume from Eggo, as well as our supply disruptions in Brazil and Venezuela were broadly offset by the benefit of lapping the peanut butter-related recalls of first quarter 2009.
Price and mix contributed 1.3 points of growth, and currency contributed 2.9 points of growth. Acquisitions had no impact on the quarter. All of our operating segments contributed to net sales growth for the quarter. North America and Europe each contributed 2% to net sales growth on an internal basis. Latin America and Asia Pacific each increased internal net sales by 1%.
Now let me turn to Slide 6 to discuss gross profit. On an internal basis, gross profit rose 7% in the first quarter. Gross margin increased 190 basis points to 43%. There were several drivers of our gross margin improvement. First, we had some benefit from price increases. Second, our cost reduction initiatives were greater than the underlying rate of inflation. And third, we were lapping the impact of the peanut butter-related recall. 
It is important to note, for the year, we're approximately 80% hedged on commodities, but our outlook does include commodity inflation in future quarters as we begin to lap lower costs in 2009. For 2010, we expect cost pressures to be in the range of 3% to 4%. Gross margin is expected to expand by approximately 100 basis points due to cost savings initiatives.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss advertising. Our commitment to strengthen our brand equities through advertising remains a key facet of our business model. However, during the quarter, internal advertising declined 3%, driven primarily by timing of North America advertising campaigns, shifting from the first quarter to later in the year, as well as the absence of Eggo advertising.  
In the U.S., advertising for our top eight cereal brands was up in the quarter. Europe advertising increased and was lapping easy year-over-year comparisons due to media deflation in 2009. Latin America also increased advertising, particularly in Mexico Cereal business, which was on top of strong growth last year. We now expect full year advertising to be up mid-single digits with heavier investments as we progress into Q2 and Q3.
Slide 8 highlights our internal operating profit growth by area. First quarter internal operating profit rose 17%, driven by positive internal sales growth, moderating cost inflation, continued cost savings initiatives and slightly lower advertising spending. Upfront costs are comparable to last year at approximately $0.03 of earnings per share. 
North America internal operating profit grew a healthy 22% as a result of solid sales growth, gross margin expansion and timing of advertising investment. This compares favorably to last year's increase of 1.6%, which reflected the 2009 peanut butter-related recalls. Europe's internal operating profit rose 4% due to solid sales growth and improved cost of goods, partially offset by investments in advertising. 
Latin America's internal operating profit rose less than 1%. The impact of supply disruptions in Brazil and Venezuela masked the strength of Latin America's business, especially in Mexico. And in Asia Pacific, internal operating profit grew 10%, reflecting an improvement in gross margin and the timing of advertising spending.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss cash flow. Managing for cash remains a key operating principle for Kellogg. In the first quarter, cash flow was $190 million, up $18 million over the first quarter of 2009. For the full year, we anticipate another year of delivering strong cash flow. As we said in our fourth quarter call, we expect to spend approximately $500 million in capital expenditures for 2010. And we expect our cash flow to be comparable to full year 2009's record cash flow.
Now let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss the impact of foreign exchange on earnings per share. Because our guidance is on a currency-neutral basis, we'd like to provide an estimate of foreign currency impact on our 2010 earnings. Slide 10 shows our key currencies with 2009 actual rates and current spot rates as of April 26, 2010. Based on April 26 spot rates, we estimate full year foreign exchange to be unfavorable $0.02 compared with our earlier estimate of flat. 
So while we have good news from foreign currency in the first quarter, these current spot rates indicate we will have a negative impact over the next three quarters. We also recognize that foreign currency has become very volatile, especially in Europe. Over the last several days, the spot rates for the euro and the pound have declined against the U.S. dollar. These changes are not reflected in the April 26 spot rates. We will continue to update you on the impact of foreign exchange on a quarterly basis.
Now let's turn to Slide 11 to discuss our full year outlook. In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance. We delivered solid net sales growth and exceeded our expectations for earnings. However, we experienced favorability in Q1 due to discrete tax benefits and timing of investments. We expect our investments to increase as we progress through the year. As a result, we are affirming our 2010 full year guidance growth rates for internal net sales, internal operating profit and currency neutral earnings per share. 
We expect internal net sales growth of 2% to 3%, in line with our long-term targets. Internal operating profit is anticipated to grow 8% to 10%, which is above our long-term targets. This then includes an expectation to increase our advertising investment as we progress through the balance of the year, resulting in mid-single digit advertising growth for the full year. We still expect gross margin to increase approximately 100 basis points and upfront costs to be approximately $0.16.
Consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareowners, our Board of Directors authorized a new three-year share buyback program totaling $2.5 billion across the years 2010 through 2012, replacing all other authorizations. The $148 million of shares purchased in the first quarter 2010 falls under this new authorization. 
As we review the balance of 2010, we now expect average shares outstanding to be relatively flat compared to the end of 2009. We remain confident in our visibility to achieve currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 11% to 13%, which is above our long-term annual targets. And now, I'd like to turn it over to John Bryant to cover our North America and international results."

I'd like to give you some more color on our business performance in the first quarter, starting with North America, which delivered solid internal net sales growth of 2% compared to 4% growth last year. Let me disc",1035,"Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to give you some more color on our business performance in the first quarter, starting with North America, which delivered solid internal net sales growth of 2% compared to 4% growth last year. Let me discuss each business in greater detail, beginning with cereal on Slide 13.
The U.S. and Canadian Cereal categories continued to operate in a competitive environment and lapped tough growth comparisons from a year ago, where category growth was 6% to 7% in the U.S. and 8% in Canada. While the North American category is down slightly in the quarter, we expect improvement through the back half of the year. Our North America cereal sales were up slightly in the first quarter against tough comparisons. 
Taking a close look at the U.S., our core brands continue to do well, growing 4% across all channels. If you look across all channels, our share was slightly down, roughly 20 basis points. Within alternate [alternative] channels, particularly club and dollar, our gains were strong. First quarter innovation include the well-received Special K granola. And we have strong innovation in the second half, including FiberPlus cereal. 
As we said in the fourth quarter call, we built cereal trade inventory at the end of 2009. However, given the timing of both Easter and several April promotions, we continue to hold slightly elevated trade inventory at the end of the first quarter. We anticipate that this inventory will be reduced across the second and third quarters. Our Canadian Cereal business delivered a good quarter, with half a point share gain and good sales growth against tough comparisons a year ago. 
Let's turn to Slide 14 to discuss the North American snack performance. We posted first quarter internal net sales growth of 5% compared to 2% a year earlier. The strong results reflected broad-based growth across Pop-Tarts, crackers, cookies and wholesome snacks. Our Pop-Tarts business posted another strong quarter, with mid-single digit internal net sales growth and over a three-point increase in market share. 
Our store-door cracker sales were up a robust 4% against strong first quarter 2009 comparisons of 11%. Our sales growth was driven by our three big brands and introduction of Italian Four Cheese Cheez-Its and Wheatables Nut Crisps in the quarter. 
Cookie sales were also up for the quarter, and we gained 60 basis points of share. The Fudge Shoppe Cheesecake Middles introduction, Mother's brand and strong growth in Kashi cookies contributed to the performance in the quarter. 
Sustained momentum in our Wholesome Snacks business resulted in a greater than three-point increase in share and widened our share leadership in this growing category. We are very pleased with the successful introduction of Special K Fruit Crisps at the end of 2009 and strong performance of FiberPlus bars.
Turning to our Frozen and Specialty Channels business, Frozen and Specialty Channels first quarter sales declined 3% compared to last year's increase of 6%. Over the past several months, we have made significant progress in increasing Eggo production levels, and we have nearly reached previous capacity levels. We continue to build our inventory and our customers' inventory. The impact on the top line will continue through the first half of 2010 and is included in our 2010 guidance. 
Morningstar Farms Veggie Foods continue to perform well, growing internal net sales 5% in the quarter, and Kashi frozen meals also delivered healthy growth. The pressure on our Food Away From Home business is moderating. The business posted flat sales this quarter, reflecting improving trends in the food service industry.
Please turn to Slide 17 for a discussion of the International business. Outside North America, our International business continue to perform well, delivering 2% internal net sales growth for the quarter. European internal net sales grew 2% during the first quarter, driven by cereal share gains in the U.K., France and Italy and an inventory build at the end of the quarter in preparation for April promotions in the U.K. 
The healthy mid-single digit growth in cereal sales and volume was driven by strong innovation, the introduction of Krave in the U.K., as well as solid performance in Trésor and Extra on the continent. We were pleased with our European performance, given that in the first quarter of 2009, the Cereal category in the U.K., our largest European market, was up 6%. However, the continued migration from bulk to packaged snacks in Russia destroyed Europe's overall volume performance. We expect this impact to continue throughout the first half of 2010. 
Latin America internal net sales rose 1% during Q1, on top of 8% growth last year. A highlight of the quarter was the high single digit sales growth in Mexico, driven by cereal. Mexico's strength was offset by a sales decline in Brazil due to the excessive rains, which resulted in water damage and temporary closure of our Brazilian manufacturing facility. 
While the plant is now up and running, it will take some time to return to full capacity. Lower inventory levels will continue to impact results through the second quarter. In addition, Venezuela's performance was impacted by intermittent supply disruptions, driven by various government policies. We continue to expect internal net sales growth for the Latin American region to be in the mid-single digit range for the full year.
In Asia Pacific, first quarter internal net sales grew 1%, on top of strong growth in the first quarter of last year of 11%, and was driven by strong cereal sales in the region. However, as mentioned on the fourth quarter call, we continue to transition our Chinese business from a lower-margin business to a branded model. This will result in volume loss through the first half of the year. 
Australia was also down modestly as it lapped high single digit comps from a year ago, and we had no promotional activity with one of our largest retailers during the quarter. Although Australia is facing challenges similar to other developed markets, we anticipate seeing stronger sales growth for the remainder of the year. In Asia Pacific, we still expect to deliver mid-single digit internal net sales growth for the region in 2010. Now let me turn it back over to David."

We expect that the pressure on our top line this quarter will continue during Q2 and then improve in the back half of the year. The top line is expected to be in line with our 2010 and long-term guidance of 2% to 3%. We're focused on leveraging the current environment to our advantage, to build Kellogg into an even stronger company for the future. 
We will continue to renovate our current products, and draw out new innovation to address consumer's growing and evolving needs, while differentiating and enhancing our portfolio. We're optimizing our global organization and striving for enhanced effectiveness in many areas of our business. And as we have said, we'll continue to invest in brand building, and in other areas of the business, to make Kellogg stronger. 
Our 2010 financial performance will be driven by moderate top line growth, coupled with our cost savings, productivity momentum and continued investments. We've almost reached the halfway point of our three-year $1 billion-plus cost challenge. We're on track, and these savings will help us drive efficiency gains, offset future commodity and energy inflation and provide the fuel to sustain our momentum.
All of these elements, combined with excellent financial visibility, support our increased confidence that we're on track to deliver on our 2010 guidance. While we feel good about the future, we're also pragmatic about the current consumer, customer and comparative dynamics and the impact on our business during 2010. And we believe that we're addressing and reflecting this environment in our outlook. 
Our business model and strategy remain relevant and resilient. We remain committed to managing our business to cash and long-term sustainable and dependable growth. And I'd now like to open it up for questions."

I mean, you think about the sales gross margin areas, a couple of things are likely to happen there. We thought inventories would come down in U.S. Cereal and because of the timing of Easter and April promotions, that did not occur. So that'll probably come out in Q2, Q3. We also saw in the U.K. probably about a one-point impact on our performance across Europe because of strong inventory build for promotions in April and the timing of Easter there, as well. But we're off to a great start for the year. We plan to invest back to build the company, to make ourselves stronger in this environment. And we remain very confident in hitting our numbers."

Consumers buying more on deal as in channel shifting, people looking to get the best value they can. So our expectation was we feel a little bit of softness in Q2, a bit of second half, but long term, we don't see any issues for the category whatsoever. It will remain vibrant, and we'd expect that the second half to return to more normal growth rates."

In terms of shelf size or shelf space, what we'll say there is we've been operating around 15 SKUs. That's going to go up to probably something like 19 SKUs. It's still well below the 40-plus that we had before the event. So the good news is, is that the core is very strong. And that the brand is very strong.

The category got a significant bump this year, not that, that is necessarily turned around. That comp makes it difficult. You've got retailers driving traffic to their stores, consumers being a lot more sensitive to value, buying on deal, channel shifting.

Our second quarter results were modeled and expected, reflecting weakness in the Cereal category, combined with the impact of our voluntary cereal recall at the end of June and softness in that area of business",559,"Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results were modeled and expected, reflecting weakness in the Cereal category, combined with the impact of our voluntary cereal recall at the end of June and softness in that area of business. 
The weakness in the Cereal category have the greatest bearing on our Q2 results. Throughout the first half of the year, we talked about the challenging Cereal category and deflation. Our results and those of other cereal manufacturers reflected this trend.
Although we anticipated a difficult quarter, the severity of the impact to our business was greater than we expected. Our low cereal sales resulted from difficult year-on-year comparables, the cereal recall and inventory reductions. John will talk about these in greater detail. 
We continue to feel confident in the Cereal category and believe trends will begin to improve in the back half of the year. Let me talk briefly about the voluntary cereal recall, which was due to an item that came from the line up. While we had relatively few complaints at the time of the recall, we knew that removing the production store shelves was the right thing to do for our consumers. The cost was high, the total anticipated EPS impact for the year including lost sales is approximately $0.12.  And we're currently pursuing all legal recourse to recoup the cost. 
Over the past 18 months, we've experienced two events that have adversely affected our business. The payment-related recalls at the end of 2008 and the recent cereal line of recall. We're frustrated by these business disruptions, both supply related, but I can confidently say that they were unrelated to one another and unrelated to our cost savings programs. And when it comes to quality and food safety, over the last few years, we've actually increased our vigilance and ramped up our investment across the company. 
What these issues do have in common is the pressure that they place on our resources, both time and money. While we're working to minimize the impact, they will cause disruption to our business, our employees, our customers and our consumers and to this quarter, to our total company results. The weakness in our Cereal business in Q2, combined with the size of the cereal recall, drove our decision to call down our 2010 guidance.
It has always been our intent to take a realistic, open and pragmatic approach to running our business for the long term. This call down, while disappointing, will ensure that we can continue to do the right things for the long-term health of the business. As we said at the beginning of this year, we expect a stronger back half as we anticipate category trends will gradually improve. Of course, this will not happen overnight. We also expect to have stronger innovation in the second half of the year. 
We just introduced FiberPlus cereal at the end of June, with strong initial results. And our Snacks business has launched a strong line-up as well. And we will continue to invest in our business through increased advertising. John will review the business in more details shortly. Even though we had a tough quarter, we feel good about the underlying health of our business and the remainder of the year. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Ron to discuss our financials."
283356,98349778,70437,"Kellogg Company, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our second quarter and first half results on Slide 4. As we have mentioned, we expected to have some tough comparisons in the first half, as well as some challenging operating condition",1581,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our second quarter and first half results on Slide 4. As we have mentioned, we expected to have some tough comparisons in the first half, as well as some challenging operating conditions across our business. What we did not anticipate was the degree of weakness in the Cereal category and, of course, the voluntary cereal recall in June that directly impacted our results.
For the quarter, net sales declined 5% on a reported basis and 4% on an internal basis. Approximately one point of the sales decline was attributable to the recall. The softness in the Eggo business also contributed roughly one point to the decline in sales. The remainder was primarily due to weakness in our U.S. and U.K. Cereal businesses and the reduction of cereal inventory levels in the U.S.
Operating profit for the quarter also fell as a result of lower net sales, the recall and an increased investment in advertising. Operating profit was down 13% on a reported basis and down 11% on an internal basis.
Earnings per share declined 14% on a reported basis, and 11% on a currency-neutral basis. The recall reduced operating profit by approximately 10% and earnings per share by $0.10, including loss sales in the quarter.
As we look at recent consensus estimates, we recognize that it was difficult to estimate the impact of the recall, given that we provided no guidance until today. The accounting rules required us to book the majority of the impact in the second quarter. We also expect a small impact in the third quarter.
For the first half, internal net sales declined 1%. However, year-to-date internal operating profit was up 3% and currency-neutral earnings per share grew 7%. Excluding the impact of the recall, internal net sales would have been flat. Internal operating profit would have increased approximately 8%. And earnings per share would have increased approximately 12% on a currency neutral basis. While sales were softer than expected without the recall, year-to-date operating profit and earnings per share would have been in line with our previous full year guidance.
On Slide 5, we'll walk through the components of our internal net sales performance. On a reported basis, our second quarter net sales declined by 5.2% year-over-year. Internal net sales declined 3.9%. The following components contributed to the overall change. While our volume reduced our internal net sales by 4.5 points, our lower volume performance was impacted by three different factors. Over two points of the total company volume decline was attributable to our U.S. Cereal business, which included approximately one point from the recall. 
Softness in the Eggo business contributed one point and the continued transition from bulk-to-packaged products in our Russia Snacks business contributed another point to the decline. 
Volume across the remainder of our business was relatively flat. Price and mix were positive and contributed 0.6 points of growth and currency negatively impacted growth by 1.3 points.
Now let me turn to Slide 6 to discuss gross profit. On a reported basis, gross profit declined 7% in the second quarter and gross margin contracted by 90 basis points to 42.6%. The impact of the recall contributed 120 basis points to this year-over-year decline. So without the recall, our gross margin would have expanded modestly.
As a result of the recall and an expectation of higher commodity costs, we now expect gross margin to increase approximately 50 basis points for the year, in line with our year-to-date results. We now expect cost pressures to be in the range of 4% to 5%, up from our prior estimate of 3% to 4%. For the remainder of the year, we are approximately 90% hedged on commodities. As we said on our first quarter call, our outlook includes commodity inflation in future quarters as we begin to lap lower costs in 2009. We plan to share our outlook for 2011 on our third quarter earnings call.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss advertising. As David stated, we are committed to reinvesting in our business. The categories in which we participate respond well to investment, and we believe it is important for the long-term health of these categories and our business. As a result, we have not pulled back on advertising. Instead, we have continued to invest. 
Internal advertising increased 4% in the second quarter. U.S. Retail Cereal, Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific all increased advertising expenditures by at least mid-single digits this quarter. Advertising was up 1% on an internal basis for the first half. And as we said last quarter, we expect our advertising investment for the full year 2010 to grow in the mid-single-digit range.
Slide 8 reviews our internal operating profit growth by area. Total company internal operating profit declined 11%. In North America, internal operating profit declined 16%, with the recall contributing 13 points to the decline. In addition, the cereal pricing environment, trade inventory reductions at key customers and softness in the Eggo business contributed to the decline were partially offset by lower-upfront costs in the quarter. 
Europe realized a 6% increase in operating profit as a result of lower commodity costs, cost savings and lower upfront costs. These more than offset the softer sales and increased advertising spending.
The 10% decline in Latin America was a result of commodity inflation, increased advertising, the difficult operating environment in Venezuela and to a lesser extent, the residual impact from the temporary closure of our Brazil plant in the first quarter. These items more than offset a mid-single-digit increase in sales.
While sales also increased in Asia-Pacific, increased cost pressures and advertising investment contributed to a 10% decline in operating profit. Note that Latin America and Asia-Pacific are lapping strong double-digit operating profit growth in the second quarter 2009.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss cash flow. We remain committed to generating cash and returning it to share owners. Year-to-date, cash flow was $446 million, $89 million lower when compared to last year. Lower cash flow was primarily due to the timing of cash tax payments. We now expect our cash flow to be in the $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion range for the year, in line with our revised business outlook, which I will discuss shortly.
Now let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss the impact of foreign exchange on earnings per share. Since our guidance is on a currency-neutral basis, each quarter, we provide an estimate of the foreign currency impact on our full year earnings per share. Slide 10 shows our key currencies with 2009 actual rates and current spot rates as of July 26, 2010. Based on these spot rates, we estimate full year 2010 foreign exchange to be unfavorable $0.04. We will continue to update you on the impact of foreign exchange on a quarterly basis.
Now let's turn to Slide 11 to discuss adjustments to our full year 2010 outlook. As David mentioned, we are lowering our guidance for 2010. This change reflects the weaker business performance in the second quarter and the voluntary cereal recall. We still expect to have a stronger back half based on the comps, coupled with increased innovation and advertising. But remember that we have more difficult sales and earnings comps in the third quarter and easier sales and earnings comps in the fourth quarter. We expect internal net sales growth to be flat to up 1%. Internal operating profit growth is now expected to be in the 4% to 6% range.
As you recall, we had strong operating profit growth in Q1 and for the first half, we were up 3%. This guidance also includes our intent to grow advertising in the mid-single digit range. We will continue to execute our three-year $1 billion-plus cost savings challenge and expect that gross profit margins will expand approximately 50 basis points for the year.
With this outlook on internal operating profit and slightly lower average shares outstanding, we expect our currency-neutral earnings per share growth to be in the range of 8% to 10%.
On the next slide, we have laid out the key changes to our 2010 earnings per share guidance. The primary driver to our lower earnings per share is the voluntary cereal recall, which is expected to have a negative 4% impact. In addition, softer business performance reflects another 1% to 2% decline. However, embedded in this guidance is up-front costs of $0.12 per share for 2010 compared to our prior guidance of $0.16. This contributes a positive 1% to the earnings per share guidance. Note that lower up-front costs were driven by reduced costs of the initiatives, not the number of initiatives. In addition, we remain on track to achieve our three-year $1 billion-plus cost challenge.
We estimate that the reduction in the average shares outstanding should contribute another 1% to 2% to our earnings per share. As I mentioned earlier, we now expect full year 2010 cash flow to be in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion. We will continue to return cash to share owners under our current three-year $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $356 million worth of shares. We currently assume that we would decrease average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 1% to 2% in 2010. We will update you on the third quarter call on our progress. 
And now I'll turn it over to John Bryant to cover our North America and International results."

In the second quarter, net sales from North America Ready-to-Eat Cereal business decreased by 13% versus las",1433,"Thanks, Ron. Let me begin with North America. Internal net sales declined 6% in the second quarter and we were down 2% for the first half of 2010. In the second quarter, net sales from North America Ready-to-Eat Cereal business decreased by 13% versus last year. While disappointing, the 13% decline can be explained in part by three factors. The first factor is weak consumption against tough costs. Second, is the cereal recall at the end of the quarter. And finally, the correction of elevated trade inventory, which we flagged at the end of the first quarter.
First, looking at consumption. We estimate that the category's declined by 2% to 3% in value during the quarter. We believe that our total channel consumption was down around 5% leading to a loss of approximately one share point. A large part of the decline in the category and in our consumption can be explained by the comparables. 
In the second quarter last year, the category grew around 4% in value and our total channel consumption was up approximately 6% to 7%, resulting in approximately one share point of growth. Our share gain last year was largely due to Post going through some integration issues. As we lapped last year, Post has regained some share.
It is also worth noting that the SKU actualization last year adversely impacted our second quarter results by 1% to 2%. In addition, our innovation this year is more back-end loaded. 
The second factor, as David has already talked about at length, was the voluntary cereal recall. While this occurred at the end of the quarter, we were required to reverse the sales of all products, which was subsequently returned. The net impact was a reduction in sales of 5% in the second quarter in North America Retail Cereal sales.
Finally, we flagged at both the end of last year and the first quarter that we had higher retail inventory than we were comfortable with. And we saw this reverse out in the second quarter, resulting in an estimated 3% adverse impact on shipments. So contributing to the 13% net sales decline is a 5% impact from weak consumption, largely due to tough year-ago comparison, a 5% decline from the recall and approximately 3% from a retail inventory correction.
While these three factors help explain the results, we do not pretend to be satisfied with the performance of our Cereal business. On a more positive note, we gained cereal share in Canada in the quarter and are seeing some very promising early results from innovation in the U.S. Both FiberPlus and Cinnabon cereals have shown strong early performance with a 0.4 share and 0.3 share, respectively.
As we look at the remainder of the year, we expect to have weak consumption in the third quarter as the impact of the recall will show up on shelf, but expect better performance in the fourth quarter. We will have more advertising project and more innovation in the back half, and we remain excited about our long-term prospects in this important category.
North America Retail Snacks posted internal net sales growth of 1% for the second quarter and 3% for the first half, reflecting strengths in the Pop-Tarts and Wholesome Snacks businesses. The Pop-Tarts business delivered another strong quarter with net sales up mid-single digit and gained two points of share. Innovation and strong brand building supported this iconic brands continued growth.
Store door cracker sales was down slightly in the quarter. Our overall share was flat as we decreased our promotion activity in the second quarter in order to return to more balanced levels. Late in the second quarter, we launched a range of new products including two varieties of Town House Flatbread Crisps, Club Minis and Cheez-It Double Cheese Snack Mix.
Our Cookie business declined in the quarter against a tough year-ago comparable when we launched the Mother's business. Recent innovations including Fudge Shoppe Coconut Dreams and 100-Calorie Right Bites mini-Brownies are performing well. We expect Cookies to continue to be a tough category for the remainder of the year.
Momentum in our Wholesome Snacks business continued into the second quarter, delivering strong sales growth and maintaining our share leadership in this growing category. The successful introduction of Special K Fruit Crisps at the end of 2009 and the strong performance of FiberPlus bars continue to drive growth. We also launched two new SKUs of Nutri-Grain bars in the quarter.
For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued growth in Wholesome Snacks and the Pop-Tarts, combined with a slight improvement in Crackers and slight performance in Cookies. We feel good about our strong innovations throughout the back half of 2010, much of which was introduced at the end of the second quarter.
Turning to the Frozen and Specialty Channels business. North America Frozen and Specialty Channels second quarter sales declined 9% versus last year. This was driven by the softness in our Eggo business, which was adversely impacted by our supply constraints and a tough double-digit growth rate comparison in the prior year. It is also worth noting that the performance in the second quarter was weaker year-on-year compared to the first quarter, due to a higher trade inventory rebuilt in the first quarter. 
Towards the end of the second quarter, we have enough capacity in our network to return to demand-driving activities such as advertising and trade promotion. We are beginning to see the business respond to these drivers and expect it to return to modest growth in the back half of the year. We also introduced new products with Eggo Cinnabon Pancakes and Eggo Real Fruit Breakfast Pizzas, launching at the end of the second quarter.
We continue to work with our customers to help reset freezers, to regain space that we lost when we were unable to maintain supply. The combination of new products, improved freezer space and increased advertising pressure should help drive improved performance in the back half of the year. In addition, the Veggie Foods business continue to perform well in the quarter and our Food Away From Home business also showed positive growth.
Turning to our International business. Our Latin America and Asia-Pacific businesses continue to deliver solid sales growth while weakness in Europe muted the growth of our overall International business.
Europe internal net sales declined 3% in the second quarter, driven primarily by two factors, a weaker U.K. Cereal category and continued volume declines in the Russia Snack business. Similar to the U.S., many food categories across Europe experienced deflation. In the U.K., our largest European market, we gained share in the quarter, but our sales were down, reflecting a 4% decline in the category, which is up against a very tough 7% growth in the second quarter last year.
At the end of the first quarter, trade inventory in the U.K. was increased in preparation for Easter promotions. The U.K. ended the second quarter with inventory levels similar to a year ago.
In Russia, the migration from bulks to packaged snacks drove lower volumes and contributed to Europe's lower top line results. With a weak local economy, the transition has taken longer than we originally anticipated. To stand in the short-term volume declines, we are protecting our Bulk business while pushing harder the game, more trade support for our packaged snacks. We expect to see less of a negative impact from Russia in the back half. And while we were disappointed in the performance of our Russia Snacks business, our Cereal business in Russia had strong growth during the quarter.
Latin America's internal net sales rose 5% in the second quarter, on top of last year's healthy 8% growth. Internal net sales were driven by price increases in Venezuela and strong cereal growth, particularly in Mexico. Double-digit consumption growth in Mexico was not fully reflected in our net sales performance as retail has reduced inventory in the quarter and we lacked an inventory build last year due to the H1N1 virus scare. We continue to expect Latin America to deliver mid-single digit internal net sales growth for 2010.
Asia-Pacific delivered internal net sales growth of 3%, driven by strong top line performance in Australia, South Korea and India. Both Australia and South Korea saw strong second quarter Cereal category growth. We are currently launching a new Sultana Bran product, which will increase our healthy offerings in Australia and Heart to Heart oat cereal in India. For the year, we continue to expect mid-single digit internal net sales growth from our Asia-Pacific businesses. 
Now let me turn it back over to David."

And you look at the category as John said, when he went through deflation existing in the category, we sort, we talked about it in Q1. It's actually a little bit worse than what's expected. But as we reflected on, did the analysis, no question that Post and the fact that their year-on-year comps, when they're out of the market last year and have come back in this year, have had an impact. I think retailers pushing and using the category to draw traffic in has exacerbated in the short term the situation, and no doubt consumers are continuing to look for and buying a deal. So I think all manufacturers in the short term are seeing some of the costs come down, which has probably meant their activities are going up a little bit. Our view and our outlook as we look to the back half and going forward is, Cereal category is a great category. We think once Post lapsed Q3, that the level of investment tactically should moderate as cost go up. For us, as we look at the performance of Kellogg's specifically and take the 5% decline in U.S., we had a small impact from the SKU calculus, it was probably one or two. So if you look at that relative to the category, while we're not happy with the performance, we can understand it. John mentioned our innovation in the back half is much stronger. We're seeing very good performance at the FiberPlus and a couple of other innovations we've launched. And on your question specifically on advertising investment. Our belief is that while we are one of the highest spenders, if you look specifically in the category, it tends to be a fairly high investment category and we have real opportunities to build stronger capabilities in digital. We have real opportunities to increase the level of communication with Hispanics and those plus other opportunities on new products and investments around the world, we'll see our advertising grow. I think mid-single digits is a very good level for us. And we feel very comfortable that over the medium to long term, we'll get a good investment return for that."

I think when you think about the category in the first half of 2009, the four major developed markets in the world, the category grew anywhere between 4% and 8%. I think with hindsight, we probably underestimated the difficult challenge that would create for 2010. We knew it would be a challenge, that's why we when come into the year, our expectations for top line were probably more moderate than people were expecting. When you look specifically on what's unfolded this year, Post really, as we dug into the data was out and has come back in and are probably back to more historical levels. I think all manufacturers because of lower cost are probably putting a little bit more money back into the market to reflect that consumers are being under pressure. Consumers clearly across all categories, I think, are buying more diligently and deal where they can get it and using coupons. And then retailers themselves see the Cereal category as a great traffic build up, so are actually using it in ways that may help with traffic but may not help with the overall strength in the category. So you put all of those things into combination and what you see is a very stark difference this year to last year partly because of the comps and partly because of those competitive dynamic. But our view would be, this is a great category. We'll see that dissipate as we move through the back half of the year and as cost increases invariably they will as we go forward, we would expect to see the category start to perform in a more normal basis."

I'm looking at Smart Start, for example, Raisin Bran Crunch, Special  K, had what I would call pretty disappointing performances, certainly in the ACNielsen data. What worries me there, David, is do you think there is an internal trade down going on in the Cereal category from some of those -- you guys are famous for volume to value, make sure I get that right. But, I guess, I would look at the data and start to worry that maybe there is trade out of some of the pricier, higher profitability cereals."

We've actually reduced our investment in Smart Start  and moved it elsewhere in the portfolio, and that's one of the reasons why that business is down. I think also what you're seeing a little bit in the Cereal category is the drive towards utility. All family products are doing well. Our highly focused brands against [indiscernible] in this state, in general not doing as well in this current environment, I think that's a reflection of the consumer. Having said that, I think you can point to a couple of businesses, where you are getting some good growth and a reasonably high price. So for example, we're seeing double-digit growth in BearNaked and we're seeing good growth in Kashi. So it's hard to generalize. I think what you're seeing is a movement of money around the brands, and you're seeing a general consumer drive towards utility."

So I just want to understand why that is the case? And why that should get better in the back half, so that even if pricing doesn't necessarily get better, should we expect to see actually volume get better in the back half? And then secondly, at the competitive level, it just seems like you've got even players like Quaker talking about spending more money in the category. Obviously, you're raising investments both from the brand side and some of the promotional activity. Does the competitive environment get worse before it really gets better?

The category from a pricing perspective is actually not all that elastic and that the volume didn't go down significantly last year, when some of the pricing came up and didn't go up this year when the pricing came down a little bit. So it's not the category, which you can win in long term through the pricing, maybe get there through brand building and through innovation. I think some of the deflation we're seeing in the category this year is actually a bit of an anomaly. If you look at 2009, let's look at Post, they had some integration issues last year and their price per pound last year was up about $0.25 year-on-year in the second quarter. This year, their price per pound in the major channels are down around $0.25. So a lot of which you're seeing actually is a disruption in one particular competitor coming back to, I guess, what is more normal levels and they'll be there for the second quarter and the third quarter. I think as you go into the back half of this year and into next year, as you get cost inflation coming through, you would expect to see less deflation, potentially return to an inflationary environment in the Cereal category."

Our second quarter results were modeled and expected, reflecting weakness in the Cereal category, combined with the impact of our voluntary cereal recall at the end of June and softness in that area of business",559,"Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results were modeled and expected, reflecting weakness in the Cereal category, combined with the impact of our voluntary cereal recall at the end of June and softness in that area of business. 
The weakness in the Cereal category have the greatest bearing on our Q2 results. Throughout the first half of the year, we talked about the challenging Cereal category and deflation. Our results and those of other cereal manufacturers reflected this trend.
Although we anticipated a difficult quarter, the severity of the impact to our business was greater than we expected. Our low cereal sales resulted from difficult year-on-year comparables, the cereal recall and inventory reductions. John will talk about these in greater detail. 
We continue to feel confident in the Cereal category and believe trends will begin to improve in the back half of the year. Let me talk briefly about the voluntary cereal recall, which was due to an item that came from the line up. While we had relatively few complaints at the time of the recall, we knew that removing the production store shelves was the right thing to do for our consumers. The cost was high, the total anticipated EPS impact for the year including lost sales is approximately $0.12.  And we're currently pursuing all legal recourse to recoup the cost. 
Over the past 18 months, we've experienced two events that have adversely affected our business. The payment-related recalls at the end of 2008 and the recent cereal line of recall. We're frustrated by these business disruptions, both supply related, but I can confidently say that they were unrelated to one another and unrelated to our cost savings programs. And when it comes to quality and food safety, over the last few years, we've actually increased our vigilance and ramped up our investment across the company. 
What these issues do have in common is the pressure that they place on our resources, both time and money. While we're working to minimize the impact, they will cause disruption to our business, our employees, our customers and our consumers and to this quarter, to our total company results. The weakness in our Cereal business in Q2, combined with the size of the cereal recall, drove our decision to call down our 2010 guidance.
It has always been our intent to take a realistic, open and pragmatic approach to running our business for the long term. This call down, while disappointing, will ensure that we can continue to do the right things for the long-term health of the business. As we said at the beginning of this year, we expect a stronger back half as we anticipate category trends will gradually improve. Of course, this will not happen overnight. We also expect to have stronger innovation in the second half of the year. 
We just introduced FiberPlus cereal at the end of June, with strong initial results. And our Snacks business has launched a strong line-up as well. And we will continue to invest in our business through increased advertising. John will review the business in more details shortly. Even though we had a tough quarter, we feel good about the underlying health of our business and the remainder of the year. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Ron to discuss our financials."
283356,98349778,70562,"Kellogg Company, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our second quarter and first half results on Slide 4. As we have mentioned, we expected to have some tough comparisons in the first half, as well as some challenging operating condition",1580,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our second quarter and first half results on Slide 4. As we have mentioned, we expected to have some tough comparisons in the first half, as well as some challenging operating conditions across our business. What we did not anticipate was the degree of weakness in the Cereal category and, of course, the voluntary cereal recall in June that directly impacted our results.
For the quarter, net sales declined 5% on a reported basis and 4% on an internal basis. Approximately one point of the sales decline was attributable to the recall. The softness in the Eggo business also contributed roughly one point to the decline in sales. The remainder was primarily due to weakness in our U.S. and U.K. Cereal businesses and the reduction of cereal inventory levels in the U.S.
Operating profit for the quarter also fell as a result of lower net sales, the recall and an increased investment in advertising. Operating profit was down 13% on a reported basis and down 11% on an internal basis.
Earnings per share declined 14% on a reported basis, and 11% on a currency-neutral basis. The recall reduced operating profit by approximately 10% and earnings per share by $0.10, including loss sales in the quarter.
As we look at recent consensus estimates, we recognize that it was difficult to estimate the impact of the recall, given that we provided no guidance until today. The accounting rules required us to book the majority of the impact in the second quarter. We also expect a small impact in the third quarter.
For the first half, internal net sales declined 1%. However, year-to-date internal operating profit was up 3% and currency-neutral earnings per share grew 7%. Excluding the impact of the recall, internal net sales would have been flat. Internal operating profit would have increased approximately 8%. And earnings per share would have increased approximately 12% on a currency neutral basis. While sales were softer than expected without the recall, year-to-date operating profit and earnings per share would have been in line with our previous full year guidance.
On Slide 5, we'll walk through the components of our internal net sales performance. On a reported basis, our second quarter net sales declined by 5.2% year-over-year. Internal net sales declined 3.9%. The following components contributed to the overall change. Lower volume reduced our internal net sales by 4.5 points, our lower volume performance was impacted by three different factors. Over two points of the total company volume decline was attributable to our U.S. Cereal business, which included approximately one point from the recall.  Softness in the Eggo business contributed one point and the continued transition from bulk-to-packaged products in our Russia Snacks business contributed another point to the decline. 
Volume across the remainder of our business was relatively flat. Price and mix were positive and contributed 0.6 points of growth and currency negatively impacted growth by 1.3 points.
Now let me turn to Slide 6 to discuss gross profit. On a reported basis, gross profit declined 7% in the second quarter and gross margin contracted by 90 basis points to 42.6%. The impact of the recall contributed 120 basis points to this year-over-year decline. So without the recall, our gross margin would have expanded modestly.
As a result of the recall and an expectation of higher commodity costs, we now expect gross margin to increase approximately 50 basis points for the year, in line with our year-to-date results. We now expect cost pressures to be in the range of 4% to 5%, up from our prior estimate of 3% to 4%. For the remainder of the year, we are approximately 90% hedged on commodities. As we said on our first quarter call, our outlook includes commodity inflation in future quarters as we begin to lap lower costs in 2009. We plan to share our outlook for 2011 on our third quarter earnings call.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss advertising. As David stated, we are committed to reinvesting in our business. The categories in which we participate respond well to investment, and we believe it is important for the long-term health of these categories and our business. As a result, we have not pulled back on advertising. Instead, we have continued to invest. 
Internal advertising increased 4% in the second quarter. U.S. Retail Cereal, Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific all increased advertising expenditures by at least mid-single digits this quarter. Advertising was up 1% on an internal basis for the first half. And as we said last quarter, we expect our advertising investment for the full year 2010 to grow in the mid-single-digit range.
Slide 8 reviews our internal operating profit growth by area. Total company internal operating profit declined 11%. In North America, internal operating profit declined 16%, with the recall contributing 13 points to the decline. In addition, the cereal pricing environment, trade inventory reductions at key customers and softness in the Eggo business contributed to the decline were partially offset by lower-upfront costs in the quarter. 
Europe realized a 6% increase in operating profit as a result of lower commodity costs, cost savings and lower upfront costs. These more than offset the softer sales and increased advertising spending.
The 10% decline in Latin America was a result of commodity inflation, increased advertising, the difficult operating environment in Venezuela and to a lesser extent, the residual impact from the temporary closure of our Brazil plant in the first quarter. These items more than offset a mid-single-digit increase in sales.
While sales also increased in Asia-Pacific, increased cost pressures and advertising investment contributed to a 10% decline in operating profit. Note that Latin America and Asia-Pacific are lapping strong double-digit operating profit growth in the second quarter 2009.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss cash flow. We remain committed to generating cash and returning it to share owners. Year-to-date, cash flow was $446 million, $89 million lower when compared to last year. Lower cash flow was primarily due to the timing of cash tax payments. We now expect our cash flow to be in the $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion range for the year, in line with our revised business outlook, which I will discuss shortly.
Now let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss the impact of foreign exchange on earnings per share. Since our guidance is on a currency-neutral basis, each quarter, we provide an estimate of the foreign currency impact on our full year earnings per share. Slide 10 shows our key currencies with 2009 actual rates and current spot rates as of July 26, 2010. Based on these spot rates, we estimate full year 2010 foreign exchange to be unfavorable $0.04. We will continue to update you on the impact of foreign exchange on a quarterly basis.
Now let's turn to Slide 11 to discuss adjustments to our full year 2010 outlook. As David mentioned, we are lowering our guidance for 2010. This change reflects the weaker business performance in the second quarter and the voluntary cereal recall. We still expect to have a stronger back half based on the comps, coupled with increased innovation and advertising. But remember that we have more difficult sales and earnings comps in the third quarter and easier sales and earnings comps in the fourth quarter. We expect internal net sales growth to be flat to up 1%. Internal operating profit growth is now expected to be in the 4% to 6% range.
As you recall, we had strong operating profit growth in Q1 and for the first half, we were up 3%. This guidance also includes our intent to grow advertising in the mid-single digit range. We will continue to execute our three-year $1 billion-plus cost savings challenge and expect that gross profit margins will expand approximately 50 basis points for the year.
With this outlook on internal operating profit and slightly lower average shares outstanding, we expect our currency-neutral earnings per share growth to be in the range of 8% to 10%.
On the next slide, we have laid out the key changes to our 2010 earnings per share guidance. The primary driver to our lower earnings per share is the voluntary cereal recall, which is expected to have a negative 4% impact. In addition, softer business performance reflects another 1% to 2% decline. However, embedded in this guidance is up-front costs of $0.12 per share for 2010 compared to our prior guidance of $0.16. This contributes a positive 1% to the earnings per share guidance. Note that lower up-front costs were driven by reduced costs of the initiatives, not the number of initiatives. In addition, we remain on track to achieve our three-year $1 billion-plus cost challenge.
We estimate that the reduction in the average shares outstanding should contribute another 1% to 2% to our earnings per share. As I mentioned earlier, we now expect full year 2010 cash flow to be in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion. We will continue to return cash to share owners under our current three-year $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $356 million worth of shares. We currently assume that we would decrease average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 1% to 2% in 2010. We will update you on the third quarter call on our progress. 
And now I'll turn it over to John Bryant to cover our North America and International results."
283356,98349778,70562,"Kellogg Company, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Ron. Let me begin with North America. Internal net sales declined 6% in the second quarter and we were down 2% for the first half of 2010. In the second quarter, net sales from North America Ready-to-Eat Cereal business decreased by 13% versus las",1433,"Thanks, Ron. Let me begin with North America. Internal net sales declined 6% in the second quarter and we were down 2% for the first half of 2010. In the second quarter, net sales from North America Ready-to-Eat Cereal business decreased by 13% versus last year. While disappointing, the 13% decline can be explained in part by three factors. The first factor is weak consumption against tough costs. Second, is the cereal recall at the end of the quarter. And finally, the correction of elevated trade inventory, which we flagged at the end of the first quarter.
First, looking at consumption. We estimate that the category's declined by 2% to 3% in value during the quarter. We believe that our total channel consumption was down around 5% leading to a loss of approximately one share point. A large part of the decline in the category and in our consumption can be explained by the comparables. 
In the second quarter last year, the category grew around 4% in value and our total channel consumption was up approximately 6% to 7%, resulting in approximately one share point of growth. Our share gain last year was largely due to Post going through some integration issues. As we lapped last year, Post has regained some share.
It is also worth noting that the SKU actualization last year adversely impacted our second quarter results by 1% to 2%. In addition, our innovation this year is more back-end loaded. 
The second factor, as David has already talked about at length, was the voluntary cereal recall. While this occurred at the end of the quarter, we were required to reverse the sales of all products, which was subsequently returned. The net impact was a reduction in sales of 5% in the second quarter in North America Retail Cereal sales.
Finally, we flagged at both the end of last year and the first quarter that we had higher retail inventory than we were comfortable with. And we saw this reverse out in the second quarter, resulting in an estimated 3% adverse impact on shipments. So contributing to the 13% net sales decline is a 5% impact from weak consumption, largely due to tough year-ago comparison, a 5% decline from the recall and approximately 3% from a retail inventory correction.
While these three factors help explain the results, we do not pretend to be satisfied with the performance of our Cereal business. On a more positive note, we gained cereal share in Canada in the quarter and are seeing some very promising early results from innovation in the U.S. Both FiberPlus and Cinnabon cereals have shown strong early performance with a 0.4 share and 0.3 share, respectively.
As we look at the remainder of the year, we expect to have weak consumption in the third quarter as the impact of the recall will show up on shelf, but expect better performance in the fourth quarter. We will have more advertising project and more innovation in the back half, and we remain excited about our long-term prospects in this important category.
North America Retail Snacks posted internal net sales growth of 1% for the second quarter and 3% for the first half, reflecting strengths in the Pop-Tarts and Wholesome Snacks businesses. The Pop-Tarts business delivered another strong quarter with net sales up mid-single digit and gained two points of share. Innovation and strong brand building supported this iconic brands continued growth.
Store door cracker sales was down slightly in the quarter. Our overall share was flat as we decreased our promotion activity in the second quarter in order to return to more balanced levels. Late in the second quarter, we launched a range of new products including two varieties of Town House Flatbread Crisps, Club Minis and Cheez-It Double Cheese Snack Mix.
Our Cookie business declined in the quarter against a tough year-ago comparable when we launched the Mother's business. Recent innovations including Fudge Shoppe Coconut Dreams and 100-Calorie Right Bites mini-Brownies are performing well. We expect Cookies to continue to be a tough category for the remainder of the year.
Momentum in our Wholesome Snacks business continued into the second quarter, delivering strong sales growth and maintaining our share leadership in this growing category. The successful introduction of Special K Fruit Crisps at the end of 2009 and the strong performance of FiberPlus bars continue to drive growth. We also launched two new SKUs of Nutri-Grain bars in the quarter.
For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued growth in Wholesome Snacks and the Pop-Tarts, combined with a slight improvement in Crackers and slight performance in Cookies. We feel good about our strong innovations throughout the back half of 2010, much of which was introduced at the end of the second quarter.
Turning to the Frozen and Specialty Channels business. North America Frozen and Specialty Channels second quarter sales declined 9% versus last year. This was driven by the softness in our Eggo business, which was adversely impacted by our supply constraints and a tough double-digit growth rate comparison in the prior year. It is also worth noting that the performance in the second quarter was weaker year-on-year compared to the first quarter, due to a higher trade inventory rebuilt in the first quarter. 
Towards the end of the second quarter, we have enough capacity in our network to return to demand-driving activities such as advertising and trade promotion. We are beginning to see the business respond to these drivers and expect it to return to modest growth in the back half of the year. We also introduced new products with Eggo Cinnabon Pancakes and Eggo Real Fruit Breakfast Pizzas, launching at the end of the second quarter.
We continue to work with our customers to help reset freezers, to regain space that we lost when we were unable to maintain supply. The combination of new products, improved freezer space and increased advertising pressure should help drive improved performance in the back half of the year. In addition, the Veggie Foods business continue to perform well in the quarter and our Food Away From Home business also showed positive growth.
Turning to our International business. Our Latin America and Asia-Pacific businesses continue to deliver solid sales growth while weakness in Europe muted the growth of our overall International business.
Europe internal net sales declined 3% in the second quarter, driven primarily by two factors, a weaker U.K. Cereal category and continued volume declines in the Russia Snack business. Similar to the U.S., many food categories across Europe experienced deflation. In the U.K., our largest European market, we gained share in the quarter, but our sales were down, reflecting a 4% decline in the category, which is up against a very tough 7% growth in the second quarter last year.
At the end of the first quarter, trade inventory in the U.K. was increased in preparation for Easter promotions. The U.K. ended the second quarter with inventory levels similar to a year ago.
In Russia, the migration from bulks to packaged snacks drove lower volumes and contributed to Europe's lower top line results. With a weak local economy, the transition has taken longer than we originally anticipated. To stand in the short-term volume declines, we are protecting our Bulk business while pushing harder the game, more trade support for our packaged snacks. We expect to see less of a negative impact from Russia in the back half. And while we were disappointed in the performance of our Russia Snacks business, our Cereal business in Russia had strong growth during the quarter.
Latin America's internal net sales rose 5% in the second quarter, on top of last year's healthy 8% growth. Internal net sales were driven by price increases in Venezuela and strong cereal growth, particularly in Mexico. Double-digit consumption growth in Mexico was not fully reflected in our net sales performance as retail has reduced inventory in the quarter and we lacked an inventory build last year due to the H1N1 virus scare. We continue to expect Latin America to deliver mid-single digit internal net sales growth for 2010.
Asia-Pacific delivered internal net sales growth of 3%, driven by strong top line performance in Australia, South Korea and India. Both Australia and South Korea saw strong second quarter Cereal category growth. We are currently launching a new Sultana Bran product, which will increase our healthy offerings in Australia and Heart to Heart oat cereal in India. For the year, we continue to expect mid-single digit internal net sales growth from our Asia-Pacific businesses. 
Now let me turn it back over to David."

And you look at the category as John said, when he went through deflation existing in the category, we sort, we talked about it in Q1. It's actually a little bit worse than what's expected. But as we reflected on, did the analysis, no question that Post and the fact that their year-on-year comps, when they're out of the market last year and have come back in this year, have had an impact. I think retailers pushing and using the category to draw traffic in has exacerbated in the short term the situation, and no doubt consumers are continuing to look for and buying a deal. So I think all manufacturers in the short term are seeing some of the costs come down, which has probably meant their activities are going up a little bit. Our view and our outlook as we look to the back half and going forward is, Cereal category is a great category. We think once Post lapsed Q3, that the level of investment tactically should moderate as cost go up. For us, as we look at the performance of Kellogg's specifically and take the 5% decline in U.S., we had a small impact from the SKU calculus, it was probably one or two. So if you look at that relative to the category, while we're not happy with the performance, we can understand it. John mentioned our innovation in the back half is much stronger. We're seeing very good performance at the FiberPlus and a couple of other innovations we've launched. And on your question specifically on advertising investment. Our belief is that while we are one of the highest spenders, if you look specifically in the category, it tends to be a fairly high investment category and we have real opportunities to build stronger capabilities in digital. We have real opportunities to increase the level of communication with Hispanics and those plus other opportunities on new products and investments around the world, we'll see our advertising grow. I think mid-single digits is a very good level for us. And we feel very comfortable that over the medium to long term, we'll get a good investment return for that."

I think when you think about the category in the first half of 2009, the four major developed markets in the world, the category grew anywhere between 4% and 8%. I think with hindsight, we probably underestimated the difficult challenge that would create for 2010. We knew it would be a challenge, that's why when we came into the year, our expectations for top line were probably more moderate than people were expecting. When you look specifically on what's unfolded this year, Post really, as we dug into the data was out and has come back in and are probably back to more historical levels. I think all manufacturers because of lower cost are probably putting a little bit more money back into the market to reflect the concern of our consumers being under pressure. Consumers clearly across all categories, I think, are buying more diligently and deal where they can get it and using coupons. And then retailers themselves see the Cereal category as a great traffic build up, so are actually using it in ways that may help with traffic but may not help with the overall strength in the category. So you put all of those things into combination and what you see is a very stark difference this year to last year partly because of the comps and partly because of those competitive dynamic. But our view would be, this is a great category. We'll see that dissipate as we move through the back half of the year and as cost increases invariably they will as we go forward, we would expect to see the category start to perform in a more normal basis."

The category from a pricing perspective is actually not all that elastic and that the volume didn't go down significantly last year, when some of the pricing came up and didn't go up this year when the pricing came down a little bit. So it's not the category, which you can win in long term through the pricing, maybe get there through brand building and through innovation. I think some of the deflation we're seeing in the category this year is actually a bit of an anomaly. If you look at 2009, let's look at Post, they had some integration issues last year and their price per pound last year was up about $0.25 year-on-year in the second quarter. This year, their price per pound in the major channels are down around $0.25. So a lot of which you're seeing actually is a disruption in one particular competitor coming back to, I guess, what is more normal levels and they'll be there for the second quarter and the third quarter.

We're confident that we can regai",875,"Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. 2010 has been a difficult, disappointing year for the company. By now there are many questions about what has happened to Kellogg and why and when we expect better performance. We're confident that we can regain momentum as a company, and this confidence comes from an understanding of what has happened in our business over the last two years and a conviction that we're well positioned for the future. To understand our confidence in this future, it is first necessary to recognize what has taken us off course in 2010. And there are four major issues. 
First, we've had significant issues in our supply chain. We've weathered the two largest recalls in our history during the past two years. We've also been impacted by production challenges in our Eggo facility. We have a long-standing commitment to food quality, and the recent voluntary recalls have demonstrated our commitment to putting consumers first. We've taken steps in our supply chain to mitigate similar potential risks. This includes additional operating expense across 2010 and 2011 as well as slightly elevated levels of capital spending in 2011 and 2012. 
It is difficult to quantify the true impact of these supply disruptions. There are clearly defined costs associated with the recourse and the softer costs associated with lost sales. To put the impact of these issues into context, we estimate that the various supply disruptions adversely impacted operating expense by $200 million to $300 million over the last two years and impacted capital expenditures by $150 million to $200 million for a total impact approaching $0.5 billion. In addition, there's also the organizational impact of focusing large numbers of internal resources on proactively identifying and resolving issues to mitigate risks going forward.
I believe that these supply disruptions clearly distinguish the last two years from the preceding eight years. Second, we've had significantly less innovation during 2009 and 2010. As we enter the recession, we pull back on innovation and drive increased renovation across the portfolio, such as adding fiber to our kid cereals. The renovation has set up our portfolio for the future but did not drive short-term sales performance. The lower level of innovation, combined with these key [ph] rationalization has weighed all our top line growth. 
It's always difficult to quantify the impact of reduced innovation. But as a guide, we launched about $800 million worth of innovation in 2008. In 2009 and 2010, our innovation was roughly 25% lower than in 2008. The good news is that we are moving forward into 2011 with a wide of innovation that is going to increase significantly. 
Third, we have some tough comparisons in 2010, both in the overall strong 2009 Cereal category growth globally and in the non-major channel. In 2009, we had abnormally high growth from the non-major channels, as we work closely with some large customers in that group. However, in 2010, I compare this picked up more of the activity that we had enjoyed in 2009. 
To give you a sense of the impact, we estimate that this has resulted in an approximate 2-point drag on our top line in U.S. Cereal business. I think the last two years have reinforced several key truths regarding the U.S. Cereal category. For most retailers to do well in the category, the key branded players need to excite consumers. And most importantly, the category is driven by health news, innovation and brand building. Promotional activity has not proven to grow the category over time. 
Fourth and finally, deflation has been an issue at our core Cereal categories around the world. Managing through this deflationary cycle has been much more difficult than we had anticipated.
Heading into 2011, we anticipate cost inflation at much greater levels than in 2010. Historically, retailers have accepted price increases to offset cost inflation of this magnitude, and we believe that a combination of pricing, mix and trade spend could yield 200 to 300 basis points of net price realizations for 2011. 
It is also worth stating what has not impacted Kellogg in 2010. One thing we have not done is cut back on brand building. Instead, we've continued to invest back into our brands as industry-leading levels.
So there are several specific issues, which differentiate 2010 from the prior eight years. As we head into 2011, we're confident that we can succeed by playing our game, continuing to invest in brand building and driving sustainable innovation in the marketplace. Despite our long-term confidence, we need to remain pragmatic. It will take time, focus and effort to regain our momentum. We will stabilize our supply chain and mitigate the risks of future disruption. We will ramp up our innovation. We will keep our people focused on the key drivers of our business, and we will add value back into our categories. We believe that we can achieve all of this, but it will not be done overnight. It is not as simple as lapping soft comparisons. Hence, we're providing realistic guidance to 2011 to enable us to regain momentum and get back on track with our long-term sustainable growth model.
Now let me turn it over to Ron and John to discuss 2010 and 2011 in more detail."
283356,98349801,84238,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 summarizes our third quarter and year-to-date financial results. For the quarter, net sales declined 4% on a reported basis and 2% on an internal basis. The key contributor to the decline was softness in",1613,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 summarizes our third quarter and year-to-date financial results. For the quarter, net sales declined 4% on a reported basis and 2% on an internal basis. The key contributor to the decline was softness in our U.S. Cereal business, including continued aggressive competitive price discounting and the impact from the Cereal recall. In addition, the challenging economic environment in Europe, combined with difficult year-over-year comparisons and a deflationary category in the U.K., contributed to third quarter sales decline.
Operating profit declined 5% on a reported basis and 3% on an internal basis. Lower net sales, increased advertising investment and a decrease in operating leverage due to reduced volume in our manufacturing plants, as well as increased costs, contributed to the decline. These items were offset by a significant reduction in our estimated 2010 incentive compensation expense. I'll discuss this in more detail along with the implications for 2011 shortly.
Earnings per share declined 4% on a reported basis and 2% on a currency neutral basis. Earnings per share benefited from lower average shares outstanding due to our share repurchases. 
Slide 6 highlights the components of our net sales performance. Third quarter reported net sales fell 3.6%. Internal net sales declined 2.5% driven by lower volume. The 3.4% decline in volume was partially attributable to the U.S. Cereal business, including the impact of the Cereal recall and in Europe due primarily to the Russia's Snacks business. 
Partially offsetting the volume decline, price and mix improved by 0.9 points, primarily as a result of better mix in our U.S. Snacks business and pricing in Latin America. Currency adversely impacted net sales by 1.1 points.
Now let me turn to Slide 7 to discuss gross profit. Gross profit declined by 5% on a reported basis in the third quarter and 4% on an internal basis. Internal gross margin contracted by 50 basis points to 43.4%. Higher commodity costs and lower operating leverage were the primary contributors to the margin decline.
Slide 8 shows our trend in advertising investment during 2010. As planned, we continue to invest behind our brands in the third quarter. Our internal advertising expenditures increased 9%, primarily driven by U.S. Cereal and Snacks, but we also invested behind new product launches in Asia-Pacific and the relaunch of Special K in Latin America. 
Slide 9 shows our internal operating profit growth by area. Third quarter internal operating profit decreased by 3% against a strong 11% increase last year. We had expected stronger performance as we progress through the back half, but our business has been softer than planned. As a result, we adjusted our incentive compensation costs sharply downward versus target. We estimate that the benefit was approximately 10 points in the third quarter and includes adjustments for our first-half accruals.
For the full year, incentive compensation costs will be reduced significantly, so restoring them back to target levels in 2011 will create a significant headwind. In North America, internal operating profit declined 3% against the strong 10% increase a year ago. Lower sales, as a result of increased promotional pricing activity in the Cereal category, the impact of the Cereal recall and a slower rebound in the Eggo business drove the decline. In addition, higher supply chain costs and increased advertising contributed to the decrease. Lower upfront and incentive compensation costs partially offset the decline.
Europe's internal operating profit grew by 2% against the 7% growth a year earlier. A mid- single-digit decline in net sales was more than offset by cost of goods savings, lower overhead expenses due to incentive compensation costs and a reduction in upfront costs.
In Latin America, internal operating profit declined 18% as a result of increased commodity costs, and in Mexico, incremental operating and distribution costs. In addition, SG&A expenses were higher due to several discrete investments and overhead, inflation in Venezuela and a modest increase in advertising. These items more than offset the mid single-digit increase in internal net sales growth and slightly lower upfront costs.
Internal operating profit declined 17% in Asia-Pacific in the quarter compared to a 9% increase in 2009. In the quarter, we invested heavily in advertising to support new product launches across the region.
Now let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss cash flow. Our year-to-date cash flow was $827 million, $151 million lower than last year, primarily as a result of lower-than-expected profits. 
Slide 11 displays our guidance for 2010. On October 21, we lowered our guidance for 2010. The third quarter was softer than we originally projected, and we expect the fourth quarter to be softer as well. For 2010, we expect internal net sales to be down approximately 1%, primarily driven by the continued competitive environment in U.S. Cereal and the challenging environment in Europe. We expect 2010 cost pressures to be approximately 5%, reflecting increased operating costs and lower operating leverage. As a result, gross margin will be flat to down slightly for the year. We expect approximately $0.13 of upfront costs, including costs associated with the implementation of SAP. We still expect to invest in advertising to support our brands at a mid single-digit growth rate for the year.
Our internal operating profit is expected to be approximately flat due to lower sales growth and higher cost pressures. Our guidance also includes the benefit of significantly lower incentive compensation costs. We expect full year interest expense to be approximately $250 million, and we estimate our tax rate to be approximately 29%.
We have historically targeted a 90% funding level for our pension plans. While asset returns have improved this year, lower interest rates have reduced our funding status. To return to our targeted funding levels, we plan to take advantage of the low interest rate environment and make a voluntary contribution of approximately $500 million net of tax to our benefit plans before the end of the year. This contribution will also significantly reduce the need for required contributions for the foreseeable future. While the contribution provides a positive P&L benefit for 2011, our net benefits expense is still estimated to increase next year.
Year-to-date, we have purchased $907 million in shares, and we expect that we will reduce average shares outstanding by approximately 2% for the year. Given our current business outlook, cash flow is expected to be in the $950 million to $1 billion range before the net $500 million voluntary benefit plan contribution. Capital spending is expected to be approximately $470 million for the year, slightly lower than our previous guidance. We expect our currency neutral earnings per share growth to be in the 4% to 5% range. This includes slight improvements in average shares outstanding and our tax rate. Since our guidance is on a currency neutral basis, each quarter, we provide an estimate of the foreign exchange impact on our full year earnings per share.
Slide 12 shows our key currencies with 2009 actual rates and current spot rates as of October 26, 2010. Based on these spot rates, we estimate full year 2010 foreign exchange to have a $0.02 unfavorable impact to our reported earnings per share.
Now let's turn to Slide 13 to discuss our outlook for 2011. We recognize that 2011 will be a year of regaining our momentum to put us back on the path of sustainable growth. As a result, we developed a realistic outlook for the year. We expect internal net sales to grow low single digits. Based on our growth algorithm and estimated cost inflation, the company's sales growth is estimated to be more price driven with some contribution from mix. We expected volume may be flat to down slightly. Internal operating profit is expected to be flat to down 2% or down slightly. 
Let me explain our operating profit outlook in more detail. As previously discussed, we have a significant headwind to re-establish our employee incentive compensation plans back to target levels. This adversely impacts 2011 operating profit growth by approximately six points.
On the positive side, we do expect operating profit to benefit approximately 2 points from lapping the hard costs of the Cereal recall. The net impact of these two items is a 4-point headwind. The continued rebuild of our Eggo business will contribute modestly to sales growth, but the impact to operating profit is not significant due to the reinstatement of marketing investments. We expect cost pressures to be approximately 6%. Our cost pressures are partially offset by approximately 4% from cost savings programs. We anticipate gross margin to be up slightly year-over-year and we are approximately 40% hedged on commodities for 2011. We anticipate $0.12 of upfront costs, including costs associated with the reimplementation of SAP, and we expect internal advertising to grow in line with sales. 
Below operating profit, interest expense is anticipated to be similar to 2010, approximately $250 million. And the full year tax rate is forecasted to be approximately 30%. We are planning to give 2011 cash flow guidance next quarter. However, we do expect cash flow to be greater than the $1 billion. We expect capital spending to be approximately 4% in 2011 at the high end of our 3% to 4% range. We plan to continue to execute a $2.5 billion three-year share repurchase authorization. Average shares outstanding are expected to decline by approximately 4% in 2011. We expect earnings per share to grow low single digits on a currency neutral basis. In terms of the foreign currency impact, the latest spot rates as shown on Slide 12 are estimated to benefit full year 2011 earnings per share by $0.08.
Now let me turn it over to John to discuss our North America and International business."

Internal net sales declined 3% in the third quarter and were down 2% year-to-date. The decline was primarily driven by Retail Cereal and a slower than expected recovery of our Eggo Waffle",1375,"Thanks, Ron. Slide 14 shows our top line results for North America. Internal net sales declined 3% in the third quarter and were down 2% year-to-date. The decline was primarily driven by Retail Cereal and a slower than expected recovery of our Eggo Waffle business. 
Turning first to North America Cereal. Internal net sales for the North American Retail Cereal business decreased by 6% in the third quarter. The decline in the third quarter can be explained in part by the following factors. 
First, the Cereal category remained soft in the quarter. We estimate that Cereal category sales were down approximately 3%. Our shipments were down 6% in line with our consumption. 
Second, roughly 75% of our decrease in consumption was due to the recall. The recall hit us at the worst possible time, as the three brands impacted by the recall, Froot Loops, Corn Pops and Apple Jacks, were the cornerstone of our back-to-school program. Following the recall, we tried to rework our promotional plans. However, compared to this, we're more aggressive than we expected. Our share declined by approximately one point in the third quarter, all of which was a result of the recall-impacted brands. And finally, as David mentioned in his opening remarks, we have also been adversely impacted by less support from non-measured channels in this year. 
The impact of the recall is masking some underlying strength in our business. The Special K franchise remains healthy, and recent second quarter innovation continues to perform well. 
FiberPlus and Cinnabon cereals, introduced at the end of June, gained 0.5 share points and 0.3 share points, respectively, during the third quarter. Kashi and BearNaked continued to gain strength with a 0.3-share-point gain driven by GOLEAN and BearNaked granola. 
Our Canadian business was another bright spot in the quarter. The Cereal category was up approximately 2%, and Kellogg grew 4%, resulting in a 1-point share gain. Driving this growth was the success of Mini-Wheats Mini Bites, which gained a share point in the quarter.
We are excited about our 2011 innovation calendar. We are leveraging proven ideas from around the world. Beginning in January, we planned to launch crunching up in the U.S. This brand is our second largest brand in the U.K. with nearly an 8 share of market. We will also launch a very successful Special K oats and honey line expansion, which is already achieved over a share point in the U.K. And we will continue to bring news to our Mini-Wheats franchise. This represents the strongest innovation pipeline for North America Cereal in the last five years. It also reflects our belief that the only sustainable way to grow the Cereal business is by exciting the consumer to innovation, health news and strong brand building.
Turning to Slide 16. You can see that North America Retail Snacks posted flat internal net sales growth for the third quarter and 2% growth year-to-date. On Slide 17, you can see that we achieved a broad-based growth across the Snacks portfolio with the exception of cookies. Pop-tarts are up in the quarter and continue to gain nearly a point in share despite lapping aggressive promotions a year ago. Brand building in the quarter included the excitement surrounding the opening of a Times Square store in New York City. 
Our stores [indiscernible] were up low single digit in the quarter. Our share gain of 0.2 points in the quarter was driven by strength in our Cheez-It, Wheatables and Town House brands. Town House Flatbread Crisps, launched in late June, continue to perform well. We are excited about our 2011 innovation, which includes Special K cracker chips. We believe healthier snacking alternatives will present a significant growth opportunity for the company.
The strong performance across our Snacks business was masked by a weaker performance in cookies in the quarter. This business has been adversely impacted by several retailers rationalizing a slowdown [ph]. We are starting to see a reverse in this trend as it has not helped the category. Also, while our cookie sales were down in the quarter, this was largely due to lower incremental sales. Our base sales were relatively flat. 
Our Wholesome  Snacks business continue to deliver solid results in the quarter, led by the strengths of Nutri-Grain bars, FiberPlus bars and Special K Fruit Crisps. We delivered mid- single-digit internal net sales growth and gained 0.4 share points. We are actively working to add capacity across our Wholesome Snacks portfolio to improve service levels, better supply the market and further accelerate our top line growth.
Our Frozen and Specialty business posted an overall decline of 5% in internal net sales for the quarter and a 6% decline year-to-date. Third quarter top line growth for North America Frozen reflected the slower than anticipated rebound of our Eggo business. Customers are not resetting their shares as quickly as we had expected, and the pace of consumers response is slower than projected. We are confident that the business will return to previous sales levels over time. We are accelerating our growth with an exciting innovation calendar of new products. Our recent introduction of Cinnabon pancakes continues to perform well, and we plan to launch Eggo thick and fluffy original and Cinnabon brand sugar waffles, as well as several SKUs of FiberPlus Eggo waffles in mid-December.
In addition, our Veggie Foods business performed well, and we have strong innovation programs for 2011, including two varieties of Morningstar biscuits. Our Food Away From Home business also grew modestly year-over-year.
Turning to our International business. Our total International internal net sales decreased 2% in the quarter against a 6% increase a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, International internal sales were flat, masking 0 growth of 2%. 
Snacks sales were down, largely driven by Russia and Venezuela. Our business in Europe continue to have good share performance despite an internal net sales decline of 5%. In the U.K., our consumption was down 5% against a tough 9% growth a year ago. Despite lower consumption, we held share in the category, which is suffering significant price discounting similar to the U.S. We have an exciting range of innovation in the U.K. for 2011, including Special K clusters and milk chocolate Krave, which will help drive the category. 
In France, our second largest European market, our consumption remains strong with solid share growth. However, in the third quarter, changes made by the trade resulted in a reduction of a week of inventory, which contributed to a 6% decline in net sales.
Similar to last quarter, Russia experienced strong growth in Cereal, up 38%. And Snacks, while improving, was still down over 20%. For 2011, we expect Europe internal net sales to grow modestly as the region remains a difficult operating environment. 
In Latin America, our top line increased 5% compared to a 9% increase a year ago. There were strong Cereal growth across the region with Cereal sales up 8%, mitigating a decline in the Snacks business. A decline in Snacks is largely driven by Venezuela, where we import products for Mexico and have been impacted by changes in exchange rates. 
Note also that in the quarter, our business in Puerto Rico was impacted by the U.S. Cereal recall, which dampened our growth. In August, we relaunched Special K in Mexico, Central America and Colombia. The Special K franchise is responding well in fruit food, price points and media support. For 2010 and 2011, we expect to deliver mid- single-digit internal net sales growth in Latin America driven by strong underlying Cereal growth.
Asia-Pacific delivered internal net sales growth of 2% with strong performance across Asia and South Africa. In Australia, we gained share behind the successful launch of Sultana Bran Buds, which achieved an excess of a share point in the quarter. For Asia-Pacific, we expect low to mid- single-digit internal sales growth in 2011, as we continue to see strong category growth across most of Asia and South Africa, offset by slower growth in Australia and Japan. On Slide 20, I'd like to make one final point. We expect 2011 to be one of our strongest innovation years ever with estimated net sales from innovation up at least 25% over 2010. 
Now let me turn it back to David."

But maybe you can elaborate a little bit on just in terms of when you think about the four buckets of the issues, is there one bucket or the other that may take a quicker in terms of course correcting? And then as you think about the milestones that we should monitor going forward, is it first just innovation really driving better top line improvement and then overtime, as some of these investments in the supply chain goes away and then you'll ultimately see margin expansion over time?"

And I think the learnings we and our trading partners have had across these will help both of us as we go through 2011. So I think that will be relatively fast. And then the deflationary environment, harder for us to truly predict what will happen there. But clearly, with inflation coming back fairly significantly as we speak, we do expect that we will see a fair amount of a net price realization, 200 to 300 basis points. So most of these are we're already working on or have in play. We'll start in 2011. Some will take us time through 2011 to fully complete."

We're confident that we can regai",876,"Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. 2010 has been a difficult, disappointing year for the company. I know there are many questions about what has happened to Kellogg and why and when we expect better performance. We're confident that we can regain momentum as a company, and this confidence comes from an understanding of what has happened in our business over the last two years and a conviction that we're well positioned for the future. To understand our confidence in this future, it is first necessary to recognize what has taken us off course in 2010. And there are four major issues. 
First, we've had significant issues in our supply chain. We've weathered the two largest recalls in our history during the past two years. We've also been impacted by production challenges in our Eggo facility. We have a long-standing commitment to food quality, and the recent voluntary recalls have demonstrated our commitment to putting consumers first. We've taken steps in our supply chain to mitigate similar potential risks. This includes additional operating expense across 2010 and 2011 as well as slightly elevated levels of capital spending in 2011 and 2012. 
It is difficult to quantify the true impact of these supply disruptions. There are the clearly defined costs associated with the recourse and the softer costs associated with lost sales. To put the impact of these issues into context, we estimate that the various supply disruptions adversely impacted operating expense by $200 million to $300 million over the last two years and impacted capital expenditures by $150 million to $200 million for a total impact approaching $0.5 billion. In addition, there's also the organizational impact of focusing large numbers of internal resources on proactively identifying and resolving issues to mitigate risks going forward.
I believe that these supply disruptions clearly distinguish the last two years from the preceding eight years. Second, we've had significantly less innovation during 2009 and 2010. As we entered the recession, we pulled back on innovation and drove increased renovation across the portfolio, such as adding fiber to our kid cereals. The renovation has set up our portfolio for the future but did not drive short-term sales performance. The lower level of innovation, combined with these key [ph] rationalization has weighed all our top line growth. 
It's always difficult to quantify the impact of reduced innovation. But as a guide, we launched about $800 million worth of innovation in 2008. In 2009 and 2010, our innovation was roughly 25% lower than in 2008. The good news is that we are moving forward into 2011 with a weight of innovation that is going to increase significantly. 
Third, we have some tough comparisons in 2010, both in the overall strong 2009 Cereal category growth globally and in the non-major channels. In 2009, we had abnormally high growth from the non-major channels, as we work closely with some large customers in that group. However, in 2010, I compare this picked up more of the activity that we had enjoyed in 2009. 
To give you a sense of the impact, we estimate that this has resulted in an approximate 2-point drag on our top line in U.S. Cereal business. I think the last two years have reinforced several key truths regarding the U.S. Cereal category. For most retailers to do well in the category, the key branded players need to excite consumers. And most importantly, the category is driven by health news, innovation and brand building. Promotional activity has not proven to grow the category over time. 
Fourth and finally, deflation has been an issue at our core Cereal categories around the world. Managing through this deflationary cycle has been much more difficult than we had anticipated.
Heading into 2011, we anticipate cost inflation at much greater levels than in 2010. Historically, retailers have accepted price increases to offset cost inflation of this magnitude, and we believe that a combination of pricing, mix and trade spend could yield 200 to 300 basis points of net price realizations for 2011. 
It is also worth stating what has not impacted Kellogg in 2010. One thing we have not done is cut back on brand building. Instead, we've continued to invest back into our brands at industry-leading levels.
So there are several specific issues, which differentiate 2010 from the prior eight years. As we head into 2011, we're confident that we can succeed by playing our game, continuing to invest in brand building and driving sustainable innovation in the marketplace. Despite our long-term confidence, we need to remain pragmatic. It will take time, focus and effort to regain our momentum. We will stabilize our supply chain and mitigate the risks of future disruption. We will ramp up our innovation. We will keep our people focused on the key drivers of our business, and we will add value back into our categories. We believe that we can achieve all of this, but it will not be done overnight. It is not as simple as lapping soft comparisons. Hence, we're providing realistic guidance to 2011 to enable us to regain momentum and get back on track with our long-term sustainable growth model.
Now let me turn it over to Ron and John to discuss 2010 and 2011 in more detail."
283356,98349801,84396,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 summarizes our third quarter and year-to-date financial results. For the quarter, net sales declined 4% on a reported basis and 2% on an internal basis. The key contributor to the decline was softness in",1614,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 summarizes our third quarter and year-to-date financial results. For the quarter, net sales declined 4% on a reported basis and 2% on an internal basis. The key contributor to the decline was softness in our U.S. Cereal business, including continued aggressive competitive price discounting and the impact from the Cereal recall. In addition, the challenging economic environment in Europe, combined with difficult year-over-year comparisons and a deflationary category in the U.K., contributed to third quarter sales decline.
Operating profit declined 5% on a reported basis and 3% on an internal basis. Lower net sales, increased advertising investment and a decrease in operating leverage due to reduced volume in our manufacturing plants, as well as increased costs, contributed to the decline. These items were offset by a significant reduction in our estimated 2010 incentive compensation expense. I'll discuss this in more detail along with the implications for 2011 shortly.
Earnings per share declined 4% on a reported basis and 2% on a currency neutral basis. Earnings per share benefited from lower average shares outstanding due to our share repurchases. 
Slide 6 highlights the components of our net sales performance. Third quarter reported net sales fell 3.6%. Internal net sales declined 2.5% driven by lower volume. The 3.4% decline in volume was partially attributable to the U.S. Cereal business, including the impact of the Cereal recall and in Europe due primarily to the Russia's Snacks business. 
Partially offsetting the volume decline, price and mix improved by 0.9 points, primarily as a result of better mix in our U.S. Snacks business and pricing in Latin America. Currency adversely impacted net sales by 1.1 points.
Now let me turn to Slide 7 to discuss gross profit. Gross profit declined by 5% on a reported basis in the third quarter and 4% on an internal basis. Internal gross margin contracted by 50 basis points to 43.4%. Higher commodity costs and lower operating leverage were the primary contributors to the margin decline.
Slide 8 shows our trend in advertising investment during 2010. As planned, we continue to invest behind our brands in the third quarter. Our internal advertising expenditures increased 9%, primarily driven by U.S. Cereal and Snacks, but we also invested behind new product launches in Asia-Pacific and the relaunch of Special K in Latin America. 
Slide 9 shows our internal operating profit growth by area. Third quarter internal operating profit decreased by 3% against a strong 11% increase last year. We had expected stronger performance as we progress through the back half, but our business has been softer than planned. As a result, we adjusted our incentive compensation costs sharply downward versus target. We estimate that the benefit was approximately 10 points in the third quarter and includes adjustments for our first-half accruals.
For the full year, incentive compensation costs will be reduced significantly, so restoring them back to target levels in 2011 will create a significant headwind. In North America, internal operating profit declined 3% against a strong 10% increase a year ago. Lower sales, as a result of increased promotional pricing activity in the Cereal category, the impact of the Cereal recall and a slower rebound in the Eggo business drove the decline. In addition, higher supply chain costs and increased advertising contributed to the decrease. Lower upfront and incentive compensation costs partially offset the decline.
Europe's internal operating profit grew by 2% against the 7% growth a year earlier. A mid- single-digit decline in net sales was more than offset by cost of goods savings, lower overhead expenses due to incentive compensation costs and a reduction in upfront costs.
In Latin America, internal operating profit declined 18% as a result of increased commodity costs, and in Mexico, incremental operating and distribution costs. In addition, SG&A expenses were higher due to several discrete investments and overhead, inflation in Venezuela and a modest increase in advertising. These items more than offset the mid- single-digit increase in internal net sales growth and slightly lower upfront costs.
Internal operating profit declined 17% in Asia-Pacific in the quarter compared to a 9% increase in 2009. In the quarter, we invested heavily in advertising to support new product launches across the region.
Now let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss cash flow. Our year-to-date cash flow was $827 million, $151 million lower than last year, primarily as a result of lower-than-expected profits. 
Slide 11 displays our guidance for 2010. On October 21, we lowered our guidance for 2010. The third quarter was softer than we originally projected, and we expect the fourth quarter to be softer as well. For 2010, we expect internal net sales to be down approximately 1%, primarily driven by the continued competitive environment in U.S. Cereal and the challenging environment in Europe. We expect 2010 cost pressures to be approximately 5%, reflecting increased operating costs and lower operating leverage. As a result, gross margin will be flat to down slightly for the year. We expect approximately $0.13 of upfront costs, including costs associated with the implementation of SAP. We still expect to invest in advertising to support our brands at a mid- single-digit growth rate for the year.
Our internal operating profit is expected to be approximately flat due to lower sales growth and higher cost pressures. Our guidance also includes the benefit of significantly lower incentive compensation costs. We expect full year interest expense to be approximately $250 million, and we estimate our tax rate to be approximately 29%.
We have historically targeted a 90% funding level for our pension plans. While asset returns have improved this year, lower interest rates have reduced our funding status. To return to our targeted funding levels, we plan to take advantage of the low interest rate environment and make a voluntary contribution of approximately $500 million net of tax to our benefit plans before the end of the year. This contribution will also significantly reduce the need for required contributions for the foreseeable future. While the contribution provides a positive P&L benefit for 2011, our net benefits expense is still estimated to increase next year.
Year-to-date, we have purchased $907 million in shares, and we expect that we will reduce average shares outstanding by approximately 2% for the year. Given our current business outlook, cash flow is expected to be in the $950 million to $1 billion range before the net $500 million voluntary benefit plan contribution. Capital spending is expected to be approximately $470 million for the year, slightly lower than our previous guidance. We expect our currency neutral earnings per share growth to be in the 4% to 5% range. This includes slight improvements in average shares outstanding and our tax rate. Since our guidance is on a currency neutral basis, each quarter, we provide an estimate of the foreign exchange impact on our full year earnings per share.
Slide 12 shows our key currencies with 2009 actual rates and current spot rates as of October 26, 2010. Based on these spot rates, we estimate full year 2010 foreign exchange to have a $0.02 unfavorable impact to our reported earnings per share.
Now let's turn to Slide 13 to discuss our outlook for 2011. We recognize that 2011 will be a year of regaining our momentum to put us back on the path of sustainable growth. As a result, we developed a realistic outlook for the year. We expect internal net sales to grow low single digits. Based on our growth algorithm and estimated cost inflation, the company's sales growth is estimated to be more price driven with some contribution from mix. We expect the volume may be flat to down slightly. Internal operating profit is expected to be flat to down 2% or down slightly. 
Let me explain our operating profit outlook in more detail. As previously discussed, we have a significant headwind to re-establish our employee incentive compensation plans back to target levels. This adversely impacts 2011 operating profit growth by approximately six points.
On the positive side, we do expect operating profit to benefit approximately 2 points from lapping the hard costs of the Cereal recall. The net impact of these two items is a 4-point headwind. The continued rebuild of our Eggo business will contribute modestly to sales growth, but the impact to operating profit is not significant due to the reinstatement of marketing investments. We expect cost pressures to be approximately 6%. Our cost pressures are partially offset by approximately 4% from cost savings programs. We anticipate gross margin to be up slightly year-over-year and we are approximately 40% hedged on commodities for 2011. We anticipate $0.12 of upfront costs, including costs associated with the reimplementation of SAP, and we expect internal advertising to grow in line with sales. 
Below operating profit, interest expense is anticipated to be similar to 2010, approximately $250 million. And the full year tax rate is forecasted to be approximately 30%. We are planning to give 2011 cash flow guidance next quarter. However, we do expect cash flow to be greater than the $1 billion. We expect capital spending to be approximately 4% in 2011 at the high end of our 3% to 4% range. We plan to continue to execute a $2.5 billion three-year share repurchase authorization. Average shares outstanding are expected to decline by approximately 4% in 2011. We expect earnings per share to grow low single digits on a currency neutral basis. In terms of the foreign currency impact, the latest spot rates as shown on Slide 12 are estimated to benefit full year 2011 earnings per share by $0.08.
Now let me turn it over to John to discuss our North America and International business."

Internal net sales declined 3% in the third quarter and were down 2% year-to-date. The decline was primarily driven by Retail Cereal and a slower than expected recovery of our Eggo Waffle",1377,"Thanks, Ron. Slide 14 shows our top line results for North America. Internal net sales declined 3% in the third quarter and were down 2% year-to-date. The decline was primarily driven by Retail Cereal and a slower than expected recovery of our Eggo Waffle business. 
Turning first to North America Cereal. Internal net sales for the North American Retail Cereal business decreased by 6% in the third quarter. The decline in the third quarter can be explained in part by the following factors. 
First, the Cereal category remained soft in the quarter. We estimate that Cereal category sales were down approximately 3%. Our shipments were down 6% in line with our consumption. 
Second, roughly 75% of our decrease in consumption was due to the recall. The recall hit us at the worst possible time, as the three brands impacted by the recall, Froot Loops, Corn Pops and Apple Jacks, were the cornerstone of our back-to-school program. Following the recall, we tried to rework our promotional plans. However, compared to this, we're more aggressive than we expected. Our share declined by approximately one point in the third quarter, all of which was a result of the recall-impacted brands. And finally, as David mentioned in his opening remarks, we have also been adversely impacted by less support from non-measured channels in this year. 
The impact of the recall is masking some underlying strength in our business. The Special K franchise remains healthy, and recent second quarter innovation continues to perform well. 
FiberPlus and Cinnabon cereals, introduced at the end of June, gained 0.5 share points and 0.3 share points, respectively, during the third quarter. Kashi and BearNaked continued to gain strength with a 0.3-share-point gain driven by GOLEAN and BearNaked granola. 
Our Canadian business was another bright spot in the quarter. The Cereal category was up approximately 2%, and Kellogg grew 4%, resulting in a 1-point share gain. Driving this growth was the success of Mini-Wheats Mini Bites, which gained a share point in the quarter.
We are excited about our 2011 innovation calendar. We are leveraging proven ideas from around the world. Beginning in January, we planned to launch Crunching Up in the U.S. This brand is our second largest brand in the U.K. with nearly an 8 share of market. We will also launch a very successful Special K oats and honey line expansion, which is already achieved over a share point in the U.K. And we will continue to bring news to our Mini-Wheats franchise. This represents the strongest innovation pipeline for North America Cereal in the last five years. It also reflects our belief that the only sustainable way to grow the Cereal business is by exciting the consumer through innovation, health news and strong brand building.
Turning to Slide 16. You can see that North America Retail Snacks posted flat internal net sales growth for the third quarter and 2% growth year-to-date. On Slide 17, you can see that we achieved a broad-based growth across the Snacks portfolio with the exception of cookies. Pop-tarts are up in the quarter and continue to gain nearly a point in share despite lapping aggressive promotions a year ago. Brand building in the quarter included the excitement surrounding the opening of a Times Square store in New York City. 
Our store [indiscernible] cracker sales were up low single digits in the quarter. Our share gain of 0.2 points in the quarter was driven by strength in our Cheez-It, Wheatables and Town House brands. Town House Flatbread Crisps, launched in late June, continue to perform well. We are excited about our 2011 innovation, which includes Special K cracker chips. We believe healthier snacking alternatives will present a significant growth opportunity for the company.
The strong performance across our Snacks business was masked by a weaker performance in cookies in the quarter. This business has been adversely impacted by several retailers rationalizing a slowdown [ph]. We are starting to see a reverse in this trend as it has not helped the category. Also, while our cookie sales were down in the quarter, this was largely due to lower incremental sales. Our base sales were relatively flat. 
Our Wholesome Snacks business continue to deliver solid results in the quarter, led by the strengths of Nutri-Grain bars, FiberPlus bars and Special K Fruit Crisps. We delivered mid- single-digit internal net sales growth and gained 0.4 share points. We are actively working to add capacity across our Wholesome Snacks portfolio to improve service levels, better supply the market and further accelerate our top line growth.
Our Frozen and Specialty business posted an overall decline of 5% in internal net sales for the quarter and a 6% decline year-to-date. Third quarter top line growth for North America Frozen reflected the slower than anticipated rebound of our Eggo business. Customers are not resetting their shelves as quickly as we had expected, and the pace of consumers’ response is slower than projected. We are confident that the business will return to previous sales levels over time. We are accelerating our growth with an exciting innovation calendar of new products. Our recent introduction of Cinnabon pancakes continues to perform well, and we plan to launch Eggo thick and fluffy original and Cinnabon brand sugar waffles, as well as several SKUs of FiberPlus Eggo waffles in mid-December.
In addition, our Veggie Foods business performed well, and we have strong innovation programs for 2011, including two varieties of Morningstar biscuits. Our Food Away From Home business also grew modestly year-over-year.
Turning to our International business. Our total International internal net sales decreased 2% in the quarter against a 6% increase a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, International internal sales were flat, masking 0 growth of 2%. 
Snacks sales were down, largely driven by Russia and Venezuela. Our business in Europe continue to have good share performance despite an internal net sales decline of 5%. In the U.K., our consumption was down 5% against a tough 9% growth a year ago. Despite lower consumption, we held share in the category, which is suffering significant price discounting similar to the U.S. We have an exciting range of innovation in the U.K. for 2011, including Special K clusters and milk chocolate Krave, which will help drive the category. 
In France, our second largest European market, our consumption remains strong with solid share growth. However, in the third quarter, changes made by the trade resulted in a reduction of a week of inventory, which contributed to a 6% decline in net sales.
Similar to last quarter, Russia experienced strong growth in Cereal, up 38%. And Snacks, while improving, was still down over 20%. For 2011, we expect Europe internal net sales to grow modestly as the region remains a difficult operating environment. 
In Latin America, our top line increased 5% compared to a 9% increase a year ago. There were strong Cereal growth across the region with Cereal sales up 8%, mitigating a decline in the Snacks business. A decline in Snacks is largely driven by Venezuela, where we import products from Mexico and have been impacted by changes in exchange rates. 
Note also that in the quarter, our business in Puerto Rico was impacted by the U.S. Cereal recall, which dampened our growth. In August, we relaunched Special K in Mexico, Central America and Colombia. The Special K franchise is responding well improved [ph] food, price points and media support. For 2010 and 2011, we expect to deliver mid- single-digit internal net sales growth in Latin America driven by strong underlying Cereal growth.
Asia-Pacific delivered internal net sales growth of 2% with strong performance across Asia and South Africa. In Australia, we gained share behind the successful launch of Sultana Bran Buds, which achieved an excess of a share point in the quarter. For Asia-Pacific, we expect low to mid- single-digit internal sales growth in 2011, as we continue to see strong category growth across most of Asia and South Africa, offset by slower growth in Australia and Japan. On Slide 20, I'd like to make one final point. We expect 2011 to be one of our strongest innovation years ever with estimated net sales from innovation up at least 25% over 2010. 
Now let me turn it back to David."

And I think the learnings we and our trading partners have had across these will help both of us as we go through 2011. So I think that will be relatively fast. And then the deflationary environment, harder for us to truly predict what will happen there. But clearly, with inflation coming back fairly significantly as we speak, we do expect that we will see a fair amount of a net price realization, 200 to 300 basis points. So most of these are we're already working on or have in play. We'll start in 2011. Some will take us time through 2011 to fully complete."

So if you have so much innovation coming, you would expect all things being equal with essentially just a base volume or just a stare volume base that the volume should still just be growing. Are there other products that will be coming off? I mean, is there a continued SKU rationalization? Or are there lower margin products that are being cut as you add the new products?"

As we did the same thing and we've looked at what's going on in the marketplace in that category specifically, as we've discussed with our trading partners, there has clearly been too much of a pullback, not only by Kellogg, but by many companies on innovation.

Same is true on Eggo. We anticipated customers' shop resets [ph] to be complete through Q3. Some of that's gone into Q4, but it's progressing well. Consumers are coming back a little more slowly. And part of that is because in many instances, the number of SKUs and the availability is, in fact, to where we'd like it to be. So you add those two things together.

If I look at the top line drivers, the Cereal business in Latin America was actually quite strong in the quarter of 8%.

So that outlying Cereal business is doing well. That's why we have confidence in mid- single-digit growth this year and mid- single-digit growth next year.

We're confident that we can rega",875," Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. 2010 has been a difficult, disappointing year for the company. By now there are many questions about what has happened to Kellogg and why and when we expect better performance. We're confident that we can regain momentum as a company, and this confidence comes from an understanding of what has happened in our business over the last two years and a conviction that we're well positioned for the future. To understand our confidence in this future, it is first necessary to recognize what has taken us off course in 2010. And there are four major issues.
 First, we've had significant issues in our supply chain. We've weathered the two largest recalls in our history during the past two years. We've also been impacted by production challenges in our Eggo facility. We have a long-standing commitment to food quality, and the recent voluntary recalls have demonstrated our commitment to putting consumers first. We've taken steps in our supply chain to mitigate similar potential risks. This includes additional operating expense across 2010 and 2011 as well as slightly elevated levels of capital spending in 2011 and 2012.
 It is difficult to quantify the true impact of these supply disruptions. There are clearly defined costs associated with the recourse and the softer costs associated with lost sales. To put the impact of these issues into context, we estimate that the various supply disruptions adversely impacted operating expense by $200 million to $300 million over the last two years and impacted capital expenditures by $150 million to $200 million for a total impact approaching $0.5 billion. In addition, there's also the organizational impact of focusing large numbers of internal resources on proactively identifying and resolving issues to mitigate risks going forward.
 I believe that these supply disruptions clearly distinguish the last two years from the preceding eight years. Second, we've had significantly less innovation during 2009 and 2010. As we enter the recession, we pull back on innovation and drive increased renovation across the portfolio, such as adding fiber to our kid cereals. The renovation has set up our portfolio for the future but did not drive short-term sales performance. The lower level of innovation, combined with these key [ph] rationalization has weighed all our top line growth.
 It's always difficult to quantify the impact of reduced innovation. But as a guide, we launched about $800 million worth of innovation in 2008. In 2009 and 2010, our innovation was roughly 25% lower than in 2008. The good news is that we are moving forward into 2011 with a wide of innovation that is going to increase significantly.
 Third, we have some tough comparisons in 2010, both in the overall strong 2009 Cereal category growth globally and in the non-major channel. In 2009, we had abnormally high growth from the non-major channels, as we work closely with some large customers in that group. However, in 2010, I compare this picked up more of the activity that we had enjoyed in 2009.
 To give you a sense of the impact, we estimate that this has resulted in an approximate 2-point drag on our top line in U.S. Cereal business. I think the last two years have reinforced several key truths regarding the U.S. Cereal category. For most retailers to do well in the category, the key branded players need to excite consumers. And most importantly, the category is driven by health news, innovation and brand building. Promotional activity has not proven to grow the category over time.
 Fourth and finally, deflation has been an issue at our core Cereal categories around the world. Managing through this deflationary cycle has been much more difficult than we had anticipated.
 Heading into 2011, we anticipate cost inflation at much greater levels than in 2010. Historically, retailers have accepted price increases to offset cost inflation of this magnitude, and we believe that a combination of pricing, mix and trade spend could yield 200 to 300 basis points of net price realizations for 2011.
 It is also worth stating what has not impacted Kellogg in 2010. One thing we have not done is cut back on brand building. Instead, we've continued to invest back into our brands as industry-leading levels.
 So there are several specific issues, which differentiate 2010 from the prior eight years. As we head into 2011, we're confident that we can succeed by playing our game, continuing to invest in brand building and driving sustainable innovation in the marketplace. Despite our long-term confidence, we need to remain pragmatic. It will take time, focus and effort to regain our momentum. We will stabilize our supply chain and mitigate the risks of future disruption. We will ramp up our innovation. We will keep our people focused on the key drivers of our business, and we will add value back into our categories. We believe that we can achieve all of this, but it will not be done overnight. It is not as simple as lapping soft comparisons. Hence, we're providing realistic guidance to 2011 to enable us to regain momentum and get back on track with our long-term sustainable growth model.
 Now let me turn it over to Ron and John to discuss 2010 and 2011 in more detail.

Slide 5 summarizes our third quarter and year-to-date financial results. For the quarter, net sales declined 4% on a reported basis and 2% on an internal basis. The key contributor to the decline was softness in",1613," Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 summarizes our third quarter and year-to-date financial results. For the quarter, net sales declined 4% on a reported basis and 2% on an internal basis. The key contributor to the decline was softness in our U.S. Cereal business, including continued aggressive competitive price discounting and the impact from the Cereal recall. In addition, the challenging economic environment in Europe, combined with difficult year-over-year comparisons and a deflationary category in the U.K., contributed to third quarter sales decline.
 Operating profit declined 5% on a reported basis and 3% on an internal basis. Lower net sales, increased advertising investment and a decrease in operating leverage due to reduced volume in our manufacturing plants, as well as increased costs, contributed to the decline. These items were offset by a significant reduction in our estimated 2010 incentive compensation expense. I'll discuss this in more detail along with the implications for 2011 shortly.
 Earnings per share declined 4% on a reported basis and 2% on a currency neutral basis. Earnings per share benefited from lower average shares outstanding due to our share repurchases.
 Slide 6 highlights the components of our net sales performance. Third quarter reported net sales fell 3.6%. Internal net sales declined 2.5% driven by lower volume. The 3.4% decline in volume was partially attributable to the U.S. Cereal business, including the impact of the Cereal recall and in Europe due primarily to the Russia's Snacks business.
 Partially offsetting the volume decline, price and mix improved by 0.9 points, primarily as a result of better mix in our U.S. Snacks business and pricing in Latin America. Currency adversely impacted net sales by 1.1 points.
 Now let me turn to Slide 7 to discuss gross profit. Gross profit declined by 5% on a reported basis in the third quarter and 4% on an internal basis. Internal gross margin contracted by 50 basis points to 43.4%. Higher commodity costs and lower operating leverage were the primary contributors to the margin decline.
 Slide 8 shows our trend in advertising investment during 2010. As planned, we continue to invest behind our brands in the third quarter. Our internal advertising expenditures increased 9%, primarily driven by U.S. Cereal and Snacks, but we also invested behind new product launches in Asia-Pacific and the relaunch of Special K in Latin America.
 Slide 9 shows our internal operating profit growth by area. Third quarter internal operating profit decreased by 3% against a strong 11% increase last year. We had expected stronger performance as we progress through the back half, but our business has been softer than planned. As a result, we adjusted our incentive compensation costs sharply downward versus target. We estimate that the benefit was approximately 10 points in the third quarter and includes adjustments for our first-half accruals.
 For the full year, incentive compensation costs will be reduced significantly, so restoring them back to target levels in 2011 will create a significant headwind. In North America, internal operating profit declined 3% against the strong 10% increase a year ago. Lower sales, as a result of increased promotional pricing activity in the Cereal category, the impact of the Cereal recall and a slower rebound in the Eggo business drove the decline. In addition, higher supply chain costs and increased advertising contributed to the decrease. Lower upfront and incentive compensation costs partially offset the decline.
 Europe's internal operating profit grew by 2% against the 7% growth a year earlier. A mid- single-digit decline in net sales was more than offset by cost of goods savings, lower overhead expenses due to incentive compensation costs and a reduction in upfront costs.
 In Latin America, internal operating profit declined 18% as a result of increased commodity costs, and in Mexico, incremental operating and distribution costs. In addition, SG&A expenses were higher due to several discrete investments and overhead, inflation in Venezuela and a modest increase in advertising. These items more than offset the mid single-digit increase in internal net sales growth and slightly lower upfront costs.
 Internal operating profit declined 17% in Asia-Pacific in the quarter compared to a 9% increase in 2009. In the quarter, we invested heavily in advertising to support new product launches across the region.
 Now let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss cash flow. Our year-to-date cash flow was $827 million, $151 million lower than last year, primarily as a result of lower-than-expected profits.
 Slide 11 displays our guidance for 2010. On October 21, we lowered our guidance for 2010. The third quarter was softer than we originally projected, and we expect the fourth quarter to be softer as well. For 2010, we expect internal net sales to be down approximately 1%, primarily driven by the continued competitive environment in U.S. Cereal and the challenging environment in Europe. We expect 2010 cost pressures to be approximately 5%, reflecting increased operating costs and lower operating leverage. As a result, gross margin will be flat to down slightly for the year. We expect approximately $0.13 of upfront costs, including costs associated with the implementation of SAP. We still expect to invest in advertising to support our brands at a mid single-digit growth rate for the year.
 Our internal operating profit is expected to be approximately flat due to lower sales growth and higher cost pressures. Our guidance also includes the benefit of significantly lower incentive compensation costs. We expect full year interest expense to be approximately $250 million, and we estimate our tax rate to be approximately 29%.
 We have historically targeted a 90% funding level for our pension plans. While asset returns have improved this year, lower interest rates have reduced our funding status. To return to our targeted funding levels, we plan to take advantage of the low interest rate environment and make a voluntary contribution of approximately $500 million net of tax to our benefit plans before the end of the year. This contribution will also significantly reduce the need for required contributions for the foreseeable future. While the contribution provides a positive P&L benefit for 2011, our net benefits expense is still estimated to increase next year.
 Year-to-date, we have purchased $907 million in shares, and we expect that we will reduce average shares outstanding by approximately 2% for the year. Given our current business outlook, cash flow is expected to be in the $950 million to $1 billion range before the net $500 million voluntary benefit plan contribution. Capital spending is expected to be approximately $470 million for the year, slightly lower than our previous guidance. We expect our currency neutral earnings per share growth to be in the 4% to 5% range. This includes slight improvements in average shares outstanding and our tax rate. Since our guidance is on a currency neutral basis, each quarter, we provide an estimate of the foreign exchange impact on our full year earnings per share.
 Slide 12 shows our key currencies with 2009 actual rates and current spot rates as of October 26, 2010. Based on these spot rates, we estimate full year 2010 foreign exchange to have a $0.02 unfavorable impact to our reported earnings per share.
 Now let's turn to Slide 13 to discuss our outlook for 2011. We recognize that 2011 will be a year of regaining our momentum to put us back on the path of sustainable growth. As a result, we developed a realistic outlook for the year. We expect internal net sales to grow low single digits. Based on our growth algorithm and estimated cost inflation, the company's sales growth is estimated to be more price driven with some contribution from mix. We expected volume may be flat to down slightly. Internal operating profit is expected to be flat to down 2% or down slightly.
 Let me explain our operating profit outlook in more detail. As previously discussed, we have a significant headwind to re-establish our employee incentive compensation plans back to target levels. This adversely impacts 2011 operating profit growth by approximately six points.
 On the positive side, we do expect operating profit to benefit approximately 2 points from lapping the hard costs of the Cereal recall. The net impact of these two items is a 4-point headwind. The continued rebuild of our Eggo business will contribute modestly to sales growth, but the impact to operating profit is not significant due to the reinstatement of marketing investments. We expect cost pressures to be approximately 6%. Our cost pressures are partially offset by approximately 4% from cost savings programs. We anticipate gross margin to be up slightly year-over-year and we are approximately 40% hedged on commodities for 2011. We anticipate $0.12 of upfront costs, including costs associated with the reimplementation of SAP, and we expect internal advertising to grow in line with sales.
 Below operating profit, interest expense is anticipated to be similar to 2010, approximately $250 million. And the full year tax rate is forecasted to be approximately 30%. We are planning to give 2011 cash flow guidance next quarter. However, we do expect cash flow to be greater than the $1 billion. We expect capital spending to be approximately 4% in 2011 at the high end of our 3% to 4% range. We plan to continue to execute a $2.5 billion three-year share repurchase authorization. Average shares outstanding are expected to decline by approximately 4% in 2011. We expect earnings per share to grow low single digits on a currency neutral basis. In terms of the foreign currency impact, the latest spot rates as shown on Slide 12 are estimated to benefit full year 2011 earnings per share by $0.08.
 Now let me turn it over to John to discuss our North America and International business.
"
283356,98349801,86582,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives"," Thanks, Ron. Slide 14 shows our top line results for North America. Internal net sales declined 3% in the third quarter and were down 2% year-to-date. The decline was primarily driven by Retail Cereal and a slower than expected recovery of our Eggo Waffl",1375," Thanks, Ron. Slide 14 shows our top line results for North America. Internal net sales declined 3% in the third quarter and were down 2% year-to-date. The decline was primarily driven by Retail Cereal and a slower than expected recovery of our Eggo Waffle business.
 Turning first to North America Cereal. Internal net sales for the North American Retail Cereal business decreased by 6% in the third quarter. The decline in the third quarter can be explained in part by the following factors.
 First, the Cereal category remained soft in the quarter. We estimate that Cereal category sales were down approximately 3%. Our shipments were down 6% in line with our consumption.
 Second, roughly 75% of our decrease in consumption was due to the recall. The recall hit us at the worst possible time, as the three brands impacted by the recall, Froot Loops, Corn Pops and Apple Jacks, were the cornerstone of our back-to-school program. Following the recall, we tried to rework our promotional plans. However, compared to this, we're more aggressive than we expected. Our share declined by approximately one point in the third quarter, all of which was a result of the recall-impacted brands. And finally, as David mentioned in his opening remarks, we have also been adversely impacted by less support from non-measured channels in this year.
 The impact of the recall is masking some underlying strength in our business. The Special K franchise remains healthy, and recent second quarter innovation continues to perform well.
 FiberPlus and Cinnabon cereals, introduced at the end of June, gained 0.5 share points and 0.3 share points, respectively, during the third quarter. Kashi and BearNaked continued to gain strength with a 0.3-share-point gain driven by GOLEAN and BearNaked granola.
 Our Canadian business was another bright spot in the quarter. The Cereal category was up approximately 2%, and Kellogg grew 4%, resulting in a 1-point share gain. Driving this growth was the success of Mini-Wheats Mini Bites, which gained a share point in the quarter.
 We are excited about our 2011 innovation calendar. We are leveraging proven ideas from around the world. Beginning in January, we planned to launch crunching up in the U.S. This brand is our second largest brand in the U.K. with nearly an 8 share of market. We will also launch a very successful Special K oats and honey line expansion, which is already achieved over a share point in the U.K. And we will continue to bring news to our Mini-Wheats franchise. This represents the strongest innovation pipeline for North America Cereal in the last five years. It also reflects our belief that the only sustainable way to grow the Cereal business is by exciting the consumer to innovation, health news and strong brand building.
 Turning to Slide 16. You can see that North America Retail Snacks posted flat internal net sales growth for the third quarter and 2% growth year-to-date. On Slide 17, you can see that we achieved a broad-based growth across the Snacks portfolio with the exception of cookies. Pop-tarts are up in the quarter and continue to gain nearly a point in share despite lapping aggressive promotions a year ago. Brand building in the quarter included the excitement surrounding the opening of a Times Square store in New York City.
 Our stores [indiscernible] were up low single digit in the quarter. Our share gain of 0.2 points in the quarter was driven by strength in our Cheez-It, Wheatables and Town House brands. Town House Flatbread Crisps, launched in late June, continue to perform well. We are excited about our 2011 innovation, which includes Special K cracker chips. We believe healthier snacking alternatives will present a significant growth opportunity for the company.
 The strong performance across our Snacks business was masked by a weaker performance in cookies in the quarter. This business has been adversely impacted by several retailers rationalizing a slowdown [ph]. We are starting to see a reverse in this trend as it has not helped the category. Also, while our cookie sales were down in the quarter, this was largely due to lower incremental sales. Our base sales were relatively flat.
 Our Wholesome  Snacks business continue to deliver solid results in the quarter, led by the strengths of Nutri-Grain bars, FiberPlus bars and Special K Fruit Crisps. We delivered mid- single-digit internal net sales growth and gained 0.4 share points. We are actively working to add capacity across our Wholesome Snacks portfolio to improve service levels, better supply the market and further accelerate our top line growth.
 Our Frozen and Specialty business posted an overall decline of 5% in internal net sales for the quarter and a 6% decline year-to-date. Third quarter top line growth for North America Frozen reflected the slower than anticipated rebound of our Eggo business. Customers are not resetting their shares as quickly as we had expected, and the pace of consumers response is slower than projected. We are confident that the business will return to previous sales levels over time. We are accelerating our growth with an exciting innovation calendar of new products. Our recent introduction of Cinnabon pancakes continues to perform well, and we plan to launch Eggo thick and fluffy original and Cinnabon brand sugar waffles, as well as several SKUs of FiberPlus Eggo waffles in mid-December.
 In addition, our Veggie Foods business performed well, and we have strong innovation programs for 2011, including two varieties of Morningstar biscuits. Our Food Away From Home business also grew modestly year-over-year.
 Turning to our International business. Our total International internal net sales decreased 2% in the quarter against a 6% increase a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, International internal sales were flat, masking 0 growth of 2%.
 Snacks sales were down, largely driven by Russia and Venezuela. Our business in Europe continue to have good share performance despite an internal net sales decline of 5%. In the U.K., our consumption was down 5% against a tough 9% growth a year ago. Despite lower consumption, we held share in the category, which is suffering significant price discounting similar to the U.S. We have an exciting range of innovation in the U.K. for 2011, including Special K clusters and milk chocolate Krave, which will help drive the category.
 In France, our second largest European market, our consumption remains strong with solid share growth. However, in the third quarter, changes made by the trade resulted in a reduction of a week of inventory, which contributed to a 6% decline in net sales.
 Similar to last quarter, Russia experienced strong growth in Cereal, up 38%. And Snacks, while improving, was still down over 20%. For 2011, we expect Europe internal net sales to grow modestly as the region remains a difficult operating environment.
 In Latin America, our top line increased 5% compared to a 9% increase a year ago. There were strong Cereal growth across the region with Cereal sales up 8%, mitigating a decline in the Snacks business. A decline in Snacks is largely driven by Venezuela, where we import products for Mexico and have been impacted by changes in exchange rates.
 Note also that in the quarter, our business in Puerto Rico was impacted by the U.S. Cereal recall, which dampened our growth. In August, we relaunched Special K in Mexico, Central America and Colombia. The Special K franchise is responding well in fruit food, price points and media support. For 2010 and 2011, we expect to deliver mid- single-digit internal net sales growth in Latin America driven by strong underlying Cereal growth.
 Asia-Pacific delivered internal net sales growth of 2% with strong performance across Asia and South Africa. In Australia, we gained share behind the successful launch of Sultana Bran Buds, which achieved an excess of a share point in the quarter. For Asia-Pacific, we expect low to mid- single-digit internal sales growth in 2011, as we continue to see strong category growth across most of Asia and South Africa, offset by slower growth in Australia and Japan. On Slide 20, I'd like to make one final point. We expect 2011 to be one of our strongest innovation years ever with estimated net sales from innovation up at least 25% over 2010.
 Now let me turn it back to David.

While 2010 has been a difficult and disappointing year for the company and our shareholders, we remain confident in our long-term future. We are addressing the major issues that took us off course in 2010. We're stabilizing our supply chain and mitigating the risk of future disruptions. We're ramping up our innovation, and we're adding value back into our categories. We are also fully aware of the tough consumer and economic environment in which we are competing in operating and the degree of volatility that this environment can create. However, we remain positive about 2011 and the future. We expect our core Cereal markets to see category growth with a combination of innovation, price, mix and trade. All of our products offer a strong value proposition, and our heritage as a health and wellness company is aligned with current consumer needs and demographic trends. Regaining our momentum will take time, so we're providing pragmatic guidance for 2011. Our outlook reflects our intent to do what is necessary to get Kellogg back on track.

But maybe you can elaborate a little bit on just in terms of when you think about the four buckets of the issues, is there one bucket or the other that may take a quicker in terms of course correcting?

So I think as we start the year, you'll see that kick in very strongly. The comparatives will clearly -- they're going to be easy next year given the tough year we've had this year. And I think the learnings we and our trading partners have had across these will help both of us as we go through 2011. So I think that will be relatively fast. And then the deflationary environment, harder for us to truly predict what will happen there. But clearly, with inflation coming back fairly significantly as we speak, we do expect that we will see a fair amount of a net price realization, 200 to 300 basis points. So most of these are we're already working on or have in play. We'll start in 2011. Some will take us time through 2011 to fully complete.

I think the hardest thing for a management team and in coming to do when faced with a disappointing year is to step back, understand and confront issues that have taken them off track. The team has done that. We understand what the issues are. We're in the process of fixing them and moving forward to address them. We're going to stabilize the business. We're reinvesting in innovation. We're going to keep our brand building going so. We do believe we're regaining momentum through 2011. And hopefully, that will get us back to our long-term targets as soon as possible. Really, I think the confidence in the company is very strong. If you ask about I exercise some options, I have a lot of stock. The bulk of my personal work is clearly tied up in Kellogg. I remain very committed to the company, so I don't think anyone should take any single way from that at all.

And the reason why I ask that is you look at some of the things that have dragged your business over the last two years. Some of it is cyclical, right? In a good economy, sales are better, but it allows the economy -- sales are actually weaker, so maybe there's more of a cyclical element to your business than we all appreciated and maybe you did. And then, secondly, part of the SKU rationalization, I guess, is tied to some of the -- that has occurred, has been tied to maybe some of the new product innovation that you've done in the past that didn't stick as well. And also, the supply chain issues maybe suggest that you've got to spend a little bit more on supply chain than you were. So just curious in terms of whether there was a serious debate about changing the long-term objectives and what held in your confidence level and that may not have to be adjusted in the future?

I think, if anything, what we saw in 2009 was a significant increase in the category growth. To the extent that when we came into '10, we, probably looking backwards, underestimated the benefits of that in '09. And therefore, the impact is a category readjusted in 2010. The deflationary environment that we've seen this year is not typical for the category, and we believe that that will reverse. So I don't think there's anything fundamental about the category. We feel great about our brands and the categories. And the most important thing is we do have a clear understanding of what we need to do to succeed going forward. It will involve some investment in our supply chain. We think that's appropriate. But I don't think it really changes our desire to get back onto our long-term guidance.

So while there's some volatility from one quarter to the next because of timing in various expenses, we're very comfortable with the ability to sustain the current margin structure on Latin America.

Ron, can you talk about the Cereal recall from the perspective of breaking it down into what was the cost of the recall itself and then what's the lost amount of sales? So I'm looking for a full year quantified impact on those two pieces. And then also, the EPS. I don't think you said it on this call. Last call, you called it out at minus $0.12 for the year. Can you update us on that as well?

As we look into Q3, Q4, we said there's another two $0.01, essentially a $0.01 per quarter. It's very difficult to try to alter that estimate or quantify the impact of back-to-school has had just directly as a result of the recall. So we're still on about $0.12 across the year with about $0.08 to $0.09 being hard costs.

So we did have an impact from the recall on top line because it disrupted our marketing programs. Obviously, that will help us as we go into 2011. Again, we're trying to be pragmatic because of the level of pricing expectation across the total company of 200 to 300 basis points. In this current environment, that has a degree of volume risk to it. So we're trying to be realistic as we pull together our 2011 plan.
