I'm pleased to report that McAfee's team executed very well in the fourth quarter of 2009, resulting in another record-setting quarter in tapping a gre",1586,"Okay, Kate. Thank you very much, and good afternoon and welcome, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that McAfee's team executed very well in the fourth quarter of 2009, resulting in another record-setting quarter in tapping a great year. This marks the 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit, year-over-year revenue growth for McAfee. We increased market share in all four quarters and continued to strengthen the foundation for the future of the company. I want to thank the entire McAfee team for their support and thank our worldwide partners for their commitment and dedication to providing our customers with the best security solutions. We're proud to report another triple double this quarter, with double-digit, year-over-year growth on all three major financial metrics: Revenue, operating cash flow and non-GAAP earnings per share; surpassing guidance for revenue and at the high-end of our expectations for operating margin and non-GAAP earnings per share.Specifically, for the fourth quarter 2009, we reported record revenue of $525.7 million, an increase of 24% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. We also had a record deferred revenue of $1.4 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase and up 6% sequentially. In sales, which were orders received during the quarter, were up 15% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share reached a record $0.64, representing an increase of 20% year-over-year. And cash flow from operations reached the $145 million, an increase of 108% year-over-year.2009 was a triple-double year, with revenue reaching $1.9 billion, an increase of 20% over 2008, and non-GAAP earnings per share, reaching $2.42, up 21% from a year ago. Total cash flow from operations for the year grew to $496 million, representing 61% growth from 2008. In 2009, we recorded four quarters of double-digit growth in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share. Putting us ahead of many of our peers in terms of performance. We also showed strength in deferred revenue, operating margin and added significantly to our product portfolio. Every year, we strive to improve our operating margins. Over the last year, we delivered 200 basis points of margin expansion. We've done this by managing our cost effectively while investing in our business. And we've done a very good job absorbing six acquisitions over the last two years. Our outlook for continued growth is promising for many reasons. We have significantly expanded our distribution reach, with many new partnerships around the world, and the threat landscape is continuing to escalate. We also had a strong pipeline of new and enhanced products and services that has helped us in our goal to become the number one global security technology provider, from both the individual consumer to the largest enterprises in the world. McAfee has built a very strong business model. In Q4, 77% of our revenue came off the balance sheet, and 89% of our revenue was reoccurring in nature. We also have a balanced model, with 36% of our revenue coming from consumer and 64% of revenue coming from our corporate in the quarter. Geographically, we're well positioned, with 57% of our revenue from North America and 43% from international. We see continued strength in the Americas, where not only in the U.S., but Canada and Latin America performed especially well. We also have seen revitalization in Europe, Middle East and Africas region, which had its best quarter of the year in Q4 and is showing continued signs of improvement based on both the economy and the stronger McAfee leadership team.  The Asia Pacific region is also growing substantially and is actually our fastest growing business in terms of sales. This is the result of the investments we've been making in that region and are now paying off. The integration of secure computing is another example of our success. I'm very pleased to say that through 2009, we saw continued improvement in this business and ended the year with very solid results. In fact, Secure Computing was even more accretive to our 2009 non-GAAP earnings per share than our original acquisition plan. And looking ahead, our overall network business should continue to prosper due to pent-up refreshes and increasing demand for our network-based security offerings. Talking about our Corporate business, revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 grew 30% year-over-year to a record $338 million. McAfee closed 623 deals greater than $100,000 in value, including 103 deals greater than $500,000, 33 deals greater than $1 million, with one deal of approximately $5 million. This is the largest number of 1 million plus deals that we've closed in a single quarter ever, bringing the total number of deals over 1 million in all of 2009 to 108 million.These larger deals continue to show the standardization decisions that are being made by enterprises, many of which were competitive displacements. Competitive displacements grew 32% in all of 2009 as compared to 2008. And for example, in North America alone, we displaced competitors on 4.5 million nodes during the year. Our sales force is increasingly successful at selling products across the McAfee portfolio, expanding the customer commitment to McAfee and proving our vision of providing the best possible protection by interlocking security across systems, network and risk and compliance. When we look at deals over $500,000 in the fourth quarter, 73% of those deals had multiple products. When we look at the same period or year prior, only 31% of the deals over 500k had multiple products. Overall, we're delivering on our value proposition of hire protection at a lower total cost of ownership. This proposition is delivering us a consistent mix of large, mid- and small-sized deals, resulting in balanced growth, predictability and ongoing ability to take market share in all key segments of our business. In our Mid-market business, we saw substantial sales growth in 2009 versus 2008 at 26% year-over-year. This performance is a result of our investments in the sales force, updated channel programs, strong leadership and the success of the introduction of our acquired products.We saw a continued adoption of our Total Protection Suites among Mid-market customers. This is our most strategic and sticky systems product. For the first time in Q4, this set of suites now represented over half of our Total Systems business in the mid-market. And even more exciting, we saw a 16% increase in our competitive displacements sales on this segment.Turning to our Consumer business, revenue grew 15% year-over-year to a record $188 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. We've continued to expand our Consumer business and are taking market share to a number of strategic partnerships and a continuously expanding product portfolio. Recently, we announced newer expanded partnerships with AT&T, British Telecom, Facebook, Fujitsu and Verizon, just to name a few. The business opportunities we see through these strategic relationships are tremendous. For example, our new telco-ISP partnerships have sorted out very well. And on a global basis, McAfee now covers more than 70% of the total broadband subscriber base of the world's top 10 largest ISPs. Additionally, our e-business model with Adobe Systems and Facebook are important new channels for McAfee this year. In fact, in just a few short weeks, McAfee has dramatically expanded its presence on Facebook, acquiring over 60,000 fans in just access to 400 million Facebook users.Also, I'm extremely pleased to say that our PC OEM strategy is really paying off. The combination of over 60 million Windows 7 licenses sold, PC unit sales growth and the fact that McAfee ships on more than 50% of the PCs shipped by the top 10 PC OEMs, are all now ingredients for ongoing success. All in all, for 2009, we saw an 84% year-over-year increase in new, registered trial subscribers, sending us up for continued growth in 2010. On top of that, we just launched an update to our 2010 consumer product suites. This is our best consumer product ever period. With the update, we're delivering the fastest, lightest and the most effective consumer PC protection product in the company's history. The update is being well received, and we were just awarded a 4½ out of five star rating by CNET's download.com, a higher rating than our major competitor. McAfee has been recognized with numerous industry honors for product performance since its 2009 release, including top awards from AV-Comparatives.org, AV-Test.org and Virus Bulletin. Additionally, new 2009 offering, such as McAfee Family Protection along with McAfee Online Backup, help us extend the life cycle of the customer by delivering great value and protection against the ever-increasing threat landscape. And looking into 2010, I've never been more excited about our new product pipeline. We have a number of significant releases coming this year, including new products for the Apple's Macintosh platform for consumers all the way through the enterprise, a major new release of ePolicy Orchestrator, which enables us to cross-sell and upsell opportunities from our recent acquisitions, as well as a significant new release of a next-generation enterprise firewall and significant updates for Data Loss Prevention and encryption products. And additionally, our security as a service offerings will be more attractive than ever in 2010. As we move forward, we also plan to strengthen partnerships and add new ones. We expect the culmination of partnerships, products and a great team at McAfee to fuel our growth. That, combined with a better economic climate and an escalating threat environment, means McAfee is in the right place at the right time. The future's never been brighter. And with that, let me hand it over to Rocky for a financial review of the quarter and guidance. Rocky?"

Our performance reflects the hard work of our world-class team and focus on opera",1764,"Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. The fourth quarter of 2009 marked another solid quarter for McAfee, and we continued to execute well in a challenging environment. Our performance reflects the hard work of our world-class team and focus on operational execution amid signs of the worldwide economy maybe stabilizing. Over the past year, we have been focused on driving operational efficiencies and scalability into our business. We are pleased with the operating margin expansion we achieved this year due to these efforts. In 2009, we've made investments on our worldwide sales operations that enhanced our channel strategy, emphasizing the value we placed on our partners. We successfully integrated three acquisitions that expand our ability to deliver best-in-class security solutions to our customers and enter into new markets. And we continue to closely manage our expenses. These improvements in our business contributed to the strong results we achieved in 2009 and position us very well for the opportunities we see for McAfee as we enter 2010. Turning to the Q4 results, we delivered record revenue of $525.7 million, up 24% year-over-year. These results include a positive impact from currency of approximately $23 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Currency had a positive impact of $9 million. We were very pleased with continued strong performance in our Consumer business, and our Corporate business growth was driven primarily by system security, firewall and our Web and e-mail products. On a geographic basis, we had double-digit, year-over-year growth in nearly all of our geographies. North America revenue in Q4 was $299 million, up 28% from last year and accounted for 57% of revenue. This was another record-revenue quarter for North America, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth at/or above 25%. International revenue reached a record $227 million, an increase of 19% over last year and accounted for 43% of revenue. As reported in U.S. dollars, revenue results in our international geographies compared to fourth quarter 2008 showed: Europe, the Middle East and Africa grew 24%; Asia Pacific grew 6%; Latin America grew 20%; and Japan grew 10%. For the second consecutive quarter, we have seen improved performance from our European operations, and we were especially pleased with a strong recovery we saw in our European Mid-market business. We are excited about the launch of our new inside sales operations in Cork, Ireland, and this is a good example of the infrastructure projects we have had underway to ensure our sales capacity matches our growth opportunities. The changes we've made in our European operations in 2009 are starting to have a positive impact, and we are encouraged by the opportunities we see for McAfee in this area of the world, as the global economy showed signs of improvement.For the fourth quarter, approximately 77% of total revenue came from deferred revenue off the balance sheet, and approximately 89% of fourth quarter revenue was recurring in nature. Looking at our Corporate business, this was another record-revenue quarter, and we achieved revenue of $338 million, up 30% year-over-year. We also had a record sales quarter with 16% growth year-over-year.Our Mid-market business did very well this quarter. Our Core Systems business was very strong, and we were particularly pleased to see the growth in our Non-systems business with the success of our network and data protection products. Our Consumer business had an outstanding quarter. Q4 revenues were $188 million, up 15% year-over-year and up over 6% sequentially. We also achieved record sales, which were up 13.3% over the same period last year.The strength of our PC OEM business continues to contribute to our cash flow growth, and we did a great job expanding our ISP partnership channel and developing new innovative channels for our products, such as with Facebook and Adobe. The success we achieved drove expansion in both our Consumer gross margins and Consumer operating margin in 2009 over 2008. Overall, we are very pleased with our growth and profitability in the Consumer business. Our focus on diversifying our go-to-market model, backed by our award-winning product portfolio, has resulted in new and exciting partnerships for McAfee, and we are reaching hundreds of millions of consumers. Going forward, we plan to continue strengthening the four pillars of our consumer strategy by expanding our distribution model, broadening our award-winning product portfolio and service and support capabilities and developing our PC Web and mobile platform delivery. This strategy has helped us deliver consistent growth despite very challenging consumer confidence and should continue to serve us well as the economy improves. Turning to other highlights from the income statement, non-GAAP gross profit margins for the fourth quarter was 79.3%, up slightly sequentially and flat year-over-year. Over the course of 2009, we delivered solid gross margins, while scaling our business at integrating our hardware-centric, Secure Computing acquisition. Going forward, we see opportunities to expand our margins, as we replace some of our appliance-based products with new, virtual appliance software solutions in our Network business.Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income was $137 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 26%, the high end of our guidance range. We're proud to report this is our third consecutive quarter of non-GAAP operating margin at/or above 26%. In 2009, we expanded our operating margin by 200 basis points, reflecting our ability to strike the right balance between expense management and growth opportunities. Achieving this level of margin expansion is particularly gratifying, considering the tough economic conditions we've experienced in 2009. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to improve our operating efficiencies and make strategic investments in our infrastructure to support future growth. As a result, we believe we will deliver improved operating margins in 2010.Total employee headcount at the end of 2009 was 6,144 employees, up 42 employees from the third quarter of 2009. In 2009, we added 581 employees. And year-to-date, in 2010, we have added an additional 72 employees. Continuing, fourth quarter non-GAAP other income was a loss of $1 million, compared with $1 million of other income in the third quarter of 2009. This decrease primarily is attributed to foreign currency losses.Q4 non-GAAP net income was $103 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.64, up 20% year-over-year. And in the fourth quarter, our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 24%.Turning to a few items on the balance sheet. Net accounts receivable balance at the end of fourth quarter 2009 was $294 million, compared with $232 million for the third quarter. Day sales outstanding were 50 days for the fourth quarter 2009 as a result of strong cash collections. Prepaid expenses, income taxes and other current assets was $339 million, down 6% quarter-over-quarter. Deferred revenue at the end of the fourth quarter 2009 was $1.41 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of $9 million on deferred revenue year-over-year and a negative impact of $9 million quarter-over-quarter. We ended the fourth quarter with $1.1 billion in short-term deferred revenue, up $46 million when compared with the third quarter of 2009. Long-term deferred revenue was up $27 million in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter 2009, ending the quarter at $339 million. The composition of our deferred revenue balance at the end of the fourth quarter 2009 was 67% related to Corporate and 33% to Consumer.In the fourth quarter, we did not see any significant change in discounting. And for the full year, 2009, discounting increased approximately 100 basis points over 2008. Fourth quarter contract links improved 10% on a year-over-year basis. And op also improved approximately 10% for the full year 2009 over 2008. We ended the fourth quarter of 2009 with cash and marketable securities of $950 million. During the quarter, we repaid our $100 million unsecured term loan in accordance with our credit agreement from the prior year. And in conjunction with this, we amended our credit facility to increase the revolver capacity to $450 million. This facility provides McAfee additional financial flexibility to support our continued growth strategy.I'm also pleased to report that our Board has approved a stock repurchase program of up to $500 million through December 2011. Financial flexibility is a critical strength for McAfee in this marketplace. Looking ahead, we expect to use our cash balances to repurchase stock, along with our plans to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities. Turning to fourth quarter cash flow, I'm pleased that we generated total operating cash flow of $145 million. For the year, we generated a record $496 million in operating cash flow, up over 60% from last year and reflecting the quality of our receivables and the positive impact of our Consumer business. As we exit 2009, we expect to have sustained strength in our operating cash flow. Now I would like to our outlook.  There are signs of an improving economic environment. And as a result, we, along with our technology peers, are expecting modest improvements in IT spending for 2010. Within this outlook, industry analysts estimate McAfee's addressable market should grow approximately 5% to 9% in 2010 over 2009. In 2010, McAfee is well positioned to achieve organic double-digit revenue, non-GAAP EPS and cash flow growth and continued market share gains. The visibility of our business model, coupled with our team's consistent execution record, puts us on track to achieve our 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in Q1. Our business pipeline is very strong, and we have already closed a number of significant transactions. For the first quarter of 2010, we expect to achieve revenues in the range of $500 million to $520 million, GAAP operating income margin in the range of 12% to 16%, non-GAAP operating income margin in the range of 24% to 26% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.60 to $0.64 per share on a fully-diluted basis. Our outlook for Q1 2010 is based on a fully-diluted share count in the range of 160 million to 162 million shares, compared to a fully-diluted share count of 156 million shares in Q1 2009. And we are assuming an annual GAAP tax rate of 26% and an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 24%.In summary, 2009 illustrates is the many milestones we have reached in preparing McAfee to take the security leadership to a new level. We're pleased with our revenue, deferred revenue, operational improvement and cash flow performance. Our foundation is solid, and we have a strong balance sheet positioning us for continued success. On behalf of the executive management team, we want to thank all of our employees worldwide for their continued strong performance. And now, I will turn it back to Dave for closing comments."

So it's showing. In terms of sustaining that, we said that we think we can continue double-digit growth and revenue EPS and cash flow. So obviously, now having 16 consecutive quarters, if you look at the guidance, we're predicting a 17th consecutive double-digit revenue growth quarter, and we think we can continue to operate there. In terms of deferred revenue, certainly, we had strong growth. Look at the bookings or sales growth that we've called out, 15%, pretty solid all-around. Certainly, there's a mix there between revenue growth and deferred revenue growth. The way you really look at that is, revenue plus change in deferred. It really gives you the proxy for our sales number. But all in all, it's a very good solid number from consumer to mid, small and enterprise, and we really hit all cylinders..."

So we're going after that. Virtual appliances is the way to go after that. We're just introducing those products into the market now. We're incenting our organizations to go after that. And hopefully, we'll begin to see some opportunity there on our P&L to really drive that. Pricing-wise, we really have a bundling opportunity here, which is really a consolidation of some of the features and the market that are all point products that lets us continue to rise our ASPs while doing it. And it just creates a similar opportunity we have on the end point, and now on the network, and hopefully the network with virtual appliances. So we're pretty optimistic there and hopefully this will work."

I mean just walking up our market segments for us, consumer, I mean just look at PC unit growth, certainly, look at the Windows 7 refresh, I mean there's lots of opportunities sitting there for McAfee, particularly now with the amount of distribution capacity the company has and the threat landscape. It's hard to go a day without seeing some major threat escalation. Mid-market's been very powerful for us with the SaaS offering. We're really seeing a movement to the cloud there. And certainly, our top service product had very strong results. Our mid-market at 24%, this past quarter, was really solid for us. And then when you, kind of, go to your question around Endpoint or Network, the Network is a real opportunistic area for the company. We did see so many fragmented point vendors. And we are getting -- every quarter, we're not closer to really having us full sweep on a single platform with software or hardware combinations. It really puts us in place to really create an interlock of our Hardware business and Software business on the Network with that at the Endpoint. So this is creating a pretty interesting juxtaposition of growth opportunity for the company. And hopefully, you're hearing we're pretty bullish on the opportunity overall. We've also shown that we've made investments, or Mike DeCesare in the sales organization, of adding capacity to our model, both in the channel and inside sales, lead gen. We've really renewed our European model. We had an outstanding quarter in Q4 in Europe, and just continuing to get the leadership really strengthened there. So getting the network business humming and getting Europe humming and then adding that to our U.S. and Asia, it's putting us in an interesting position hopefully for the year."

We don't have a single major distribution partner that is all loaded with PC units and bounties to that. So this is a chance to really drive the model. Cash flow is up. I'd also tell you we're proud to have the Dell agreement largely behind us. And hopefully, you see that, $145 million in cash flow this quarter with the Dell largely behind us.

Thank you very much, and good afternoon and welcome, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that McAfee's team executed very well in the fourth quarter of 2009, resulting in another record-setting quarter in tapping a great year. This marks the 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit, year-over-year revenue growth for McAfee. We increased market share in all four quarters and continued to strengthen the foundation for the future of the company. I want to thank the entire McAfee team for their support and thank our worldwide partners for their commitment and dedication to providing our customers with the best security solutions. We're proud to report another triple double this quarter, with double-digit, year-over-year growth on all three major financial metrics: Revenue, operating cash flow and non-GAAP earnings per share; surpassing guidance for revenue and at the high-end of our expectations for operating margin and non-GAAP earnings per share.Specifically, for the fourth quarter 2009, we reported record revenue of $525.7 million, an increase of 24% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. We also had a record deferred revenue of $1.4 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase and up 6% sequentially. In sales, which were orders received during the quarter, were up 15% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share reached a record $0.64, representing an increase of 20% year-over-year. And cash flow from operations reached the $145 million, an increase of 108% year-over-year.2009 was a triple-double year, with revenue reaching $1.9 billion, an increase of 20% over 2008, and non-GAAP earnings per share, reaching $2.42, up 21% from a year ago. Total cash flow from operations for the year grew to $496 million, representing 61% growth from 2008. In 2009, we recorded four quarters of double-digit growth in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share. Putting us ahead of many of our peers in terms of performance. We also showed strength in deferred revenue, operating margin and added significantly to our product portfolio. Every year, we strive to improve our operating margins. Over the last year, we delivered 200 basis points of margin expansion. We've done this by managing our cost effectively while investing in our business. And we've done a very good job absorbing six acquisitions over the last two years. Our outlook for continued growth is promising for many reasons. We have significantly expanded our distribution reach, with many new partnerships around the world, and the threat landscape is continuing to escalate. We also had a strong pipeline of new and enhanced products and services that has helped us in our goal to become the number one global security technology provider, from both the individual consumer to the largest enterprises in the world. McAfee has built a very strong business model. In Q4, 77% of our revenue came off the balance sheet, and 89% of our revenue was reoccurring in nature. We also have a balanced model, with 36% of our revenue coming from consumer and 64% of revenue coming from our corporate in the quarter. Geographically, we're well positioned, with 57% of our revenue from North America and 43% from international. We see continued strength in the Americas, where not only in the U.S., but Canada and Latin America performed especially well. We also have seen revitalization in Europe, Middle East and Africas region, which had its best quarter of the year in Q4 and is showing continued signs of improvement based on both the economy and the stronger McAfee leadership team.  The Asia Pacific region is also growing substantially and is actually our fastest growing business in terms of sales. This is the result of the investments we've been making in that region and are now paying off. The integration of secure computing is another example of our success. I'm very pleased to say that through 2009, we saw continued improvement in this business and ended the year with very solid results. In fact, Secure Computing was even more accretive to our 2009 non-GAAP earnings per share than our original acquisition plan. And looking ahead, our overall network business should continue to prosper due to pent-up refreshes and increasing demand for our network-based security offerings. Talking about our Corporate business, revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 grew 30% year-over-year to a record $338 million. McAfee closed 623 deals greater than $100,000 in value, including 103 deals greater than $500,000, 33 deals greater than $1 million, with one deal of approximately $5 million. This is the largest number of 1 million plus deals that we've closed in a single quarter ever, bringing the total number of deals over 1 million in all of 2009 to 108 million.These larger deals continue to show the standardization decisions that are being made by enterprises, many of which were competitive displacements. Competitive displacements grew 32% in all of 2009 as compared to 2008. And for example, in North America alone, we displaced competitors on 4.5 million nodes during the year. Our sales force is increasingly successful at selling products across the McAfee portfolio, expanding the customer commitment to McAfee and proving our vision of providing the best possible protection by interlocking security across systems, network and risk and compliance. When we look at deals over $500,000 in the fourth quarter, 73% of those deals had multiple products. When we look at the same period or year prior, only 31% of the deals over 500k had multiple products. Overall, we're delivering on our value proposition of hire protection at a lower total cost of ownership. This proposition is delivering us a consistent mix of large, mid- and small-sized deals, resulting in balanced growth, predictability and ongoing ability to take market share in all key segments of our business. In our Mid-market business, we saw substantial sales growth in 2009 versus 2008 at 26% year-over-year. This performance is a result of our investments in the sales force, updated channel programs, strong leadership and the success of the introduction of our acquired products.We saw a continued adoption of our Total Protection Suites among Mid-market customers. This is our most strategic and sticky systems product. For the first time in Q4, this set of suites now represented over half of our Total Systems business in the mid-market. And even more exciting, we saw a 16% increase in our competitive displacements sales on this segment.Turning to our Consumer business, revenue grew 15% year-over-year to a record $188 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. We've continued to expand our Consumer business and are taking market share to a number of strategic partnerships and a continuously expanding product portfolio. Recently, we announced newer expanded partnerships with AT&T, British Telecom, Facebook, Fujitsu and Verizon, just to name a few. The business opportunities we see through these strategic relationships are tremendous. For example, our new telco-ISP partnerships have started out very well. And on a global basis, McAfee now covers more than 70% of the total broadband subscriber base of the world's top 10 largest ISPs. Additionally, our e-business model with Adobe Systems and Facebook are important new channels for McAfee this year. In fact, in just a few short weeks, McAfee has dramatically expanded its presence on Facebook, acquiring over 60,000 fans in just access to 400 million Facebook users.Also, I'm extremely pleased to say that our PC OEM strategy is really paying off. The combination of over 60 million Windows 7 licenses sold, PC unit sales growth and the fact that McAfee ships on more than 50% of the PCs shipped by the top 10 PC OEMs, are all now ingredients for ongoing success. All in all, for 2009, we saw an 84% year-over-year increase in new, registered trial subscribers, sending us up for continued growth in 2010. On top of that, we just launched an update to our 2010 consumer product suites. This is our best consumer product ever period. With the update, we're delivering the fastest, lightest and the most effective consumer PC protection product in the company's history. The update is being well received, and we were just awarded a 4½ out of five star rating by CNET's download.com, a higher rating than our major competitor. McAfee has been recognized with numerous industry honors for product performance since its 2009 release, including top awards from AV-Comparatives.org, AV-Test.org and Virus Bulletin. Additionally, new 2009 offering, such as McAfee Family Protection along with McAfee Online Backup, help us extend the life cycle of the customer by delivering great value and protection against the ever-increasing threat landscape. And looking into 2010, I've never been more excited about our new product pipeline. We have a number of significant releases coming this year, including new products for the Apple's Macintosh platform for consumers all the way through the enterprise, a major new release of ePolicy Orchestrator, which enables us to cross-sell and upsell opportunities from our recent acquisitions, as well as a significant new release of a next-generation enterprise firewall and significant updates for Data Loss Prevention and encryption products. And additionally, our security as a service offerings will be more attractive than ever in 2010. As we move forward, we also plan to strengthen existing partnerships and add new ones. We expect the combination of partnerships, products and a great team at McAfee to fuel our growth. That, combined with a better economic climate and an escalating threat environment, means McAfee is in the right place at the right time. The future's never been brighter. And with that, let me hand it over to Rocky for a financial review of the quarter and guidance. Rocky?"

The fourth quarter of 2009 marked another solid quarter for McAfee, and we continued to execute well in a challenging environment. Our performance reflects the hard work of our world-class team and focus on operational execution amid signs of the worldwide economy maybe stabilizing. Over the past year, we have been focused on driving operational efficiencies and scalability into our business. We are pleased with the operating margin expansion we achieved this year due to these efforts. In 2009, we've made investments on our worldwide sales operations that enhanced our channel strategy, emphasizing the value we placed on our partners. We successfully integrated three acquisitions that expand our ability to deliver best-in-class security solutions to our customers and enter into new markets. And we continue to closely manage our expenses. These improvements in our business contributed to the strong results we achieved in 2009 and position us very well for the opportunities we see for McAfee as we enter 2010. Turning to the Q4 results, we delivered record revenue of $525.7 million, up 24% year-over-year. These results include a positive impact from currency of approximately $23 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Currency had a positive impact of $9 million. We were very pleased with continued strong performance in our Consumer business, and our Corporate business growth was driven primarily by system security, firewall and our Web and e-mail products. On a geographic basis, we had double-digit, year-over-year growth in nearly all of our geographies. North America revenue in Q4 was $299 million, up 28% from last year and accounted for 57% of revenue. This was another record-revenue quarter for North America, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth at/or above 25%. International revenue reached a record $227 million, an increase of 19% over last year and accounted for 43% of revenue. As reported in U.S. dollars, revenue results in our international geographies compared to fourth quarter 2008 showed: Europe, the Middle East and Africa grew 24%; Asia Pacific grew 6%; Latin America grew 20%; and Japan grew 10%. For the second consecutive quarter, we have seen improved performance from our European operations, and we were especially pleased with a strong recovery we saw in our European Mid-market business. We are excited about the launch of our new inside sales operations in Cork, Ireland, and this is a good example of the infrastructure projects we have had underway to ensure our sales capacity matches our growth opportunities. The changes we've made in our European operations in 2009 are starting to have a positive impact, and we are encouraged by the opportunities we see for McAfee in this area of the world, as the global economy showed signs of improvement.For the fourth quarter, approximately 77% of total revenue came from deferred revenue off the balance sheet, and approximately 89% of fourth quarter revenue was recurring in nature. Looking at our Corporate business, this was another record-revenue quarter, and we achieved revenue of $338 million, up 30% year-over-year. We also had a record sales quarter with 16% growth year-over-year.Our Mid-market business did very well this quarter. Our Core Systems business was very strong, and we were particularly pleased to see the growth in our Non-systems business with the success of our network and data protection products. Our Consumer business had an outstanding quarter. Q4 revenues were $188 million, up 15% year-over-year and up over 6% sequentially. We also achieved record sales, which were up 13.3% over the same period last year.The strength of our PC OEM business continued to contribute to our cash flow growth, and we did a great job expanding our ISP partnership channel and developing new innovative channels for our products, such as with Facebook and Adobe. The success we achieved drove expansion in both our Consumer gross margins and Consumer operating margin in 2009 over 2008. Overall, we are very pleased with our growth and profitability in the Consumer business. Our focus on diversifying our go-to-market model, backed by our award-winning product portfolio, has resulted in new and exciting partnerships for McAfee, and we are reaching hundreds of millions of consumers. Going forward, we plan to continue strengthening the four pillars of our consumer strategy by expanding our distribution model, broadening our award-winning product portfolio and service and support capabilities and developing our PC Web and mobile platform delivery. This strategy has helped us deliver consistent growth despite very challenging consumer confidence and should continue to serve us well as the economy improves. Turning to other highlights from the income statement, non-GAAP gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 79.3%, up slightly sequentially and flat year-over-year. Over the course of 2009, we delivered solid gross margins, while scaling our business and integrating our hardware-centric, Secure Computing acquisition. Going forward, we see opportunities to expand our margins, as we replace some of our appliance-based products with new, virtual appliance software solutions in our Network business.Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income was $137 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 26%, the high end of our guidance range. We're proud to report this is our third consecutive quarter of non-GAAP operating margin at/or above 26%. In 2009, we expanded our operating margin by 200 basis points, reflecting our ability to strike the right balance between expense management and growth opportunities. Achieving this level of margin expansion is particularly gratifying, considering the tough economic conditions we've experienced in 2009. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to improve our operating efficiencies and make strategic investments in our infrastructure to support future growth. As a result, we believe we will deliver improved operating margins in 2010.Total employee headcount at the end of 2009 was 6,144 employees, up 42 employees from the third quarter of 2009. In 2009, we added 581 employees. And year-to-date, in 2010, we have added an additional 72 employees. Continuing, fourth quarter non-GAAP other income was a loss of $1 million, compared with $1 million of other income in the third quarter of 2009. This decrease primarily is attributed to foreign currency losses.Q4 non-GAAP net income was $103 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.64, up 20% year-over-year. And in the fourth quarter, our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 24%.Turning to a few items on the balance sheet. Net accounts receivable balance at the end of fourth quarter 2009 was $294 million, compared with $232 million for the third quarter. Day sales outstanding were 50 days for the fourth quarter 2009 as a result of strong cash collections. Prepaid expenses, income taxes and other current assets was $339 million, down 6% quarter-over-quarter. Deferred revenue at the end of the fourth quarter 2009 was $1.41 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of $9 million on deferred revenue year-over-year and a negative impact of $9 million quarter-over-quarter. We ended the fourth quarter with $1.1 billion in short-term deferred revenue, up $46 million when compared with the third quarter of 2009. Long-term deferred revenue was up $27 million in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter 2009, ending the quarter at $339 million. The composition of our deferred revenue balance at the end of the fourth quarter 2009 was 67% related to Corporate and 33% to Consumer.In the fourth quarter, we did not see any significant change in discounting. And for the full year, 2009, discounting increased approximately 100 basis points over 2008. Fourth quarter contract links improved 10% on a year-over-year basis. And op also improved approximately 10% for the full year 2009 over 2008. We ended the fourth quarter of 2009 with cash and marketable securities of $950 million. During the quarter, we repaid our $100 million unsecured term loan in accordance with our credit agreement from the prior year. And in conjunction with this, we amended our credit facility to increase the revolver capacity to $450 million. This facility provides McAfee additional financial flexibility to support our continued growth strategy.I'm also pleased to report that our Board has approved a stock repurchase program of up to $500 million through December 2011. Financial flexibility is a critical strength for McAfee in this marketplace. Looking ahead, we expect to use our cash balances to repurchase stock, along with our plans to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities. Turning to fourth quarter cash flow, I'm pleased that we generated total operating cash flow of $145 million. For the year, we generated a record $496 million in operating cash flow, up over 60% from last year and reflecting the quality of our receivables and the positive impact of our Consumer business. As we exit 2009, we expect to have sustained strength in our operating cash flow. Now I would like to our outlook.  There are signs of an improving economic environment. And as a result, we, along with our technology peers, are expecting modest improvements in IT spending for 2010. Within this outlook, industry analysts estimate McAfee's addressable market should grow approximately 5% to 9% in 2010 over 2009. In 2010, McAfee is well positioned to achieve organic double-digit revenue, non-GAAP EPS and cash flow growth and continued market share gains. The visibility of our business model, coupled with our team's consistent execution record, puts us on track to achieve our 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in Q1. Our business pipeline is very strong, and we have already closed a number of significant transactions. For the first quarter of 2010, we expect to achieve revenues in the range of $500 million to $520 million, GAAP operating income margin in the range of 12% to 16%, non-GAAP operating income margin in the range of 24% to 26% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.60 to $0.64 per share on a fully-diluted basis. Our outlook for Q1 2010 is based on a fully-diluted share count in the range of 160 million to 162 million shares, compared to a fully-diluted share count of 156 million shares in Q1 2009. And we are assuming an annual GAAP tax rate of 26% and an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 24%.In summary, 2009 illustrates is the many milestones we have reached in preparing McAfee to take the security leadership to a new level. We're pleased with our revenue, deferred revenue, operational improvement and cash flow performance. Our foundation is solid, and we have a strong balance sheet positioning us for continued success. On behalf of the executive management team, we want to thank all of our employees worldwide for their continued strong performance. And now, I will turn it back to Dave for closing comments."

More importantly, 2009 paved the way for a solid 2010 for product verification and strong teams in place in all of our leadership positions. As you may have read in our press release, Rocky's retiring later this year. In anticipation of this upcoming transition, we've initiated a search for a new Chief Financial Officer and look forward to completing this process later this year. Rocky plans to remain in his role to ease the transition period. As reflected in our record quarterly and annual results, Rocky will leave McAfee in a very strong financial position. On behalf of the McAfee team, I thank him for his continued service and his contributions. And with that, we'll take your questions and pass over to Kate."

So it's showing. In terms of sustaining that, we said that we think we can continue double-digit growth and revenue EPS and cash flow. So obviously, now having 16 consecutive quarters, if you look at the guidance, we're predicting a 17th consecutive double-digit revenue growth quarter, and we think we can continue to operate there. In terms of deferred revenue, certainly, we had strong growth. Look at the bookings or sales growth that we've called out, 15%, pretty solid all-around. Certainly, there's a mix there between revenue growth and deferred revenue growth. The way you really look at that is, revenue plus change in deferred. It really gives you the proxy for our sales number. But all in all, it's a very good solid number from consumer to mid, small and enterprise, and we really hit all cylinders..."

And as you know, there's other companies out there, in the network security space, that have done a good job blending software and hardware models, which results in improved gross margin. So we're going after that. Virtual appliances is the way to go after that. We're just introducing those products into the market now. We're incenting our organizations to go after that. And hopefully, we'll begin to see some opportunity there on our P&L to really drive that. Pricing-wise, we really have a bundling opportunity here, which is really a consolidation of some of the features and the market that are all point products that lets us continue to rise our ASPs while doing it.

I mean just walking up our market segments for us, consumer, I mean just look at PC unit growth, certainly, look at the Windows 7 refresh, I mean there's lots of opportunities sitting there for McAfee, particularly now with the amount of distribution capacity the company has and the threat landscape. It's hard to go a day without seeing some major threat escalation. Mid-market's been very powerful for us with the SaaS offering. We're really seeing a movement to the cloud there. And certainly, our top service product had very strong results. Our mid-market at 24%, this past quarter, was really solid for us. And then when you, kind of, go to your question around Endpoint or Network, the Network is a real opportunistic area for the company. We did see so many fragmented point vendors. And we are getting -- every quarter, we're not closer to really having us full sweep on a single platform with software or hardware combinations. It really puts us in place to really create an interlock of our Hardware business and Software business on the Network with that at the Endpoint. So this is creating a pretty interesting juxtaposition of growth opportunity for the company. And hopefully, you're hearing we're pretty bullish on the opportunity overall. We've also shown that we've made investments, or Mike DeCesare in the sales organization, of adding capacity to our model, both in the channel and inside sales, lead gen. We've really renewed our European model. We had an outstanding quarter in Q4 in Europe, and just continuing to get the leadership really strengthened there. So getting the network business humming and getting Europe humming and then adding that to our U.S. and Asia, it's putting us in an interesting position hopefully for the year."

We also know there's FX impacts. And we've taken all that into consideration here as you look at our guidance. And certainly, the exchange rates aren't getting better here, we know that. And we've taken all that in. But consumer-wise, that partner's teams had done an amazing job. We've had a great back-end SaaS model. We've got a strong way to help our partners make money and help us. The balance of the partner models is really important because we've really done rev shares and a combination of the balance approach to that partnering model. So we don't get that same exposure that some of our competitors are getting. We have some bounty to pay on PC units. But it's not as severe because it's balanced across other ways in which we do the contracts. So hopefully, that helps you, kind of, see what we see."

We had outstanding triple-digit registrations or subscriber trials in 2009 with over 80% for the full year. But conversions are challenging. And these are areas we keep working on. We are showing strong growth. I mean double-digit again, on a sales basis for consumers. So it is working. But remember, there's new types of devices. Some of those devices are smaller type devices. Some of those shipments are heading to emerging markets. They don't have as good a conversion rates. But generally speaking, we're on more units. There is a major Windows 7 refresh. And the product that we have is wider now too. So think Family Protection, Online Backup, much better product overall. So we think we can continue to really grow that business. We think we can continue to expand margins on that. Certainly, to your point, we're optimistic that, that business is going to continue to drive cash flow and margin expansion. I mentioned Dell is turning out to be an outstanding agreement for us. And so is the other ones like Acer, where it's at, as well as these ISPs. So the answer is yes."

So now we've got cloud and premise-based solutions for those markets for the channels. We're focusing on it a lot more with leadership programs, investments of dollars. And you could see Q4, 24% in that mid space was good. And we're getting good results out of EMEA now. One of the other things we did, Steve, was really go after a telesales model to complement the channel. We have an outstanding telecenter now in Plano, Texas. Another one up in Cork, Ireland, as Rocky had mentioned. Another one over in Asia.

Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report the 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit, year-over-year revenue growth for McAfee with revenue of $503 million, up 12%; deferred revenue of",1056,"Okay. Thank you, Kate. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report the 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit, year-over-year revenue growth for McAfee with revenue of $503 million, up 12%; deferred revenue of $1.4 billion, up 9%; cash flow from operations hitting a record $157 million; non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.60; and sales in the quarter, up 11% and up 5% on a constant-normalized basis. 
In the aggregate, compared to the fourth quarter, first quarter foreign exchange headwind negatively impacted our sales by $15 million, revenue by $12 million and non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.03. Also, compared to our first quarter guidance, we saw an additional headwind of $3 million in revenue and a penny in non-GAAP earnings per share as the U.S. dollar strengthened, more than we anticipated versus the euro and British pound. 
Looking at the first quarter 2010 business results for McAfee, we're especially pleased with our record Consumer business performance. Consumer revenue grew 11% year-over-year to a record $190 million, and our sales grew 17% year-over-year on a constant-normalized basis. We saw growth in all areas of the Global Consumer business, with double-digit growth in North America and more than 26% growth in our International Consumer business with Europe, Middle East and Africa achieving its third quarter in a row of greater than 20% year-over-year sales growth. These continued strong results in our Consumer segment proved that our investments in this business have been effective, and our shared risk model continues to be very profitable for both McAfee and our partners. As a result, we continue to take market share from our competitors. 
Our Consumer team had many exciting accomplishments during the quarter, executing on our strategy of protecting consumers where they need it: their PCs, the Web and mobile devices. Additionally, we continue to execute on our balanced partnership model with PC OEMs, Internet service providers, telecommunications companies, financial services, retail, social networks and portals on a global basis. 
During the quarter, we launched our new ISP [Internet service provider] offerings with Verizon in the U.S. and Yahoo BB in Japan. We continued our optimized programs with AT&T, generating a year-over-year 73% increase in our subscriber base with them. We also launched our new portal offerings with Mail.com and accumulated more than 170,000 Facebook fans as their exclusive security partner. We also recorded 3.2 million downloads of our securities scanner in conjunction with Adobe Systems partnership and announced a new agreement with SK Telecom in South Korea for our new Google Android mobile product. 
We generated more than $22 billion McAfee SECURE trustmark impressions and released our new ToPS for Mac product to our first partners. We launched a major upgrade to our core security suites, including a new user interface and significant performance improvements that was well welcomed with great reviews, including a 4.5-star review with CNET, higher than our major competitor. 
And finally, I'm excited about the future products and services we have planned this year to extend the subscription life cycle and lifetime value relationship with our consumers. These new products and services include identity protection, collaboration, transactional security and extended smart phone mobile offerings. 
And now, let me provide some color on our Corporate business. We achieved record first quarter revenue on our Corporate segment of $313 million, up 13% year-over-year. There was some real bright spots in this business this quarter. Customer demand was strong, and we experienced increased contract lengths without notable impact to discounting, and we had a strong pipeline at the end of the quarter. 
During the quarter, we closed 376 deals greater than $100,000 in value. Within this, we have 56 deals greater than $500,000 in value and 19 deals greater than $1 million in value. We saw 17% growth in the sales value of deals greater than $100,000 over Q1 of last year, reflecting strong business from our largest and most strategic corporate relationships, and we're starting to see the payoff of these investments we've made in the area last year. For example, our two largest deals in the quarter were in financial services and the government sector, where we have specific vertical focuses. 
We saw strong demand for our network solutions in Q1, and sales were up 14% year-over-year. The focus we have put on cross selling our best-of-breed portfolio is delivering solid results. And looking ahead, there continues to be great opportunity. You've also seen us bring terrific, new network products out already this year, including our next-generation firewall, called McAfee Firewall Enterprise 8, making the industry's most secure firewall even better. 
I'd also specifically like to note our success in Asia this quarter. Our Corporate sales grew 32% on a constant-normalized basis in this region, building upon the improvements we had in Europe last quarter and our foundation of strong North American sales. 
In Q1, we have modest growth in our Small- and Mid-market business. Over the last few quarters, we have focused effort into consolidating our global telesales infrastructure and reinvigorating our channel programs. While it's still too early to tell, we believe these investments will better align our resources with the opportunities we see in the market. 
Our Corporate results could have been even better had we not have some operational execution challenges. Frankly speaking, one $7 million deal remained in our backlog due to operation challenges and processing the transaction. On top of this, several other deals greater than $1 million, that were originally in our forecast, slipped into Q2 and have now closed. It was disappointing for me and the team not to be able to book these additional transactions. This, coupled with our currency headwinds, brought us into the low end of our overall expectations for the quarter. 
That said, we're seeing an economic recovery bring spending back to more normalized levels compared to this time last year. Along with our technology peers, we believe that IT spending is improving, and the security market should continue its historic trend about pacing the overall IT market rate of growth. The return to a more stable economic environment and more stabilized budgets will benefit McAfee, and our business remains strong. 
Now let me hand it over to Rocky for his additional financial detail, and then I'll come back with some comments on our Q2 outlook. Rocky?"
32053,99506779,58670,"McAfee, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","McAfee LLC","Executives","Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter of 2010 was both rewarding and challenging for McAfee, and we achieved double-digit revenue growth, solid profitability and record operating cash flow. We have worked very hard over the last few",1009,"Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter of 2010 was both rewarding and challenging for McAfee, and we achieved double-digit revenue growth, solid profitability and record operating cash flow. We have worked very hard over the last few years to diversify our business model and bring leading, comprehensive security solutions to customers that span the marketplace from the enterprise to consumers around the world. 
We've successfully integrated several acquisitions to expand our market opportunity, while focusing on improving our global operations and the efficiency of our infrastructure. Dave has already highlighted some areas of focus from this quarter, and I will now take you through more of the financial results. 
Turning to our Q1 results, we delivered record first quarter revenue of $503 million, up 12% year-over-year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, currency had a negative impact of $12 million. This headwind was approximately $3 million more than we originally forecasted, as the dollar strengthened through the quarter. These results include a positive year-over-year impact from currency of approximately $11 million. 
On a geographic basis, McAfee achieved double-digit year-over-year growth in nearly all of our geographies. North American revenue in Q1 was $284 million, up 12% from last year and accounted for 57% of consolidated revenue. International revenue reached a record of $219 million, up 13% over last year and accounted for 43% of consolidated revenue. 
As reported in U.S. dollars, revenue results in our international geographies, compared to Q1 2009, showed Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 14%; Asia Pacific grew 22%; Latin America grew 17%; and Japan grew 3%. For the first quarter, approximately 79% of total revenue came from deferred revenue off the balance sheet, and approximately 91% of first quarter revenue was recurring in nature. 
Looking at our Corporate business, we delivered revenue of $313 million, up 13% year-over-year. Our Consumer business had an exceptional quarter with record revenue of $190 million, up 11% year-over-year. We also achieved record sales, which were up 17% over Q1 last year on a constant-normalized basis and reflecting the success of our diverse consumer strategy. 
Turning to other highlights from the remainder of the income statement, non-GAAP gross profit margin for the first quarter was 78.1%. Year-over-year, strong product margins were offset by a higher mix from our Network business and increased infrastructure costs and investments in improving our customer support. These investments will scale with future revenues, and we're looking forward to continue to improve the quality of our customer experience and expense efficiency, which will provide improved financial performance. 
Q1 non-GAAP operating income was $127 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 25.2% within our expected margin range and despite foreign currency headwinds. An important element to achieving McAfee's long-term growth potential is expanding our worldwide footprint and realizing the benefit our investment in new markets. For example, in the quarter, we opened up our new Cork facility to expand our sales capacity in Europe, Africa and Asia. We are pleased with the progress of our infrastructure improvements and also with the quality of the teams and partners we have developed globally. 
During the quarter, we also continued to make operational investments and improvements in our sales infrastructure with the migration of our consumer commerce platform to a highly scalable world-class operation structure, launching the first phase of our CRM [customer relationships management] platform and continuing the rollout of our redesigned global telesales operation. We are encouraged by the early results of these programs.  
In addition, we continue to reshape our go-to-market headcount and resources to focus on those markets and customers, which provide us the best growth opportunities. As of March 31, we had 6,095 employees worldwide. Year-to-date, we have continued to increase our sales capacity, streamline our acquired company's operations and shipped resources to more cost-effective locations. 
We remained focused on striking the right balance between strategic investments in our future growth and improving operational efficiencies. We will continue this strategy in Q2 and for the remainder of the year to ensure our cost structure is aligned with our double-digit growth and profitability goals and to help partially offset continued currency headwinds. 
Moving on, Q1 non-GAAP net income was $96 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.60, up 6% year-over-year. This includes approximately a penny of additional currency headwind than we originally forecasted. And in our Q1, our GAAP tax rate was 28%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. 
Turning to a few items on the balance sheet. Net accounts receivable balance at the end of the first quarter 2010 was $231 million, compared with $294 million for the fourth quarter. Days sales outstanding were 41 days for the first quarter 2010 as a result of strong cash collections, which reflects the benefit of our improved operational process. 
Prepaid expenses, deferred costs of revenue and other current assets was $273 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to increases in marketing spend. Total overall deferred cost of revenue and prepaid expenses, primarily associated with revenue sharing and royalty arrangements, were $270 million and slightly down sequentially. 
Deferred revenue at the end of Q1 was $1.38 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Currency fluctuations had a negative impact of $34 million quarter-over-quarter and a positive impact of $9 million on deferred revenue year-over-year. 
We ended the first quarter with $1.1 billion in short-term deferred revenue, down $7 million, sequentially; long-term deferred revenue was $317 million, down $22 million, due to the negative $34 million foreign exchange impact quarter-to-quarter. The composition of our deferred revenue balance at the end of the first quarter 2010 was 65%, related to Corporate and 35% to Consumer. 
Finally, I'm especially pleased that we generated record operating cash flow of $157 million, which reflects our focus on managing our balance sheet as well as the success of our Consumer business. Under our stock buyback plan, we purchased approximately 3.7 million shares for $150 million during the quarter. Ending cash and marketable securities at quarter end was $902 million. And now, I'll turn it back over to Dave for closing comments."

To summarize and move into our outlook, we remain very excited about the opportunities we see in 2010.

To summarize and move into our outlook, we remain very excited about the opportunities we see in 2010. As we started off this year, there were a number of factors driving my confidence and optimism that remain true today. Economic conditions have stabilized. IT budgets are there, and security remains a top priority. The threat environment continues to escalate. At McAfee, we saw more malware come into our labs in 2009 than in the previous years combined. 
In 2009, we added nearly 17 million pieces of new malware to our collection. That's more than 45,000 pieces a day. The increasingly complex regulatory environments around the globe on issues such as data breaches, payment card information and other customer data is just another driver of security decisions we expect to continue. 
The overall risk of the cyber attack is compounded at a global proliferation of network devices. My counterpart at Ericsson recently predicted that by the end of year 2020, there'll be 50 billion devices connected to the Internet. It is an incredible number of devices to manage and to protect, especially when you consider that today, there's about 5 billion IP-connected devices. Enterprises continue to make standardization decisions on security, benefiting McAfee as we offer the industry's most comprehensive, interlocked security solution across end points, network and cloud. 
Looking at McAfee's business, we have the right ingredients to continue to be the leader in the market. We have a very strong product cycle coming and product portfolio to help protect customers from consumers to enterprise, from network to end point, from individual PCs to the cloud. We've got an incredible network of partners and alliances across our business, covering many key growth verticals of government, telecommunications and technology. 
A few examples such as: We recently announced a network partnership with Riverbed and Brocade; the Security Innovation Alliance has now surpassed the 100 partners; and we recently announced our Cloud Secure program, a program for Software-as-a-Service (sic) [Security-as-a-Service] providers to add additional security to their cloud deployments. 
I'm also sure many of you will like a quick update on our CFO search. The good news is that we're close to hiring a new executive team member, and I look forward to announcing a decision soon. 
Now turning to our guidance for the second quarter of 2010. We expect to achieve revenue in the range of $500 million to $520 million, non-GAAP operating income margin in the range of 24% to 26% and non-GAAP earnings per share in a range of $0.58 to $0.62 per share on a fully diluted basis. 
Our outlook for Q2 2010 is based on fully diluted share count in the range of 158 million to 160 million shares, compared to a fully diluted share count of 158 million shares in Q2 2009, and we're assuming an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 24%. 
To give you a little more color on our Q2 non-GAAP guidance assumptions, we estimate $0.04 to $0.05 per share of foreign currency headwind when compared with our first quarter 2010 guidance. The continuing purchases under our stock repurchase program and a $0.01 to $0.02 per share impact related to our recent faulty signature update. 
What I'm referring to in this last point is the anticipated impact associated with the signature update we had last week. While responding to a new global threat to Windows PCs that attacks critical operating system components, an error, specifically, the release of a faulty DAT file, caused some of our customer computers to be rendered inoperable. As a result, we expect some negative impact resulting from getting our customers back up and running. I'm extremely proud of how the McAfee team responded and contained this issue, and it's largely behind us today. 
While we're pleased with the performance in many parts of our business, we're taking measures to correct our execution challenges, including aligning our business operations and our cost structure appropriately. We will continue this strategy in Q2 and for the remainder of the year to ensure our cost structure is aligned with our double-digit growth and profitability goals and to help offset continued currency headwinds. The estimated cost reduction to our operating model is approximately $20 million. 
And in closing, I hope you had a good understanding of the opportunity McAfee has this year: stabilizing global economy, the security market poised to grow faster than overall IT; and exponential growth threats and regulations and devices. 
Simply put, the opportunity of security is one that still have a lot of greenfield and is a great business to be in. I firmly believe McAfee is very competitively positioned in this business with a good diversified model, strong product portfolio, top-notch partners and strategic alliances and a very strong team. In fact in the time I've been at McAfee, I've never been more encouraged by the opportunities we see for this company. 
On behalf of the executive management team, I want to thank all the employees worldwide for their hard work and continued performance. Thank you. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kate."

Since it came in, even a couple of weeks before the end of the quarter, it was a pretty complex deal to ship. We ended up having one component of over 25 components. One of those components didn't ship. Because of that, we couldn't take it to revenue. We couldn't even put it in deferred revenue, and hence, it's in backlog. So unfortunately, a small shipping sort of operations snafu caused us a pretty large transaction, kind of one of the culprits here in the quarter. I would tell you there is a number of other deals that came in, some of which came in just after the cutoff. Unfortunately, they also account for Q2. And again, a little disappointment at our Corporate sales execution. Our operation execution take full responsibility. We had quite a bit of business. We had plenty of business, quite honestly, to make and beat the quarter. And then coupled with currency headwind, I mean, just look those two components, really, $0.03 EPS just on that, quarter-over-quarter. When you look at just from our guide, another penny. When you look at the revenue and the bookings impact, currency in these deals slips. That's why I went out of my way, Adam, to really say we feel really good about our business. We see a lot of good pipeline. We see a great opportunity here as a company. We're expanding. We're really motivated, but it is what it is, and we're disappointed with the quarter, of course, and we'll do better as we move forward."

And certainly, when you look at just that, it's causing us to want to make sure we've realigned our cost model to reflect some of that. That's just one factor. I think the second factor here is we have been aggressively hiring. If you look at just last year, 2008 to 2009, we added nearly 600-plus employees to the company. We continue to hire sales capacity in through to Q1, and we're netting more sales capacity into the model. We're really trying to now build and integrate acquisitions and move those acquisition integrations a little faster if we can. If you immediately try to hold on to the accountability of your business units as long as you can as the model's going, I think it's time for us to kind of phase-two integrate some of our acquisitions, recognize some of the synergy off of that we can do, and quite honestly, we think we can even keep or raise our UAR [ph] capacity, what we call unique capacity for field, as we go through all of this.

We almost have a tale of two cities here, a little bit in the Q1 quarter. I couldn't say enough good things about the trends I'm seeing in our consumer model. It really up constant normalize in the nearly 20%, 11% on revenue. But you know that on a bookings basis, it's much higher. We're seeing very steady registration rates. The partnerships are working. We're just getting more partners involved, like Verizon's and AT&T is coming online, the Facebook ones, the Adobe ones, really some good optimism in the next few quarters on that. And that's still largely on PC-based devices. Some of the announcements we made there is we've just really got a brand new Macintosh product. We've got four more products in the pipeline coming. We talked a little bit about the identity area, identity protection, the collaboration areas. The nice part here is we've got new partnerships, and we got new products. And then to your point, mobile, I just think this is a massive opportunity. We just launched a brand-new product on the Android platform. And of course, this is really after the Wi-Fi access threat portion because again, this device is just like any other device. Once you're Wi-Fi enabled, you have a bunch of threats. We launched our first big pilot with the largest telecommunications company in Korea, and we hope to continue to roll that out. We're pretty optimistic the mobile market is a good one. It will take us a few quarters to really engage it, but we've got some products now, we've got some partnerships now and we're running."

So you try and look at the true nature of your sales, and this is where we really try to call out that we've been having strong growth in our business model. Now we said 11% overall sales growth and 5% up, constant normalized. So just the true, without exchange impact and without acquisitions impact, what we've got. And of course, this has been very strong for us. In Consumer was 17% constant normalized on a pretty positive number. So that's a little bit -- and of course, when you said double digit, I alluded to this at the end that we're realigning our cost structure.

So we feel like we're looking at things in a very conservative light. In addition, the underlying theme to our cost performance or efficiency in this back half of the year, we're expecting to continue to see a sustained weak FX environment relative to foreign currencies. And so we're aligning the costs as David talked about, assuming we continue to see like a 1.30 or a 1.31 euro rate. Now one thing that's also hindered us, particularly in the first quarter because we've actually talked about foreign exchange in almost every prior quarter, we typically have a natural hedge in our foreign currency position between revenues and expenses. Unfortunately, some of our foreign currency expenses are outside of the European theater like India and other parts of Asia. Those currencies actually strengthened, and those are only an expense source so those currencies strengthen during the quarter which was anti to the normal trend of prior quarters, and we lost our natural hedge. So we're continuing to assess if we need to adjust our foreign exchange strategies, but to the extent those currencies return to their normal behavior and perhaps the volatility of the euro corrects itself, we will see a return to our natural hedge position."

We had a good growth in that segment of the market. Number of transaction, absolute dollar amount, standardization decisions felt really good. Really where the weakness was here in this particular quarter was in some of the small, mid as well, under $100,000 had some weakness there, as well as I mentioned, a $7 million transaction and a number of others that just slipped out of our fingers into the next day.

When it comes to SMB, again, it's a bunch of different things going on and in different continents. So I apologize for the complex question. When we look at our endpoint side of the SMB, we probably couldn't be happier that, that's going really well, kind of getting good strong double-digit growth to the endpoint side. And the way this keeps maturing is -- our Total Protection Suite upgrades from AB to the full suite continues to play out very nicely in that mid, small. Probably our biggest challenge is in our Appliance business, Network business into that sector as well as the rest. And then when you jump over to other theaters or other international segments, we've got our softness and really where we've got to continue to execute. Now I did try to call out. I've been working on this pretty hard for a few months as has the whole sales teams. We built a whole new telecenter Cork, Ireland that Rocky alluded to, to try to bring online a telesales group. Largely, they were just getting started in Q1. I mean, most just got hired, very little productivity and really, we took most of the cost in Q1 and very little productivity so far. But having said that, telesales getting going. Our channel program is getting going and our pretty heavy focus on that mid and small. I think we'll improve there. But again, Q1, it was not and of course, that was it. And I would say a little bit more of we have some special programs in Q4 that pumped that mid and small. That probably cost us a little dip back down in Q1. So we hope Q2 comes back strong, and we're, let's say, maniacally focused on execution here."

Just maybe to add on to Rocky a little bit, Dell has been a fabulous partner for us and as have our other partners that we've worked on hard. Hopefully, we've seen a pretty diversified balance now as you look at that business. It really is working. We've got good strong telcos. I kind of called out that 73% increase with AT&T specifically and the subscriber base with them. That's been very solid. When you start to look at Adobe and others, it's really balancing well. We've been very encouraged with the model here and even with Dell, that profitability model, that contract we did last year, now, that's behind us, and we continue to look at other ways to do things with Dell. They've been a very strong partner and hopefully, we'll even see more from them in the future. When it comes to kind of consumer and corporate theater base, consumer wise, it was very strong internationally. And we were up substantially all over the world and that's been a good part of it. Third quarter in a row in Europe, over 20% in sales growth. Of course Asia was up even more than that, almost 60%. When you look at some of the other regions, consumer is really model's beginning to work well. And so a 26% year-over-year just in international on the consumer side. On the corporate side, it was pretty similar all around. Europe is improving, Asia Pac did quite well. I called that one out in corporate. But North America and Europe were almost the same, predominantly on slipped deals and a couple of things that we just didn't get in at the end of the quarter. So I've been pleased with Europe improving, especially from a corporate point of view. And I wouldn't call that out any differently than any other theater right now in terms of the Q1 performance. We think we've kind of right at the boat, got it going, and now we just got to really drive for growth in this coming quarter."

Complexity of us growing into a hardware business and software business, perpetual license models, subscription license models sometimes shows its side. I don't think it changes necessarily our sales and bookings growth and some of the things that have are happening overall. I mean we continue to grow as a company pretty substantially. How much we can get in the door and recognize as revenues sometimes has its challenges. We're doing everything we can to continue to improve and build upon that, and you can imagine sometimes deals come in at the end of the quarter, not always the easiest being a hardware company trying to ship stuff at the end of the quarter when they come in with an hour to go or with a couple of hours to go. Again, trying not to make an excuse just to say that we've got work to do to mature ourselves as a strong execution company when it comes to both finance and operations. When it comes to SMB, I would tell you, we need to keep working hard at the enterprise endpoint. We've got a little bit more than 50% of our overall AV to ToPS upgrades already occurred in our install base. And you kind of look about half of them already upgrade, and you look at the enterprise, it's a much higher percent in that high end. That's why the Network business is becoming important to the company. When you look at the SMB in mid, we'd still got a lot of strong cycles in the ToPS end point side of our business, and that's why I keep calling out that remaining 50% of our installed base, we can convert. A lot of it sits in that middle-market segment. So we're going keep focusing in and make sure we've got the right product portfolios, but I think you're reading it the right way. And of course, we've got a number of new products hooked up to ePO. As you know, that's a key. We just got solid core hooked up. We've got a number of risk and compliance products now. When I say hooked up, it's integrated more fully and of course, now we've got a lot of our network products integrated into ePO, which will be a driver for us. So I still think quite honestly, the pipeline's fantastic. We've got a lot of big deals and the biggest deals we've ever seen. We've got a very motivated sales force, and we just got to put Q1 behind us and drive."

When it comes to the mix on the Consumer side, we continue to see us being able to optimize and work with the netbook and the slates. And so to the new types of devices coming out, the conversion rates have been improving especially as the education improves in the notebook arena. The netbook is just like any other device, it accesses the Internet, it has your identity on it, it basically is a computing environment that essentially has the same risks and threats as anything else. Just because it's cheaper from an overall dollar amount, doesn't mean the threats are changing. So from an educational point of view, that makes us get better conversion rates, and I would tell you I didn't see really any change in terms of our conversion rates overall.

I would tell you we also got a whole suite of consumer products coming as I mentioned. And with the distribution we have, that's all good there. A whole new ePO product coming, and then of course a bunch of products for SMB. But I would tell you again, we've got channel programs, and telesales is a bit of our culprit in the mid-market still in the SMB. We've got to mature that especially internationally, and we'll put the money in place in Q1. We just got to get the fruits now in the coming quarters."

From a market share standpoint on the enterprise, I mean, Dave probably has much to say than I do on that.

I'd like to see that basically, other competitor is growing at that rate. And I feel like we've taken market share. We're getting a lot of strategic corporate relationships there. The Networks business is paying off, and we've been doing okay. And then if you added to it to the large deal, the $7 million deal and a bunch of other slipped deals, that segment feels good.

I would tell you we continue to mature our North American markets and continue to spend money on infrastructure to improve that segment of the market, particularly what we call ToPS service which is our in-the-cloud model for both anti-malware as well as other e-mail Web types of services for that space.

It included a two-year subscription extension as well as Starbucks gift cards and a repair reimbursement kind of model, package to really say sorry for those efforts.

Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report the 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit, year-over-year revenue growth for McAfee with revenue of $503 million, up 12%; deferred revenue of $1.4 billion, up 9%; cash flow from operations hitting a record $157 million; non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.60; and sales in the quarter, up 11% and up 5% on a constant-normalized basis. 
In the aggregate, compared to the fourth quarter, first quarter foreign exchange headwind negatively impacted our sales by $15 million, revenue by $12 million and non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.03. Also, compared to our first quarter guidance, we saw an additional headwind of $3 million in revenue and a penny in non-GAAP earnings per share as the U.S. dollar strengthened, more than we anticipated versus the euro and British pound. 
Looking at the first quarter 2010 business results for McAfee, we're especially pleased with our record Consumer business performance. Consumer revenue grew 11% year-over-year to a record $190 million, and our sales grew 17% year-over-year on a constant-normalized basis. We saw growth in all areas of the Global Consumer business, with double-digit growth in North America and more than 26% growth in our International Consumer business with Europe, Middle East and Africa achieving its third quarter in a row of greater than 20% year-over-year sales growth. These continued strong results in our Consumer segment proved that our investments in this business have been effective, and our shared risk model continues to be very profitable for both McAfee and our partners. As a result, we continue to take market share from our competitors. 
Our Consumer team had many exciting accomplishments during the quarter, executing on our strategy of protecting consumers where they need it: their PCs, the Web and mobile devices. Additionally, we continue to execute on our balanced partnership model with PC OEMs, Internet service providers, telecommunications companies, financial services, retail, social networks and portals on a global basis. 
During the quarter, we launched our new ISP [Internet service provider] offerings with Verizon in the U.S. and Yahoo BB in Japan. We continued our optimized programs with AT&T, generating a year-over-year 73% increase in our subscriber base with them. We also launched our new portal offerings with Mail.com and accumulated more than 170,000 Facebook fans as their exclusive security partner. We also recorded 3.2 million downloads of our securities scanner in conjunction with Adobe Systems partnership and announced a new agreement with SK Telecom in South Korea for our new Google Android mobile product. 
We generated more than $22 billion McAfee SECURE trustmark impressions and released our new ToPS for Mac product to our first partners. We launched a major upgrade to our core security suites, including a new user interface and significant performance improvements that was well welcomed with great reviews, including a 4.5-star review with CNET, higher than our major competitor. 
And finally, I'm excited about the future products and services we have planned this year to extend the subscription life cycle and lifetime value relationship with our consumers. These new products and services include identity protection, collaboration, transactional security and extended smart phone mobile offerings. 
And now, let me provide some color on our Corporate business. We achieved record first quarter revenue on our Corporate segment of $313 million, up 13% year-over-year. There was some real bright spots in this business this quarter. Customer demand was strong, and we experienced increased contract lengths without notable impact to discounting, and we had a strong pipeline at the end of the quarter. 
During the quarter, we closed 376 deals greater than $100,000 in value. Within this, we have 56 deals greater than $500,000 in value and 19 deals greater than $1 million in value. We saw 17% growth in the sales value of deals greater than $100,000 over Q1 of last year, reflecting strong business from our largest and most strategic corporate relationships, and we're starting to see the payoff of these investments we've made in the area last year. For example, our two largest deals in the quarter were in financial services and the government sector, where we have specific vertical focuses. 
We saw strong demand for our network solutions in Q1, and sales were up 14% year-over-year. The focus we have put on cross selling our best-of-breed portfolio is delivering solid results. And looking ahead, there continues to be great opportunity. You've also seen us bring terrific, new network products out already this year, including our next-generation firewall, called McAfee Firewall Enterprise 8, making the industry's most secure firewall even better. 
I'd also specifically like to note our success in Asia this quarter. Our Corporate sales grew 32% on a constant-normalized basis in this region, building upon the improvements we had in Europe last quarter and our foundation of strong North American sales. 
In Q1, we have modest growth in our Small- and Mid-market business. Over the last few quarters, we have focused effort into consolidating our global telesales infrastructure and reinvigorating our channel programs. While it's still too early to tell, we believe these investments will better align our resources with the opportunities we see in the market. 
Our Corporate results could have been even better had we not have some operational execution challenges. Frankly speaking, one $7 million deal remained in our backlog due to operation challenges and processing the transaction. On top of this, several other deals greater than $1 million, that were originally in our forecast, slipped into Q2 and have now closed. It was disappointing for me and the team not to be able to book these additional transactions. This, coupled with our currency headwinds, brought us into the low end of our overall expectations for the quarter. 
That said, we're seeing an economic recovery bring spending back to more normalized levels compared to this time last year. Along with our technology peers, we believe that IT spending is improving, and the security market should continue its historic trend about pacing the overall IT market rate of growth. The return to a more stable economic environment and more stabilized budgets will benefit McAfee, and our business remains strong. 
Now let me hand it over to Rocky for his additional financial detail, and then I'll come back with some comments on our Q2 outlook. Rocky?

The first quarter of 2010 was both rewarding and challenging for McAfee, and we achieved double-digit revenue growth, solid profitability and record operating cash flow. We have worked very hard over the last few",1009,"Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter of 2010 was both rewarding and challenging for McAfee, and we achieved double-digit revenue growth, solid profitability and record operating cash flow. We have worked very hard over the last few years to diversify our business model and bring leading, comprehensive security solutions to customers that span the marketplace from the enterprise to consumers around the world. 
We've successfully integrated several acquisitions to expand our market opportunity, while focusing on improving our global operations and the efficiency of our infrastructure. Dave has already highlighted some areas of focus from this quarter, and I will now take you through more of the financial results. 
Turning to our Q1 results, we delivered record first quarter revenue of $503 million, up 12% year-over-year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, currency had a negative impact of $12 million. This headwind was approximately $3 million more than we originally forecasted, as the dollar strengthened through the quarter. These results include a positive year-over-year impact from currency of approximately $11 million. 
On a geographic basis, McAfee achieved double-digit year-over-year growth in nearly all of our geographies. North American revenue in Q1 was $284 million, up 12% from last year and accounted for 57% of consolidated revenue. International revenue reached a record of $219 million, up 13% over last year and accounted for 43% of consolidated revenue. 
As reported in U.S. dollars, revenue results in our international geographies, compared to Q1 2009, showed Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 14%; Asia Pacific grew 22%; Latin America grew 17%; and Japan grew 3%. For the first quarter, approximately 79% of total revenue came from deferred revenue off the balance sheet, and approximately 91% of first quarter revenue was recurring in nature. 
Looking at our Corporate business, we delivered revenue of $313 million, up 13% year-over-year. Our Consumer business had an exceptional quarter with record revenue of $190 million, up 11% year-over-year. We also achieved record sales, which were up 17% over Q1 last year on a constant-normalized basis and reflecting the success of our diverse consumer strategy. 
Turning to other highlights from the remainder of the income statement, non-GAAP gross profit margin for the first quarter was 78.1%. Year-over-year, strong product margins were offset by a higher mix from our Network business and increased infrastructure costs and investments in improving our customer support. These investments will scale with future revenues, and we're looking forward to continue to improve the quality of our customer experience and expense efficiency, which will provide improved financial performance. 
Q1 non-GAAP operating income was $127 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 25.2% within our expected margin range and despite foreign currency headwinds. An important element to achieving McAfee's long-term growth potential is expanding our worldwide footprint and realizing the benefit our investment in new markets. For example, in the quarter, we opened up our new Cork facility to expand our sales capacity in Europe, Africa and Asia. We are pleased with the progress of our infrastructure improvements and also with the quality of the teams and partners we have developed globally. 
During the quarter, we also continued to make operational investments and improvements in our sales infrastructure with the migration of our consumer commerce platform to a highly scalable world-class operation structure, launching the first phase of our CRM [customer relationships management] platform and continuing the rollout of our redesigned global telesales operation. We are encouraged by the early results of these programs.  
In addition, we continue to reshape our go-to-market headcount and resources to focus on those markets and customers, which provide us the best growth opportunities. As of March 31, we had 6,095 employees worldwide. Year-to-date, we have continued to increase our sales capacity, streamline our acquired company's operations and shipped resources to more cost-effective locations. 
We remained focused on striking the right balance between strategic investments in our future growth and improving operational efficiencies. We will continue this strategy in Q2 and for the remainder of the year to ensure our cost structure is aligned with our double-digit growth and profitability goals and to help partially offset continued currency headwinds. 
Moving on, Q1 non-GAAP net income was $96 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.60, up 6% year-over-year. This includes approximately a penny of additional currency headwind than we originally forecasted. And in our Q1, our GAAP tax rate was 28%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. 
Turning to a few items on the balance sheet. Net accounts receivable balance at the end of the first quarter 2010 was $231 million, compared with $294 million for the fourth quarter. Days sales outstanding were 41 days for the first quarter 2010 as a result of strong cash collections, which reflects the benefit of our improved operational process. 
Prepaid expenses, deferred costs of revenue and other current assets was $273 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to increases in marketing spend. Total overall deferred cost of revenue and prepaid expenses, primarily associated with revenue sharing and royalty arrangements, were $270 million and slightly down sequentially. 
Deferred revenue at the end of Q1 was $1.38 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Currency fluctuations had a negative impact of $34 million quarter-over-quarter and a positive impact of $9 million on deferred revenue year-over-year. 
We ended the first quarter with $1.1 billion in short-term deferred revenue, down $7 million, sequentially; long-term deferred revenue was $317 million, down $22 million, due to the negative $34 million foreign exchange impact quarter-to-quarter. The composition of our deferred revenue balance at the end of the first quarter 2010 was 65%, related to Corporate and 35% to Consumer. 
Finally, I'm especially pleased that we generated record operating cash flow of $157 million, which reflects our focus on managing our balance sheet as well as the success of our Consumer business. Under our stock buyback plan, we purchased approximately 3.7 million shares for $150 million during the quarter. Ending cash and marketable securities at quarter end was $902 million. And now, I'll turn it back over to Dave for closing comments.

To summarize and move into our outlook, we remain very excited about the opportunities we see in 2010. As we started off this year, there were a number of factors driving my confidence and optimism that remain true today. Economi",850,"All right. Thanks, Rocky. To summarize and move into our outlook, we remain very excited about the opportunities we see in 2010. As we started off this year, there were a number of factors driving my confidence and optimism that remain true today. Economic conditions have stabilized. IT budgets are there, and security remains a top priority. The threat environment continues to escalate. At McAfee, we saw more malware come into our labs in 2009 than in the previous years combined. 
In 2009, we added nearly 17 million pieces of new malware to our collection. That's more than 45,000 pieces a day. The increasingly complex regulatory environments around the globe on issues such as data breaches, payment card information and other customer data is just another driver of security decisions we expect to continue. 
The overall risk of the cyber attack is compounded at a global proliferation of network devices. My counterpart at Ericsson recently predicted that by the end of year 2020, there'll be 50 billion devices connected to the Internet. It is an incredible number of devices to manage and to protect, especially when you consider that today, there's about 5 billion IP-connected devices. Enterprises continue to make standardization decisions on security, benefiting McAfee as we offer the industry's most comprehensive, interlocked security solution across end points, network and cloud. 
Looking at McAfee's business, we have the right ingredients to continue to be the leader in the market. We have a very strong product cycle coming and product portfolio to help protect customers from consumers to enterprise, from network to end point, from individual PCs to the cloud. We've got an incredible network of partners and alliances across our business, covering many key growth verticals of government, telecommunications and technology. 
A few examples such as: We recently announced a network partnership with Riverbed and Brocade; the Security Innovation Alliance has now surpassed the 100 partners; and we recently announced our Cloud Secure program, a program for Software-as-a-Service (sic) [Security-as-a-Service] providers to add additional security to their cloud deployments. 
I'm also sure many of you will like a quick update on our CFO search. The good news is that we're close to hiring a new executive team member, and I look forward to announcing a decision soon. 
Now turning to our guidance for the second quarter of 2010. We expect to achieve revenue in the range of $500 million to $520 million, non-GAAP operating income margin in the range of 24% to 26% and non-GAAP earnings per share in a range of $0.58 to $0.62 per share on a fully diluted basis. 
Our outlook for Q2 2010 is based on fully diluted share count in the range of 158 million to 160 million shares, compared to a fully diluted share count of 158 million shares in Q2 2009, and we're assuming an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 24%. 
To give you a little more color on our Q2 non-GAAP guidance assumptions, we estimate $0.04 to $0.05 per share of foreign currency headwind when compared with our first quarter 2010 guidance. The continuing purchases under our stock repurchase program and a $0.01 to $0.02 per share impact related to our recent faulty signature update. 
What I'm referring to in this last point is the anticipated impact associated with the signature update we had last week. While responding to a new global threat to Windows PCs that attacks critical operating system components, an error, specifically, the release of a faulty DAT file, caused some of our customer computers to be rendered inoperable. As a result, we expect some negative impact resulting from getting our customers back up and running. I'm extremely proud of how the McAfee team responded and contained this issue, and it's largely behind us today. 
While we're pleased with the performance in many parts of our business, we're taking measures to correct our execution challenges, including aligning our business operations and our cost structure appropriately. We will continue this strategy in Q2 and for the remainder of the year to ensure our cost structure is aligned with our double-digit growth and profitability goals and to help offset continued currency headwinds. The estimated cost reduction to our operating model is approximately $20 million. 
And in closing, I hope you had a good understanding of the opportunity McAfee has this year: stabilizing global economy, the security market poised to grow faster than overall IT; and exponential growth threats and regulations and devices. 
Simply put, the opportunity of security is one that still have a lot of greenfield and is a great business to be in. I firmly believe McAfee is very competitively positioned in this business with a good diversified model, strong product portfolio, top-notch partners and strategic alliances and a very strong team. In fact in the time I've been at McAfee, I've never been more encouraged by the opportunities we see for this company. 
On behalf of the executive management team, I want to thank all the employees worldwide for their hard work and continued performance. Thank you. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kate.

Since it came in, even a couple of weeks before the end of the quarter, it was a pretty complex deal to ship. We ended up having one component of over 25 components. One of those components didn't ship. Because of that, we couldn't take it to revenue. We couldn't even put it in deferred revenue, and hence, it's in backlog. So unfortunately, a small shipping sort of operations snafu caused us a pretty large transaction, kind of one of the culprits here in the quarter. I would tell you there is a number of other deals that came in, some of which came in just after the cutoff. Unfortunately, they also account for Q2. And again, a little disappointment at our Corporate sales execution. Our operation execution take full responsibility. We had quite a bit of business. We had plenty of business, quite honestly, to make and beat the quarter. And then coupled with currency headwind, I mean, just look those two components, really, $0.03 EPS just on that, quarter-over-quarter. When you look at just from our guide, another penny. When you look at the revenue and the bookings impact, currency in these deals slips. That's why I went out of my way, Adam, to really say we feel really good about our business. We see a lot of good pipeline. We see a great opportunity here as a company. We're expanding. We're really motivated, but it is what it is, and we're disappointed with the quarter, of course, and we'll do better as we move forward.

And certainly, when you look at just that, it's causing us to want to make sure we've realigned our cost model to reflect some of that. That's just one factor. I think the second factor here is we have been aggressively hiring. If you look at just last year, 2008 to 2009, we added nearly 600-plus employees to the company. We continue to hire sales capacity in through to Q1, and we're netting more sales capacity into the model. We're really trying to now build and integrate acquisitions and move those acquisition integrations a little faster if we can. If you immediately try to hold on to the accountability of your business units as long as you can as the model's going, I think it's time for us to kind of phase-two integrate some of our acquisitions, recognize some of the synergy off of that we can do, and quite honestly, we think we can even keep or raise our UAR [ph] capacity, what we call unique capacity for field, as we go through all of this.

And that's still largely on PC-based devices. Some of the announcements we made there is we've just really got a brand new Macintosh product. We've got four more products in the pipeline coming. We talked a little bit about the identity area, identity protection, the collaboration areas. The nice part here is we've got new partnerships, and we got new products. And then to your point, mobile, I just think this is a massive opportunity. We just launched a brand-new product on the Android platform. And of course, this is really after the Wi-Fi access threat portion because again, this device is just like any other device. Once you're Wi-Fi enabled, you have a bunch of threats.

Now one thing that's also hindered us, particularly in the first quarter because we've actually talked about foreign exchange in almost every prior quarter, we typically have a natural hedge in our foreign currency position between revenues and expenses. Unfortunately, some of our foreign currency expenses are outside of the European theater like India and other parts of Asia. Those currencies actually strengthened, and those are only an expense source so those currencies strengthen during the quarter which was anti to the normal trend of prior quarters, and we lost our natural hedge. So we're continuing to assess if we need to adjust our foreign exchange strategies, but to the extent those currencies return to their normal behavior and perhaps the volatility of the euro corrects itself, we will see a return to our natural hedge position.

Or are you having to just incur additional expenses to help clean up some of the issues from the past couple of weeks?

And we wanted to make sure we kind of call that out, so that you could kind of look at that as an extra-ordinary item a bit. But it does hit our non-GAAP EPS to some cost point of view. When it comes to SMB, again, it's a bunch of different things going on and in different continents. So I apologize for the complex question. When we look at our endpoint side of the SMB, we probably couldn't be happier that, that's going really well, kind of getting good strong double-digit growth to the endpoint side. And the way this keeps maturing is -- our Total Protection Suite upgrades from AB to the full suite continues to play out very nicely in that mid, small. Probably our biggest challenge is in our Appliance business, Network business into that sector as well as the rest. And then when you jump over to other theaters or other international segments, we've got our softness and really where we've got to continue to execute. Now I did try to call out. I've been working on this pretty hard for a few months as has the whole sales teams. We built a whole new telecenter Cork, Ireland that Rocky alluded to, to try to bring online a telesales group. Largely, they were just getting started in Q1. I mean, most just got hired, very little productivity and really, we took most of the cost in Q1 and very little productivity so far. But having said that, telesales getting going. Our channel program is getting going and our pretty heavy focus on that mid and small. I think we'll improve there. But again, Q1, it was not and of course, that was it. And I would say a little bit more of we have some special programs in Q4 that pumped that mid and small. That probably cost us a little dip back down in Q1. So we hope Q2 comes back strong, and we're, let's say, maniacally focused on execution here.

Just maybe to add on to Rocky a little bit, Dell has been a fabulous partner for us and as have our other partners that we've worked on hard. Hopefully, we've seen a pretty diversified balance now as you look at that business. It really is working. We've got good strong telcos. I kind of called out that 73% increase with AT&T specifically and the subscriber base with them. That's been very solid. When you start to look at Adobe and others, it's really balancing well. We've been very encouraged with the model here and even with Dell, that profitability model, that contract we did last year, now, that's behind us, and we continue to look at other ways to do things with Dell. They've been a very strong partner and hopefully, we'll even see more from them in the future. When it comes to kind of consumer and corporate theater base, consumer wise, it was very strong internationally. And we were up substantially all over the world and that's been a good part of it. Third quarter in a row in Europe, over 20% in sales growth. Of course Asia was up even more than that, almost 60%. When you look at some of the other regions, consumer is really model's beginning to work well. And so a 26% year-over-year just in international on the consumer side. On the corporate side, it was pretty similar all around. Europe is improving, Asia Pac did quite well. I called that one out in corporate. But North America and Europe were almost the same, predominantly on slipped deals and a couple of things that we just didn't get in at the end of the quarter. So I've been pleased with Europe improving, especially from a corporate point of view. And I wouldn't call that out any differently than any other theater right now in terms of the Q1 performance. We think we've kind of right at the boat, got it going, and now we just got to really drive for growth in this coming quarter.

Complexity of us growing into a hardware business and software business, perpetual license models, subscription license models sometimes shows its side. I don't think it changes necessarily our sales and bookings growth and some of the things that have are happening overall. I mean we continue to grow as a company pretty substantially. How much we can get in the door and recognize as revenues sometimes has its challenges. We're doing everything we can to continue to improve and build upon that, and you can imagine sometimes deals come in at the end of the quarter, not always the easiest being a hardware company trying to ship stuff at the end of the quarter when they come in with an hour to go or with a couple of hours to go. Again, trying not to make an excuse just to say that we've got work to do to mature ourselves as a strong execution company when it comes to both finance and operations. When it comes to SMB, I would tell you, we need to keep working hard at the enterprise endpoint. We've got a little bit more than 50% of our overall AV to ToPS upgrades already occurred in our install base. And you kind of look about half of them already upgrade, and you look at the enterprise, it's a much higher percent in that high end. That's why the Network business is becoming important to the company. When you look at the SMB in mid, we'd still got a lot of strong cycles in the ToPS end point side of our business, and that's why I keep calling out that remaining 50% of our installed base, we can convert. A lot of it sits in that middle-market segment. So we're going keep focusing in and make sure we've got the right product portfolios, but I think you're reading it the right way. And of course, we've got a number of new products hooked up to ePO. As you know, that's a key. We just got solid core hooked up. We've got a number of risk and compliance products now. When I say hooked up, it's integrated more fully and of course, now we've got a lot of our network products integrated into ePO, which will be a driver for us. So I still think quite honestly, the pipeline's fantastic. We've got a lot of big deals and the biggest deals we've ever seen. We've got a very motivated sales force, and we just got to put Q1 behind us and drive.

In cash flow, it's a part of our goals and our strategy for this year. Certainly, we're trying to make the adjustments from a cost point of view to keep meeting those goals. I kind of alluded to that in the sort of $20 million go-forward operating model adjustments we're making as well. And this is what it takes to be an elite company and that's our strategy. When it comes to the mix on the Consumer side, we continue to see us being able to optimize and work with the netbook and the slates. And so to the new types of devices coming out, the conversion rates have been improving especially as the education improves in the notebook arena. The netbook is just like any other device, it accesses the Internet, it has your identity on it, it basically is a computing environment that essentially has the same risks and threats as anything else. Just because it's cheaper from an overall dollar amount, doesn't mean the threats are changing. So from an educational point of view, that makes us get better conversion rates, and I would tell you I didn't see really any change in terms of our conversion rates overall. If anything, they've gotten actually better, more units, more conversions, build more partners in the Consumer side.

I would tell you I think of all the network product areas, the firewall is going through the biggest refresh cycle. I believe during the economic downturn over the last 18 months or so, most of the infrastructure was not refreshed. The network firewall was one of those product areas that is being refreshed. We added a heck of a lot of features to that product. In addition to be very secure, we have a realtime feed from our cloud intelligence directly to the firewall that can drop traffic and protect the whole perimeter on-the-fly dynamically. We added applications support, kind of one upping the Palo Alto networks to the world in that area and really went after a very powerful and scalable firewall model. So we're happy with that. I would tell you we also got a whole suite of consumer products coming as I mentioned. And with the distribution we have, that's all good there. A whole new ePO product coming, and then of course a bunch of products for SMB.

And of course, we'll always be doing the right thing for those companies, and we have already done that and we think again that this crisis can also turn into a wake-up call for us in a number of ways. When it comes to the Consumer, we offered a straight package for those consumers. It included a two-year subscription extension as well as Starbucks gift cards and a repair reimbursement kind of model, package to really say sorry for those efforts. And some of those drove some costs and hopefully, I outlined that in the guidance as well. But there  wasn't very many consumers, think in the small thousands of numbers in that range out of tens of millions. And of course like I said, I think 100 plus range for customers in that area and 1,000-ish in the consumer.

Thank you for joining us.

Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report the 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit, year-over-year revenue growth for McAfee with revenue of $503 million, up 12%; deferred revenue of $1.4 billion, up 9%; cash flow from operations hitting a record $157 million; non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.60; and sales in the quarter, up 11% and up 5% on a constant-normalized basis. 
In the aggregate, compared to the fourth quarter, first quarter foreign exchange headwind negatively impacted our sales by $15 million, revenue by $12 million and non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.03. Also, compared to our first quarter guidance, we saw an additional headwind of $3 million in revenue and a penny in non-GAAP earnings per share as the U.S. dollar strengthened, more than we anticipated versus the euro and British pound. 
Looking at the first quarter 2010 business results for McAfee, we're especially pleased with our record Consumer business performance. Consumer revenue grew 11% year-over-year to a record $190 million, and our sales grew 17% year-over-year on a constant-normalized basis. We saw growth in all areas of the Global Consumer business, with double-digit growth in North America and more than 26% growth in our International Consumer business with Europe, Middle East and Africa achieving its third quarter in a row of greater than 20% year-over-year sales growth. These continued strong results in our Consumer segment proved that our investments in this business have been effective, and our shared risk model continues to be very profitable for both McAfee and our partners. As a result, we continue to take market share from our competitors. 
Our Consumer team had many exciting accomplishments during the quarter, executing on our strategy of protecting consumers where they need it: their PCs, the Web and mobile devices. Additionally, we continue to execute on our balanced partnership model with PC OEMs, Internet service providers, telecommunications companies, financial services, retail, social networks and portals on a global basis. 
During the quarter, we launched our new ISP [Internet service provider] offerings with Verizon in the U.S. and Yahoo BB in Japan. We continued our optimized programs with AT&T, generating a year-over-year 73% increase in our subscriber base with them. We also launched our new portal offerings with Mail.com and accumulated more than 170,000 Facebook fans as their exclusive security partner. We also recorded 3.2 million downloads of our securities scanner in conjunction with Adobe Systems partnership and announced a new agreement with SK Telecom in South Korea for our new Google Android mobile product. 
We generated more than $22 billion McAfee SECURE trustmark impressions and released our new ToPS for Mac product to our first partners. We launched a major upgrade to our core security suites, including a new user interface and significant performance improvements that was well welcomed with great reviews, including a 4.5-star review with CNET, higher than our major competitor. 
And finally, I'm excited about the future products and services we have planned this year to extend the subscription life cycle and lifetime value relationship with our consumers. These new products and services include identity protection, collaboration, transactional security and extended smart phone mobile offerings. 
And now, let me provide some color on our Corporate business. We achieved record first quarter revenue on our Corporate segment of $313 million, up 13% year-over-year. There was some real bright spots in this business this quarter. Customer demand was strong, and we experienced increased contract lengths without notable impact to discounting, and we had a strong pipeline at the end of the quarter. 
During the quarter, we closed 376 deals greater than $100,000 in value. Within this, we have 56 deals greater than $500,000 in value and 19 deals greater than $1 million in value. We saw 17% growth in the sales value of deals greater than $100,000 over Q1 of last year, reflecting strong business from our largest and most strategic corporate relationships, and we're starting to see the payoff of these investments we've made in the area last year. For example, our two largest deals in the quarter were in financial services and the government sector, where we have specific vertical focuses. 
We saw strong demand for our network solutions in Q1, and sales were up 14% year-over-year. The focus we have put on cross selling our best-of-breed portfolio is delivering solid results. And looking ahead, there continues to be great opportunity. You've also seen us bring terrific, new network products out already this year, including our next-generation firewall, called McAfee Firewall Enterprise 8, making the industry's most secure firewall even better. 
I'd also specifically like to note our success in Asia this quarter. Our Corporate sales grew 32% on a constant normalized basis in this region, building upon the improvements we had in Europe last quarter and our foundation of strong North American sales. 
In Q1, we had modest growth in our Small- and Mid-market business. Over the last few quarters, we have focused effort into consolidating our global telesales infrastructure and reinvigorating our channel programs. While it's still too early to tell, we believe these investments will better align our resources with the opportunities we see in the market. 
Our Corporate results could have been even better had we not have some operational execution challenges. Frankly speaking, one $7 million deal remained in our backlog due to operation challenges and processing the transaction. On top of this, several other deals greater than $1 million, that were originally in our forecast, slipped into Q2 and have now closed. It was disappointing for me and the team not to be able to book these additional transactions. This, coupled with our currency headwinds, brought us into the low end of our overall expectations for the quarter. 
That said, we're seeing an economic recovery bring spending back to more normalized levels compared to this time last year. Along with our technology peers, we believe that IT spending is improving, and the security market should continue its historic trend about pacing the overall IT market rate of growth. The return to a more stable economic environment and more stabilized budgets will benefit McAfee, and our business remains strong. 
Now let me hand it over to Rocky for his additional financial detail, and I'll come back with some comments on our Q2 outlook. Rocky?"
32053,99506779,60587,"McAfee, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","McAfee LLC","Executives","Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter of 2010 was both rewarding and challenging for McAfee, and we achieved double-digit revenue growth, solid profitability and record operating cash flow. We have worked very hard over the last few",1010,"Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter of 2010 was both rewarding and challenging for McAfee, and we achieved double-digit revenue growth, solid profitability and record operating cash flow. We have worked very hard over the last few years to diversify our business model and bring leading, comprehensive security solutions to customers that span the marketplace from the enterprise to consumers around the world. 
We've successfully integrated several acquisitions to expand our market opportunity, while focusing on improving our global operations and the efficiency of our infrastructure. Dave has already highlighted some areas of focus from this quarter, and I will now take you through more of the financial results. 
Turning to our Q1 results, we delivered record first quarter revenue of $503 million, up 12% year-over-year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, currency had a negative impact of $12 million. This headwind was approximately $3 million more than we originally forecasted, as the dollar strengthened through the quarter. These results include a positive year-over-year impact from currency of approximately $11 million. 
On a geographic basis, McAfee achieved double-digit year-over-year growth in nearly all of our geographies. North American revenue in Q1 was $284 million, up 12% from last year and accounted for 57% of consolidated revenue. International revenue reached a record of $219 million, up 13% over last year and accounted for 43% of consolidated revenue. 
As reported in U.S. dollars, revenue results in our international geographies compared to Q1 2009, showed Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 14%; Asia Pacific grew 22%; Latin America grew 17%; and Japan grew 3%. For the first quarter, approximately 79% of total revenue came from deferred revenue off the balance sheet, and approximately 91% of first quarter revenue was recurring in nature. Looking at our Corporate business, we delivered revenue of $313 million, up 13% year-over-year. 
Our Consumer business had an exceptional quarter with record revenue of $190 million, up 11% year-over-year. We also achieved record sales, which were up 17% over Q1 last year on a constant normalized basis and reflecting the success of our diverse consumer strategy. 
Turning to other highlights from the remainder of the income statement, non-GAAP gross profit margin for the first quarter was 78.1%. Year-over-year, strong product margins were offset by a higher mix from our Network business and increased infrastructure costs and investments in improving our customer support. These investments will scale with future revenues, and we're looking forward to continue to improve the quality of our customer experience and expense efficiency, which will provide improved financial performance. 
Q1 non-GAAP operating income was $127 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 25.2% within our expected margin range and despite foreign currency headwinds. An important element to achieving McAfee's long-term growth potential is expanding our worldwide footprint and realizing the benefit our investment in new markets. For example, in the quarter, we opened up our new Cork facility to expand our sales capacity in Europe, Africa and Asia. We are pleased with the progress of our infrastructure improvements and also with the quality of the teams and partners we have developed globally. 
During the quarter, we also continued to make operational investments and improvements in our sales infrastructure with the migration of our consumer commerce platform to a highly scalable world-class operation structure, launching the first phase of our CRM [customer relationships management] platform and continuing the rollout of our redesigned global telesales operation. We are encouraged by the early results of these programs.  
In addition, we continue to reshape our go-to-market headcount and resources to focus on those markets and customers, which provide us the best growth opportunities. As of March 31, we had 6,095 employees worldwide. Year-to-date, we have continued to increase our sales capacity, streamline our acquired company's operations and shipped resources to more cost-effective locations. 
We remained focused on striking the right balance between strategic investments in our future growth and improving operational efficiencies. We will continue this strategy in Q2 and for the remainder of the year to ensure our cost structure is aligned with our double-digit growth and profitability goals and to help partially offset continued currency headwinds. 
Moving on, Q1 non-GAAP net income was $96 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.60, up 6% year-over-year. This includes approximately a penny of additional currency headwind than we originally forecasted. And in our Q1, our GAAP tax rate was 28%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. 
Turning to a few items on the balance sheet. Net accounts receivable balance at the end of the first quarter 2010 was $231 million, compared with $294 million for the fourth quarter. Days sales outstanding were 41 days for the first quarter 2010 as a result of strong cash collections, which reflects the benefit of our improved operational process. 
Prepaid expenses, deferred costs of revenue and other current assets was $273 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to increases in marketing spend. Total overall deferred cost of revenue and prepaid expenses, primarily associated with revenue sharing and royalty arrangements, were $270 million and slightly down sequentially. 
Deferred revenue at the end of Q1 was $1.38 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Currency fluctuations had a negative impact of $34 million quarter-over-quarter and a positive impact of $9 million on deferred revenue year-over-year. 
We ended the first quarter with $1.1 billion in short-term deferred revenue, down $7 million, sequentially; long-term deferred revenue was $317 million, down $22 million, due to the negative $34 million foreign exchange impact quarter-to-quarter. The composition of our deferred revenue balance at the end of the first quarter 2010 was 65%, related to Corporate and 35% to Consumer. 
Finally, I'm especially pleased that we generated record operating cash flow of $157 million, which reflects our focus on managing our balance sheet as well as the success of our Consumer business. Under our stock buyback plan, we purchased approximately 3.7 million shares for $150 million during the quarter. Ending cash and marketable securities at quarter end was $902 million. And now, I'll turn it back over to Dave for closing comments."

To summarize and move into our outlook, we remain very excited about the opportunities we see in 2010.

To summarize and move into our outlook, we remain very excited about the opportunities we see in 2010. As we started off this year, there were a number of factors driving my confidence and optimism that remain true today. Economic conditions have stabilized. IT budgets are there, and security remains a top priority. The threat environment continues to escalate. At McAfee, we saw more malware come into our labs in 2009 than in the previous years combined. 
In 2009, we added nearly 17 million pieces of new malware to our collection. That's more than 45,000 pieces a day. The increasingly complex regulatory environments around the globe on issues such as data breaches, payment card information and other customer data is just another driver of security decisions we expect to continue. 
The overall risk of the cyber attack is compounded at a global proliferation of network devices. My counterpart at Ericsson recently predicted that by the end of year 2020, there'll be 50 billion devices connected to the Internet. It is an incredible number of devices to manage and to protect, especially when you consider that today, there's about 5 billion IP-connected devices. Enterprises continue to make standardization decisions on security, benefiting McAfee as we offer the industry's most comprehensive, interlocked security solution across end points, network and cloud. 
Looking at McAfee's business, we have the right ingredients to continue to be the leader in the market. We have a very strong product cycle coming and product portfolio to help protect customers from consumers to enterprise, from network to end point, from individual PCs to the cloud. We've got an incredible network of partners and alliances across our business, covering many key growth verticals of government, telecommunications and technology. 
A few examples such as: We recently announced a network partnership with Riverbed and Brocade; the Security Innovation Alliance has now surpassed the 100 partners; and we recently announced our Cloud Secure program, a program for Software-as-a-Service (sic) [Security-as-a-Service] providers to add additional security to their cloud deployments. 
I'm also sure many of you will like a quick update on our CFO search. The good news is that we're close to hiring a new executive team member, and I look forward to announcing a decision soon. 
Now turning to our guidance for the second quarter of 2010. We expect to achieve revenue in the range of $500 million to $520 million, non-GAAP operating income margin in the range of 24% to 26% and non-GAAP earnings per share in a range of $0.58 to $0.62 per share on a fully diluted basis. 
Our outlook for Q2 2010 is based on fully diluted share count in the range of 158 million to 160 million shares, compared to a fully diluted share count of 158 million shares in Q2 2009, and we're assuming an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 24%. 
To give you a little more color on our Q2 non-GAAP guidance assumptions, we estimate $0.04 to $0.05 per share of foreign currency headwind when compared with our first quarter 2010 guidance. The continuing purchases under our stock repurchase program and a $0.01 to $0.02 per share impact related to our recent faulty signature update. 
What I'm referring to in this last point is the anticipated impact associated with the signature update we had last week. While responding to a new global threat to Windows PCs that attacks critical operating system components, an error, specifically, the release of a faulty DAT file, caused some of our customer computers to be rendered inoperable. As a result, we expect some negative impact resulting from getting our customers back up and running. I'm extremely proud of how the McAfee team responded and contained this issue, and it's largely behind us today. 
While we're pleased with the performance in many parts of our business, we're taking measures to correct our execution challenges, including aligning our business operations and our cost structure appropriately. We will continue this strategy in Q2 and for the remainder of the year to ensure our cost structure is aligned with our double-digit growth and profitability goals and to help offset continued currency headwinds. The estimated cost reduction to our operating model is approximately $20 million. 
And in closing, I hope you had a good understanding of the opportunity McAfee has this year: stabilizing global economy, the security market poised to grow faster than overall IT; and exponential growth threats and regulations and devices. 
Simply put, the opportunity of security is one that still have a lot of greenfield and is a great business to be in. I firmly believe McAfee is very competitively positioned in this business with a good diversified model, strong product portfolio, top-notch partners and strategic alliances and a very strong team. In fact,, in the time I've been at McAfee, I've never been more encouraged by the opportunities we see for this company. 
On behalf of the executive management team, I want to thank all the employees worldwide for their hard work and continued performance. Thank you. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kate."

Since it came in, even a couple of weeks before the end of the quarter, it was a pretty complex deal to ship. We ended up having one component of over 25 components. One of those components didn't ship. Because of that, we couldn't take it to revenue. Couldn't even put it in deferred revenue, and hence, it's in backlog. So unfortunately, a small shipping sort of operations snafu caused us a pretty large transaction, kind of one of the culprits here in the quarter. I would tell you there is a number of other deals that came in, some of which came in just after the cutoff. Unfortunately, they also account for Q2. And again, a little disappointment at our Corporate sales execution. Our operation execution take full responsibility. We had quite a bit of business. We had plenty of business, quite honestly, to make and beat the quarter. And then coupled with currency headwind, I mean, just look those two components, really, $0.03 EPS just on that. Quarter-over-quarter, when you look at just from our guide, another penny. When you look at the revenue and the bookings impact, currency and these deal flips. That's why I went out of my way, Adam, to really say we feel really good about our business. We see a lot of good pipeline. We see a great opportunity here as a company. We're expanding. We're really motivated, but it is what it is, and we're disappointed with the quarter, of course, and we'll do better as we move forward."

Obviously, just bringing it down purely on just currency. We've kind of put an exchange rate now at about $1.32 on the euro. Of course, that's in really where some of the biggest impact has been, the pound and the euro as well as you know. And then of course, this faulty DAT issue has some cost related to it as well. So when you kind of look at the sort of faulty DAT plus the currency that's probably the biggest component, there's some spending and some cost issues that are in our guidance forecast. And again, as I mentioned, we think the bulk of that's behind us. And certainly, we remitted [ph] everybody. But of course, it cost to do it as well. So that's kind of the guidance. Rocky, did you want to add on?"

And certainly, when you look at just that, it's causing us to want to make sure we've realigned our cost model to reflect some of that. That's just one factor. I think the second factor here is we have been aggressively hiring. If you look at just last year, 2008 to 2009, we added nearly 600-plus employees to the company. We continue to hire sales capacity in through to Q1, and we're netting more sales capacity into the model. We're really trying to now build and integrate acquisitions and move those acquisition integrations a little faster if we can. If you immediately try to hold on to the accountability of your business units as long as you can as the model's going, I think it's time for us to kind of phase-two integrate some of our acquisitions, recognize some of the synergy off of that we can do, and quite honestly, we think we can even keep or raise our UAR [ph] capacity, what we call unique capacity for field, as we go through all of this.

We're just getting more partners involved, like Verizon's and AT&T is coming online, the Facebook ones, the Adobe ones, really some good optimism in the next few quarters on that. And that's still largely on PC-based devices. Some of the announcements we made there is we've just really got a brand new Macintosh product. We've got four more products in the pipeline coming. We talked a little bit about the identity area, identity protection, the collaboration areas. The nice part here is we've got new partnerships, and we got new products. And then to your point, mobile, I just think this is a massive opportunity. We just launched a brand-new product on the Android platform. And of course, this is really after the Wi-Fi access threat portion because again, this device is just like any other device. Once you're Wi-Fi enabled, you have a bunch of threats. We launched our first big pilot with the largest telecommunications company in Korea, and we hope to continue to roll that out. We're pretty optimistic the mobile market is a good one.

And so we're aligning the costs as David talked about, assuming we continue to see like a $1.30 or a $1.31 euro rate. Now one thing that's also hindered us, particularly in the first quarter because we've actually talked about foreign exchange in almost every prior quarter, we typically have a natural hedge in our foreign currency position between revenues and expenses. Unfortunately, some of our foreign currency expenses are outside of the European theater like India and other parts of Asia. Those currencies actually strengthened, and those are only an expense source so those currencies strengthen during the quarter which was anti to the normal trend of prior quarters, and we lost our natural hedge. So we're continuing to assess if we need to adjust our foreign exchange strategies, but to the extent those currencies return to their normal behavior and perhaps the volatility of the euro corrects itself, we will see a return to our natural hedge position."

We had a good growth in that segment of the market. Number of transaction, absolute dollar amount, standardization decisions felt really good.

When you look at our endpoint side of the SMB, we probably couldn't be happier that, that's going really well, kind of getting good strong double-digit growth to the endpoint side. And the way this keeps maturing is -- our Total Protection Suite upgrades from AB to the full suite continues to play out very nicely in that mid, small. Probably our biggest challenge is in our Appliance business, Network business into that sector as well as the rest. And then when you jump over to other theaters or other international segments, we've got our softness and really where we've got to continue to execute. Now I did try to call out. I've been working on this pretty hard for a few months as has the whole sales teams. We built a whole new telecenter in Cork, Ireland that Rocky alluded to, to try to bring online a telesales group. Largely, they were just getting started in Q1. I mean, most just got hired, very little productivity and really, we took most of the cost in Q1 and very little productivity so far. But having said that, telesales getting going. Our channel program is getting going and our pretty heavy focus on that mid and small. I think we'll improve there. But again, Q1, it was not and of course, that was it. And I would say a little bit more of -- we have some special programs in Q4 that pumped that mid and small that probably cost us a little dip back down in Q1.

Hopefully, we've seen a pretty diversified balance now as you look at that business. It really is working. We've got good strong telcos. I kind of called out that 73% increase with AT&T specifically and the subscriber base with them. That's been very solid. When you start to look at Adobe and others, it's really balancing well. We've been very encouraged with the model there and even with Dell, that profitability model, that contract we did last year, now, that's behind us, and we continue to look at other ways to do things with Dell. They've been a very strong partner and hopefully, we'll even see more from them in the future. When it comes to kind of consumer and corporate theater base, consumer wise, it was very strong internationally. And we were up substantially all over the world and that's been a good part of it. Third quarter in a row in Europe, over 20% in sales growth. Of course, Asia was up even more than that, almost 60%. When you look at some of the other regions, Consumer is really -- model's beginning to work well. And so a 26% year-over-year just in international on the Consumer side. On the Corporate side, it was pretty similar all around. Europe's been improving, Asia Pac did quite well. I called that one out in corporate. But North America and Europe were almost the same, predominantly on slipped deals and a couple of things that we just didn't get in at the end of the quarter. So I've been pleased with Europe improving, especially from a corporate point of view. And I wouldn't call that out any differently than any other theater right now in terms of the Q1 performance. We think we've kind of right at the boat, got it going, and now we just got to really drive for growth in this coming quarter."

I don't think it changes necessarily our sales and bookings growth and some of the things that have are happening overall. I mean we continue to grow as a company pretty substantially. How much we can get in the door and recognize as revenues sometimes has its challenges. We're doing everything we can to continue to improve and build upon that, and you can imagine sometimes deals come in at the end of the quarter, not always the easiest being a hardware company trying to ship stuff at the end of the quarter when they come in with an hour to go or with a couple of hours to go. Again, trying not to make an excuse just to say that we've got work to do to mature ourselves as a strong execution company when it comes to both finance and operations. When it comes to SMB, I would tell you, we need to keep working hard at the enterprise endpoint. We've got a little bit more than 50% of our overall AV to ToPS upgrades already occurred in our install base. And you kind of look about half of them already upgrade, and you look at the enterprise, it's a much higher percent in that high end. That's why the Network business is becoming important to the company. When you look at the SMB in mid, we'd still got a lot of strong cycles in the ToPS end point side of our business, and that's why I keep calling out that remaining 50% of our installed base, we can convert. A lot of it sits in that middle-market segment. So we're going keep focusing in and make sure we've got the right product portfolios, but I think you're reading it the right way. And of course, we've got a number of new products hooked up to ePO. As you know, that's a key. We just got solid core hooked up. We've got a number of risk and compliance products now. When I say hooked up, it's integrated more fully and of course, now we've got a lot of our network products integrated into ePO, which will be a driver for us. So I still think quite honestly, the pipeline's fantastic. We've got a lot of big deals and the biggest deals we've ever seen. We've got a very motivated sales force, and we just got to put Q1 behind us and drive."

In cash flow, it's a part of our goals and our strategy for this year. Certainly, we're trying to make the adjustments from a cost point of view to keep meeting those goals. I kind of alluded to that in the sort of $20 million go-forward operating model adjustments we're making as well. And this is what it takes to be an elite company and that's our strategy. When it comes to the mix on the Consumer side, we continue to see us being able to optimize and work with the netbook and the slates. And so to the new types of devices coming out, the conversion rates have been improving especially as the education improves in the notebook arena. The netbook is just like any other device, it accesses the Internet, it has your identity on it, it basically is a computing environment that essentially has the same risks and threats as anything else. Just because it's cheaper from an overall dollar amount, doesn't mean the threats are changing. So from an educational point of view, that makes us get better conversion rates, and I would tell you I didn't see really any change in terms of our conversion rates overall. If anything, they've gotten actually better, more units, more conversions, build more partners in the Consumer side."

We did have a very large launch just this past week at Interop for our next-generation firewall. I'm particularly happy with this product. I would tell you I think of all the network product areas, the firewall is going through the biggest refresh cycle. I believe during the economic downturn over the last 18 months or so, most of the infrastructure was not refreshed. The network firewall was one of those product areas that is being refreshed. We added a heck of a lot of features to that product. In addition to be very secure, we have a realtime feed from our cloud intelligence directly to the firewall that can drop traffic and protect the whole perimeter on-the-fly dynamically. We added applications support, kind of one upping the Palo Alto networks to the world in that area and really went after a very powerful and scalable firewall model. So we're happy with that. I would tell you we also got a whole suite of consumer products coming as I mentioned. And with the distribution we have, that's all good there. A whole new ePO product coming, and then of course a bunch of products for SMB. But I would tell you again, we've got channel programs, and telesales is a bit of our culprit in the mid-market still in the SMB. We've got to mature that especially internationally, and we'll put the money in place in Q1. We just got to get the fruits now in the coming quarters."

Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report the 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit, year-over-year revenue growth for McAfee with revenue of $503 million, up 12%; deferred revenue of $1.4 billion, up 9%; cash flow from operations hitting a record $157 million; non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.60; and sales in the quarter, up 11% and up 5% on a constant-normalized basis. 
In the aggregate, compared to the fourth quarter, first quarter foreign exchange headwind negatively impacted our sales by $15 million, revenue by $12 million and non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.03. Also, compared to our first quarter guidance, we saw an additional headwind of $3 million in revenue and a penny in non-GAAP earnings per share as the U.S. dollar strengthened, more than we anticipated versus the euro and British pound. 
Looking at the first quarter 2010 business results for McAfee, we're especially pleased with our record Consumer business performance. Consumer revenue grew 11% year-over-year to a record $190 million, and our sales grew 17% year-over-year on a constant-normalized basis. We saw growth in all areas of the Global Consumer business, with double-digit growth in North America and more than 26% growth in our International Consumer business with Europe, Middle East and Africa achieving its third quarter in a row of greater than 20% year-over-year sales growth. These continued strong results in our Consumer segment proved that our investments in this business have been effective, and our shared risk model continues to be very profitable for both McAfee and our partners. As a result, we continue to take market share from our competitors. 
Our Consumer team had many exciting accomplishments during the quarter, executing on our strategy of protecting consumers where they need it: their PCs, the Web and mobile devices. Additionally, we continue to execute on our balanced partnership model with PC OEMs, Internet service providers, telecommunications companies, financial services, retail, social networks and portals on a global basis. 
During the quarter, we launched our new ISP [Internet service provider] offerings with Verizon in the U.S. and Yahoo BB in Japan. We continued our optimized programs with AT&T, generating a year-over-year 73% increase in our subscriber base with them. We also launched our new portal offerings with Mail.com and accumulated more than 170,000 Facebook fans as their exclusive security partner. We also recorded 3.2 million downloads of our securities scanner in conjunction with Adobe Systems partnership and announced a new agreement with SK Telecom in South Korea for our new Google Android mobile product. 
We generated more than $22 billion McAfee SECURE trustmark impressions and released our new ToPS for Mac product to our first partners. We launched a major upgrade to our core security suites, including a new user interface and significant performance improvements that was well welcomed with great reviews, including a 4.5-star review with CNET, higher than our major competitor. 
And finally, I'm excited about the future products and services we have planned this year to extend the subscription life cycle and lifetime value relationship with our consumers. These new products and services include identity protection, collaboration, transactional security and extended smart phone mobile offerings. 
And now, let me provide some color on our Corporate business. We achieved record first quarter revenue on our Corporate segment of $313 million, up 13% year-over-year. There was some real bright spots in this business this quarter. Customer demand was strong, and we experienced increased contract lengths without notable impact to discounting, and we had a strong pipeline at the end of the quarter. 
During the quarter, we closed 376 deals greater than $100,000 in value. Within this, we have 56 deals greater than $500,000 in value and 19 deals greater than $1 million in value. We saw 17% growth in the sales value of deals greater than $100,000 over Q1 of last year, reflecting strong business from our largest and most strategic corporate relationships, and we're starting to see the payoff of these investments we've made in the area last year. For example, our two largest deals in the quarter were in financial services and the government sector, where we have specific vertical focuses. 
We saw strong demand for our network solutions in Q1, and sales were up 14% year-over-year. The focus we have put on cross selling our best-of-breed portfolio is delivering solid results. And looking ahead, there continues to be great opportunity. You've also seen us bring terrific, new network products out already this year, including our next-generation firewall, called McAfee Firewall Enterprise 8, making the industry's most secure firewall even better. 
I'd also specifically like to note our success in Asia this quarter. Our Corporate sales grew 32% on a constant normalized basis in this region, building upon the improvements we had in Europe last quarter and our foundation of strong North American sales. 
In Q1, we had modest growth in our Small- and Mid-market business. Over the last few quarters, we have focused effort into consolidating our global telesales infrastructure and reinvigorating our channel programs. While it's still too early to tell, we believe these investments will better align our resources with the opportunities we see in the market. 
Our Corporate results could have been even better had we not have some operational execution challenges. Frankly speaking, one $7 million deal remained in our backlog due to operation challenges and processing the transaction. On top of this, several other deals greater than $1 million, that were originally in our forecast, slipped into Q2 and have now closed. It was disappointing for me and the team not to be able to book these additional transactions. This, coupled with our currency headwinds, brought us into the low end of our overall expectations for the quarter. 
That said, we're seeing an economic recovery bring spending back to more normalized levels compared to this time last year. Along with our technology peers, we believe that IT spending is improving, and the security market should continue its historic trend about pacing the overall IT market rate of growth. The return to a more stable economic environment and more stabilized budgets will benefit McAfee, and our business remains strong. 
Now let me hand it over to Rocky for his additional financial detail, and I'll come back with some comments on our Q2 outlook. Rocky?"
32053,99506779,60602,"McAfee, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","McAfee LLC","Executives","Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter of 2010 was both rewarding and challenging for McAfee, and we achieved double-digit revenue growth, solid profitability and record operating cash flow. We have worked very hard over the last few",1010,"Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter of 2010 was both rewarding and challenging for McAfee, and we achieved double-digit revenue growth, solid profitability and record operating cash flow. We have worked very hard over the last few years to diversify our business model and bring leading, comprehensive security solutions to customers that span the marketplace from the enterprise to consumers around the world. 
We've successfully integrated several acquisitions to expand our market opportunity, while focusing on improving our global operations and the efficiency of our infrastructure. Dave has already highlighted some areas of focus from this quarter, and I will now take you through more of the financial results. 
Turning to our Q1 results, we delivered record first quarter revenue of $503 million, up 12% year-over-year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, currency had a negative impact of $12 million. This headwind was approximately $3 million more than we originally forecasted, as the dollar strengthened through the quarter. These results include a positive year-over-year impact from currency of approximately $11 million. 
On a geographic basis, McAfee achieved double-digit year-over-year growth in nearly all of our geographies. North American revenue in Q1 was $284 million, up 12% from last year and accounted for 57% of consolidated revenue. International revenue reached a record of $219 million, up 13% over last year and accounted for 43% of consolidated revenue. 
As reported in U.S. dollars, revenue results in our international geographies compared to Q1 2009, showed Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 14%; Asia Pacific grew 22%; Latin America grew 17%; and Japan grew 3%. For the first quarter, approximately 79% of total revenue came from deferred revenue off the balance sheet, and approximately 91% of first quarter revenue was recurring in nature. Looking at our Corporate business, we delivered revenue of $313 million, up 13% year-over-year. 
Our Consumer business had an exceptional quarter with record revenue of $190 million, up 11% year-over-year. We also achieved record sales, which were up 17% over Q1 last year on a constant normalized basis and reflecting the success of our diverse consumer strategy. 
Turning to other highlights from the remainder of the income statement, non-GAAP gross profit margin for the first quarter was 78.1%. Year-over-year, strong product margins were offset by a higher mix from our Network business and increased infrastructure costs and investments in improving our customer support. These investments will scale with future revenues, and we're looking forward to continue to improve the quality of our customer experience and expense efficiency, which will provide improved financial performance. 
Q1 non-GAAP operating income was $127 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 25.2% within our expected margin range and despite foreign currency headwinds. An important element to achieving McAfee's long-term growth potential is expanding our worldwide footprint and realizing the benefit our investment in new markets. For example, in the quarter, we opened up our new Cork facility to expand our sales capacity in Europe, Africa and Asia. We are pleased with the progress of our infrastructure improvements and also with the quality of the teams and partners we have developed globally. 
During the quarter, we also continued to make operational investments and improvements in our sales infrastructure with the migration of our consumer commerce platform to a highly scalable world-class operation structure, launching the first phase of our CRM [customer relationships management] platform and continuing the rollout of our redesigned global telesales operation. We are encouraged by the early results of these programs.  
In addition, we continue to reshape our go-to-market headcount and resources to focus on those markets and customers, which provide us the best growth opportunities. As of March 31, we had 6,095 employees worldwide. Year-to-date, we have continued to increase our sales capacity, streamline our acquired company's operations and shipped resources to more cost-effective locations. 
We remained focused on striking the right balance between strategic investments in our future growth and improving operational efficiencies. We will continue this strategy in Q2 and for the remainder of the year to ensure our cost structure is aligned with our double-digit growth and profitability goals and to help partially offset continued currency headwinds. 
Moving on, Q1 non-GAAP net income was $96 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.60, up 6% year-over-year. This includes approximately a penny of additional currency headwind than we originally forecasted. And in our Q1, our GAAP tax rate was 28%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. 
Turning to a few items on the balance sheet. Net accounts receivable balance at the end of the first quarter 2010 was $231 million, compared with $294 million for the fourth quarter. Days sales outstanding were 41 days for the first quarter 2010 as a result of strong cash collections, which reflects the benefit of our improved operational process. 
Prepaid expenses, deferred costs of revenue and other current assets was $273 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to increases in marketing spend. Total overall deferred cost of revenue and prepaid expenses, primarily associated with revenue sharing and royalty arrangements, were $270 million and slightly down sequentially. 
Deferred revenue at the end of Q1 was $1.38 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Currency fluctuations had a negative impact of $34 million quarter-over-quarter and a positive impact of $9 million on deferred revenue year-over-year. 
We ended the first quarter with $1.1 billion in short-term deferred revenue, down $7 million, sequentially; long-term deferred revenue was $317 million, down $22 million, due to the negative $34 million foreign exchange impact quarter-to-quarter. The composition of our deferred revenue balance at the end of the first quarter 2010 was 65%, related to Corporate and 35% to Consumer. 
Finally, I'm especially pleased that we generated record operating cash flow of $157 million, which reflects our focus on managing our balance sheet as well as the success of our Consumer business. Under our stock buyback plan, we purchased approximately 3.7 million shares for $150 million during the quarter. Ending cash and marketable securities at quarter end was $902 million. And now, I'll turn it back over to Dave for closing comments."
32053,99506779,60602,"McAfee, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","McAfee LLC","Executives","All right. Thanks, Rocky.

To summarize and move into our outlook, we remain very excited about the opportunities we see in 2010. As we started off this year, there were a number of factors driving my confidence and optimism that remain true today. Economic conditions have stabilized. IT budgets are there, and security remains a top priority. The threat environment continues to escalate. At McAfee, we saw more malware come into our labs in 2009 than in the previous years combined. 
In 2009, we added nearly 17 million pieces of new malware to our collection. That's more than 45,000 pieces a day. The increasingly complex regulatory environments around the globe on issues such as data breaches, payment card information and other customer data is just another driver of security decisions we expect to continue. 
The overall risk of the cyber attack is compounded at a global proliferation of network devices. My counterpart at Ericsson recently predicted that by the end of year 2020, there'll be 50 billion devices connected to the Internet. It is an incredible number of devices to manage and to protect, especially when you consider that today, there's about 5 billion IP-connected devices. Enterprises continue to make standardization decisions on security, benefiting McAfee as we offer the industry's most comprehensive, interlocked security solution across end points, network and cloud. 
Looking at McAfee's business, we have the right ingredients to continue to be the leader in the market. We have a very strong product cycle coming and product portfolio to help protect customers from consumers to enterprise, from network to end point, from individual PCs to the cloud. We've got an incredible network of partners and alliances across our business, covering many key growth verticals of government, telecommunications and technology. 
A few examples such as: We recently announced a network partnership with Riverbed and Brocade; the Security Innovation Alliance has now surpassed the 100 partners; and we recently announced our Cloud Secure program, a program for Software-as-a-Service (sic) [Security-as-a-Service] providers to add additional security to their cloud deployments. 
I'm also sure many of you will like a quick update on our CFO search. The good news is that we're close to hiring a new executive team member, and I look forward to announcing a decision soon. 
Now turning to our guidance for the second quarter of 2010. We expect to achieve revenue in the range of $500 million to $520 million, non-GAAP operating income margin in the range of 24% to 26% and non-GAAP earnings per share in a range of $0.58 to $0.62 per share on a fully diluted basis. 
Our outlook for Q2 2010 is based on fully diluted share count in the range of 158 million to 160 million shares, compared to a fully diluted share count of 158 million shares in Q2 2009, and we're assuming an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 24%. 
To give you a little more color on our Q2 non-GAAP guidance assumptions, we estimate $0.04 to $0.05 per share of foreign currency headwind when compared with our first quarter 2010 guidance. The continuing purchases under our stock repurchase program and a $0.01 to $0.02 per share impact related to our recent faulty signature update. 
What I'm referring to in this last point is the anticipated impact associated with the signature update we had last week. While responding to a new global threat to Windows PCs that attacks critical operating system components, an error, specifically, the release of a faulty DAT file, caused some of our customer computers to be rendered inoperable. As a result, we expect some negative impact resulting from getting our customers back up and running. I'm extremely proud of how the McAfee team responded and contained this issue, and it's largely behind us today. 
While we're pleased with the performance in many parts of our business, we're taking measures to correct our execution challenges, including aligning our business operations and our cost structure appropriately. We will continue this strategy in Q2 and for the remainder of the year to ensure our cost structure is aligned with our double-digit growth and profitability goals and to help offset continued currency headwinds. The estimated cost reduction to our operating model is approximately $20 million. 
And in closing, I hope you had a good understanding of the opportunity McAfee has this year: stabilizing global economy, the security market poised to grow faster than overall IT; and exponential growth threats and regulations and devices. 
Simply put, the opportunity of security is one that still have a lot of greenfield and is a great business to be in. I firmly believe McAfee is very competitively positioned in this business with a good diversified model, strong product portfolio, top-notch partners and strategic alliances and a very strong team. In fact,, in the time I've been at McAfee, I've never been more encouraged by the opportunities we see for this company. 
On behalf of the executive management team, I want to thank all the employees worldwide for their hard work and continued performance. Thank you. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kate."

Since it came in, even a couple of weeks before the end of the quarter, it was a pretty complex deal to ship. We ended up having one component of over 25 components. One of those components didn't ship. Because of that, we couldn't take it to revenue. Couldn't even put it in deferred revenue, and hence, it's in backlog. So unfortunately, a small shipping sort of operations snafu caused us a pretty large transaction, kind of one of the culprits here in the quarter. I would tell you there is a number of other deals that came in, some of which came in just after the cutoff. Unfortunately, they also account for Q2. And again, a little disappointment at our Corporate sales execution. Our operation execution take full responsibility. We had quite a bit of business. We had plenty of business, quite honestly, to make and beat the quarter. And then coupled with currency headwind, I mean, just look those two components, really, $0.03 EPS just on that. Quarter-over-quarter, when you look at just from our guide, another penny. When you look at the revenue and the bookings impact, currency and these deal flips. That's why I went out of my way, Adam, to really say we feel really good about our business. We see a lot of good pipeline. We see a great opportunity here as a company. We're expanding. We're really motivated, but it is what it is, and we're disappointed with the quarter, of course, and we'll do better as we move forward."

And certainly, when you look at just that, it's causing us to want to make sure we've realigned our cost model to reflect some of that. That's just one factor. I think the second factor here is we have been aggressively hiring. If you look at just last year, 2008 to 2009, we added nearly 600-plus employees to the company. We continue to hire sales capacity in through to Q1, and we're netting more sales capacity into the model. We're really trying to now build and integrate acquisitions and move those acquisition integrations a little faster if we can. If you immediately try to hold on to the accountability of your business units as long as you can as the model's going, I think it's time for us to kind of phase-two integrate some of our acquisitions, recognize some of the synergy off of that we can do, and quite honestly, we think we can even keep or raise our UAR [ph] capacity, what we call unique capacity for field, as we go through all of this.

And so we're aligning the costs as David talked about, assuming we continue to see like a $1.30 or a $1.31 euro rate. Now one thing that's also hindered us, particularly in the first quarter because we've actually talked about foreign exchange in almost every prior quarter, we typically have a natural hedge in our foreign currency position between revenues and expenses. Unfortunately, some of our foreign currency expenses are outside of the European theater like India and other parts of Asia. Those currencies actually strengthened, and those are only an expense source so those currencies strengthen during the quarter which was anti to the normal trend of prior quarters, and we lost our natural hedge. So we're continuing to assess if we need to adjust our foreign exchange strategies, but to the extent those currencies return to their normal behavior and perhaps the volatility of the euro corrects itself, we will see a return to our natural hedge position."

I'm very pleased with what's been happening there in our business. The Secure Computing acquisition is beginning to get us some real energy in that higher-end enterprise. You probably saw the way I talk to this was very strong Consumer, and then when you really look at the Corporate business, it was almost another tale of two cities in there, the over 100,000 category in terms of $100,000 ASP category was quite strong. We had a good growth in that segment of the market. Number of transaction, absolute dollar amount, standardization decisions felt really good. Really where the weakness was here in this particular quarter was in some of the small, and mid as well, under $100,000 had some weakness there, as well as I mentioned, a $7 million transaction and a number of others that just slipped out of our fingers into the next day. And so that's a bit of the story for you."

When it comes to SMB, again, it's a bunch of different things going on and in different continents. So I apologize for the complex question. When you look at our endpoint side of the SMB, we probably couldn't be happier that, that's going really well, kind of getting good strong double-digit growth to the endpoint side. And the way this keeps maturing is -- our Total Protection Suite upgrades from AB to the full suite continues to play out very nicely in that mid, small. Probably our biggest challenge is in our Appliance business, Network business into that sector as well as the rest. And then when you jump over to other theaters or other international segments, we've got our softness and really where we've got to continue to execute. Now I did try to call out. I've been working on this pretty hard for a few months as has the whole sales teams. We built a whole new telecenter in Cork, Ireland that Rocky alluded to, to try to bring online a telesales group. Largely, they were just getting started in Q1. I mean, most just got hired, very little productivity and really, we took most of the cost in Q1 and very little productivity so far. But having said that, telesales getting going. Our channel program is getting going and our pretty heavy focus on that mid and small. I think we'll improve there. But again, Q1, it was not and of course, that was it. And I would say a little bit more of -- we have some special programs in Q4 that pumped that mid and small that probably cost us a little dip back down in Q1. So we hope Q2 comes back strong, and we're, let's say, maniacally focused on execution here."

Just maybe to add on to Rocky a little bit, Dell's been a fabulous partner for us and as have our other partners that we've worked on hard. Hopefully, we've seen a pretty diversified balance now as you look at that business. It really is working. We've got good strong telcos. I kind of called out that 73% increase with AT&T specifically and the subscriber base with them. That's been very solid. When you start to look at Adobe and others, it's really balancing well. We've been very encouraged with the model there and even with Dell, that profitability model, that contract we did last year, now, that's behind us, and we continue to look at other ways to do things with Dell. They've been a very strong partner and hopefully, we'll even see more from them in the future. When it comes to kind of consumer and corporate theater base, consumer wise, it was very strong internationally. And we were up substantially all over the world and that's been a good part of it. Third quarter in a row in Europe, over 20% in sales growth. Of course, Asia was up even more than that, almost 60%. When you look at some of the other regions, Consumer is really -- model's beginning to work well. And so a 26% year-over-year just in international on the Consumer side. On the Corporate side, it was pretty similar all around. Europe's been improving, Asia Pac did quite well. I called that one out in corporate. But North America and Europe were almost the same, predominantly on slipped deals and a couple of things that we just didn't get in at the end of the quarter. So I've been pleased with Europe improving, especially from a corporate point of view. And I wouldn't call that out any differently than any other theater right now in terms of the Q1 performance. We think we've kind of right at the boat, got it going, and now we just got to really drive for growth in this coming quarter."

Complexity of us growing into a hardware business and software business, perpetual license models, subscription license models sometimes shows its side. I don't think it changes necessarily our sales and bookings growth and some of the things that have are happening overall. I mean we continue to grow as a company pretty substantially. How much we can get in the door and recognize as revenues sometimes has its challenges. We're doing everything we can to continue to improve and build upon that, and you can imagine sometimes deals come in at the end of the quarter, not always the easiest being a hardware company trying to ship stuff at the end of the quarter when they come in with an hour to go or with a couple of hours to go. Again, trying not to make an excuse just to say that we've got work to do to mature ourselves as a strong execution company when it comes to both finance and operations. When it comes to SMB, I would tell you, we need to keep working hard at the enterprise endpoint. We've got a little bit more than 50% of our overall AV to ToPS upgrades already occurred in our install base. And you kind of look about half of them already upgrade, and you look at the enterprise, it's a much higher percent in that high end. That's why the Network business is becoming important to the company. When you look at the SMB in mid, we'd still got a lot of strong cycles in the ToPS end point side of our business, and that's why I keep calling out that remaining 50% of our installed base, we can convert. A lot of it sits in that middle-market segment. So we're going keep focusing in and make sure we've got the right product portfolios, but I think you're reading it the right way. And of course, we've got a number of new products hooked up to ePO. As you know, that's a key. We just got solid core hooked up. We've got a number of risk and compliance products now. When I say hooked up, it's integrated more fully and of course, now we've got a lot of our network products integrated into ePO, which will be a driver for us. So I still think quite honestly, the pipeline's fantastic. We've got a lot of big deals and the biggest deals we've ever seen. We've got a very motivated sales force, and we just got to put Q1 behind us and drive."

When it comes to the mix on the Consumer side, we continue to see us being able to optimize and work with the netbook and the slates. And so to the new types of devices coming out, the conversion rates have been improving especially as the education improves in the notebook arena. The netbook is just like any other device, it accesses the Internet, it has your identity on it, it basically is a computing environment that essentially has the same risks and threats as anything else. Just because it's cheaper from an overall dollar amount, doesn't mean the threats are changing. So from an educational point of view, that makes us get better conversion rates, and I would tell you I didn't see really any change in terms of our conversion rates overall.

We added a heck of a lot of features to that product. In addition to be very secure, we have a realtime feed from our cloud intelligence directly to the firewall that can drop traffic and protect the whole perimeter on-the-fly dynamically. We added applications support, kind of one upping the Palo Alto networks to the world in that area and really went after a very powerful and scalable firewall model. So we're happy with that.

When I look at the last six or eight quarters, I've had my challenges, we've grown a lot, we nearly doubled this company in the last three years, we continue to expand and grow, we've got infrastructure challenges that we continue to try to grow and scale with our business.

We've got to do a better job execution. My primary focus, I mentioned also that we have a new CFO on his way. I hope to make some announcements soon on that, we try to really drive there. We've made a number of other improvements in our finance and operations team this past quarter with some new talent coming and augmenting the great talent we already have. But again, this is an area of just got to improve and got to keep focusing in on. And of course, to that issue, I think I aged 20 years just in four days, I'll be honest with you. It was a lot of work. We recovered very fast, and it really ended up being kind of less than 100 customers-ish that were really impacted, not a significant number in the grand scheme of things. But when you look at it, we've got to make sure we do a better job with our quality assurance and some of our efforts, and of course, we are. And we're going to continue to be a strong company, and you can trust us and we're focused."

It included a two-year subscription extension as well as Starbucks gift cards and a repair reimbursement kind of model, package to really say sorry for those efforts.

All right, well let's get started. Q2 was a really challenging, emotional, but really rewarding quarter, probably the most I've had in my career. In the face of some very difficult adversities, McAfee emerged",1514,"Welcome, Jonathan. I'll practice your accent. All right, well let's get started. Q2 was a really challenging, emotional, but really rewarding quarter, probably the most I've had in my career. In the face of some very difficult adversities, McAfee emerged stronger than ever, and I for one am very optimistic, more optimistic than ever while I've been here at McAfee. 
Today, I'd like to discuss and comment on five major themes that capture the essence of the opportunity and the optimism I see in the market and for the company. First, I see continued improvement in the macroeconomic conditions for IT. We’ve seen multiple successive quarters of improvement in spending, in most segments worldwide. This, coupled with the dramatically improving market expansion for security endpoints creates a strong positive business dynamic for McAfee. 
In addition, McAfee managed to overcome significant adversity and turn this into a market advantage through focused Q2 initiatives. As a result, I believe McAfee, in one of its best quarters in years as highlighted by exceptional execution in bookings, operating expenses, big deal contracts, major PC OEM extensions, new partnerships and outstanding cash flow from operations. I believe the future never looked brighter as we're now set to drive market share growth for years to come. 
And with that opening, I want to further explain the optimism that is pervasive here at McAfee. First, we have to look at our core security market. For many years, McAfee primarily had one product, antivirus, and sold on one major platform, PCs. We experienced a near doubling of our company from just over $1 billion in sales in 2006 to more than $2 billion in 2010 as we expanded our single-product focus to a full suite. Our conversion programs have worked well with more than 50% of our installed base now using multiple stickier McAfee products from Total Protection for Consumers, to ToPS and the Enterprise. 
The market for PCs remains very strong as we’ve seen 20%+ growth in units shipped just in the first half of 2010. This, coupled with the fact that we now have extended our agreements with two of the three largest PC device manufacturers for several more years, secures our opportunity for a long time. McAfee will ship on more than 25% of all PCs shipped worldwide through just these two partnerships, far exceeding that of HP and our primary rival. These expanded relationships do not require the use of upfront cash and are accreditory [ph 21:18] results for the terms of the contracts. 
Add in our over 220 partnerships across PC OEMs, ISPs, financial firms, social networks and others, and we have access to more than 50% of the market including more than half of the consumer PC units shipped by the top 10 manufacturers. 
Our ever-broadening suite enabled us to grow our Consumer business in Q2 to $191 million, up 9% on a constant currency basis. As a solid sign of the market’s strength, our top end suites for consumers grew 63%. And now as we watch the explosion of new devices, our opportunity has grown dramatically. In fact, we estimate that our market will expand from approximately 1 billion devices in the PC market to more than 50 billion IP-connected devices worldwide. This is where our strategy is really paying off. 
McAfee has put the pieces in place to capture this market opportunity for devices such as Smart phones, ATM machines, point-of-sale devices, USB-connected devices, cars, TVs and many, many more. Over the past few years, we’ve worked hard to dramatically expand the breadth of our product offerings. We have broadened our security footprint to help customers respond whether on any kind of endpoint, the network or in the cloud and across the whole technology stack. 
As another example of that, today, I'm very pleased to be announcing our next-generation mobility platform that enables us to capture market share from Consumer segments to Enterprises for all Smart phones, tablets and slates with the broadest feature set in the industry. Our acquisition of the WaveSecure mobile security service, coupled with the Trust Digital and our own mobile products, gives us a very unique advantage. 
Worldwide mobile phone sales totaled 315 million units in the first quarter of 2010, a 17% increase from the same period in 2009 according to Gartner. Smart phone sales reached 54 million units, an increase of nearly 50% from the first quarter of 2009. 
In addition to the major PC OEM contract extensions and the acquisition of WaveSecure, we're pleased to announce the signing of an agreement with Verizon Business to market McAfee Verizon cobranded SSL products and solutions utilizing Verizon's SSL technology and certificates to secure online transactions. This strategic relationship provides us with yet another compelling value proposition that we believe will be very disruptive in the marketplace. 
Furthering our strategy, you may have seen earlier this week our announcement with Polycom to secure unified communications, thus extending the types of devices McAfee can secure. And recently, we announced that McAfee now has relationships to provide security on USB drives sold by 2/3 of the world's secure USB drive makers. 
All-in-all, we pioneered an open security risk management platform, leveraging our security management product called ePolicy Orchestrator, to more than 100 partners in our security alliance program. Through strategic alliances and partnerships, McAfee technology today is included in more third-party devices, appliances and in ever more products than before. We've created a bridge from the PC-centric world to a world where everything is digital and everything is connected. More importantly, we're continuing to gain competitive advantage by developing and acquiring the right technologies for where the security market is headed. 
The success of our strategy is really clearly reflected in our deals. We closed a near-record number of million-dollar deals plus in Q2. Over 80% of these transactions included multiple McAfee products and longer contract terms. Customers are securing and managing more connected devices with McAfee, enabling us to fulfill our strategy of silicon and satellite secure device management, all integrated to our cloud and on-premise management platforms. 
Another important sign of the opportunity in the market is the way we turned an adverse event into opportunity. I don't want to over-dramatize this, but few events in life end up providing an opportunity as the event we experienced this past quarter. I'm talking about our false-positive incident. For those who have not followed our company closely, this was a security update that we released in late April that impacted some of our customers, albeit a small percentage of our overall customer base. We had approximately 1,600 Enterprise customers and 11,000 Consumer customers affected. I'm very proud to state now that not only did we respond quickly and very effectively to these customers, we've resiled [ph 26:06] 99% more of the issues related to these incidences. And we did so without losing any Corporate customers and without any legal actions. And more importantly, in a quarter where we had a near record number of $1 million-plus deals, some of our largest deals in the quarter were with affected customers. 
For example, we had a very large educational institution, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies and a major global financial institution, all increased their commitment to McAfee by purchasing more McAfee products in the past quarter than they ever have done before. I believe this reflects the fact that our customers are really engaging in the strategic importance of McAfee, and many have raised the level of importance of our company as a critical partner within their IT infrastructure and made us a trusted security adviser. You will see and hear more about our new Global Trust and Safety Initiative that will set new industry standards in the areas of quality assurance, technical innovations, support and services and community awareness. 
When I net out the total estimated impact of a false-positive incident in Q2, our bookings impact to the extra discounts and offers were about $15 million. The revenue impact due to deferrals was about $6 million of deferred revenue not recognized from the balance sheet, and revenue was also negatively impacted by another approximately $14 million. Cost and expenses were approximately $2 million, and the total cash to customers was just $3 million. And this is all included in the above impact. In summary, the impact of the false-positive to our Q2 revenue results were greater than we anticipated with the biggest difference being against our expectations of lower in-period revenue from sales deals related to the incident. 
As I’ve said many times, but I'd really like to express my heartfelt thanks and gratitude to our employees for their hard work and to our customers and partners for their continued support of McAfee. 
Looking ahead, I'm very pleased that this event’s behind us, and we’re moving forward as a company, stronger than ever before. Our pipeline for Q3 is strong, and we'll talk a little bit more about that later in the call. Now let me turn the call over to Jonathan, and we'll cover our strong Q2 results. Jonathan?"
32053,107914965,70564,"McAfee, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","McAfee LLC","Executives","Thank you, Dave.

Again, I'm very excited to be part of the McAfee family and again, I truly appreciate the warm welcome and look forward to working with you all. I do see a tremendous amount of opportunity in this market and internally within McAfee to drive value to our customers, partners, shareholders and employees. 
Now turning to Q2 results in more detail. I'm pleased to report that McAfee had a very good Q2 on a number of fronts. On a constant currency basis, we achieved strong year-over-year growth in each of our major metrics. Non-GAAP revenue, up 7%; non-GAAP net income, up 9%; non-GAAP earnings per share, up 10%; deferred revenue, up 10%; and cash flow from operations, up 160% year-over-year. 
Now I'd like to go into a little bit more detail on our Q2 revenue results. Our non-GAAP revenue was $495 million, up 6% year-over-year and up 7% on a constant currency basis. We observed a high level of foreign exchange headwind this quarter with $5 million year-over-year and $12 million quarter-over-quarter. We had approximately $14 million of lower in-period revenue as new sales orders came in at lower revenue realization rates. This realization was lower than anticipated with the lowest level for the past four quarters. This means that more revenue than normal was deferred to future periods and therefore not recognized as revenue in Q2. These deferrals were largely caused by extension of contract durations with certain corporate customers as part of their Q2 false-positive resolution. So when you net out the effects of foreign exchange, and the false-positive issue on this quarter's revenue, you see we would have been comfortably within the range of the revenue guidance Dave shared with you back in May. 
Now turning to our Q2 non-GAAP revenue results on a geographic basis. North America revenue in Q2 was $289 million, up 9% from last year and up 9% on a constant currency basis. North America revenue accounted for 58% of consolidated revenue. International revenue was $207 million, up 2% from last year and up 4% on a constant currency basis. International revenue accounted for 42% of consolidated revenue, and we saw mid-double digit growth in Asia-Pacific, single digit growth in Latin America and Japan while EMEA was slightly down year-over-year. 
On a segment basis, in Q2 our Corporate business achieved non-GAAP revenue of $305 million, up 5% year-over-year and up 6% on a constant currency basis. We continued to see strength in large multi-element sales orders. In Q2, we saw a total of 30 sales deals over $1 million in size compared to 19 deals in Q1 2010 and 28 in Q2 of last year. 
In addition, we saw increases in the number of sales orders above $100,000 with a total of 474 deals this quarter compared to 384 deals last quarter and 452 the year before that. The percentage of these corporate transactions with multiple element solutions also continues to grow reinforcing our end-to-end integrated security strategy. 
In SMB, we saw high-single digit growth year-over-year, and we were particularly pleased with the contributions from MX Logic this quarter. The key takeaway here is that the overall growth in the number of large transactions we're seeing and the high percentage of multiple elements within these large deals is a key indicator of the momentum we're seeing in our Corporate business. 
We achieved an all-time record in our Consumer business with Q2 revenue of $191 million, up 8% year-over-year and up 9% on a constant currency basis. Year-over-year, our Q2 online sales were up double digits and our online renewal sales increased 20%. 
Now moving down the income statement. Q2 non-GAAP gross profit margin for the second quarter was 78.2%, up 10 basis points sequentially. Now as a reminder, our strategy encompasses a broad portfolio of offerings including software, hardware, services and cloud-based solutions. Consequently, mix can be challenging to forecast. However, margins across all of our segments in Q2 remained relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter. 
Operating margins in Q2 were $258 million, down 3% sequentially and up 4% over Q2 last year. In Q2, our marketing expenses decreased as we optimized one of our OEM partner agreements. We remain focused on aligning our business operations and cost structure to withstand significant foreign-exchange headwinds we have experienced while also continuing to invest in our business. 
During Q2, we completed a restructuring that effectively streamlines our business under four business units: endpoint, content, risk and compliance, and network security. We also improved efficiencies in our sales operations. These cost reductions were both in real terms and against our original plan for 2010. They have also enabled us to target our investments to areas likely to provide the best return in the next few quarters while continuing to invest in our portfolio of product and solution offerings. In addition, we continue to reshape our go-to-market headcount and resources to focus on those markets and customers which provide us the best growth opportunities. 
For example, we were able to take some non-quota-carrying sales overlays in our Network business and redeploy a number of these resources in direct quota-carrying positions. 
As of June 30, we had 6,088 employees worldwide, which is roughly flat with our headcount in Q1, but headcount with direct quota responsibility increased 3%. 
We do expect to manage expenses tightly going forward given the continued currency headwinds. Q2 non-GAAP operating income was $129 million, up 3% year-over-year. I was pleased to see that our Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 26.1% compared to 25.2%, sequentially, slightly ahead of our anticipated margin range reflecting good cost control and the OEM extension I've mentioned earlier. The effects of foreign exchange on revenue expenses had a total negative impact to operating income of approximately $7 million quarter-over-quarter. Overall, we were pleased with operating margin and performance this quarter despite many of the challenges we were facing. 
In Q2, our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $98 million, up 4% over Q2 last year, and non-GAAP net income as a percentage of revenue was 20%, slightly improved from last quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.63, up 5% both sequentially and year-over-year. And within this, foreign exchange headwinds had a negative impact of $0.04. 
Now turning to some balance sheet highlights. Net accounts receivable balance at the end of Q2 2010 was $244 million compared with $231 million for the first quarter of 2010. DSO, or days sales outstanding, were 45 days for the second quarter 2010 compared to 41 days in Q1 and 51 days in the prior year. Both of these metrics reflect continued solid working capital management. 
Deferred revenue at the end of Q2 was $1.4 billion, up 5% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, deferred revenue was up 10% year-over-year. The composition of our deferred revenue balance at the end of Q2 was 65% in relation to our Corporate business and 35% in relation to our Consumer business. Approximately 80% of our Q2 2010 revenue was from the balance sheet, and approximately 91% was recurring in nature from services, support and subscriptions. 
During the quarter, we generated $134 million of operating cash flow, up 152% from Q2 '09 and down $23 million, sequentially. Another reminder, Q1 is typically a seasonally stronger cash collections period following our seasonally larger Q4 sales period. 
And just a comment on Q2 cash usage. We completed the acquisition of Trust Digital this quarter, and we're excited about this development in our mobile strategy. We look forward to integrating Trust Digital's Mobile Management Platform into our offerings and expanding the endpoint reach of our business. And I’d personally like to welcome Trust Digital's employees to the company. 
During Q2, we repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares for $150 million at an average price of $32.30 per share. Year-to-date, we’ve deployed $300 million towards repurchasing 8.3 million shares at an average price of $35.97 per share. We have $200 million remaining in our current authorization. 
Cash and marketable securities at quarter end were $804 million compared to $902 million in Q1 2010. The change in our cash position was mostly due to stock repurchase, acquisitions and seasonally normal changes in our operating cash flow. 
I’d just like to finish my formal financial overview remarks with a comment on McAfee's long-term performance. Over the last few years, McAfee's been on a consistent and strong growth journey and delivered solid performance. Over this time, we've expanded our addressable markets, deepened the breadth of security solutions we offer and successfully integrated acquisitions, which position us well for the future. Our leadership position in digital security’s paying off, and we are focused on continuing our trajectory of growth profitability for our shareholders. 
So in summary, McAfee demonstrated good operational execution in Q2 across many aspects of our business, and I'm particularly pleased with the operating margin performance and cash flow generation. Despite foreign currency headwinds, the health of the business remains strong, and we are optimistic about the company's near-term and longer-term prospects. And I'd like to thank our employees for their particularly hard work this quarter, and now I'll turn the call back to Dave for his comments."

I made the point that McAfee's market is growing, our strategy is working, and our financial performance continues to be strong. Q2 was a good quarter for McAfee, and I believe our sales booking and operating cash flow are the most important metrics we can really see the health of the business. 
I gave you a detailed overview of the financial impact of the false-positive resolution in the quarter, and that's now behind us. 
Looking ahead, I truly believe the future is bright for McAfee, and we're headed in the back half of the year well positioned to achieve many of our 2010 strategic goals. Unlike any other security provider, McAfee offers a full complement of consumer and corporate security products, services and solutions covering all the bases, endpoint, network and the cloud. We've shifted this company's effective opportunity from a very good foundation of Antivirus business to a business that continues to lead the market while entering a greenfield of new market opportunities such as our stronger push into mobile with our Trust Digital and WaveSecure acquisitions. We have a world-class PC OEM partnership model, and we've really diversified our Consumer business to other channels that are really starting to produce, ISPs, financial service companies like Bank of America, Facebook, Adobe among many others. And I hope you've seen the huge product cycle we're in. We essentially have new products and refresh cycles going on in all of our business units, and in particular, our Consumer business coming soon. 
To summarize and move into our outlook, we remain very excited about the opportunities we see in 2010. And to start off the year, there were a number of factors driving my confidence and optimism that remains true now. I believe we have the right ingredients to continue to be the leader in the digital security market, we have a very strong product cycle and product portfolio to help customers from consumers to enterprises from network to endpoint, from individual PCs to the cloud. We’ve got an incredible network of partners and alliances covering many key areas of government, telecommunications, technology and more. To provide specific color on our current bookings forecast, our estimates show accelerated growth quarter-over-quarter of about $30 million, just in Q3. This represents a forecasted growth of over 10% year-over-year after adjusting for foreign exchange impact. 
And one more data point that I'll share is over the last six quarters, we've achieved an average 99% of our forecasted sales order bookings. This is just one reason for my confidence and optimism in McAfee's business prospects for Q3, and our goal of another triple-double year on a constant currency basis. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Jonathan for our Q3 outlook. Jonathan?"
32053,107914965,70564,"McAfee, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","McAfee LLC","Executives","Thanks, Dave. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements.

Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and that actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. The guidance we're providing is on a non-GAAP basis with reconciliation to GAAP. As Dave discussed, we are optimistic about McAfee's prospects and our ability to achieve strong performance this year. I do want to remind you, first, that we are facing some unprecedented foreign exchange headwinds. We are expecting that these will especially affect our revenue over the foreseeable future. Based on currency movements, as we last spoke with you at our Analysts Day, we are expecting approximately $8 million of negative revenue impact sequentially going into Q3. 
On a year-over-year basis, this translates to as much as $18 million and $25 million in Q3 and Q4, respectively. We highly encourage you to take this into account as you construct your own analysis for the second half. Our outlook for your information, assumes a $1.27 U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate for Q3, and we're anticipating a strengthening of the dollar in Q4. 
Apart from these comments, we’ll be providing guidance for the third quarter only. The third quarter of 2010, we expect to achieve revenue in the range of $505 million to $520 million, up 4% to 7% year-over-year. From a sequential perspective, we expect to see approximately 2% to 5% growth. 
As I stated earlier, forecasting gross margin is challenging due to the mix of our digital security product and services portfolio that may be sold in any period. We expect to manage gross margins and operating expenses together to achieve a target operating income range. 
We expect to achieve non-GAAP operating income margin in the range of 24% to 26% in the third quarter and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.62 per share to $0.66 per share on a fully diluted basis. We expect to continue to generate between $100 million to $150 million in operating cash flow per quarter or approximately $550 million in cash flow for 2010. For Q3, we expect to be at the lower end of this range. 
Our outlook for Q3 is based on a fully diluted share count in the range of 154 million to 156 million shares compared to a fully diluted share count of 160 million shares in Q3, 2009. And we're assuming an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 24%. 
Within our Q3 non-GAAP guidance assumptions, we estimate the following rule of thumb: For every $0.01 movement in the euro, revenue is impacted by approximately $1.3 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share is impacted by approximately half a penny. As Kate mentioned in her opening comments, we have provided a currency rule of thumb for you on our website. I'll now turn the call back to Dave for his summary and conclusions."

Before we take some questions in closing, I hope you had a good understanding of the opportunity McAfee has this year: a stabilizing global economy, the security market poised to grow faster than the overall IT and its exponential growth in threats, regulations and devices. Simply put, the opportunity in security is one that I still have a lot of greenfield and is a great business. I firmly believe McAfee is very competitively positioned in this business with a good diversified model, strong product portfolios, top-notch partners and strategic alliances and a very strong management team. In fact, in the time I've been at McAfee, I've never been more encouraged by the opportunities I see now. 
Today, I’ve really tried to give you a straightforward overview of what's happening at McAfee, our opportunity, our strategy and our success and as a result, and what’s probably most important is how bright the future is for the company, both in Q3 and long beyond.

We had to do a little more discounting, we showed that, the normal on some of the resolutions we had.

Really the challenges really are in the, I would say, some of the mid-segments, probably outside the U.S. a little bit, mostly in Europe. If you kind of looked at a balance there. But how we’re handling the DAT files and things, that's behind us. We largely had that completed. I thought it was an extraordinary effort what we went through just in terms of resolving customers, the commitment we weighed, really going out of our way to show our customers that we were going to stand behind them and they showed it back by really purchasing from us, extending their contracts with us. The only real challenge we ended up having was despite a strong bookings quarter was the yield of revenue from those bookings. And Jonathan talked a little bit about some of the numbers there that despite the strong bookings numbers, we didn't quite get the revenue yield, mostly related to that DAT and because of concessions and the way we have to take revenue and tally on that, but again, look at bookings, look at cash flow, look at contracts, number of deals, we saw a lot of price solid data points in the business particularly Corporate and I think we're on the right track there."

Yes, we were very pleased that we were able to really secure a multiyear commitment out of these top PC OEMs and I'm sure you can guess who they are, but this was a very solid relationship foundation for us as you can see. Pretty strong. It's really a shared revenue sort of agreement and that's really what gets it. It's risk and reward together, and this is the basis for how we built and diversified our portfolio of consumer partnerships and of course, I pointed out also, we've got some very strong partnerships outside of the PC OEMs going. And the Facebook numbers look great, the Adobe numbers look good, we’re diversifying with banks and I would tell you that’s certainly a really good shared partnership model that we closed in the quarter. And you can see what the units that we're getting out of these deals versus some of our competition we've really got, I think, the foundation set that we wanted to do."

First is",486,"Yes, Rob, I think you're very insightful here because we've really seen a tipping point the last few quarters, and kudos to Apple and Rim and others who have really penetrated the markets, but I'll make some comments around two different markets. First is corporate. We've seen a mass influx of corporate Smart phones, kind of consumerization in the corporate model is heavily upon us right now. There’s hardly a day goes by where we don't get requests for some new device type to be connected to the network. And of course, how do you manage that securely? So Corporate is really seeing some trends right now where Apple, iPhone, iPads, Android phones, name your favorite Smart phone, you have to manage it securely. So the Trust Digital deal that we did I thought was ideal in combining with our EPO platform. Now we can manage not only PC Windows-types devices, but Smart phones through the same console, single-agent, single console and really manage kind of all devices there. And of course, we're seeing deals with ATMs and point-of-sale registers and all kinds of endpoints there. But Smart phones, I'm really seeing an inflection point now, and I'm starting to see a lot of phone access. It's just adding more nodes to what we can manage. And it’s really creating an elasticity to our endpoint model just like we did ToPS on Windows, we’re doing ToPS on mobile. And the consumer space, we’re earlier on, I would say in security, but we're excited about the prospects there. We clearly see not just the device manufacturers beginning to push for things like secure commerce, secure web browsing and safe searching and shopping from your device. But also the telecommunications companies are really beginning to look at opportunities there, because they also see the ability to go to a store, activate a security feature, kind of an insurance card. If you lose your phone, you can wipe it, lock it, kill it, encrypt it, locate it. And there is a suite of features here that we think the consumers will purchase at time of activation or later on this via the cloud. So we’re in early days Consumer, but I think this is exciting. I think the holiday period, you’ll see a lot more of this and especially going in 2011 and we’re there. We’ve really now got the pieces, a very strong company in what's called 10-Q, but the product line’s called WaveSecure based out of Singapore, very internationalized, Chinese support, other language support, we can go global with our telecommunications partnerships, they've already done SingTel, which is one of them in Singapore and we feel like we could replicate that model, the Telcos, with Smart phone management from McAfee. So again, excited about the space. I see a lot of good points now after a few years finally it’s kind of here, both Corporate and Consumer."

Jonathan mentioned the MX Logic's success that we had, and that product is centered towards the mid and small space. Some of the things we've done with our McAfee SECURE is centered towards that as well, which is our vulnerability scanning products for retailers. And that’ll also we haven't talked a whole lot about the Verizon partnership as well.

All right, well let's get started. Q2 was a really challenging, emotional, but really rewarding quarter, probably the most I've had in my career. In the face of some very difficult adversities, McAfee emerged",1514,"Welcome, Jonathan. I'll practice your accent. All right, well let's get started. Q2 was a really challenging, emotional, but really rewarding quarter, probably the most I've had in my career. In the face of some very difficult adversities, McAfee emerged stronger than ever, and I for one am very optimistic, more optimistic than ever while I've been here at McAfee. 
Today, I'd like to discuss and comment on five major themes that capture the essence of the opportunity and the optimism I see in the market and for the company. First, I see continued improvement in the macroeconomic conditions for IT. We’ve seen multiple successive quarters of improvement in spending in most segments worldwide. This, coupled with the dramatically improving market expansion for security endpoints, creates a strong positive business dynamic for McAfee. 
In addition, McAfee managed to overcome significant adversity and turn this into a market advantage through focused Q2 initiatives. As a result, I believe McAfee had one of its best quarters in years as highlighted by exceptional execution in bookings, operating expenses, big deal contracts, major PC OEM extensions, new partnerships and outstanding cash flow from operations. I believe the future never looked brighter as we're now set to drive market share growth for years to come. 
And with that opening, I want to further explain the optimism that is pervasive here at McAfee. First, we have to look at our core security market. For many years, McAfee primarily had one product, antivirus, and sold on one major platform, PCs. We experienced a near doubling of our company from just over $1 billion in sales in 2006 to more than $2 billion in 2010 as we expanded our single-product focus to a full suite. Our conversion programs have worked well with more than 50% of our installed base now using multiple stickier McAfee products from Total Protection for consumers, to ToPS and the Enterprise. 
The market for PCs remains very strong as we’ve seen 20%-plus growth in units shipped just in the first half of 2010. This, coupled with the fact that we now have extended our agreements with two of the three largest PC device manufacturers for several more years, secures our opportunity for a long time. McAfee will ship on more than 25% of all PCs shipped worldwide through just these two partnerships, far exceeding that of HP and our primary rival. These expanded relationships do not require the use of upfront cash and are accretive to our results for the terms of the contracts. 
Add in our over 220 partnerships across PC OEMs, ISPs, financial firms, social networks and others, and we have access to more than 50% of the market including more than half of the consumer PC units shipped by the top 10 manufacturers. 
Our ever-broadening suite enabled us to grow our Consumer business in Q2 to $191 million, up 9% on a constant currency basis. As a solid sign of the market’s strength, our top end suites for consumers grew 63%. And now as we watch the explosion of new devices, our opportunity has grown dramatically. In fact, we estimate that our market will expand from approximately 1 billion devices in the PC market to more than 50 billion IP-connected devices worldwide. This is where our strategy is really paying off. 
McAfee has put the pieces in place to capture this market opportunity for devices such as Smart phones, ATM machines, point-of-sale devices, USB-connected devices, cars, TVs and many, many more. Over the past few years, we’ve worked hard to dramatically expand the breadth of our product offerings. We have broadened our security footprint to help customers respond whether on any kind of endpoint, the network or in the cloud and across the whole technology stack. 
As another example of that, today, I'm very pleased to be announcing our next-generation mobility platform that enables us to capture market share from Consumer segments to Enterprises for all Smart phones, tablets and slates with the broadest feature set in the industry. Our acquisition of the WaveSecure mobile security service, coupled with the Trust Digital and our own mobile products, gives us a very unique advantage. 
Worldwide mobile phone sales totaled 315 million units in the first quarter of 2010, a 17% increase from the same period in 2009 according to Gartner. Smart phone sales reached 54 million units, an increase of nearly 50% from the first quarter of 2009. 
In addition to the major PC OEM contract extensions and the acquisition of WaveSecure, we're pleased to announce the signing of an agreement with Verizon Business to market McAfee Verizon cobranded SSL products and solutions utilizing Verizon's SSL technology and certificates to secure online transactions. This strategic relationship provides us with yet another compelling value proposition that we believe will be very disruptive in the marketplace. 
Furthering our strategy, you may have seen earlier this week our announcement with Polycom to secure unified communications, thus extending the types of devices McAfee can secure. And recently, we announced that McAfee now has relationships to provide security on USB drives sold by 2/3 of the world's secure USB drive makers. 
All-in-all, we pioneered an open security risk management platform, leveraging our security management product called ePolicy Orchestrator, to more than 100 partners in our security alliance program. Through strategic alliances and partnerships, McAfee technology today is included in more third-party devices, appliances and in ever more products than before. We've created a bridge from the PC-centric world to a world where everything is digital and everything is connected. More importantly, we're continuing to gain competitive advantage by developing and acquiring the right technologies for where the security market is headed. 
The success of our strategy is really clearly reflected in our deals. We closed a near-record number of million-dollar deals plus in Q2. Over 80% of these transactions included multiple McAfee products and longer contract terms. Customers are securing and managing more connected devices with McAfee, enabling us to fulfill our strategy of silicon and satellite secure device management, all integrated to our cloud and on-premise management platforms. 
Another important sign of the opportunity in the market is the way we turned an adverse event into opportunity. I don't want to over-dramatize this, but few events in life end up providing an opportunity as the event we experienced this past quarter. I'm talking about our false-positive incident. For those who have not followed our company closely, this was a security update that we released in late April that impacted some of our customers, albeit a small percentage of our overall customer base. We had approximately 1,600 Enterprise customers and 11,000 Consumer customers affected. I'm very proud to state now that not only did we respond quickly and very effectively to these customers, we've resiled [ph 26:06] 99% more of the issues related to these incidences. And we did so without losing any Corporate customers and without any legal actions. And more importantly, in a quarter where we had a near record number of $1 million-plus deals, some of our largest deals in the quarter were with affected customers. 
For example, we had a very large educational institution, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies and a major global financial institution, all increased their commitment to McAfee by purchasing more McAfee products in the past quarter than they ever have done before. I believe this reflects the fact that our customers are really engaging in the strategic importance of McAfee, and many have raised the level of importance of our company as a critical partner within their IT infrastructure and made us a trusted security adviser. You will see and hear more about our new Global Trust and Safety Initiative that will set new industry standards in the areas of quality assurance, technical innovations, support and services and community awareness. 
When I net out the total estimated impact of a false-positive incident in Q2, our bookings impact to the extra discounts and offers were about $15 million. The revenue impact due to deferrals was about $6 million of deferred revenue not recognized from the balance sheet, and revenue was also negatively impacted by another approximately $14 million. Cost and expenses were approximately $2 million, and the total cash to customers was just $3 million. And this is all included in the above impact. In summary, the impact of the false-positive to our Q2 revenue results were greater than we anticipated with the biggest difference being against our expectations of lower in-period revenue from sales deals related to the incident. 
As I’ve said many times, but I'd really like to express my heartfelt thanks and gratitude to our employees for their hard work and to our customers and partners for their continued support of McAfee. 
Looking ahead, I'm very pleased that this event’s behind us, and we’re moving forward as a company, stronger than ever before. Our pipeline for Q3 is strong, and we'll talk a little bit more about that later in the call. Now let me turn the call over to Jonathan, and we'll cover our strong Q2 results. Jonathan?"
32053,107914965,71399,"McAfee, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","McAfee LLC","Executives","Thank you, Dave. Again, I'm very excited to be part of the McAfee family and again, I truly appreciate the warm welcome and look forward to working with you all.

Again, I'm very excited to be part of the McAfee family and again, I truly appreciate the warm welcome and look forward to working with you all. I do see a tremendous amount of opportunity in this market and internally within McAfee to drive value to our customers, partners, shareholders and employees. 
Now turning to Q2 results in more detail. I'm pleased to report that McAfee had a very good Q2 on a number of fronts. On a constant currency basis, we achieved strong year-over-year growth in each of our major metrics. Non-GAAP revenue, up 7%; non-GAAP net income, up 9%; non-GAAP earnings per share, up 10%; deferred revenue, up 10%; and cash flow from operations, up 160% year-over-year. 
Now I'd like to go into a little bit more detail on our Q2 revenue results. Our non-GAAP revenue was $495 million, up 6% year-over-year and up 7% on a constant currency basis. We observed a high level of foreign exchange headwind this quarter with $5 million year-over-year and $12 million quarter-over-quarter. We had approximately $14 million of lower in-period revenue as new sales orders came in at lower revenue realization rates. This realization was lower than anticipated with the lowest level for the past four quarters. This means that more revenue than normal was deferred to future periods and therefore not recognized as revenue in Q2. These deferrals were largely caused by extension of contract durations with certain corporate customers as part of their Q2 false-positive resolution. So when you net out the effects of foreign exchange, and the false-positive issue on this quarter's revenue, you see we would have been comfortably within the range of the revenue guidance Dave shared with you back in May. 
Now turning to our Q2 non-GAAP revenue results on a geographic basis. North America revenue in Q2 was $289 million, up 9% from last year and up 9% on a constant currency basis. North America revenue accounted for 58% of consolidated revenue. International revenue was $207 million, up 2% from last year and up 4% on a constant currency basis. International revenue accounted for 42% of consolidated revenue, and we saw mid-double digit growth in Asia-Pacific, single digit growth in Latin America and Japan while EMEA was slightly down year-over-year. 
On a segment basis, in Q2 our Corporate business achieved non-GAAP revenue of $305 million, up 5% year-over-year and up 6% on a constant currency basis. We continued to see strength in large multi-element sales orders. In Q2, we saw a total of 30 sales deals over $1 million in size compared to 19 deals in Q1 2010 and 28 in Q2 of last year. 
In addition, we saw increases in the number of sales orders above $100,000 with a total of 474 deals this quarter compared to 384 deals last quarter and 452 the year before that. The percentage of these corporate transactions with multiple element solutions also continues to grow reinforcing our end-to-end integrated security strategy. 
In SMB, we saw high-single digit growth year-over-year, and we were particularly pleased with the contributions from MX Logic this quarter. The key takeaway here is that the overall growth in the number of large transactions we're seeing and the high percentage of multiple elements within these large deals is a key indicator of the momentum we're seeing in our Corporate business. 
We achieved an all-time record in our Consumer business with Q2 revenue of $191 million, up 8% year-over-year and up 9% on a constant currency basis. Year-over-year, our Q2 online sales were up double digits and our online renewal sales increased 20%. 
Now moving down the income statement. Q2 non-GAAP gross profit margin for the second quarter was 78.2%, up 10 basis points sequentially. Now as a reminder, our strategy encompasses a broad portfolio of offerings including software, hardware, services and cloud-based solutions. Consequently, mix can be challenging to forecast. However, margins across all of our segments in Q2 remained relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter. 
Operating margins in Q2 were $258 million, down 3% sequentially and up 4% over Q2 last year. In Q2, our marketing expenses decreased as we optimized one of our OEM partner agreements. We remain focused on aligning our business operations and cost structure to withstand significant foreign-exchange headwinds we have experienced while also continuing to invest in our business. 
During Q2, we completed a restructuring that effectively streamlines our business under four business units: endpoint, content, risk and compliance, and network security. We also improved efficiencies in our sales operations. These cost reductions were both in real terms and against our original plan for 2010. They have also enabled us to target our investments to areas likely to provide the best return in the next few quarters while continuing to invest in our portfolio of product and solution offerings. In addition, we continue to reshape our go-to-market headcount and resources to focus on those markets and customers which provide us the best growth opportunities. 
For example, we were able to take some non-quota-carrying sales overlays in our Network business and redeploy a number of these resources in direct quota-carrying positions. 
As of June 30, we had 6,088 employees worldwide, which is roughly flat with our headcount in Q1, but headcount with direct quota responsibility increased 3%. 
We do expect to manage expenses tightly going forward given the continued currency headwinds. Q2 non-GAAP operating income was $129 million, up 3% year-over-year. I was pleased to see that our Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 26.1% compared to 25.2%, sequentially, slightly ahead of our anticipated margin range reflecting good cost control and the OEM extension I've mentioned earlier. The effects of foreign exchange on revenue expenses had a total negative impact to operating income of approximately $7 million quarter-over-quarter. Overall, we were pleased with operating margin and performance this quarter despite many of the challenges we were facing. 
In Q2, our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $98 million, up 4% over Q2 last year, and non-GAAP net income as a percentage of revenue was 20%, slightly improved from last quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.63, up 5% both sequentially and year-over-year. And within this, foreign exchange headwinds had a negative impact of $0.04. 
Now turning to some balance sheet highlights. Net accounts receivable balance at the end of Q2 2010 was $244 million compared with $231 million for the first quarter of 2010. DSO, or days sales outstanding, were 45 days for the second quarter 2010 compared to 41 days in Q1 and 51 days in the prior year. Both of these metrics reflect continued solid working capital management. 
Deferred revenue at the end of Q2 was $1.4 billion, up 5% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, deferred revenue was up 10% year-over-year. The composition of our deferred revenue balance at the end of Q2 was 65% in relation to our Corporate business and 35% in relation to our Consumer business. Approximately 80% of our Q2 2010 revenue was from the balance sheet, and approximately 91% was recurring in nature from services, support and subscriptions. 
During the quarter, we generated $134 million of operating cash flow, up 152% from Q2 '09 and down $23 million, sequentially. Another reminder, Q1 is typically a seasonally stronger cash collections period following our seasonally larger Q4 sales period. 
And just a comment on Q2 cash usage. We completed the acquisition of Trust Digital this quarter, and we're excited about this development in our mobile strategy. We look forward to integrating Trust Digital's Mobile Management Platform into our offerings and expanding the endpoint reach of our business. And I’d personally like to welcome Trust Digital's employees to the company. 
During Q2, we repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares for $150 million at an average price of $32.30 per share. Year-to-date, we’ve deployed $300 million towards repurchasing 8.3 million shares at an average price of $35.97 per share. We have $200 million remaining in our current authorization. 
Cash and marketable securities at quarter end were $804 million compared to $902 million in Q1 2010. The change in our cash position was mostly due to stock repurchase, acquisitions and seasonally normal changes in our operating cash flow. 
I’d just like to finish my formal financial overview remarks with a comment on McAfee's long-term performance. Over the last few years, McAfee's been on a consistent and strong growth journey and delivered solid performance. Over this time, we've expanded our addressable markets, deepened the breadth of security solutions we offer and successfully integrated acquisitions, which position us well for the future. Our leadership position in digital security’s paying off, and we are focused on continuing our trajectory of growth profitability for our shareholders. 
So in summary, McAfee demonstrated good operational execution in Q2 across many aspects of our business, and I'm particularly pleased with the operating margin performance and cash flow generation. Despite foreign currency headwinds, the health of the business remains strong, and we are optimistic about the company's near-term and longer-term prospects. And I'd like to thank our employees for their particularly hard work this quarter, and now I'll turn the call back to Dave for his comments."

I made the point that McAfee's market is growing, our strategy is working, and our financial performance continues to be strong. Q2 was a good quarter for McAfee, and I believe our sales booking and operating cash flow are the most important metrics we can really see the health of the business. 
I gave you a detailed overview of the financial impact of the false-positive resolution in the quarter, and that's now behind us. 
Looking ahead, I truly believe the future is bright for McAfee, and we're headed into the back half of the year well positioned to achieve many of our 2010 strategic goals. Unlike any other security provider, McAfee offers a full complement of consumer and corporate security products, services and solutions covering all the bases, endpoint, network and the cloud. We've shifted this company's effective opportunity from a very good foundation of Antivirus business to a business that continues to lead the market while entering a greenfield of new market opportunities such as our stronger push into mobile with our Trust Digital and WaveSecure acquisitions. We have a world-class PC OEM partnership model, and we've really diversified our Consumer business to other channels that are really starting to produce: ISPs, financial service companies like Bank of America, Facebook Adobe among many others. And I hope you've seen the huge product cycle we're in. We essentially have new products or refresh cycles going on in all of our business units, and in particular, our Consumer business coming soon. 
To summarize and move into our outlook, we remain very excited about the opportunities we see in 2010. And as we start off the year, there were a number of factors driving my confidence and optimism that remains true now. I believe we have the right ingredients to continue to be the leader in the digital security market. We have a very strong product cycle and product portfolio to help customers from consumers to enterprises, from network to endpoint, from individual PCs to the cloud. We’ve got an incredible network of partners and alliances covering many key areas of government, telecommunications, technology and more. To provide specific color on our current bookings forecast, our estimates show accelerated growth quarter-over-quarter of about $30 million, just in Q3. This represents a forecasted growth of over 10% year-over-year after adjusting for foreign exchange impact. 
And one more data point that I'll share is over the last six quarters, we've achieved an average 99% of our forecasted sales order bookings. This is just one reason for my confidence and optimism in McAfee's business prospects for Q3, and our goal of another triple-double year on a constant currency basis. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Jonathan for our Q3 outlook. Jonathan?"

Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and that actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. The guidance we're providing is on a non-GAAP basis with reconciliation to GAAP. As Dave discussed, we are optimistic about McAfee's prospects and our ability to achieve strong performance this year. I do want to remind you, first, that we are facing some unprecedented foreign exchange headwinds. We are expecting that these will especially affect our revenue over the foreseeable future. Based on currency movements, since we last spoke with you at our Analyst Day, we are expecting approximately $8 million of negative revenue impact sequentially going into Q3. 
On a year-over-year basis, this translates to as much as $18 million and $25 million in Q3 and Q4, respectively. We highly encourage you to take this into account as you construct your own analysis for the second half. Our outlook for your information, assumes a $1.27 U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate for Q3, and we're anticipating a strengthening of the dollar in Q4. 
Apart from these comments, we’ll be providing guidance for the third quarter only. The third quarter of 2010, we expect to achieve revenue in the range of $505 million to $520 million, up 4% to 7% year-over-year. From a sequential perspective, we expect to see approximately 2% to 5% growth. 
As I stated earlier, forecasting gross margin is challenging due to the mix of our digital security product and services portfolio that may be sold in any period. We expect to manage gross margins and operating expenses together to achieve a target operating income range. 
We expect to achieve non-GAAP operating income margin in the range of 24% to 26% in the third quarter and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.62 per share to $0.66 per share on a fully diluted basis. We expect to continue to generate between $100 million to $150 million in operating cash flow per quarter or approximately $550 million in cash flow for 2010. For Q3, we expect to be at the lower end of this range. 
Our outlook for Q3 is based on a fully diluted share count in the range of 154 million to 156 million shares compared to a fully diluted share count of 160 million shares in Q3, 2009. And we're assuming an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 24%. 
Within our Q3 non-GAAP guidance assumptions, we estimate the following rule of thumb: For every $0.01 movement in the euro, revenue is impacted by approximately $1.3 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share is impacted by approximately half a penny. As Kate mentioned in her opening comments, we have provided a currency rule of thumb for you on our website. I'll now turn the call back to Dave for his summary and conclusions."

Before we take some questions in closing, I hope you had a good understanding of the opportunity McAfee has this year: a stabilizing global economy, the security market poised to grow faster than the overall IT and its exponential growth in threats, regulations and devices.

I firmly believe McAfee is very competitively positioned in this business with a good diversified model, strong product portfolios, top-notch partners and strategic alliances and a very strong management team. In fact, in the time I've been at McAfee, I've never been more encouraged by the opportunities I see now. 
Today, I’ve really tried to give you a straightforward overview of what's happening at McAfee, our opportunity, our strategy and our success and as a result, and what’s probably most important is how bright the future is for the company, both in Q3 and long beyond.

I would tell you we had a very strong and probably our best area of execution outside of Consumers really. It’s been in the higher-end Enterprise, 30 deals over $1 million, our second highest in the company's history, our best ever Q2 quarter for number of million dollars deals. If you looked at what Jonathan showed in deals over $500k, deals over $100k, really an Enterprise strength. We were very, very solid and this despite some of the adversity I mentioned as well that we felt like – we didn’t see really any price issues. We had to do a little more discounting, we showed that, the normal on some of the resolutions we had. But generally, we got longer contract lengths, we've got longer commitments from our customers, the number of verticals and industries that we were able to close large deals was excellent, not just governments and banks and telcos, but I mentioned education and pharmaceutical and probably the best element that I saw was 80-plus percent of those big deals had multi-elements to it meaning network, endpoint, cloud combinations and it really played to our strategy, particularly in the high-end Corporate. We're taking market share, we're winning against our competition and I think we have the right strategy there, and as I mentioned we're optimistic about Q3 and the second half of the year with that same play."

Our SMB business, as Jonathan alluded to, was solid. MX Logic was really a standout this past quarter, a cloud kind of delivery of security. The over $1 million, and over $500k, over $100k transaction types were pretty strong. Really the challenges really are in the, I would say, some of the mid-segments, probably outside the U.S. a little bit, mostly in Europe. If you kind of looked at a balance there. But how we’re handling the DAT files and things, that's behind us. We largely had that completed. I thought it was an extraordinary effort what we went through just in terms of resolving customers, the commitment we weighed, really going out of our way to show our customers that we were going to stand behind them and they showed it back by really purchasing from us, extending their contracts with us. The only real challenge we ended up having was despite a strong bookings quarter was the yield of revenue from those bookings. And Jonathan talked a little bit about some of the numbers there that despite the strong bookings numbers, we didn't quite get the revenue yield, mostly related to that DAT and because of concessions and the way we have to take revenue and tally on that, but again, look at bookings, look at cash flow, look at contracts, number of deals, we saw a lot of price solid data points in the business particularly Corporate and I think we're on the right track there."

I think the sort of key takeaway on that when you do look at that $6 million to $20 million total revenue impact this quarter for items related to the false-positive, it’s substantially all of that that’s sitting now in deferred revenue. And you saw that with deferred revenue up 10% on a constant currency basis. So again, future benefit for us. We’ll manage that appropriately as we go forward."

First is",485,"Yes, Rob, I think you're very insightful here because we've really seen a tipping point the last few quarters, and kudos to Apple and RIM and others who have really penetrated the markets, but I'll make some comments around two different markets. First is corporate. We've seen a mass influx of corporate Smart phones, kind of consumerization in the corporate model is heavily upon us right now. There’s hardly a day goes by where we don't get requests for some new device type to be connected to the network. And of course, how do you manage that securely? So Corporate is really seeing some trends right now where Apple, iPhone, iPads, Droid phones, name your favorite Smart phone, you have to manage it securely. So the Trust Digital deal that we did I thought was ideal in combining with our ePO platform. Now we can manage not only PC Windows-types devices, but Smart phones through the same console, single-agent, single console and really manage kind of all devices there. And of course, we're seeing deals with ATMs and point-of-sale registers and all kinds of endpoints there. But Smart phones, I'm really seeing an inflection point now, and I'm starting to see a lot of phone access. It's just adding more nodes to what we can manage. And it’s really creating an elasticity to our endpoint model just like we did ToPS on Windows, we’re doing ToPS on mobile. On the consumer space, where earlier on, I would say in security, but we're excited about the prospects there. We clearly see not just the device manufacturers beginning to push for things like secure commerce, secure web browsing and safe searching and shopping from your device. But also the telecommunications companies are really beginning to look at opportunities there, because they also see the ability to go to a store, activate a security feature, kind of an insurance card. If you lose your phone, you can wipe it, lock it, kill it, encrypt it, locate it. And there's a suite of features here that we think the consumers will purchase at time of activation or later on this via the cloud. So we’re in early days Consumer, but I think this is exciting. I think the holiday period, you’ll see a lot more of this and especially going in 2011 and we’re there. We’ve really now got the pieces, a very strong company, it was called tenCube, but the product line’s called WaveSecure based out of Singapore, very internationalized, Chinese support, other language support, we can go global with our telecommunications partnerships, they've already done SingTel, which is one of them in Singapore and we feel like we could replicate that model, the Telcos, with Smart phone management from McAfee. So again, excited about the space. I see a lot of good points now after a few years finally it’s kind of here, both Corporate and Consumer."

Jonathan mentioned the MX Logic's success that we had, and that product is centered towards the mid and small space. Some of the things we've done with our McAfee SECURE is centered towards that as well, which is our vulnerability scanning products for retailers. And that’ll also we haven't talked a whole lot about the Verizon partnership as well.

All right, well let's get started. Q2 was a really challenging, emotional, but really rewarding quarter, probably the most I've had in my career. In the face of some very difficult adversities, McAfee emerged",1514,"Welcome, Jonathan. I'll practice your accent. All right, well let's get started. Q2 was a really challenging, emotional, but really rewarding quarter, probably the most I've had in my career. In the face of some very difficult adversities, McAfee emerged stronger than ever, and I for one am very optimistic, more optimistic than ever while I've been here at McAfee. 
Today, I'd like to discuss and comment on five major themes that capture the essence of the opportunity and the optimism I see in the market and for the company. First, I see continued improvement in the macroeconomic conditions for IT. We’ve seen multiple successive quarters of improvement in spending in most segments worldwide. This, coupled with the dramatically improving market expansion for security endpoints, creates a strong positive business dynamic for McAfee. 
In addition, McAfee managed to overcome significant adversity and turn this into a market advantage through focused Q2 initiatives. As a result, I believe McAfee had one of its best quarters in years as highlighted by exceptional execution in bookings, operating expenses, big deal contracts, major PC OEM extensions, new partnerships and outstanding cash flow from operations. I believe the future never looked brighter as we're now set to drive market share growth for years to come. 
And with that opening, I want to further explain the optimism that is pervasive here at McAfee. First, we have to look at our core security market. For many years, McAfee primarily had one product, antivirus, and sold on one major platform, PCs. We experienced a near doubling of our company from just over $1 billion in sales in 2006 to more than $2 billion in 2010 as we expanded our single-product focus to a full suite. Our conversion programs have worked well with more than 50% of our installed base now using multiple stickier McAfee products from Total Protection for consumers, to ToPS and the Enterprise. 
The market for PCs remains very strong as we’ve seen 20%-plus growth in units shipped just in the first half of 2010. This, coupled with the fact that we now have extended our agreements with two of the three largest PC device manufacturers for several more years, secures our opportunity for a long time. McAfee will ship on more than 25% of all PCs shipped worldwide through just these two partnerships, far exceeding that of HP and our primary rival. These expanded relationships do not require the use of upfront cash and are accretive to our results for the terms of the contracts. 
Add in our over 220 partnerships across PC OEMs, ISPs, financial firms, social networks and others, and we have access to more than 50% of the market including more than half of the consumer PC units shipped by the top 10 manufacturers. 
Our ever-broadening suite enabled us to grow our Consumer business in Q2 to $191 million, up 9% on a constant currency basis. As a solid sign of the market’s strength, our top end suites for consumers grew 63%. And now as we watch the explosion of new devices, our opportunity has grown dramatically. In fact, we estimate that our market will expand from approximately 1 billion devices in the PC market to more than 50 billion IP-connected devices worldwide. This is where our strategy is really paying off. 
McAfee has put the pieces in place to capture this market opportunity for devices such as Smart phones, ATM machines, point-of-sale devices, USB-connected devices, cars, TVs and many, many more. Over the past few years, we’ve worked hard to dramatically expand the breadth of our product offerings. We have broadened our security footprint to help customers respond whether on any kind of endpoint, the network or in the cloud and across the whole technology stack. 
As another example of that, today, I'm very pleased to be announcing our next-generation mobility platform that enables us to capture market share from Consumer segments to Enterprises for all Smart phones, tablets and slates with the broadest feature set in the industry. Our acquisition of the WaveSecure mobile security service, coupled with the Trust Digital and our own mobile products, gives us a very unique advantage. 
Worldwide mobile phone sales totaled 315 million units in the first quarter of 2010, a 17% increase from the same period in 2009 according to Gartner. Smart phone sales reached 54 million units, an increase of nearly 50% from the first quarter of 2009. 
In addition to the major PC OEM contract extensions and the acquisition of WaveSecure, we're pleased to announce the signing of an agreement with Verizon Business to market McAfee Verizon cobranded SSL products and solutions utilizing Verizon's SSL technology and certificates to secure online transactions. This strategic relationship provides us with yet another compelling value proposition that we believe will be very disruptive in the marketplace. 
Furthering our strategy, you may have seen earlier this week our announcement with Polycom to secure unified communications, thus extending the types of devices McAfee can secure. And recently, we announced that McAfee now has relationships to provide security on USB drives sold by 2/3 of the world's secure USB drive makers. 
All-in-all, we pioneered an open security risk management platform, leveraging our security management product called ePolicy Orchestrator, to more than 100 partners in our security alliance program. Through strategic alliances and partnerships, McAfee technology today is included in more third-party devices, appliances and in ever more products than before. We've created a bridge from the PC-centric world to a world where everything is digital and everything is connected. More importantly, we're continuing to gain competitive advantage by developing and acquiring the right technologies for where the security market is headed. 
The success of our strategy is really clearly reflected in our deals. We closed a near-record number of million-dollar deals plus in Q2. Over 80% of these transactions included multiple McAfee products and longer contract terms. Customers are securing and managing more connected devices with McAfee, enabling us to fulfill our strategy of silicon and satellite secure device management, all integrated to our cloud and on-premise management platforms. 
Another important sign of the opportunity in the market is the way we turned an adverse event into opportunity. I don't want to over-dramatize this, but few events in life end up providing an opportunity as the event we experienced this past quarter. I'm talking about our false-positive incident. For those who have not followed our company closely, this was a security update that we released in late April that impacted some of our customers, albeit a small percentage of our overall customer base. We had approximately 1,600 Enterprise customers and 11,000 Consumer customers affected. I'm very proud to state now that not only did we respond quickly and very effectively to these customers, we've resiled [ph 26:06] 99% more of the issues related to these incidences. And we did so without losing any Corporate customers and without any legal actions. And more importantly, in a quarter where we had a near record number of $1 million-plus deals, some of our largest deals in the quarter were with affected customers. 
For example, we had a very large educational institution, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies and a major global financial institution, all increased their commitment to McAfee by purchasing more McAfee products in the past quarter than they ever have done before. I believe this reflects the fact that our customers are really engaging in the strategic importance of McAfee, and many have raised the level of importance of our company as a critical partner within their IT infrastructure and made us a trusted security adviser. You will see and hear more about our new Global Trust and Safety Initiative that will set new industry standards in the areas of quality assurance, technical innovations, support and services and community awareness. 
When I net out the total estimated impact of a false-positive incident in Q2, our bookings impact to the extra discounts and offers were about $15 million. The revenue impact due to deferrals was about $6 million of deferred revenue not recognized from the balance sheet, and revenue was also negatively impacted by another approximately $14 million. Cost and expenses were approximately $2 million, and the total cash to customers was just $3 million. And this is all included in the above impact. In summary, the impact of the false-positive to our Q2 revenue results were greater than we anticipated with the biggest difference being against our expectations of lower in-period revenue from sales deals related to the incident. 
As I’ve said many times, but I'd really like to express my heartfelt thanks and gratitude to our employees for their hard work and to our customers and partners for their continued support of McAfee. 
Looking ahead, I'm very pleased that this event’s behind us, and we’re moving forward as a company, stronger than ever before. Our pipeline for Q3 is strong, and we'll talk a little bit more about that later in the call. Now let me turn the call over to Jonathan, and we'll cover our strong Q2 results. Jonathan?"
32053,107914965,72883,"McAfee, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","McAfee LLC","Executives","Thank you, Dave.

Again, I'm very excited to be part of the McAfee family and again, I truly appreciate the warm welcome and look forward to working with you all. I do see a tremendous amount of opportunity in this market and internally within McAfee to drive value to our customers, partners, shareholders and employees. 
Now turning to Q2 results in more detail. I'm pleased to report that McAfee had a very good Q2 on a number of fronts. On a constant currency basis, we achieved strong year-over-year growth in each of our major metrics. Non-GAAP revenue, up 7%; non-GAAP net income, up 9%; non-GAAP earnings per share, up 10%; deferred revenue, up 10%; and cash flow from operations, up 160% year-over-year. 
Now I'd like to go into a little bit more detail on our Q2 revenue results. Our non-GAAP revenue was $495 million, up 6% year-over-year and up 7% on a constant currency basis. We observed a high level of foreign exchange headwind this quarter with $5 million year-over-year and $12 million quarter-over-quarter. We had approximately $14 million of lower in-period revenue as new sales orders came in at lower revenue realization rates. This realization was lower than anticipated with the lowest level for the past four quarters. This means that more revenue than normal was deferred to future periods and therefore not recognized as revenue in Q2. These deferrals were largely caused by extension of contract durations with certain corporate customers as part of their Q2 false-positive resolution. So when you net out the effects of foreign exchange, and the false-positive issue on this quarter's revenue, you see we would have been comfortably within the range of the revenue guidance Dave shared with you back in May. 
Now turning to our Q2 non-GAAP revenue results on a geographic basis. North America revenue in Q2 was $289 million, up 9% from last year and up 9% on a constant currency basis. North America revenue accounted for 58% of consolidated revenue. International revenue was $207 million, up 2% from last year and up 4% on a constant currency basis. International revenue accounted for 42% of consolidated revenue, and we saw mid-double digit growth in Asia-Pacific, single digit growth in Latin America and Japan while EMEA was slightly down year-over-year. 
On a segment basis, in Q2 our Corporate business achieved non-GAAP revenue of $305 million, up 5% year-over-year and up 6% on a constant currency basis. We continued to see strength in large multi-element sales orders. In Q2, we saw a total of 30 sales deals over $1 million in size compared to 19 deals in Q1 2010 and 28 in Q2 of last year. 
In addition, we saw increases in the number of sales orders above $100,000 with a total of 474 deals this quarter compared to 384 deals last quarter and 452 the year before that. The percentage of these corporate transactions with multiple element solutions also continues to grow reinforcing our end-to-end integrated security strategy. 
In SMB, we saw high-single digit growth year-over-year, and we were particularly pleased with the contributions from MX Logic this quarter. The key takeaway here is that the overall growth in the number of large transactions we're seeing and the high percentage of multiple elements within these large deals is a key indicator of the momentum we're seeing in our Corporate business. 
We achieved an all-time record in our Consumer business with Q2 revenue of $191 million, up 8% year-over-year and up 9% on a constant currency basis. Year-over-year, our Q2 online sales were up double digits and our online renewal sales increased 20%. 
Now moving down the income statement. Q2 non-GAAP gross profit margin for the second quarter was 78.2%, up 10 basis points sequentially. Now as a reminder, our strategy encompasses a broad portfolio of offerings including software, hardware, services and cloud-based solutions. Consequently, mix can be challenging to forecast. However, margins across all of our segments in Q2 remained relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter. 
Operating margins in Q2 were $258 million, down 3% sequentially and up 4% over Q2 last year. In Q2, our marketing expenses decreased as we optimized one of our OEM partner agreements. We remain focused on aligning our business operations and cost structure to withstand significant foreign-exchange headwinds we have experienced while also continuing to invest in our business. 
During Q2, we completed a restructuring that effectively streamlines our business under four business units: endpoint, content, risk and compliance, and network security. We also improved efficiencies in our sales operations. These cost reductions were both in real terms and against our original plan for 2010. They have also enabled us to target our investments to areas likely to provide the best return in the next few quarters while continuing to invest in our portfolio of product and solution offerings. In addition, we continue to reshape our go-to-market headcount and resources to focus on those markets and customers which provide us the best growth opportunities. 
For example, we were able to take some non-quota-carrying sales overlays in our Network business and redeploy a number of these resources in direct quota-carrying positions. 
As of June 30, we had 6,088 employees worldwide, which is roughly flat with our headcount in Q1, but headcount with direct quota responsibility increased 3%. 
We do expect to manage expenses tightly going forward given the continued currency headwinds. Q2 non-GAAP operating income was $129 million, up 3% year-over-year. I was pleased to see that our Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 26.1% compared to 25.2%, sequentially, slightly ahead of our anticipated margin range reflecting good cost control and the OEM extension I've mentioned earlier. The effects of foreign exchange on revenue expenses had a total negative impact to operating income of approximately $7 million quarter-over-quarter. Overall, we were pleased with operating margin and performance this quarter despite many of the challenges we were facing. 
In Q2, our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $98 million, up 4% over Q2 last year, and non-GAAP net income as a percentage of revenue was 20%, slightly improved from last quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.63, up 5% both sequentially and year-over-year. And within this, foreign exchange headwinds had a negative impact of $0.04. 
Now turning to some balance sheet highlights. Net accounts receivable balance at the end of Q2 2010 was $244 million compared with $231 million for the first quarter of 2010. DSO, or days sales outstanding, were 45 days for the second quarter 2010 compared to 41 days in Q1 and 51 days in the prior year. Both of these metrics reflect continued solid working capital management. 
Deferred revenue at the end of Q2 was $1.4 billion, up 5% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, deferred revenue was up 10% year-over-year. The composition of our deferred revenue balance at the end of Q2 was 65% in relation to our Corporate business and 35% in relation to our Consumer business. Approximately 80% of our Q2 2010 revenue was from the balance sheet, and approximately 91% was recurring in nature from services, support and subscriptions. 
During the quarter, we generated $134 million of operating cash flow, up 152% from Q2 '09 and down $23 million, sequentially. Another reminder, Q1 is typically a seasonally stronger cash collections period following our seasonally larger Q4 sales period. 
And just a comment on Q2 cash usage. We completed the acquisition of Trust Digital this quarter, and we're excited about this development in our mobile strategy. We look forward to integrating Trust Digital's Mobile Management Platform into our offerings and expanding the endpoint reach of our business. And I’d personally like to welcome Trust Digital's employees to the company. 
During Q2, we repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares for $150 million at an average price of $32.30 per share. Year-to-date, we’ve deployed $300 million towards repurchasing 8.3 million shares at an average price of $35.97 per share. We have $200 million remaining in our current authorization. 
Cash and marketable securities at quarter end were $804 million compared to $902 million in Q1 2010. The change in our cash position was mostly due to stock repurchase, acquisitions and seasonally normal changes in our operating cash flow. 
I’d just like to finish my formal financial overview remarks with a comment on McAfee's long-term performance. Over the last few years, McAfee's been on a consistent and strong growth journey and delivered solid performance. Over this time, we've expanded our addressable markets, deepened the breadth of security solutions we offer and successfully integrated acquisitions, which position us well for the future. Our leadership position in digital security’s paying off, and we are focused on continuing our trajectory of growth profitability for our shareholders. 
So in summary, McAfee demonstrated good operational execution in Q2 across many aspects of our business, and I'm particularly pleased with the operating margin performance and cash flow generation. Despite foreign currency headwinds, the health of the business remains strong, and we are optimistic about the company's near-term and longer-term prospects. And I'd like to thank our employees for their particularly hard work this quarter, and now I'll turn the call back to Dave for his comments."

I made the point that McAfee's market is growing, our strategy is working, and our financial performance continues to be strong. Q2 was a good quarter for McAfee, and I believe our sales booking and operating cash flow are the most important metrics we can really see the health of the business. 
I gave you a detailed overview of the financial impact of the false-positive resolution in the quarter, and that's now behind us. 
Looking ahead, I truly believe the future is bright for McAfee, and we're headed into the back half of the year well positioned to achieve many of our 2010 strategic goals. Unlike any other security provider, McAfee offers a full complement of consumer and corporate security products, services and solutions covering all the bases, endpoint, network and the cloud. We've shifted this company's effective opportunity from a very good foundation of Antivirus business to a business that continues to lead the market while entering a greenfield of new market opportunities such as our stronger push into mobile with our Trust Digital and WaveSecure acquisitions. We have a world-class PC OEM partnership model, and we've really diversified our Consumer business to other channels that are really starting to produce: ISPs, financial service companies like Bank of America, Facebook Adobe among many others. And I hope you've seen the huge product cycle we're in. We essentially have new products or refresh cycles going on in all of our business units, and in particular, our Consumer business coming soon. 
To summarize and move into our outlook, we remain very excited about the opportunities we see in 2010. And as we start off the year, there were a number of factors driving my confidence and optimism that remains true now. I believe we have the right ingredients to continue to be the leader in the digital security market. We have a very strong product cycle and product portfolio to help customers from consumers to enterprises, from network to endpoint, from individual PCs to the cloud. We’ve got an incredible network of partners and alliances covering many key areas of government, telecommunications, technology and more. To provide specific color on our current bookings forecast, our estimates show accelerated growth quarter-over-quarter of about $30 million, just in Q3. This represents a forecasted growth of over 10% year-over-year after adjusting for foreign exchange impact. 
And one more data point that I'll share is over the last six quarters, we've achieved an average 99% of our forecasted sales order bookings. This is just one reason for my confidence and optimism in McAfee's business prospects for Q3, and our goal of another triple-double year on a constant currency basis. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Jonathan for our Q3 outlook. Jonathan?"

Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and that actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. The guidance we're providing is on a non-GAAP basis with reconciliation to GAAP. As Dave discussed, we are optimistic about McAfee's prospects and our ability to achieve strong performance this year. I do want to remind you, first, that we are facing some unprecedented foreign exchange headwinds. We are expecting that these will especially affect our revenue over the foreseeable future. Based on currency movements, since we last spoke with you at our Analyst Day, we are expecting approximately $8 million of negative revenue impact sequentially going into Q3. 
On a year-over-year basis, this translates to as much as $18 million and $25 million in Q3 and Q4, respectively. We highly encourage you to take this into account as you construct your own analysis for the second half. Our outlook for your information, assumes a $1.27 U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate for Q3, and we're anticipating a strengthening of the dollar in Q4. 
Apart from these comments, we’ll be providing guidance for the third quarter only. The third quarter of 2010, we expect to achieve revenue in the range of $505 million to $520 million, up 4% to 7% year-over-year. From a sequential perspective, we expect to see approximately 2% to 5% growth. 
As I stated earlier, forecasting gross margin is challenging due to the mix of our digital security product and services portfolio that may be sold in any period. We expect to manage gross margins and operating expenses together to achieve a target operating income range. 
We expect to achieve non-GAAP operating income margin in the range of 24% to 26% in the third quarter and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.62 per share to $0.66 per share on a fully diluted basis. We expect to continue to generate between $100 million to $150 million in operating cash flow per quarter or approximately $550 million in cash flow for 2010. For Q3, we expect to be at the lower end of this range. 
Our outlook for Q3 is based on a fully diluted share count in the range of 154 million to 156 million shares compared to a fully diluted share count of 160 million shares in Q3, 2009. And we're assuming an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 24%. 
Within our Q3 non-GAAP guidance assumptions, we estimate the following rule of thumb: For every $0.01 movement in the euro, revenue is impacted by approximately $1.3 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share is impacted by approximately half a penny.

Before we take some questions in closing, I hope you had a good understanding of the opportunity McAfee has this year: a stabilizing global economy, the security market poised to grow faster than the overall IT and its exponential growth in threats, regulations and devices. Simply put, the opportunity in security is one that I still have a lot of greenfield and is a great business. I firmly believe McAfee is very competitively positioned in this business with a good diversified model, strong product portfolios, top-notch partners and strategic alliances and a very strong management team. In fact, in the time I've been at McAfee, I've never been more encouraged by the opportunities I see now. 
Today, I’ve really tried to give you a straightforward overview of what's happening at McAfee, our opportunity, our strategy and our success and as a result, and what’s probably most important is how bright the future is for the company, both in Q3 and long beyond. On behalf of the executive management team, I want to thank all the employees of McAfee worldwide for their hard work and continued performance. And with that, Jonathan and I would like to open up the call for questions. Operator?"

We were very, very solid and this despite some of the adversity I mentioned as well that we felt like – we didn’t see really any price issues. We had to do a little more discounting, we showed that, the normal on some of the resolutions we had. But generally, we got longer contract lengths, we've got longer commitments from our customers, the number of verticals and industries that we were able to close large deals was excellent, not just governments and banks and telcos, but I mentioned education and pharmaceutical and probably the best element that I saw was 80-plus percent of those big deals had multi-elements to it meaning network, endpoint, cloud combinations and it really played to our strategy, particularly in the high-end Corporate.

Our SMB business, as Jonathan alluded to, was solid. MX Logic was really a standout this past quarter, a cloud kind of delivery of security. The over $1 million, and over $500k, over $100k transaction types were pretty strong. Really the challenges really are in the, I would say, some of the mid-segments, probably outside the U.S. a little bit, mostly in Europe. If you kind of looked at a balance there. But how we’re handling the DAT files and things, that's behind us. We largely had that completed. I thought it was an extraordinary effort what we went through just in terms of resolving customers, the commitment we weighed, really going out of our way to show our customers that we were going to stand behind them and they showed it back by really purchasing from us, extending their contracts with us. The only real challenge we ended up having was despite a strong bookings quarter was the yield of revenue from those bookings. And Jonathan talked a little bit about some of the numbers there that despite the strong bookings numbers, we didn't quite get the revenue yield, mostly related to that DAT and because of concessions and the way we have to take revenue and tally on that, but again, look at bookings, look at cash flow, look at contracts, number of deals, we saw a lot of price solid data points in the business particularly Corporate and I think we're on the right track there."

I think the sort of key takeaway on that when you do look at that $6 million to $20 million total revenue impact this quarter for items related to the false-positive, it’s substantially all of that that’s sitting now in deferred revenue. And you saw that with deferred revenue up 10% on a constant currency basis. So again, future benefit for us. We’ll manage that appropriately as we go forward."

First is corporate. We've seen a mass influx of corporate Smart phones, kind of consumerization in the corporate model is heavily upon us right now. There’s hardly a day goes by where we don't get requests for some new device type to be connected to the network. And of course, how do you manage that securely? So Corporate is really seeing some trends right now where Apple, iPhone, iPads, Droid phones, name your favorite Smart phone, you have to manage it securely. So the Trust Digital deal that we did I thought was ideal in combining with our ePO platform. Now we can manage not only PC Windows-types devices, but Smart phones through the same console, single-agent, single console and really manage kind of all devices there. And of course, we're seeing deals with ATMs and point-of-sale registers and all kinds of endpoints there. But Smart phones, I'm really seeing an inflection point now, and I'm starting to see a lot of phone access. It's just adding more nodes to what we can manage. And it’s really creating an elasticity to our endpoint model just like we did ToPS on Windows, we’re doing ToPS on mobile. On the consumer space, where earlier on, I would say in security, but we're excited about the prospects there. We clearly see not just the device manufacturers beginning to push for things like secure commerce, secure web browsing and safe searching and shopping from your device. But also the telecommunications companies are really beginning to look at opportunities there, because they also see the ability to go to a store, activate a security feature, kind of an insurance card. If you lose your phone, you can wipe it, lock it, kill it, encrypt it, locate it. And there's a suite of features here that we think the consumers will purchase at time of activation or later on this via the cloud. So we’re in early days Consumer, but I think this is exciting. I think the holiday period, you’ll see a lot more of this and especially going in 2011 and we’re there. We’ve really now got the pieces, a very strong company, it was called tenCube, but the product line’s called WaveSecure based out of Singapore, very internationalized, Chinese support, other language support, we can go global with our telecommunications partnerships, they've already done SingTel, which is one of them in Singapore and we feel like we could replicate that model, the Telcos, with Smart phone management from McAfee. So again, excited about the space. I see a lot of good points now after a few years finally it’s kind of here, both Corporate and Consumer."

We spent a lot of time, I spent a lot of time with the team and with Dave going through the forecast, both in terms of the bookings forecast, but also then the realization rates going into Q3. So I think at this point, we do strongly believe that the DAT is behind us based on all the really proactive reach-out we did, and that was the major driver of everything that occurred to our numbers in Q2. So I gave you the numbers, and that's the guidance we’re giving at this point and I think we're very, very confident in them."

I would tell you that I think there's a lot of opportunity there. One of the areas we continue to look to do is to leverage our cloud services to that market. Jonathan mentioned the MX Logic's success that we had, and that product is centered towards the mid and small space. Some of the things we've done with our McAfee SECURE is centered towards that as well, which is our vulnerability scanning products for retailers. And that’ll also we haven't talked a whole lot about the Verizon partnership as well.

It's my pleasure to be with you today and report outstanding quarterly results for McAfee.

It's my pleasure to be with you today and report outstanding quarterly results for McAfee. Against the backdrop of a historic translation for McAfee that could have cost significant disruption, our third quarter results beat records on several metrics. These excellent results are a testament to our strategy and the confidence of our customers, partners and employees in the proposed combination of McAfee and Intel. I'd like to thank all of the McAfee employees and our customers and partners for demonstrating strong support in the acquisition. The support is evidenced by lower discounts, longer contracts and a higher percentage of new customer business, as well as lower attrition among our employees. All of this shows that the future is clearly very bright for McAfee. Our outstanding third quarter results are a clear sign of a team that's executing very well. I'm very proud to be a part of this team and I believe McAfee is stronger than ever before. 
I'd like to start out today's call with some financial highlights from the quarter, followed by some industry insights and then some exciting new product announcements.
In Q3, we achieved record third quarter revenue of $523 million, up 8% year-over-year. We also achieved record deferred revenue of $1.4 billion, also up 8% year-over-year; record year-to-date operating cash flow of $431 million, up 23% year-over-year; And record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.67, up 9% year-over-year. Our Q3 performance is clear evidence that our customers and partners understand and support our strategy of delivering innovative, holistic security risk management solutions in the future potential of the combination of Intel and McAfee. During the quarter, we closed a record number of sales orders above $100,000, with a total of 525 deals this quarter, up 11% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. 
Within this, we had 33 transactions over $1 million, up 10% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Discounting was at the lowest point this year and our renewal rates are looking very strong. A particular note, some of our largest transactions in the past quarter involve customers spending more with McAfee on security beyond the PC that the sizable amounts that they already spent on traditional Windows PC security. This is additional evidence that our strategy of offering a broad security portfolio across expanding end points, the network and the cloud, is right on point. 
Our Network Security business in particular is growing rapidly and reported strong double-digit year-over-year sales growth, the best performance since we acquired Secure Computing in 2008. As a result of changing network perimeters in our customer's organizations, we're especially seeing great demand for a firewall, intrusion prevention and network access control products. 
I'm also very pleased to report that our Consumer business continues to thrive. We achieved record revenue of $199 million, up 13% year-over-year. Our PC OEM relationships and our broad portfolio of ISPs, telcos, financials and portal partners continues to deliver continued profitability for us and also gaining traction in the marketplace with our web and mobility offerings.
McAfee's strong performance in Q3 was in conjunction with I believe is one of the most exciting developments in the company's history. As you know, in August 19, we announced that McAfee has agreed to be acquired by Intel. I'm very excited about the expanded opportunities McAfee will have as part of the Intel family. This transaction fits perfectly with our vision of ubiquitous security and is expected to accelerate innovation at McAfee and ultimately make the digital world a safer place. 
During the quarter, we received strong endorsements from our customers and do not see any with disruption to our business. In fact, I'm happy to report that our Q3 results beat our own early forecast, particularly given that this transaction was announced with just five weeks left in the quarter. The acquisition is on track, and we're working through regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Our special shareholder meeting is scheduled for November 2, and we look forward to closing by the middle of 2011, after which McAfee will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intel. 
Intel's agreement to acquire McAfee underscores that security is a fundamental component of modern computing and is increasingly relevant in a completely connected world, providing protection to a rapidly expanding heterogenous world of connected devices requires a fundamentally new approach to security. The proposed combination of Intel and McAfee will be about helping provide greater protection efficiency to end points of mobility and embedded devices by bringing software and silicon together to do the heavy lifting. We are not moving away from our core security business of software-based end point protection and network security technologies but instead, intend to improve security for all of our customers by providing integrated hardware and software solutions. 
There are three critical areas of focus for this. First of all, mobile and embedded device security. Connected devices, such as copiers, smart meters medical devices and others require optimized protection with a lower memory footprint and low CPU utilization such as waitlisting. Secondly, securities moving down the stack. We expect the combination of software silicone tip security technologies following a path similar to the one virtualization technology has taken over the past decade. We'll able to utilize the silicon to enable the security software and provide better performance and higher efficacy. And third, managing security. With McAfee, Intel's acquiring ePolicy Orchestrator, the industry's leading security management platform, which gives enterprises the capability to centrally manage security across the myriad of devices using a single console. In addition, it's important to understand that McAfee will be a stand-alone independent subsidiary of Intel and continue to operate without interruption and with autonomy. This means a continued focus on multi-platform and multi-device support. McAfee and Intel have been working together for some time already, and we look forward to introducing the first products from our strategic partnership next year.
To comment further on McAfee's customer and partner support, we recently held our annual FOCUS security conference for a record number of customers and partners in Las Vegas. In its third year, this event attracted thousands of attendees and more than triple the number of attending partners to be updated on our strategy and vision. Customers are increasingly recognizing McAfee's strategic role and have raised the level of importance's as a critical partner within their IT infrastructure. This was abundantly obvious at FOCUS, where I personally met with customers who told me that McAfee has evolved in a true and trusted security adviser for the critical technology infrastructures. 
Here's what some of the customers told me. First, more than ever, customers are looking for a focused security company. With the increasing complex threat landscape, a clearly focused and trusted security adviser is a necessity, especially for more large organizations. This is evidenced by McAfee now having more than 94% of the Fortune 500 as customers. Second, customers want more integration, not less. The more integrated, the better. And third, tightening the seams between products and the partner ecosystem is what will better help customers manage security, risk and compliance. And fourth, our customers' top concerns around consumerization of IT, cloud security and protecting their intellectual property. It's highly encouraging that all of these focus areas are for McAfee. Given these customers comments and taking into account the improved macroeconomic environment, we're confident McAfee is aligned with the most critical trends security and will benefit from being a trusted adviser for integrated solutions.
As a part of FOCUS, we made five major announcements. First, we shared our vision for the future with McAfee 3.0 security connect. We expect this strategy to lead McAfee into our next few years with ubiquitous security that's connected to the end point network and the cloud and fed by global threat intelligence. 
Second, we reinforced our end-point leadership with our Endpoint Security platform 9 product announcement. This release sets new performance standards for any malware and data security across an expansive array of devices. 
Third, we unveiled the next-generation ePolicy Orchestrator as part of the McAfee Security and Management Platform 5, providing unified monitoring, management and reporting system that scales to any sized organization and ensures all employees' private networks and content are secure. ePO continues to be very important differentiator in the marketplace for McAfee. 
And fourth, we expanded our mobility leadership. We completed the acquisition of 10Cube [ph] (29:30) and began integration of their market-leading mobility solutions in the McAfee's product offerings. Also, based on our Trust Digital acquisition, we announced McAfee Enterprise Mobility Management Platform 9, enabling highly scalable secure enterprise mobility management. This was our first quarter of owning Trust Digital and while it's early, we're very excited about the expansion of our leadership in this area of the marketplace. This quarter, we had several dozen new Trust Digital engagements, with key enterprise customers but also had several new partnership opportunities that we're excited about. 
And fifth, we discussed security for virtualizing environments at FOCUS. With Citrix and several other partners we unveiled McAfee management of optimized virtual environments, or MOVE. MOVE needs the market in making virtual desktop security simpler and more scalable. We're also partnering with the VMware, part of their vShield product family for virtualized and cloud environments. These announcements reflect the direction of our strategy of silicon satellite, secure device management, all integrated to our cloud and our on-premise management platforms. This allows our customers to secure and manage more connected devices as we expect the number of connected endpoints to expand to from about a billion to more than 50 billion.
Over the past few years, we have worked hard to dramatically expand the breadth of our product offerings. We have broadened our security footprint to help customers respond. We'll go on any kind of endpoint to network or any cloud across the technologies back. We have a solid cycle of new products and technologies, and our vision and strategy is working when expanded market opportunities and a number of connected devices explodes. Couple that with integrating the components of our strategy, all connect and all leveraging the power unrivaled McAfee global threat intelligence, we have an offering nobody else can match. We've created a bridge from PC-centric worlds to a world where everything is digital and everything is connected. And more importantly, we are continuing to gain mind share in the marketplace by developing and acquiring the right technologies to where the security market is headed.
So what all that, let me hand it over to Jonathan for a more in-depth review of our financials. Jonathan?"

And in both gratifying to see such great performance across the board. We achieved, and in many cases exceeded, the goals we set this quarter, including record third quarter revenue, record deferred revenue, record non-GAAP earnings per share and record year-to-date operating cash flow. Our solid financial results reflect continued global demand for our end-to-end security portfolio, strong operational performance and focused execution. And as Dave mentioned, we had a record number of corporate deals while contract durations increased, discounting declined to the lowest point this year and our revenue utilization rate improve, all reflecting the real momentum of our corporate segment.
Now turning to the Q3 results in more detail. On a constant currency basis, we achieved strong year-over-year growth each of our major metrics. Again on constant-currency basis, revenue was up 11% non-GAAP net income was up 15%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were up 19% as a note. GAAP earnings per share was up 55%. Deferred revenue was up 10%. 
I'd like to note also our reported cash flow from operations was $139 million. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow is up 23% year-over-year. Now I'd like to go into a little bit more detail on our Q3 revenue and sales results. Q3 reported revenue was a third quarter record of $523 million, up 8% year-over-year and up 11% on a constant-currency basis. And as predicted, we did observe continued level of foreign exchange headwinds this quarter. [indiscernible] (33:25) Total Q3 negative revenue impact from foreign exchange was $17 million year-over-year and $3 million quarter-over-quarter. And as a note, revenue in Q3 included less than a $250,000 benefit related to previously deferred revenue associated with our Q2 signature release. 
Turning to our Q3 revenue results on a geographic basis. North America revenue was $312 million, up 14% year-over-year and up 15% on a constant-currency basis. Growth in this region was driven primarily by strong results in our Public Sector and Network Security businesses. And in Q3, North America revenue represented 60% of consolidated revenue.
Q3 international revenue was $211 million flat with last year, were up 7% on a constant-currency basis. Consistent strength in our International Consumer business and strong corporate performance in Japan-Asia Pacific was partially offset by softness in our EMEA Corporate business. In Q3, international revenue represented 40% of our consolidated revenues.
On a segment basis, our Corporate business is showing strong momentum and in Q3 achieved revenue $324 million, up 5% year-over-year and up 9% on a constant-currency basis. We are seeing Significant strength in our $1 million-plus sales orders with average deal size of 25% year-over-year. 85% of these orders had possible product elements from more than one of our business units and a significant percentage of each deal from our portfolio security products beyond our PC offerings.
Virtual SMB sales orders were up mid-teens year-over-year. This segment of the business continues to be an important area of focus for our Corporate business. Our recent Security Paradox market research report shows that over 50% of midsized organizations have seen an increase in IT security risks facing the company, 40% of these companies had a data breach in the last year Clearly, there's ongoing demand for effective and a cost-efficient security solutions in this segment of the market.
Passing to a little bit of additional color from our Corporate business units. Q3 Network Security revenue and sales orders were both up double digits year-over-year. This growth was driven primarily by our very strong Public Sector business, particularly in North America. Year-to-date, our IPS and final product revenues are up over 30%, reflecting strong demand for our intrusion prevention and next-generation cloud.
We had a solid end-point [indiscernible] (35:56) that our ToPS conversions brought. And as Dave mentioned earlier, we saw a nice lift of sales beyond traditional PCs, as well as a good number of new customers. Our Clients' Risk and Compliance business had double-digit, year-over-year revenue and sales order growth in Q3. We saw strong demand for our risk vulnerability of PCI solution for this quarter.
Now turning to our Consumer business. In Q3, we achieved an all-time revenue record of $199 million, up 13% year-over-year and up 16% on a constant-currency basis. And this really strong performance reflects our OEM partnerships continuing to pay off and we continue to see solid PC unit growth. In addition, our top ISP, telco, financials and portal partner business grew at 11% year-over-year, and our direct online business at its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. We also saw another quarter of strong double-digit growth in our premium Total Protection Suite offering. And overall our consumer margin in the Consumer business continues to be very strong.
During the quarter, we cited or reviewed our extended partnership agreement and released a new identity protection service, a new family protection product for iPhone and iPad, and refresh [indiscernible] (37:17). I'm also pleased to report we received very positive [indiscernible] (37:22)  McAfee-Intel combination from our partners around the world. 
So in summary, our Corporate business continued capitalizing the momentum we felt last year. We have a very strong [indiscernible] (37:33). And our Consumer business remains very strong with our diversified distribution model, including PC OEMs, telcos, mobile and web security. Looking ahead, we believe we are well-positioned to further expand our addressable markets, capitalizing key trends, which is mobile security, virtualization of our customers at McAfee, trusted security solutions are important areas.
Now moving down the rest of the income statement. Q3 and non-GAAP gross profit margin for the third quarter was 77.1%, down approximately 100 basis points sequentially. And as a reminder, our strategy encompasses a broad portfolio of offerings including software, hardware, services in collaboration, cloud-based solutions. Q3 had a higher mix [indiscernible] (38:20). 
Non-GAPP operating expenses in Q3 $65 million, up $7 million sequentially, about up 5%. We remain focused on aligning our business operations and cost structure [indiscernible] (38:35) while continuing to invest it. As of September 30, we had 6,121 employees worldwide, up slightly sequentially. Q3 non-GAAP operating income was $138 million, up 7% year-over-year. And I'm pleased to report that our Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 26.4%, slightly above our own expectation to reflecting a good cost control. Including the effects of foreign exchange is revenue expenses, we saw total negative impact to non-GAAP operating income of approximately $12 million year-over-year.
Q3, our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%, and our Q3 non-GAAP net income was $104 million, up 6% over Q3 last year and non-GAAP net income as a percentage of revenue was 20%, slightly improved from last quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share were a record $0.57, up 9% year-over-year [indiscernible] (39:31) We strongly expected results for such a solid Q3 financial performance despite foreign exchange headwinds. And on constant-currency basis, non-GAAP earnings per share were up 19% year-over-year and GAAP earnings per share were up 55%.  
Now turning to some cash flow and balance sheet highlights. During the quarter, we generated $139 million of operating cash flow, which was ahead of our expectations. Strong collections in the geographic mix of our business in this quarter drove this upside to our own forecast. I am very pleased that year-to-date, our operating cash flow was up 23%. 
Cash and marketable securities at the end of the third quarter [indiscernible] (40:12) this reflects our strong operating cash flow performance in Q3 and the absence of a stock repurchase in the quarter. Please note that we have suspended our repurchase program due to our pending acquisition by Intel. And quarter, we closed our acquisition of 10Cube [ph] (40:28). And looking ahead, we plan to continue with our strategy of acquiring small and medium-sized companies.
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $280 million ahead of $244 million sequentially. DSO was 48 days for Q3 compared to 45 days sequentially and 43 days in Q3 of last year. We continue to be very pleased with the overall health of our receivables portfolio.
Deferred revenue at the end of the Q3 was a record $1.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year and up 10% on a constant-currency basis. The composition of our deferred revenue at the end of Q3 was 66% related to our Corporate business and 34% related to our Consumer business. Approximately 77% of our Q3 revenue was from the balance sheet. Approximately 88% was recurring in nature for services, support and subscription. 
Now before I move to our guidance for Q4, I'd like to make comment about our Q3 results within the context of the last several quarters of McAfee's performance. Over the last few years, McAfee has been the most consistent and strong growth journey, and we worked hard to successfully strengthen our Security Solutions portfolio, expand our addressable market and integrate acquisitions. We remain on course of being financial at present and beyond. With a strong business pipeline, larger place marketplace leadership in key emerging markets, which is mobility and virtualization.
In summary, McAfee demonstrated a strong operational execution in Q3 across many aspects of our business. We overachieved on most of our key financial metrics which reflects the health, robustness and the fact that our strategies are really paying off. We are very optimistic about McAfee's edge one the long prospects. That do have of the overall business and the effect of our strategies are really paying off. We are very optimistic about McAfee's edge on the long prospects.
Now moving to our outlook and guidance. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors, and that actual results could differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. The guidance we're providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP. 
For the fourth quarter of 2010, expect achieve revenue in the range of $530 million to $550 million. 
As I've stated previously gross margins can vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the mix of our security product and services portfolio. We expect to manage gross margins and operating expenses together to achieve a targeted operating income range. We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating income margin to be in range of 25% to 26%. And non-GAAP earnings per share $0.67 to $0.71. In Q4 we expect to expand our employee base with targeted hiring in sales, engineering and business operations. We expect to continue to generate between $100 million to $150 million in operating cash flow for the quarter. And in Q4, we do expect to be at the higher end of it. Our outlook for Q4 is based on a total share count of about 159 million shares and we are assuming an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 24%.
And within our Q4 non-GAAP guidance assumptions, we estimate the following currency rule of thumb. We're assuming $1.36 U.S. dollar-to-euro exchange rate for Q4. And for every $0.01 in the euro, revenue is impacted by $1.3 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share is impacted by approximately $0.005. For Q4 we're anticipating a negative impact of $16 million dollars year-over-year. We highly encourage you to take this into account as you construct your answers.
In closing, I'd like to take a moment to thank our employees for their particularly hard work and many, many contributions this quarter. And now I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing comments."

Our strategy is working and our financial performance continues to be strong. I believe the future has never looked brighter especially with the strong support we're seeing for scene for our Intel acquisition. McAfee offers a full complement of consumer and corporate security products, services and solutions, covering all the bases, end point, network and the cloud. We've shifted this company's effective opportunity from a very good foundational antivirus business to a business that continues to lead the market with best-of-breed comprehensive solutions while entering a greenfield of new market opportunities that is a stronger push into mobile and virtualization. We have a world-class PC OEM partners model, and we have diversified our Consumer business in many other channels that are performing well and contributing to our results. Now I hope you seeing the huge product cycle we're in. We have new products and refresh cycles going in all business units. 
So to summarize, we remain very excited about the security opportunity. We have the right ingredients and continue to be the leader in digital security world. We have a very strong product cycle and product portfolio to protect customers from consumers to enterprises, from network to end point, from under digital PCs to the cloud. We've got an incredible network of partners and alliances across our business, covering many key growth verticals, including government public communications and technology. So in closing, I hope you have a good understanding of the opportunity McAfee has. It shall only be accelerated by us joining the Intel family.
So on behalf of the executive management team, I again we want to thank our employees worldwide for their hard work and continued performance. So with that, Jonathan and I will open the call for some questions. Operator?"

We've been getting in the new markets and new opportunity. So just for us, the amount of capacity we have just in the PC world has grown. And that has helped the business overall and will continue to help the business overall. I would also tell you we've done a really nice job extending our portfolio of products. I think it has been an area that we've been very successful in. We added many new products this past quarter alone: identity protection, our family protection products. We now have offerings completely for the Apple family, from iPhones to the iPads, to that Mac products. So we start to look at our diversification of not just PC OEMs but telcos and ISPs and way you could get to the PC market. We also have a pretty good foundation of getting from the PC market to beyond the PC market with mobility and other types of new tablet-like products that are in some cases really extraordinarily exciting for a vendor like us. So I think we're seeing the teams and the opportunity and financially, we have a very good engine to go after these markets with and hopefully that will continue for years to come."

As most of you know, Q3 is an interesting quarter around the world sometimes just in terms of the opportunity to close business. In the Corporate segment, we had really our strongest quarter to the year in the corporate model built in large deals, 33 deals over $1 million, as well as deals really over $100,000 in value. But we also saw good strength under $100,000, as Jonathan pointed out, with our SMB business. So we're executing a lot better ourselves. And then on top of that, I think we've got ourselves in position of selling the value of network, cloud and end point together, or a better model. That's giving us the ability to discount less, get longer contract durations and really drive the business. Our end point note count was up, the amount of new business that we sold to brand new customers was up. And quite honestly, for me, it was in a quarter of potentially a lot of disruption with the Intel announcement, where people were asking questions, how does this work? So combination of validation of customers with the Intel-proposed merger is a good one, along with good execution by our corporate teams and it shows I think we're on the right track here. And I think as the economy continues to improve, we'll keep doing that. Jonathan, you want to add anything?"

I think this is really the large question out there for all the security industry. As I have gone through the last two quarters, I'm really surprised at how big the opportunity is becoming and delighted to see it. When you look at really the introduction of the Apple iPad just not that long ago, you really seeing a huge expansion opportunity for us all. The amount of commerce being driven off these devices, which is really, in my opinion, the tipping point here is usually do you start to use of that device for more than sort of entertainment? Is it more of a commerce device? Will you put your credit card, your debit card? Will you conduct business on that device? An more and more, you'll start to see the need for security be involved with the decision-making when they buy a device. So we're watching that happen at a rapid pace. And as I talked on the Q2 call, we really watch the Enterprise segment taking off fast. The number one, literally at our events in Vegas just a few weeks ago with our users with IT consumerization, there wasn't a CIO or a CSO who didn't say the number one challenge and opportunity they had was how to secure the plethora of new devices that they're being asked to connect to their networks. And as you know, there's a lot of them being sold in the market today. So it's giving CIOs an opportunity to lower their CapEx, let employees buy their own device, bring it in, but didn't have to connect it. So we're actually seeing an expansion of devices beyond the PC. And I actually called out, this was the first quarter I really solid deals over $1 million where the new deal that were non PC-based was bigger than the original deal that was PC-based. That is a significant point for me on the Enterprise segment and we see more and more of that activity now. And has a little bit of Trust Digital acquisition as well as ePO being integrated there. And now we're seeing very quickly the consumer market growing. Obviously the communications companies, telecommunications companies are rapidly driving at this area.  I really think as we sit here another quarter, we'll see another acceleration window there. It's anybody's guess how big this could be but I'm seeing the margins and the price points to be very elastic in a positive way. I'm seeing the opportunity for turnovers and refreshes in this space to be much more rapid than the PC market. That's a key, too. Consumers are going out and buying products every six, nine months, year as opposed to two, three years in the PC market. So there's a lot of good indicators here that we'll be sitting a year from now, we have a very robust market opportunity in mobile. I think it's much sooner than we had thought even a quarter or two ago."

And I think you probably just mean smart devices in general, smartphones, tablets in a class together. But it isn't traditional antivirus that is the number one feature request there. The number one feature request is typically management, allow a policy to authenticate a device to the network securely, particularly within the Enterprise segment. So we're finding a lot of demand right now to enable devices to securely connect to the network. That doesn't mean they have to be scanned for storage on that device, but just the simple authentication of the device on to the network. And then if the device is lost, with sensitive information on it and wipe it, lock it, kill it, encrypt it, basic PCI compliance features for data management. We believe we have that full suite right now. And as I said, we're starting to see deals that are getting very large for us in these enterprises and interesting opportunity there to just safely and securely connect them. Once those devices, in my opinion, get much more robust storage on them and they probably will, then the antivirus market may come into play here in a bigger way because then the storage of content needs to be scanned and managed in a way we manage typical PC Windows devices today. But I think AV would be a lagger clearly so far, but there's a bunch of leading-edge products and features that, in my opinion, are very much ready for the market and are available and they're being rolled out pretty extensively today."

It's my pleasure to be with you today and report outstanding quarterly results for McAfee. Against the backdrop of a historic transition for McAfee that could have cost significant disruption, our third quarter results beat records on several metrics. These excellent results are a testament to our strategy and the confidence of our customers, partners and employees in the proposed combination of McAfee and Intel. I'd like to thank all of the McAfee employees and our customers and partners for demonstrating strong support in the acquisition. The support is evidenced by lower discounts, longer contracts and a higher percentage of new customer business, as well as lower attrition among our employees. All of this shows that the future is clearly very bright for McAfee. Our outstanding third quarter results are a clear sign of a team that's executing very well. I'm very proud to be a part of this team and I believe McAfee is stronger than ever before. 
I'd like to start out today's call with some financial highlights from the quarter, followed by some industry insights and then some exciting new product announcements. 
In Q3, we achieved record third quarter revenue of $523 million, up 8% year-over-year. We also achieved record deferred revenue of $1.4 billion, also up 8% year-over-year; record year-to-date operating cash flow of $431 million, up 23% year-over-year; and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.67, up 9% year-over-year. Our Q3 performance is clear evidence that our customers and partners understand and support our strategy of delivering innovative, holistic security risk management solutions and the future potential of the combination of Intel and McAfee. During the quarter, we closed a record number of sales orders above $100,000, with a total of 525 deals this quarter, up 11% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. 
Within this, we had 33 transactions over $1 million, up 10% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Discounting was at the lowest point this year and our renewal rates are looking very strong. A particular note, some of our largest transactions in the past quarter involve customers spending more with McAfee on security beyond the PC than the sizable amounts that they already spent on traditional Windows PC security. This is additional evidence that our strategy of offering a broad security portfolio across expanding end points, the network and the cloud, is right on point. 
Our Network Security business in particular is growing rapidly and reported strong double-digit year-over-year sales growth, the best performance since we acquired Secure Computing in 2008. As a result of changing network perimeters in our customer's organizations, we're especially seeing great demand for a firewall, intrusion prevention and network access control products. 
I'm also very pleased to report that our Consumer business continues to thrive. We achieved record revenue of $199 million, up 13% year-over-year. Our PC OEM relationships and our broad portfolio of ISPs, telcos, financials and portal partners continues to deliver continued profitability for us and also gaining traction in the marketplace with our web and mobility offerings.
McAfee's strong performance in Q3 was in conjunction with I believe is one of the most exciting developments in the company's history. As you know, on August 19, we announced that McAfee has agreed to be acquired by Intel. I'm very excited about the expanded opportunities McAfee will have as part of the Intel family. This transaction fits perfectly with our vision of ubiquitous security and is expected to accelerate innovation at McAfee and ultimately make the digital world a safer place. 
During the quarter, we received strong endorsements from our customers and do not see any disruption to our business. In fact, I'm happy to report that our Q3 results beat even our own early forecast, particularly given that this transaction was announced with just five weeks left in the quarter. The acquisition is on track, and we're working through regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Our special shareholder meeting is scheduled for November 2, and we look forward to closing by the middle of 2011, after which McAfee will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intel. 
Intel's agreement to acquire McAfee underscores that security is a fundamental component of modern computing and is increasingly relevant in a completely connected world, providing protection to a rapidly expanding heterogeneous world of connected devices requires a fundamentally new approach to security. The proposed combination of Intel and McAfee will be about helping provide greater protection efficiency to end points of mobility and embedded devices by bringing software and silicon together to do the heavy lifting. We are not moving away from our core security business of software-based end point protection and network security technologies but instead, intend to improve security for all of our customers by providing integrated hardware and software solutions. 
There are three critical areas of focus for this. First of all, mobile and embedded device security. Connected devices, such as copiers, smart meters, medical devices and others require optimized protection with a lower memory footprint and low CPU utilization such as wait-listing. Secondly, security is moving down the stack. We expect the combination of software and silicone to create the next generation of security technologies following a path similar to the one virtualization technology has taken over the past decade. We'll be able to utilize the silicon to enable the security software and provide better performance and higher efficacy. And third, managing security. With McAfee, Intel's acquiring ePolicy Orchestrator, the industry's leading security management platform, which gives enterprises the capability to centrally manage security across the myriad of devices using a single console. In addition, it's important to understand that McAfee will be a stand-alone independent subsidiary of Intel and continue to operate without interruption and with autonomy. This means a continued focus on multi-platform and multi-device support. McAfee and Intel have been working together for some time already, and we look forward to introducing the first products from our strategic partnership next year.
To comment further on McAfee's customer and partner support, we recently held our annual FOCUS Security Conference for a record number of customers and partners in Las Vegas. In its third year, this event attracted thousands of attendees and more than triple the number of attending partners to be updated on our strategy and vision. Customers are increasingly recognizing McAfee's strategic role and have raised the level of importance as a critical partner within their IT infrastructure. This was abundantly obvious at FOCUS, where I personally met with customers who told me that McAfee has evolved in a true and trusted security adviser for the critical technology infrastructures. 
Here's what some of the customers told me. First, more than ever, customers are looking for a focused security company. With the increasing complex threat landscape, a clearly focused and trusted security adviser is a necessity, especially for larger organizations. This is evidenced by McAfee now having more than 94% of the Fortune 500 as customers. Second, customers want more integration, not less. The more integrated, the better. And third, tightening the seams between products and the partner ecosystem is what will better help customers manage security, risk and compliance. And fourth, our customers' top concerns around consumerization of IT, cloud security and protecting their intellectual property. It's highly encouraging that all of these focus areas are for McAfee. Given these customers’ comments and taking into account the improved macroeconomic environment, we're confident McAfee is aligned with the most critical trends security and will benefit from being a trusted adviser for integrated solutions.
As a part of FOCUS, we made five major announcements. First, we shared our vision for the future with McAfee 3.0 security connect. We expect this strategy to lead McAfee into our next few years with ubiquitous security that's connected to the end point network and the cloud and fed by global threat intelligence. 
Second, we reinforced our end-point leadership with our Endpoint Security platform 9 product announcement. This release sets new performance standards for any malware and data security across an expansive array of devices. 
Third, we unveiled the next-generation ePolicy Orchestrator as part of the McAfee Security and Management Platform 5, providing unified monitoring, management and reporting system that scales to any sized organization and ensures all endpoints, networks and content are secure. ePO continues to be a very important differentiator in the marketplace for McAfee. 
And fourth, we expanded our mobility leadership. We completed the acquisition of tenCube and began integration of their market-leading mobility solutions in the McAfee's product offerings. Also, based on our Trust Digital acquisition, we announced McAfee Enterprise Mobility Management Platform 9, enabling highly scalable secure enterprise mobility management. This was our first quarter of owning Trust Digital and while it's early, we're very excited about the expansion of our leadership in this area of the marketplace. This quarter, we had several dozen new Trust Digital engagements, with key enterprise customers but we also had several new partnership opportunities that we're excited about. 
And fifth, we discussed security for virtualizing environments at FOCUS. With Citrix and several other partners we unveiled McAfee Management for Optimized Virtual Environments, or MOVE. MOVE meets the market in making virtual desktop security simpler and more scalable. We're also partnering with VMware, part of their vShield product family for virtualized and cloud environments. These announcements reflect the direction of our strategy of silicon satellite, secure device management, all integrated to our cloud and our on-premise management platforms. This allows our customers to secure and manage more connected devices as we expect the number of connected endpoints to expand from about 1 billion to more than 50 billion.
Over the past few years, we have worked hard to dramatically expand the breadth of our product offerings. We have broadened our security footprint to help customers respond. We'll go on any kind of endpoint to network or any cloud and across the technology stack. We have a solid cycle of new products and technologies, and our vision and strategy is working when expanded market opportunities as the number of connected devices explodes. Couple that with integrating the three components of our strategy, all connect and all leveraging the power of unrivalled McAfee global threat intelligence, we have an offering nobody else can match. We've created a bridge from PC-centric world to a world where everything is digital and everything is connected. And more importantly, we are continuing to gain mind share in the marketplace by developing and acquiring the right technologies to where the security market is headed.
So with all that, let me hand it over to Jonathan for a more in-depth review of our financials. Jonathan?"
32053,107914977,83112,"McAfee, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","McAfee LLC","Executives","Thanks, Dave. As you can imagine, given the Intel acquisition and all the work leading up to it, Q3 was a particularly exciting quarter. And it was all gratifying to see such great performance across the board. We achieved, and in many cases exceeded, the",1922,"Thanks, Dave. As you can imagine, given the Intel acquisition and all the work leading up to it, Q3 was a particularly exciting quarter. And it was all gratifying to see such great performance across the board. We achieved, and in many cases exceeded, the goals we set this quarter, including record third quarter revenue, record deferred revenue, record non-GAAP earnings per share and record year-to-date operating cash flow. Our solid financial results reflect continued global demand for our end-to-end security portfolio, strong operational performance and focused execution. And as Dave mentioned, we had a record number of corporate deals while contract durations increased, discounting declined to the lowest point this year and our revenue utilization rate improved, all reflecting the real momentum of our corporate segment.
Now turning to the Q3 results in more detail. On a constant currency basis, we achieved strong year-over-year growth in each of our major metrics. Again on constant-currency basis, revenue was up 11%, non-GAAP net income was up 15%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were up 19% and as a note, GAAP earnings per share was up 55%. Deferred revenue was up 10%. 
I'd like to note also our reported cash flow from operations was $139 million. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow is up 23% year-over-year. Now I'd like to go into a little bit more detail on our Q3 revenue and sales results. Q3 reported revenue with a third quarter record of $523 million, up 8% year-over-year and up 11% on a constant-currency basis. And as predicted, we did observe continued level of foreign exchange headwinds this quarter. [indiscernible] (33:25) Total Q3 negative revenue impact from foreign exchange was $17 million year-over-year and $3 million quarter-over-quarter. And as a note, revenue in Q3 included less than a $250,000 benefit related to previously deferred revenue associated with our Q2 signature release. 
Turning to our Q3 revenue results on a geographic basis. North America revenue was $312 million, up 14% year-over-year and up 15% on a constant-currency basis. Growth in this region was driven primarily by strong results in our Public Sector and Network Security businesses. And in Q3, North America revenue represented 60% of consolidated revenue.
Q3 international revenue was $211 million flat with last year, or up 7% on a constant-currency basis. Consistent strength in our International Consumer business and strong corporate performance in Japan and Asia Pacific was partially offset by softness in our EMEA Corporate business. In Q3, international revenue represented 40% of our consolidated revenues.
On a segment basis, our Corporate business is showing strong momentum and in Q3 achieved revenue of $324 million, up 5% year-over-year and up 9% on a constant-currency basis. We are seeing significant strength in our $1 million-plus sales orders with average deal size up 25% year-over-year. 85% of these orders had multiple product elements from more than one of our business units and a significant percentage of each deal from our portfolio security products beyond our PC offerings.
Virtual SMB sales orders were up mid-teens year-over-year. This segment of the business continues to be an important area of focus for our Corporate business. Our recent Security Paradox market research report shows that over 50% of midsized organizations have seen an increase in IT security risks facing their company, 40% of these companies had a data breach in the last year. Clearly, there's ongoing demand for effective and cost-efficient security solutions in this segment of the market.
Passing to a little bit of additional color from our Corporate business units. Q3 Network Security revenue and sales orders were both up double digits year-over-year. This growth was driven primarily by our very strong Public Sector business, particularly in North America. Year-to-date, our IPS and final product revenues are up over 30%, reflecting strong demand for our intrusion prevention and next-generation cloud.
We had a solid end-point quarter [indiscernible] (35:56) that our ToPS conversions brought. And as Dave mentioned earlier, we saw a nice lift of sales beyond traditional PCs, as well as a good number of new customers. Our Clients' Risk and Compliance business had double-digit, year-over-year revenue and sales order growth in Q3. We saw strong demand for our risk vulnerability of PCI solution for this quarter.
Now turning to our Consumer business. In Q3, we achieved an all-time revenue record of $199 million, up 13% year-over-year and up 16% on a constant-currency basis. And this really strong performance reflects our OEM partnerships continuing to pay off and we continue to see solid PC unit growth. In addition, our top ISP, telco, financials and portal partner business grew at 11% year-over-year, and our direct online business had its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. We also saw another quarter of strong double-digit growth in our premium Total Protection Suite offering. And overall our consumer margin in the Consumer business continues to be very strong.
During the quarter, we cited or reviewed our extended partnership agreement and released a new identity protection service, a new family protection product for iPhone and iPad, and a refresh [indiscernible] (37:17). I'm also pleased to report we received very positive feedback [indiscernible] (37:22)  McAfee-Intel combination from our partners around the world. 
So in summary, our Corporate business continued capitalizing the momentum we felt last year. We have a very strong platform and [indiscernible] (37:33). And our Consumer business remains very strong with our diversified distribution model, including PC OEMs, telcos, mobile and web security. Looking ahead, we believe we are well-positioned to further expand our addressable markets, capitalize on key trends, which is mobile security, virtualization of our customers at McAfee, trusted security solutions are seen as important areas.
Now moving down the rest of the income statement. Q3 and non-GAAP gross profit margin for the third quarter was 77.1%, down approximately 100 basis points sequentially. And as a reminder, our strategy encompasses a broad portfolio of offerings including software, hardware, services in collaboration, cloud-based solutions. Q3 had a higher mix of hardware [indiscernible] (38:20). 
Non-GAPP operating expenses in Q3 were $65 million, up $7 million sequentially, about 5% [indiscernible] (38:30) . We remain focused on aligning our business operations and cost structure [indiscernible] (38:35) while continuing to invest it. As of September 30, we had 6,121 employees worldwide, up slightly sequentially. Q3 non-GAAP operating income was $138 million, up 7% year-over-year. And I'm pleased to report that our Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 26.4%, slightly above our own expectation to reflecting a good cost control. Including the effects of foreign exchange in revenue expenses, we saw total negative impact to non-GAAP operating income of approximately $12 million year-over-year.
Q3, our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%, and our Q3 non-GAAP net income was $104 million, up 6% over Q3 last year and non-GAAP net income as a percentage of revenue was 20%, slightly improved from last quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share were a record $0.67, up 9% year-over-year, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.30, up [indiscernible] (39:31) With stronger than expected results reflect  a solid Q3 financial performance despite foreign exchange headwinds. And on constant-currency basis, non-GAAP earnings per share were up 19% year-over-year and GAAP earnings per share were up 55%.  
Now turning to some cash flow and balance sheet highlights. During the quarter, we generated $139 million of operating cash flow, which was ahead of our expectations. Strong collections in the geographic mix of our business in this quarter drove this upside to our own forecast. I am very pleased that year-to-date, our operating cash flow was up 23%. 
Cash and marketable securities at the end of the third quarter were at $1 billion. This reflects our strong operating cash flow performance in Q3 and the absence of a stock repurchase in the quarter. Please note that we have suspended our repurchase program due to our pending acquisition by Intel. And during the quarter, we closed our acquisition of tenCube. And looking ahead, we plan to continue with our strategy of acquiring small and medium-sized companies.
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $280 million ahead of $244 million sequentially. DSO was 48 days for Q3 compared to 45 days sequentially and 43 days in Q3 of last year. We continue to be very pleased with the overall health of our receivables portfolio.
Deferred revenue at the end of Q3 was a record $1.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year and up 10% on a constant-currency basis. The composition of our deferred revenue at the end of Q3 was 66% related to our Corporate business and 34% related to our Consumer business. Approximately 77% of our Q3 revenue was from the balance sheet. Approximately 88% was recurring in nature for services, support and subscription. 
Now before I move to our guidance for Q4, I'd like to make a comment about our Q3 results within the context of the last several quarters of McAfee's performance. Over the last few years, McAfee has been on a consistent and strong growth journey, and we’ve worked hard to successfully strengthen our Security Solutions portfolio, expand our addressable markets and integrate acquisitions. We remain on course of being financially successful at present and beyond. With a strong business pipeline, marketplace leadership in key emerging markets, which is mobility and virtualization.
In summary, McAfee demonstrated a strong operational execution in Q3 across many aspects of our business. We overachieved on most of our key financial metrics which reflects the health, robustness and the fact that our strategies are really paying off. We are very optimistic about McAfee's edge and the market prospects. 
Now moving to our outlook and guidance. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors, and that actual results could differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. The guidance we're providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP. 
For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect to achieve revenue in the range of $530 million to $550 million. 
As I've stated previously gross margins can vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the mix of our security product and services portfolio. We expect to manage gross margins and operating expenses together to achieve a targeted operating income range. We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating income margin to be in range of 25% to 26%. And non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.67 to $0.71. In Q4 we expect to expand our employee base with targeted hiring in sales, engineering and business operations. We expect to continue to generate between $100 million to $150 million in operating cash flow for the quarter. And in Q4, we do expect to be at the higher end of it. Our outlook for Q4 is based on a total share count of about 159 million shares and we are assuming an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 24%.
And within our Q4 non-GAAP guidance assumptions, we estimate the following currency rule of thumb. We're assuming $1.36 U.S. dollar-to-euro exchange rate for Q4. And for every $0.01 movement in the euro, revenue is impacted by $1.3 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share is impacted by approximately $0.005. For Q4 we're anticipating a negative impact of $16 million dollars year-over-year. We highly encourage you to take this into account as you construct your answers.
In closing, I'd like to take a moment to thank our employees for their particularly hard work and many, many contributions this quarter. And now I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing comments."

Our strategy is working and our financial performance continues to be strong. I believe the future has never looked brighter, especially with the strong support we're seeing for our Intel acquisition. McAfee offers a full complement of consumer and corporate security products, services and solutions, covering all the bases, end point, network and the cloud. We've shifted this company's effective opportunity from a very good foundational antivirus business to a business that continues to lead the market with best-of-breed comprehensive solutions while entering a green field of new market opportunities that is a stronger push into mobile and virtualization. We have a world-class PC OEM partner model, and we have diversified our Consumer business in many other channels that are performing well and contributing to our results. Now I hope you seeing the huge product cycle we're in. We have new products and refresh cycles going in in all business units. 
So to summarize, we remain very excited about the security opportunity. We have the right ingredients to continue to be the leader in digital security world. We have a very strong product cycle and product portfolio to protect customers from consumers to enterprises, from network to end point, from under digital PCs to the cloud. We've got an incredible network of partners and alliances across our business, covering many key growth verticals, including government public communications and technology. So in closing, I hope you have a good understanding of the opportunity McAfee has. It shall only be accelerated by us joining the Intel family.
So on behalf of the executive management team, I again want to thank our employees worldwide for their hard work and continued performance. So with that, Jonathan and I will open the call for some questions. Operator?"

We've been getting in the new markets and new opportunity. So just for us, the amount of capacity we have just in the PC world has grown. And that has helped the business overall and will continue to help the business overall. I would also tell you we've done a really nice job extending our portfolio of products. I think this has been an area that we've been very successful in. We added many new products this past quarter alone: identity protection, our family protection products. We now have offerings completely for the Apple family, from iPhones to the iPads, to the Mac products. So we start to look at our diversification of not just PC OEMs but telcos and ISPs and ways you could get to the PC market. We also have a pretty good foundation of getting from the PC market to beyond the PC market with mobility and other types of new tablet-like products that are in some cases really extraordinarily exciting for a vendor like us.

In the Corporate segment, we had really our strongest quarter for the year in the corporate model built in large deals, 33 deals over $1 million, as well as deals really over $100,000 in value. But we also saw good strength under $100,000, as Jonathan pointed out, with our SMB business. So we're executing a lot better ourselves. And then on top of that, I think we've really got ourselves in position of selling the value of network, cloud and end point together, or a better model. That's giving us the ability to discount less, get longer contract durations and really drive the business. Our end point note count was up, the amount of new business that we sold to brand new customers was up. And quite honestly, for me, it was in a quarter of potentially a lot of disruption with the Intel announcement, where people were asking questions, how does this work? So combination of validation of our customers with the Intel-proposed merger is a good one, along with good execution by our corporate teams and it shows I think we're on the right track here.

Is it more of a commerce device? Will you put your credit card, your debit card? Will you conduct business on that device? And more and more, you'll start to see the need for security be involved with the decision-making when they buy a device. So we're watching that happen at a rapid pace. And as I talked on the Q2 call, we really watch the Enterprise segment taking off fast. The number one, literally at our events in Vegas just a few weeks ago with our users, with IT consumerization, there wasn't a CIO or a CSO who didn't say the number one challenge and opportunity they had was how to secure the plethora of new devices that they're being asked to connect to their networks. And as you know, there's a lot of them being sold in the market today. So it's giving CIOs an opportunity to lower their CapEx, let employees buy their own device, bring it in, but didn't have to connect it. So we're actually seeing an expansion of devices beyond the PC. And I actually called out, this was the first quarter I really solid deals over $1 million where the new deal that were non PC-based was bigger than the original deal that was PC-based. That is a significant point for me on the Enterprise segment and we see more and more of that activity now. And has a little bit of Trust Digital acquisition as well as ePO being integrated there. And now we're seeing very quickly the consumer market growing. Obviously the communications companies, telecommunications companies are rapidly driving at this area.  I really think as we sit here another quarter, we'll see another acceleration window there. It's anybody's guess how big this could be but I'm seeing the margins and the price points to be very elastic in a positive way. I'm seeing the opportunity for turnovers and refreshes in this space to be much more rapid than the PC market. That's a key, too. Consumers are going out and buying products every six, nine months, year as opposed to two, three years in the PC market. So there's a lot of good indicators here that we'll be sitting a year from now, with a very robust market opportunity in mobile. I think it's much sooner than we had thought even a quarter or two ago."

And I think you probably just mean smart devices in general, smartphones, tablets in a class together. But it isn't traditional antivirus that is the number one feature request there. The number one feature request is typically management, allow a policy to authenticate a device to the network securely, particularly within the Enterprise segment. So we're finding a lot of demand right now to enable devices to securely connect to the network. That doesn't mean they have to be scanned for storage on that device, but just the simple authentication of the device on to the network. And then if the device is lost, with sensitive information on it we wipe it, lock it, kill it, encrypt it, basic PCI compliance features for data management. We believe we have that full suite right now. And as I said, we're starting to see deals that are getting very large for us in these enterprises and interesting opportunity there to just safely and securely connect them. Once those devices, in my opinion, get much more robust storage on them and they probably will, then the antivirus market may come into play here in a bigger way because then the storage of content needs to be scanned and managed in a way we manage typical PC Windows devices today. But I think AV would be a lagger clearly so far, but there's a bunch of leading-edge products and features that, in my opinion, are very much ready for the market and are available and they're being rolled out pretty extensively today."

It's my pleasure to be with you today and report outstanding quarterly results for McAfee. Against the backdrop of a historic transition for McAfee that could have cost significant disruption, our third quarter results beat records on several metrics. These excellent results are a testament to our strategy and the confidence of our customers, partners and employees in the proposed combination of McAfee and Intel. I'd like to thank all of the McAfee employees and our customers and partners for demonstrating strong support in the acquisition. The support is evidenced by lower discounts, longer contracts and a higher percentage of new customer business, as well as lower attrition among our employees. All of this shows that the future is clearly very bright for McAfee. Our outstanding third quarter results are a clear sign of a team that's executing very well. I'm very proud to be a part of this team and I believe McAfee is stronger than ever before. 
I'd like to start out today's call with some financial highlights from the quarter, followed by some industry insights and then some exciting new product announcements. 
In Q3, we achieved record third quarter revenue of $523 million, up 8% year-over-year. We also achieved record deferred revenue of $1.4 billion, also up 8% year-over-year; record year-to-date operating cash flow of $431 million, up 23% year-over-year; and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.67, up 9% year-over-year. Our Q3 performance is clear evidence that our customers and partners understand and support our strategy of delivering innovative, holistic security risk management solutions and the future potential of the combination of Intel and McAfee. During the quarter, we closed a record number of sales orders above $100,000, with a total of 525 deals this quarter, up 11% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. 
Within this, we had 33 transactions over $1 million, up 10% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Discounting was at the lowest point this year and our renewal rates are looking very strong. A particular note, some of our largest transactions in the past quarter involve customers spending more with McAfee on security beyond the PC than the sizable amounts that they already spent on traditional Windows PC security. This is additional evidence that our strategy of offering a broad security portfolio across expanding end points, the network and the cloud, is right on point. 
Our Network Security business in particular is growing rapidly and reported strong double-digit year-over-year sales growth, the best performance since we acquired Secure Computing in 2008. As a result of changing network perimeters in our customer's organizations, we're especially seeing great demand for a firewall, intrusion prevention and network access control products. 
I'm also very pleased to report that our Consumer business continues to thrive. We achieved record revenue of $199 million, up 13% year-over-year. Our PC OEM relationships and our broad portfolio of ISPs, telcos, financials and portal partners continues to deliver continued profitability for us and also gaining traction in the marketplace with our web and mobility offerings.
McAfee's strong performance in Q3 was in conjunction with I believe is one of the most exciting developments in the company's history. As you know, on August 19, we announced that McAfee has agreed to be acquired by Intel. I'm very excited about the expanded opportunities McAfee will have as part of the Intel family. This transaction fits perfectly with our vision of ubiquitous security and is expected to accelerate innovation at McAfee and ultimately make the digital world a safer place. 
During the quarter, we received strong endorsements from our customers and do not see any disruption to our business. In fact, I'm happy to report that our Q3 results beat even our own early forecast, particularly given that this transaction was announced with just five weeks left in the quarter. The acquisition is on track, and we're working through regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Our special shareholder meeting is scheduled for November 2, and we look forward to closing by the middle of 2011, after which McAfee will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intel. 
Intel's agreement to acquire McAfee underscores that security is a fundamental component of modern computing and is increasingly relevant in a completely connected world, providing protection to a rapidly expanding heterogeneous world of connected devices requires a fundamentally new approach to security. The proposed combination of Intel and McAfee will be about helping provide greater protection efficiency to end points of mobility and embedded devices by bringing software and silicon together to do the heavy lifting. We are not moving away from our core security business of software-based end point protection and network security technologies but instead, intend to improve security for all of our customers by providing integrated hardware and software solutions. 
There are three critical areas of focus for this. First of all, mobile and embedded device security. Connected devices, such as copiers, smart meters, medical devices and others require optimized protection with a lower memory footprint and low CPU utilization such as wait-listing. Secondly, security is moving down the stack. We expect the combination of software and silicone to create the next generation of security technologies following a path similar to the one virtualization technology has taken over the past decade. We'll be able to utilize the silicon to enable the security software and provide better performance and higher efficacy. And third, managing security. With McAfee, Intel's acquiring ePolicy Orchestrator, the industry's leading security management platform, which gives enterprises the capability to centrally manage security across the myriad of devices using a single console. In addition, it's important to understand that McAfee will be a stand-alone independent subsidiary of Intel and continue to operate without interruption and with autonomy. This means a continued focus on multi-platform and multi-device support. McAfee and Intel have been working together for some time already, and we look forward to introducing the first products from our strategic partnership next year.
To comment further on McAfee's customer and partner support, we recently held our annual FOCUS Security Conference for a record number of customers and partners in Las Vegas. In its third year, this event attracted thousands of attendees and more than triple the number of attending partners to be updated on our strategy and vision. Customers are increasingly recognizing McAfee's strategic role and have raised the level of importance as a critical partner within their IT infrastructure. This was abundantly obvious at FOCUS, where I personally met with customers who told me that McAfee has evolved in a true and trusted security adviser for the critical technology infrastructures. 
Here's what some of the customers told me. First, more than ever, customers are looking for a focused security company. With the increasing complex threat landscape, a clearly focused and trusted security adviser is a necessity, especially for larger organizations. This is evidenced by McAfee now having more than 94% of the Fortune 500 as customers. Second, customers want more integration, not less. The more integrated, the better. And third, tightening the seams between products and the partner ecosystem is what will better help customers manage security, risk and compliance. And fourth, our customers' top concerns around consumerization of IT, cloud security and protecting their intellectual property. It's highly encouraging that all of these focus areas are for McAfee. Given these customers’ comments and taking into account the improved macroeconomic environment, we're confident McAfee is aligned with the most critical trends security and will benefit from being a trusted adviser for integrated solutions.
As a part of FOCUS, we made five major announcements. First, we shared our vision for the future with McAfee 3.0 security connect. We expect this strategy to lead McAfee into our next few years with ubiquitous security that's connected to the end point network and the cloud and fed by global threat intelligence. 
Second, we reinforced our end-point leadership with our Endpoint Security platform 9 product announcement. This release sets new performance standards for any malware and data security across an expansive array of devices. 
Third, we unveiled the next-generation ePolicy Orchestrator as part of the McAfee Security and Management Platform 5, providing unified monitoring, management and reporting system that scales to any sized organization and ensures all endpoints, networks and content are secure. ePO continues to be a very important differentiator in the marketplace for McAfee. 
And fourth, we expanded our mobility leadership. We completed the acquisition of tenCube and began integration of their market-leading mobility solutions in the McAfee's product offerings. Also, based on our Trust Digital acquisition, we announced McAfee Enterprise Mobility Management Platform 9, enabling highly scalable secure enterprise mobility management. This was our first quarter of owning Trust Digital and while it's early, we're very excited about the expansion of our leadership in this area of the marketplace. This quarter, we had several dozen new Trust Digital engagements, with key enterprise customers but we also had several new partnership opportunities that we're excited about. 
And fifth, we discussed security for virtualizing environments at FOCUS. With Citrix and several other partners we unveiled McAfee Management for Optimized Virtual Environments, or MOVE. MOVE meets the market in making virtual desktop security simpler and more scalable. We're also partnering with VMware, part of their vShield product family for virtualized and cloud environments. These announcements reflect the direction of our strategy of silicon satellite, secure device management, all integrated to our cloud and our on-premise management platforms. This allows our customers to secure and manage more connected devices as we expect the number of connected endpoints to expand from about 1 billion to more than 50 billion.
Over the past few years, we have worked hard to dramatically expand the breadth of our product offerings. We have broadened our security footprint to help customers respond. We'll go on any kind of endpoint to network or any cloud and across the technology stack. We have a solid cycle of new products and technologies, and our vision and strategy is working when expanded market opportunities as the number of connected devices explodes. Couple that with integrating the three components of our strategy, all connect and all leveraging the power of unrivalled McAfee global threat intelligence, we have an offering nobody else can match. We've created a bridge from PC-centric world to a world where everything is digital and everything is connected. And more importantly, we are continuing to gain mind share in the marketplace by developing and acquiring the right technologies to where the security market is headed.
So with all that, let me hand it over to Jonathan for a more in-depth review of our financials. Jonathan?

And it was all gratifying to see such great performance across the board. We achieved, and in many cases exceeded, the goals we set this quarter, including record third quarter revenue, record deferred revenue, record non-GAAP earnings per share and record year-to-date operating cash flow. Our solid financial results reflect continued global demand for our end-to-end security portfolio, strong operational performance and focused execution. And as Dave mentioned, we had a record number of corporate deals while contract durations increased, discounting declined to the lowest point this year and our revenue utilization rate improved, all reflecting the real momentum of our corporate segment.
Now turning to the Q3 results in more detail. On a constant currency basis, we achieved strong year-over-year growth in each of our major metrics. Again on constant-currency basis, revenue was up 11%, non-GAAP net income was up 15%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were up 19% and as a note, GAAP earnings per share was up 55%. Deferred revenue was up 10%. 
I'd like to note also our reported cash flow from operations was $139 million. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow is up 23% year-over-year. Now I'd like to go into a little bit more detail on our Q3 revenue and sales results. Q3 reported revenue with a third quarter record of $523 million, up 8% year-over-year and up 11% on a constant-currency basis. And as predicted, we did observe continued level of foreign exchange headwinds this quarter. [indiscernible] (33:25) Total Q3 negative revenue impact from foreign exchange was $17 million year-over-year and $3 million quarter-over-quarter. And as a note, revenue in Q3 included less than a $250,000 benefit related to previously deferred revenue associated with our Q2 signature release. 
Turning to our Q3 revenue results on a geographic basis. North America revenue was $312 million, up 14% year-over-year and up 15% on a constant-currency basis. Growth in this region was driven primarily by strong results in our Public Sector and Network Security businesses. And in Q3, North America revenue represented 60% of consolidated revenue.
Q3 international revenue was $211 million flat with last year, or up 7% on a constant-currency basis. Consistent strength in our International Consumer business and strong corporate performance in Japan and Asia Pacific was partially offset by softness in our EMEA Corporate business. In Q3, international revenue represented 40% of our consolidated revenues.
On a segment basis, our Corporate business is showing strong momentum and in Q3 achieved revenue of $324 million, up 5% year-over-year and up 9% on a constant-currency basis. We are seeing significant strength in our $1 million-plus sales orders with average deal size up 25% year-over-year. 85% of these orders had multiple product elements from more than one of our business units and a significant percentage of each deal from our portfolio security products beyond our PC offerings.
Virtual SMB sales orders were up mid-teens year-over-year. This segment of the business continues to be an important area of focus for our Corporate business. Our recent Security Paradox market research report shows that over 50% of midsized organizations have seen an increase in IT security risks facing their company, 40% of these companies had a data breach in the last year. Clearly, there's ongoing demand for effective and cost-efficient security solutions in this segment of the market.
Passing to a little bit of additional color from our Corporate business units. Q3 Network Security revenue and sales orders were both up double digits year-over-year. This growth was driven primarily by our very strong Public Sector business, particularly in North America. Year-to-date, our IPS and final product revenues are up over 30%, reflecting strong demand for our intrusion prevention and next-generation cloud.
We had a solid end-point quarter [indiscernible] (35:56) that our ToPS conversions brought. And as Dave mentioned earlier, we saw a nice lift of sales beyond traditional PCs, as well as a good number of new customers. Our Clients' Risk and Compliance business had double-digit, year-over-year revenue and sales order growth in Q3. We saw strong demand for our risk vulnerability of PCI solution for this quarter.
Now turning to our Consumer business. In Q3, we achieved an all-time revenue record of $199 million, up 13% year-over-year and up 16% on a constant-currency basis. And this really strong performance reflects our OEM partnerships continuing to pay off and we continue to see solid PC unit growth. In addition, our top ISP, telco, financials and portal partner business grew at 11% year-over-year, and our direct online business had its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. We also saw another quarter of strong double-digit growth in our premium Total Protection Suite offering. And overall our consumer margin in the Consumer business continues to be very strong.
During the quarter, we cited or reviewed our extended partnership agreement and released a new identity protection service, a new family protection product for iPhone and iPad, and a refresh [indiscernible] (37:17). I'm also pleased to report we received very positive feedback [indiscernible] (37:22)  McAfee-Intel combination from our partners around the world. 
So in summary, our Corporate business continued capitalizing the momentum we felt last year. We have a very strong platform and [indiscernible] (37:33). And our Consumer business remains very strong with our diversified distribution model, including PC OEMs, telcos, mobile and web security. Looking ahead, we believe we are well-positioned to further expand our addressable markets, capitalize on key trends, which is mobile security, virtualization of our customers at McAfee, trusted security solutions are seen as important areas.
Now moving down the rest of the income statement. Q3 and non-GAAP gross profit margin for the third quarter was 77.1%, down approximately 100 basis points sequentially. And as a reminder, our strategy encompasses a broad portfolio of offerings including software, hardware, services in collaboration, cloud-based solutions. Q3 had a higher mix of hardware [indiscernible] (38:20). 
Non-GAPP operating expenses in Q3 were $65 million, up $7 million sequentially, about 5% [indiscernible] (38:30) . We remain focused on aligning our business operations and cost structure [indiscernible] (38:35) while continuing to invest it. As of September 30, we had 6,121 employees worldwide, up slightly sequentially. Q3 non-GAAP operating income was $138 million, up 7% year-over-year. And I'm pleased to report that our Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 26.4%, slightly above our own expectation to reflecting a good cost control. Including the effects of foreign exchange in revenue expenses, we saw total negative impact to non-GAAP operating income of approximately $12 million year-over-year.
Q3, our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%, and our Q3 non-GAAP net income was $104 million, up 6% over Q3 last year and non-GAAP net income as a percentage of revenue was 20%, slightly improved from last quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share were a record $0.67, up 9% year-over-year, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.30, up [indiscernible] (39:31) With stronger than expected results reflect  a solid Q3 financial performance despite foreign exchange headwinds. And on constant-currency basis, non-GAAP earnings per share were up 19% year-over-year and GAAP earnings per share were up 55%.  
Now turning to some cash flow and balance sheet highlights. During the quarter, we generated $139 million of operating cash flow, which was ahead of our expectations. Strong collections in the geographic mix of our business in this quarter drove this upside to our own forecast. I am very pleased that year-to-date, our operating cash flow was up 23%. 
Cash and marketable securities at the end of the third quarter were at $1 billion. This reflects our strong operating cash flow performance in Q3 and the absence of a stock repurchase in the quarter. Please note that we have suspended our repurchase program due to our pending acquisition by Intel. And during the quarter, we closed our acquisition of tenCube. And looking ahead, we plan to continue with our strategy of acquiring small and medium-sized companies.
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $280 million ahead of $244 million sequentially. DSO was 48 days for Q3 compared to 45 days sequentially and 43 days in Q3 of last year. We continue to be very pleased with the overall health of our receivables portfolio.
Deferred revenue at the end of Q3 was a record $1.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year and up 10% on a constant-currency basis. The composition of our deferred revenue at the end of Q3 was 66% related to our Corporate business and 34% related to our Consumer business. Approximately 77% of our Q3 revenue was from the balance sheet. Approximately 88% was recurring in nature for services, support and subscription. 
Now before I move to our guidance for Q4, I'd like to make a comment about our Q3 results within the context of the last several quarters of McAfee's performance. Over the last few years, McAfee has been on a consistent and strong growth journey, and we’ve worked hard to successfully strengthen our Security Solutions portfolio, expand our addressable markets and integrate acquisitions. We remain on course of being financially successful at present and beyond. With a strong business pipeline, marketplace leadership in key emerging markets, which is mobility and virtualization.
In summary, McAfee demonstrated a strong operational execution in Q3 across many aspects of our business. We overachieved on most of our key financial metrics which reflects the health, robustness and the fact that our strategies are really paying off. We are very optimistic about McAfee's edge and the market prospects. 
Now moving to our outlook and guidance. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors, and that actual results could differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. The guidance we're providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP. 
For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect to achieve revenue in the range of $530 million to $550 million. 
As I've stated previously gross margins can vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the mix of our security product and services portfolio. We expect to manage gross margins and operating expenses together to achieve a targeted operating income range. We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating income margin to be in range of 25% to 26%. And non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.67 to $0.71. In Q4 we expect to expand our employee base with targeted hiring in sales, engineering and business operations. We expect to continue to generate between $100 million to $150 million in operating cash flow for the quarter. And in Q4, we do expect to be at the higher end of it. Our outlook for Q4 is based on a total share count of about 159 million shares and we are assuming an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 24%.
And within our Q4 non-GAAP guidance assumptions, we estimate the following currency rule of thumb. We're assuming $1.36 U.S. dollar-to-euro exchange rate for Q4. And for every $0.01 movement in the euro, revenue is impacted by $1.3 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share is impacted by approximately $0.005. For Q4 we're anticipating a negative impact of $16 million dollars year-over-year. We highly encourage you to take this into account as you construct your answers.
In closing, I'd like to take a moment to thank our employees for their particularly hard work and many, many contributions this quarter. And now I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing comments.

Our strategy is working and our financial performance continues to be strong. I believe the future has never looked brighter, especially with the strong support we're seeing for our Intel acquisition. McAfee offers a full complement of consumer and corporate security products, services and solutions, covering all the bases, end point, network and the cloud. We've shifted this company's effective opportunity from a very good foundational antivirus business to a business that continues to lead the market with best-of-breed comprehensive solutions while entering a green field of new market opportunities that is a stronger push into mobile and virtualization. We have a world-class PC OEM partner model, and we have diversified our Consumer business in many other channels that are performing well and contributing to our results. Now I hope you seeing the huge product cycle we're in. We have new products and refresh cycles going in in all business units. 
So to summarize, we remain very excited about the security opportunity. We have the right ingredients to continue to be the leader in digital security world. We have a very strong product cycle and product portfolio to protect customers from consumers to enterprises, from network to end point, from under digital PCs to the cloud. We've got an incredible network of partners and alliances across our business, covering many key growth verticals, including government public communications and technology. So in closing, I hope you have a good understanding of the opportunity McAfee has. It shall only be accelerated by us joining the Intel family.
So on behalf of the executive management team, I again want to thank our employees worldwide for their hard work and continued performance. So with that, Jonathan and I will open the call for some questions. Operator?

We've been getting in the new markets and new opportunity. So just for us, the amount of capacity we have just in the PC world has grown. And that has helped the business overall and will continue to help the business overall. I would also tell you we've done a really nice job extending our portfolio of products. I think this has been an area that we've been very successful in. We added many new products this past quarter alone: identity protection, our family protection products. We now have offerings completely for the Apple family, from iPhones to the iPads, to the Mac products. So we start to look at our diversification of not just PC OEMs but telcos and ISPs and ways you could get to the PC market. We also have a pretty good foundation of getting from the PC market to beyond the PC market with mobility and other types of new tablet-like products that are in some cases really extraordinarily exciting for a vendor like us. So I think we're seeing the teams and the opportunity and financially, we have a very good engine to go after these markets with and hopefully that will continue for years to come.

As most of you know, Q3 is an interesting quarter around the world sometimes, just in terms of the opportunity to close business. In the Corporate segment, we had really our strongest quarter for the year in the corporate model built in large deals, 33 deals over $1 million, as well as deals really over $100,000 in value. But we also saw good strength under $100,000, as Jonathan pointed out, with our SMB business. So we're executing a lot better ourselves. And then on top of that, I think we've really got ourselves in position of selling the value of network, cloud and end point together, or a better model. That's giving us the ability to discount less, get longer contract durations and really drive the business. Our end point note count was up, the amount of new business that we sold to brand new customers was up. And quite honestly, for me, it was in a quarter of potentially a lot of disruption with the Intel announcement, where people were asking questions, how does this work? So combination of validation of our customers with the Intel-proposed merger is a good one, along with good execution by our corporate teams and it shows I think we're on the right track here. And I think as the economy continues to improve, we'll keep doing that. Jonathan, you want to add anything?

I think this is really the large question out there for all the security industry. As I have gone through the last two quarters, I'm really surprised at how big the opportunity is becoming and delighted to see it. When you look at really the introduction of the Apple iPad just not that long ago, you’re really seeing a huge expansion opportunity for us all. The amount of commerce being driven off these devices, which is really, in my opinion, the tipping point here is usually do you start to use of that device for more than sort of entertainment? Is it more of a commerce device? Will you put your credit card, your debit card? Will you conduct business on that device? And more and more, you'll start to see the need for security be involved with the decision-making when they buy a device. So we're watching that happen at a rapid pace. And as I talked on the Q2 call, we really watch the Enterprise segment taking off fast. The number one, literally at our events in Vegas just a few weeks ago with our users, with IT consumerization, there wasn't a CIO or a CSO who didn't say the number one challenge and opportunity they had was how to secure the plethora of new devices that they're being asked to connect to their networks. And as you know, there's a lot of them being sold in the market today. So it's giving CIOs an opportunity to lower their CapEx, let employees buy their own device, bring it in, but didn't have to connect it. So we're actually seeing an expansion of devices beyond the PC. And I actually called out, this was the first quarter I really solid deals over $1 million where the new deal that were non PC-based was bigger than the original deal that was PC-based. That is a significant point for me on the Enterprise segment and we see more and more of that activity now. And has a little bit of Trust Digital acquisition as well as ePO being integrated there. And now we're seeing very quickly the consumer market growing. Obviously the communications companies, telecommunications companies are rapidly driving at this area.  I really think as we sit here another quarter, we'll see another acceleration window there. It's anybody's guess how big this could be but I'm seeing the margins and the price points to be very elastic in a positive way. I'm seeing the opportunity for turnovers and refreshes in this space to be much more rapid than the PC market. That's a key, too. Consumers are going out and buying products every six, nine months, year as opposed to two, three years in the PC market. So there's a lot of good indicators here that we'll be sitting a year from now, with a very robust market opportunity in mobile. I think it's much sooner than we had thought even a quarter or two ago.

And I think you probably just mean smart devices in general, smartphones, tablets in a class together. But it isn't traditional antivirus that is the number one feature request there. The number one feature request is typically management, allow a policy to authenticate a device to the network securely, particularly within the Enterprise segment. So we're finding a lot of demand right now to enable devices to securely connect to the network. That doesn't mean they have to be scanned for storage on that device, but just the simple authentication of the device on to the network. And then if the device is lost, with sensitive information on it we wipe it, lock it, kill it, encrypt it, basic PCI compliance features for data management. We believe we have that full suite right now. And as I said, we're starting to see deals that are getting very large for us in these enterprises and interesting opportunity there to just safely and securely connect them. Once those devices, in my opinion, get much more robust storage on them and they probably will, then the antivirus market may come into play here in a bigger way because then the storage of content needs to be scanned and managed in a way we manage typical PC Windows devices today. But I think AV would be a lagger clearly so far, but there's a bunch of leading-edge products and features that, in my opinion, are very much ready for the market and are available and they're being rolled out pretty extensively today.

It's my pleasure to be with you today and report outstanding quarterly results for McAfee. Against the backdrop of a historic transition for McAfee that could have cost significant disruption, our third quarter results beat records on several metrics. These excellent results are a testament to our strategy and the confidence of our customers, partners and employees in the proposed combination of McAfee and Intel. I'd like to thank all of the McAfee employees and our customers and partners for demonstrating strong support in the acquisition. The support is evidenced by lower discounts, longer contracts and a higher percentage of new customer business, as well as lower attrition among our employees. All of this shows that the future is clearly very bright for McAfee. Our outstanding third quarter results are a clear sign of a team that's executing very well. I'm very proud to be a part of this team and I believe McAfee is stronger than ever before.
 I'd like to start out today's call with some financial highlights from the quarter, followed by some industry insights and then some exciting new product announcements.
 In Q3, we achieved record third quarter revenue of $523 million, up 8% year-over-year. We also achieved record deferred revenue of $1.4 billion, also up 8% year-over-year; record year-to-date operating cash flow of $431 million, up 23% year-over-year; and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.67, up 9% year-over-year. Our Q3 performance is clear evidence that our customers and partners understand and support our strategy of delivering innovative, holistic security risk management solutions and the future potential of the combination of Intel and McAfee. During the quarter, we closed a record number of sales orders above $100,000, with a total of 525 deals this quarter, up 11% sequentially and 6% year-over-year.
 Within this, we had 33 transactions over $1 million, up 10% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Discounting was at the lowest point this year and our renewal rates are looking very strong. A particular note, some of our largest transactions in the past quarter involve customers spending more with McAfee on security beyond the PC than the sizable amounts that they already spent on traditional Windows PC security. This is additional evidence that our strategy of offering a broad security portfolio across expanding end points, the network and the cloud, is right on point.
 Our Network Security business in particular is growing rapidly and reported strong double-digit year-over-year sales growth, the best performance since we acquired Secure Computing in 2008. As a result of changing network perimeters in our customer's organizations, we're especially seeing great demand for a firewall, intrusion prevention and network access control products.
 I'm also very pleased to report that our Consumer business continues to thrive. We achieved record revenue of $199 million, up 13% year-over-year. Our PC OEM relationships and our broad portfolio of ISPs, telcos, financials and portal partners continues to deliver continued profitability for us and also gaining traction in the marketplace with our web and mobility offerings.
 McAfee's strong performance in Q3 was in conjunction with I believe is one of the most exciting developments in the company's history. As you know, on August 19, we announced that McAfee has agreed to be acquired by Intel. I'm very excited about the expanded opportunities McAfee will have as part of the Intel family. This transaction fits perfectly with our vision of ubiquitous security and is expected to accelerate innovation at McAfee and ultimately make the digital world a safer place.
 During the quarter, we received strong endorsements from our customers and do not see any disruption to our business. In fact, I'm happy to report that our Q3 results beat even our own early forecast, particularly given that this transaction was announced with just five weeks left in the quarter. The acquisition is on track, and we're working through regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Our special shareholder meeting is scheduled for November 2, and we look forward to closing by the middle of 2011, after which McAfee will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intel.
 Intel's agreement to acquire McAfee underscores that security is a fundamental component of modern computing and is increasingly relevant in a completely connected world, providing protection to a rapidly expanding heterogeneous world of connected devices requires a fundamentally new approach to security. The proposed combination of Intel and McAfee will be about helping provide greater protection efficiency to end points of mobility and embedded devices by bringing software and silicon together to do the heavy lifting. We are not moving away from our core security business of software-based end point protection and network security technologies but instead, intend to improve security for all of our customers by providing integrated hardware and software solutions.
 There are three critical areas of focus for this. First of all, mobile and embedded device security. Connected devices, such as copiers, smart meters, medical devices and others require optimized protection with a lower memory footprint and low CPU utilization such as wait-listing. Secondly, security is moving down the stack. We expect the combination of software and silicone to create the next generation of security technologies following a path similar to the one virtualization technology has taken over the past decade. We'll be able to utilize the silicon to enable the security software and provide better performance and higher efficacy. And third, managing security. With McAfee, Intel's acquiring ePolicy Orchestrator, the industry's leading security management platform, which gives enterprises the capability to centrally manage security across the myriad of devices using a single console. In addition, it's important to understand that McAfee will be a stand-alone independent subsidiary of Intel and continue to operate without interruption and with autonomy. This means a continued focus on multi-platform and multi-device support. McAfee and Intel have been working together for some time already, and we look forward to introducing the first products from our strategic partnership next year.
 To comment further on McAfee's customer and partner support, we recently held our annual FOCUS Security Conference for a record number of customers and partners in Las Vegas. In its third year, this event attracted thousands of attendees and more than triple the number of attending partners to be updated on our strategy and vision. Customers are increasingly recognizing McAfee's strategic role and have raised the level of importance as a critical partner within their IT infrastructure. This was abundantly obvious at FOCUS, where I personally met with customers who told me that McAfee has evolved in a true and trusted security adviser for the critical technology infrastructures.
 Here's what some of the customers told me. First, more than ever, customers are looking for a focused security company. With the increasing complex threat landscape, a clearly focused and trusted security adviser is a necessity, especially for larger organizations. This is evidenced by McAfee now having more than 94% of the Fortune 500 as customers. Second, customers want more integration, not less. The more integrated, the better. And third, tightening the seams between products and the partner ecosystem is what will better help customers manage security, risk and compliance. And fourth, our customers' top concerns around consumerization of IT, cloud security and protecting their intellectual property. It's highly encouraging that all of these focus areas are for McAfee. Given these customers’ comments and taking into account the improved macroeconomic environment, we're confident McAfee is aligned with the most critical trends security and will benefit from being a trusted adviser for integrated solutions.
 As a part of FOCUS, we made five major announcements. First, we shared our vision for the future with McAfee 3.0 security connect. We expect this strategy to lead McAfee into our next few years with ubiquitous security that's connected to the end point network and the cloud and fed by global threat intelligence.
 Second, we reinforced our end-point leadership with our Endpoint Security platform 9 product announcement. This release sets new performance standards for any malware and data security across an expansive array of devices.
 Third, we unveiled the next-generation ePolicy Orchestrator as part of the McAfee Security and Management Platform 5, providing unified monitoring, management and reporting system that scales to any sized organization and ensures all endpoints, networks and content are secure. ePO continues to be a very important differentiator in the marketplace for McAfee.
 And fourth, we expanded our mobility leadership. We completed the acquisition of tenCube and began integration of their market-leading mobility solutions in the McAfee's product offerings. Also, based on our Trust Digital acquisition, we announced McAfee Enterprise Mobility Management Platform 9, enabling highly scalable secure enterprise mobility management. This was our first quarter of owning Trust Digital and while it's early, we're very excited about the expansion of our leadership in this area of the marketplace. This quarter, we had several dozen new Trust Digital engagements, with key enterprise customers but we also had several new partnership opportunities that we're excited about.
 And fifth, we discussed security for virtualizing environments at FOCUS. With Citrix and several other partners we unveiled McAfee Management for Optimized Virtual Environments, or MOVE. MOVE meets the market in making virtual desktop security simpler and more scalable. We're also partnering with VMware, part of their vShield product family for virtualized and cloud environments. These announcements reflect the direction of our strategy of silicon satellite, secure device management, all integrated to our cloud and our on-premise management platforms. This allows our customers to secure and manage more connected devices as we expect the number of connected endpoints to expand from about 1 billion to more than 50 billion.
 Over the past few years, we have worked hard to dramatically expand the breadth of our product offerings. We have broadened our security footprint to help customers respond. We'll go on any kind of endpoint to network or any cloud and across the technology stack. We have a solid cycle of new products and technologies, and our vision and strategy is working when expanded market opportunities as the number of connected devices explodes. Couple that with integrating the three components of our strategy, all connect and all leveraging the power of unrivalled McAfee global threat intelligence, we have an offering nobody else can match. We've created a bridge from PC-centric world to a world where everything is digital and everything is connected. And more importantly, we are continuing to gain mind share in the marketplace by developing and acquiring the right technologies to where the security market is headed.
 So with all that, let me hand it over to Jonathan for a more in-depth review of our financials. Jonathan?

32053,107914977,86618,"McAfee, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","McAfee LLC","Executives"," Thanks, Dave. As you can imagine, given the Intel acquisition and all the work leading up to it, Q3 was a particularly exciting quarter. And it was all gratifying to see such great performance across the board. We achieved, and in many cases exceeded, th",1922," Thanks, Dave. As you can imagine, given the Intel acquisition and all the work leading up to it, Q3 was a particularly exciting quarter. And it was all gratifying to see such great performance across the board. We achieved, and in many cases exceeded, the goals we set this quarter, including record third quarter revenue, record deferred revenue, record non-GAAP earnings per share and record year-to-date operating cash flow. Our solid financial results reflect continued global demand for our end-to-end security portfolio, strong operational performance and focused execution. And as Dave mentioned, we had a record number of corporate deals while contract durations increased, discounting declined to the lowest point this year and our revenue utilization rate improved, all reflecting the real momentum of our corporate segment.
 Now turning to the Q3 results in more detail. On a constant currency basis, we achieved strong year-over-year growth in each of our major metrics. Again on constant-currency basis, revenue was up 11%, non-GAAP net income was up 15%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were up 19% and as a note, GAAP earnings per share was up 55%. Deferred revenue was up 10%.
 I'd like to note also our reported cash flow from operations was $139 million. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow is up 23% year-over-year. Now I'd like to go into a little bit more detail on our Q3 revenue and sales results. Q3 reported revenue with a third quarter record of $523 million, up 8% year-over-year and up 11% on a constant-currency basis. And as predicted, we did observe continued level of foreign exchange headwinds this quarter. [indiscernible] (33:25) Total Q3 negative revenue impact from foreign exchange was $17 million year-over-year and $3 million quarter-over-quarter. And as a note, revenue in Q3 included less than a $250,000 benefit related to previously deferred revenue associated with our Q2 signature release.
 Turning to our Q3 revenue results on a geographic basis. North America revenue was $312 million, up 14% year-over-year and up 15% on a constant-currency basis. Growth in this region was driven primarily by strong results in our Public Sector and Network Security businesses. And in Q3, North America revenue represented 60% of consolidated revenue.
 Q3 international revenue was $211 million flat with last year, or up 7% on a constant-currency basis. Consistent strength in our International Consumer business and strong corporate performance in Japan and Asia Pacific was partially offset by softness in our EMEA Corporate business. In Q3, international revenue represented 40% of our consolidated revenues.
 On a segment basis, our Corporate business is showing strong momentum and in Q3 achieved revenue of $324 million, up 5% year-over-year and up 9% on a constant-currency basis. We are seeing significant strength in our $1 million-plus sales orders with average deal size up 25% year-over-year. 85% of these orders had multiple product elements from more than one of our business units and a significant percentage of each deal from our portfolio security products beyond our PC offerings.
 Virtual SMB sales orders were up mid-teens year-over-year. This segment of the business continues to be an important area of focus for our Corporate business. Our recent Security Paradox market research report shows that over 50% of midsized organizations have seen an increase in IT security risks facing their company, 40% of these companies had a data breach in the last year. Clearly, there's ongoing demand for effective and cost-efficient security solutions in this segment of the market.
 Passing to a little bit of additional color from our Corporate business units. Q3 Network Security revenue and sales orders were both up double digits year-over-year. This growth was driven primarily by our very strong Public Sector business, particularly in North America. Year-to-date, our IPS and final product revenues are up over 30%, reflecting strong demand for our intrusion prevention and next-generation cloud.
 We had a solid end-point quarter [indiscernible] (35:56) that our ToPS conversions brought. And as Dave mentioned earlier, we saw a nice lift of sales beyond traditional PCs, as well as a good number of new customers. Our Clients' Risk and Compliance business had double-digit, year-over-year revenue and sales order growth in Q3. We saw strong demand for our risk vulnerability of PCI solution for this quarter.
 Now turning to our Consumer business. In Q3, we achieved an all-time revenue record of $199 million, up 13% year-over-year and up 16% on a constant-currency basis. And this really strong performance reflects our OEM partnerships continuing to pay off and we continue to see solid PC unit growth. In addition, our top ISP, telco, financials and portal partner business grew at 11% year-over-year, and our direct online business had its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. We also saw another quarter of strong double-digit growth in our premium Total Protection Suite offering. And overall our consumer margin in the Consumer business continues to be very strong.
 During the quarter, we cited or reviewed our extended partnership agreement and released a new identity protection service, a new family protection product for iPhone and iPad, and a refresh [indiscernible] (37:17). I'm also pleased to report we received very positive feedback [indiscernible] (37:22)  McAfee-Intel combination from our partners around the world.
 So in summary, our Corporate business continued capitalizing the momentum we felt last year. We have a very strong platform and [indiscernible] (37:33). And our Consumer business remains very strong with our diversified distribution model, including PC OEMs, telcos, mobile and web security. Looking ahead, we believe we are well-positioned to further expand our addressable markets, capitalize on key trends, which is mobile security, virtualization of our customers at McAfee, trusted security solutions are seen as important areas.
 Now moving down the rest of the income statement. Q3 and non-GAAP gross profit margin for the third quarter was 77.1%, down approximately 100 basis points sequentially. And as a reminder, our strategy encompasses a broad portfolio of offerings including software, hardware, services in collaboration, cloud-based solutions. Q3 had a higher mix of hardware [indiscernible] (38:20).
 Non-GAPP operating expenses in Q3 were $65 million, up $7 million sequentially, about 5% [indiscernible] (38:30) . We remain focused on aligning our business operations and cost structure [indiscernible] (38:35) while continuing to invest it. As of September 30, we had 6,121 employees worldwide, up slightly sequentially. Q3 non-GAAP operating income was $138 million, up 7% year-over-year. And I'm pleased to report that our Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 26.4%, slightly above our own expectation to reflecting a good cost control. Including the effects of foreign exchange in revenue expenses, we saw total negative impact to non-GAAP operating income of approximately $12 million year-over-year.
 Q3, our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%, and our Q3 non-GAAP net income was $104 million, up 6% over Q3 last year and non-GAAP net income as a percentage of revenue was 20%, slightly improved from last quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share were a record $0.67, up 9% year-over-year, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.30, up [indiscernible] (39:31) With stronger than expected results reflect  a solid Q3 financial performance despite foreign exchange headwinds. And on constant-currency basis, non-GAAP earnings per share were up 19% year-over-year and GAAP earnings per share were up 55%.
 Now turning to some cash flow and balance sheet highlights. During the quarter, we generated $139 million of operating cash flow, which was ahead of our expectations. Strong collections in the geographic mix of our business in this quarter drove this upside to our own forecast. I am very pleased that year-to-date, our operating cash flow was up 23%.
 Cash and marketable securities at the end of the third quarter were at $1 billion. This reflects our strong operating cash flow performance in Q3 and the absence of a stock repurchase in the quarter. Please note that we have suspended our repurchase program due to our pending acquisition by Intel. And during the quarter, we closed our acquisition of tenCube. And looking ahead, we plan to continue with our strategy of acquiring small and medium-sized companies.
 Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $280 million ahead of $244 million sequentially. DSO was 48 days for Q3 compared to 45 days sequentially and 43 days in Q3 of last year. We continue to be very pleased with the overall health of our receivables portfolio.
 Deferred revenue at the end of Q3 was a record $1.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year and up 10% on a constant-currency basis. The composition of our deferred revenue at the end of Q3 was 66% related to our Corporate business and 34% related to our Consumer business. Approximately 77% of our Q3 revenue was from the balance sheet. Approximately 88% was recurring in nature for services, support and subscription.
 Now before I move to our guidance for Q4, I'd like to make a comment about our Q3 results within the context of the last several quarters of McAfee's performance. Over the last few years, McAfee has been on a consistent and strong growth journey, and we’ve worked hard to successfully strengthen our Security Solutions portfolio, expand our addressable markets and integrate acquisitions. We remain on course of being financially successful at present and beyond. With a strong business pipeline, marketplace leadership in key emerging markets, which is mobility and virtualization.
 In summary, McAfee demonstrated a strong operational execution in Q3 across many aspects of our business. We overachieved on most of our key financial metrics which reflects the health, robustness and the fact that our strategies are really paying off. We are very optimistic about McAfee's edge and the market prospects.
 Now moving to our outlook and guidance. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors, and that actual results could differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. The guidance we're providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP.
 For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect to achieve revenue in the range of $530 million to $550 million.
 As I've stated previously gross margins can vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the mix of our security product and services portfolio. We expect to manage gross margins and operating expenses together to achieve a targeted operating income range. We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating income margin to be in range of 25% to 26%. And non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.67 to $0.71. In Q4 we expect to expand our employee base with targeted hiring in sales, engineering and business operations. We expect to continue to generate between $100 million to $150 million in operating cash flow for the quarter. And in Q4, we do expect to be at the higher end of it. Our outlook for Q4 is based on a total share count of about 159 million shares and we are assuming an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 24%.
 And within our Q4 non-GAAP guidance assumptions, we estimate the following currency rule of thumb. We're assuming $1.36 U.S. dollar-to-euro exchange rate for Q4. And for every $0.01 movement in the euro, revenue is impacted by $1.3 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share is impacted by approximately $0.005. For Q4 we're anticipating a negative impact of $16 million dollars year-over-year. We highly encourage you to take this into account as you construct your answers.
 In closing, I'd like to take a moment to thank our employees for their particularly hard work and many, many contributions this quarter. And now I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing comments.

Our strategy is working and our financial performance continues to be strong. I believe the future has never looked brighter, especially with the strong support we're seeing for our Intel acquisition. McAfee offers a full complement of consumer and corporate security products, services and solutions, covering all the bases, end point, network and the cloud. We've shifted this company's effective opportunity from a very good foundational antivirus business to a business that continues to lead the market with best-of-breed comprehensive solutions while entering a green field of new market opportunities that is a stronger push into mobile and virtualization. We have a world-class PC OEM partner model, and we have diversified our Consumer business in many other channels that are performing well and contributing to our results. Now I hope you seeing the huge product cycle we're in. We have new products and refresh cycles going in in all business units.
 So to summarize, we remain very excited about the security opportunity. We have the right ingredients to continue to be the leader in digital security world. We have a very strong product cycle and product portfolio to protect customers from consumers to enterprises, from network to end point, from under digital PCs to the cloud. We've got an incredible network of partners and alliances across our business, covering many key growth verticals, including government public communications and technology. So in closing, I hope you have a good understanding of the opportunity McAfee has. It shall only be accelerated by us joining the Intel family.
 So on behalf of the executive management team, I again want to thank our employees worldwide for their hard work and continued performance. So with that, Jonathan and I will open the call for some questions. Operator?

I mean, clearly we still see robustness in the PC Windows market without a doubt. As you know, we've significantly extended our own presence over the last 18 months on a variety of PC OEM partners, with ACER, with Dell with some of the others that we've been really expanded to. We've been getting in the new markets and new opportunity. So just for us, the amount of capacity we have just in the PC world has grown. And that has helped the business overall and will continue to help the business overall. I would also tell you we've done a really nice job extending our portfolio of products. I think this has been an area that we've been very successful in. We added many new products this past quarter alone: identity protection, our family protection products. We now have offerings completely for the Apple family, from iPhones to the iPads, to the Mac products. So we start to look at our diversification of not just PC OEMs but telcos and ISPs and ways you could get to the PC market. We also have a pretty good foundation of getting from the PC market to beyond the PC market with mobility and other types of new tablet-like products that are in some cases really extraordinarily exciting for a vendor like us. So I think we're seeing the teams and the opportunity and financially, we have a very good engine to go after these markets with and hopefully that will continue for years to come.

As most of you know, Q3 is an interesting quarter around the world sometimes, just in terms of the opportunity to close business. In the Corporate segment, we had really our strongest quarter for the year in the corporate model built in large deals, 33 deals over $1 million, as well as deals really over $100,000 in value. But we also saw good strength under $100,000, as Jonathan pointed out, with our SMB business. So we're executing a lot better ourselves. And then on top of that, I think we've really got ourselves in position of selling the value of network, cloud and end point together, or a better model. That's giving us the ability to discount less, get longer contract durations and really drive the business. Our end point note count was up, the amount of new business that we sold to brand new customers was up. And quite honestly, for me, it was in a quarter of potentially a lot of disruption with the Intel announcement, where people were asking questions, how does this work? So combination of validation of our customers with the Intel-proposed merger is a good one, along with good execution by our corporate teams and it shows I think we're on the right track here. And I think as the economy continues to improve, we'll keep doing that. Jonathan, you want to add anything?

I think this is really the large question out there for all the security industry. As I have gone through the last two quarters, I'm really surprised at how big the opportunity is becoming and delighted to see it. When you look at really the introduction of the Apple iPad just not that long ago, you’re really seeing a huge expansion opportunity for us all. The amount of commerce being driven off these devices, which is really, in my opinion, the tipping point here is usually do you start to use of that device for more than sort of entertainment? Is it more of a commerce device? Will you put your credit card, your debit card? Will you conduct business on that device? And more and more, you'll start to see the need for security be involved with the decision-making when they buy a device. So we're watching that happen at a rapid pace. And as I talked on the Q2 call, we really watch the Enterprise segment taking off fast. The number one, literally at our events in Vegas just a few weeks ago with our users, with IT consumerization, there wasn't a CIO or a CSO who didn't say the number one challenge and opportunity they had was how to secure the plethora of new devices that they're being asked to connect to their networks. And as you know, there's a lot of them being sold in the market today. So it's giving CIOs an opportunity to lower their CapEx, let employees buy their own device, bring it in, but didn't have to connect it. So we're actually seeing an expansion of devices beyond the PC. And I actually called out, this was the first quarter I really solid deals over $1 million where the new deal that were non PC-based was bigger than the original deal that was PC-based. That is a significant point for me on the Enterprise segment and we see more and more of that activity now. And has a little bit of Trust Digital acquisition as well as ePO being integrated there. And now we're seeing very quickly the consumer market growing. Obviously the communications companies, telecommunications companies are rapidly driving at this area.  I really think as we sit here another quarter, we'll see another acceleration window there. It's anybody's guess how big this could be but I'm seeing the margins and the price points to be very elastic in a positive way. I'm seeing the opportunity for turnovers and refreshes in this space to be much more rapid than the PC market. That's a key, too. Consumers are going out and buying products every six, nine months, year as opposed to two, three years in the PC market. So there's a lot of good indicators here that we'll be sitting a year from now, with a very robust market opportunity in mobile. I think it's much sooner than we had thought even a quarter or two ago.

So we're finding a lot of demand right now to enable devices to securely connect to the network. That doesn't mean they have to be scanned for storage on that device, but just the simple authentication of the device on to the network. And then if the device is lost, with sensitive information on it we wipe it, lock it, kill it, encrypt it, basic PCI compliance features for data management. We believe we have that full suite right now. And as I said, we're starting to see deals that are getting very large for us in these enterprises and interesting opportunity there to just safely and securely connect them. Once those devices, in my opinion, get much more robust storage on them and they probably will, then the antivirus market may come into play here in a bigger way because then the storage of content needs to be scanned and managed in a way we manage typical PC Windows devices today. But I think AV would be a lagger clearly so far, but there's a bunch of leading-edge products and features that, in my opinion, are very much ready for the market and are available and they're being rolled out pretty extensively today.
