As always Tom Wilson, Don Civgin and I will make some opening comments providing color on our fourth quarter and yearly results for 2009. Following our comments we will have a question-and-answer session when Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; Joe Lacher, President of Allstate Protection; Sam Pilch, our Controller; and Matt Winter, President of Allstate Financial, will join us. 
During the session we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a follow up so that we can hear from as many of you as time permits. Last night we issued our press release and the majority of our investor supplement for the fourth quarter. We also posted a Slide presentation that will be used this morning during our presentation. You can locate these documents on our website.
As noted on Slide 1, this discussion may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate’s operations and actual results may differ materially, so refer to our Form 10-K for 2008, our 10-Q for the third quarter 2009 and our most recent press release for information on potential risks. We expect to file our 10-K for 2009 by the end of February. Also this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our press release and on our website. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available following the call.
Christine Yeider and I will be available to answer any of your questions that you may have once this call is completed. Now let’s begin with Tom Wilson.

I’ll begin with my thoughts on our progress then Bob will go through the business unit results and Don will cover investments and the balance sheet. We entered 2009 with three pri",876,"Well, good morning and thanks for your continuing interest in Allstate. I’ll begin with my thoughts on our progress then Bob will go through the business unit results and Don will cover investments and the balance sheet. 
We entered 2009 with three priorities; that was to keep Allstate financially strong, to improve customer loyalty and to reinvent protection retirement for consumer. And we made outstanding progress on the first two goals and while we made less progress on reinventing, we did lay out a foundation for growth.
Let me go through each of these priorities in order. First, we did further strengthen Allstate’s financial position. We generated operating income of $592 million for the quarter and almost $1.9 billion for the year, which was 7% higher than the full year of 2008. We had double digit returns on our $100 billion investment portfolio, realized capital losses were reduced to $33 million for the quarter and $583 million for the year. Importantly the pretax net unrealized position improved by $6.5 billion throughout the year. Net income was $518 million in the fourth quarter and $854 million for the year. As a result, book value grew by 31% in 2009.
We also built up a stronger capital base on both the GAAP and statutory basis. And we achieved this through focused operational efforts at Allstate Protection, Allstate Financial and in our investment activity. Allstate Protection achieved its objectives of providing a strong source of operating profit, improving customer loyalty and laying a foundation for growth. The combined ratio was 93.2 for the quarter as excellent operating practices, expense controls and pricing discipline resulted in all major lines generating an underwriting profit in the fourth quarter. 
Over the last five years, our personal lines business has generated an underwriting profit in 18 of 20 quarters with an average of 93.9. 
As you know we provide annual guidance on a combined ratio. This year was 87 to 89 for 2009, excluding the cash freeze and prior year reserve changes, we ended the year at 88.1, almost exactly in the middle of our expectations. 
We expect to capitalize on our positive momentum with continued focus on targeting high lifetime value customers, further improvements in customer loyalty, taking steps to improve homeowner returns, improve sales and service results from our agencies and expansion of our new product development and marketing programs.
Allstate Financial also made substantial progress in the quarter to focus the win plan, to reduce expenses, to lower fixed costs and focus on profitability, has achieved 90% of its original goals and is on schedule. Operating income was $95 million for the quarter and $340 million for the year.
Importantly we also made progress in focusing our strategy in this new investment and economic climate. Allstate Financials’ primary focus will be on providing mortality, morbidity and preservation of income products to customers through Allstate agencies and at worksites. We’re restructuring our sales programs and support, our product offerings and our marketing efforts, to broaden our relationships with the 17 million households that currently do business with Allstate.
Our workplace business is growing rapidly, with premiums increasing 9% last year as we expanded both the small and large employer segments. We will continue to reduce our fixed annuity book, value portfolio, which are the sales through banks, independent agencies and broker dealers. We began this process in 2006 and will continue to exit unprofitable relationships and lower our concentration spread based products.
We had a good quarter and a great year on investments. We had strong overall total returns and made progress in positioning our portfolio for future success by both mitigating our risks and seeking to optimize our returns. We reinvested excess liquidity, which increased throughout the year as the markets improved, raising returns. We reduced our exposure to commercial real estate by over $5 billion last year and lowered our municipal bond investments by $1.9 billion. We shortened the duration of our fixed income investments and hedged the unmatched portion of our portfolio for large increases in interest rates. And while both of these lowered our investment operating income, we will be well positioned should interest rates rise.
On our second goal we also did very well, which was to improve customer loyalty. Loyalty has three components, as you’ll remember; customer satisfaction, intent to renew and willingness to refer. Obviously all of those are important to future growth. We raised our customer loyalty scores on an absolute basis and improved our relative position to the competition. At Allstate Protection we achieved those results in 13 of our 14 regional operations throughout the U.S. Our agencies also improved their performance in all of our regions. As a result, we were able to share this benefit with the employees by making the maximum contribution to the 401(k) plan, which is tied to customer loyalty.
Finally, on reinventing protection retirement for the consumer, we laid a foundation for growth. We made good progress in improving the value proposition for our high lifetime valued customers, enhancing our service and sales capabilities, and started the development of new products to further differentiate us from the competition. Overall, we had a strong finish to a good year.
Now, Bob will go through the business results.

Turning to Slide 3, property liability net written premium fell 0.4% for the quarter and 2.3% for the year compared to similar periods in 2008. This decline was primarily driven by reductions in units as we intentionally chose to maintain pricing discipline in a highly competitive marketplace. 
That said, when you look at the details by line, there are some trends indicating positive results in the future. Beginning with Allstate brand standard auto, net written premium increased 0.7% in the fourth quarter 2009 compared to the prior year quarter as new issued applications increased 11.4%, quarter over quarter. We issued over 2 million applications for the year, a 12.3% increase year-over-year. Retention increased 0.2 of a point to 88.8% after a similar increase in the third quarter 2009. Average premium climbed 2.6% reflecting our consistent approach to seeking rate changes where needed while providing distribution and product choices for consumers.
Allstate brand homeowner’s net written premium increased 0.9% in fourth quarter 2009 versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Increases in average premium and retention are essentially offset by reductions in units as we continue to manage our exposure to catastrophic losses. We continue to focus on gaining appropriate rate changes in order to bring this line of business back to an acceptable return on capital. During the fourth quarter we received approval for rate changes averaging 6.5% in 22 states, bringing the countrywide impact for the year to 8.4%. The majority of these rate changes will be earned over the next two years.
While the two major lines of business were both slightly improved in the fourth quarter, the primary source of the overall decline in the quarter was business written through Encompass. Efforts to improve the margins here are limiting top line growth as we maintain our philosophy of profitable growth in all areas of our business.
Shifting to a discussion of margins, our overall combined ratio for the quarter was 93.2%, significantly improved from the fourth quarter of 2008. The underlying combined ratio was 88.1% in the quarter and for the entire year, consistent with the range we expected at the beginning of the year. 
In the quarter we recorded $328 million in catastrophe losses, bringing our total for the year to just over $2 billion. The fourth quarter included 13 events for $210 million, a relatively light catastrophe quarter. However, we also experienced $148 million in cat losses related to re-estimates of events that occurred earlier in 2009, offset slightly by a $30 million favorable re-estimate related to prior years. The upward development of these current year events was due primarily to adverse frequency related to hail events that occurred in the southeast. 
As we have done for the last few years, we have provided an outlook for the underlying combined ratio for 2010, a range of 88 to 90%. Remember that this combined ratio outlook excludes the effects of catastrophe losses and prior year reserve re-estimates. This range is a point higher on each end than our outlook for 2009 and reflects a conservative view on the short term trends for auto frequency and non-catastrophe weather losses for homeowners. While higher than the 2009 outlook, it represents an industry leading performance.
On Slide 4 we give you a look at the loss trends for auto. As we expected, reported frequencies for both bodily injury and property damage increased significantly in the fourth quarter compared to prior years. Bodily injury frequency rose 14.4% for the quarter and 13.1% for the year. Property damage frequency increased 7.6% in the quarter and 6.2% for the year. We provided explanations in the past for these large increases primarily related to the significant drop in 2008 frequency levels. While the comparisons are large, the fact is that the level of frequency in 2009 is similar to that recorded in 2007, with bodily injury frequency a little higher in 2009 compared to 2007 levels, and property damage levels a little lower than 2007. That said, we watch and will react appropriately to these trends, incorporating them into our rate indications in order to remain profitable over time.
Auto bodily injury paid severity continues to perform better than anticipated and property damage paid severity is essentially in line with expectations, offsetting to some extent the increases in frequency. The combined effects of frequency and severity or pure premium are well within our pricing expectations and translate into a combined ratio for the quarter of 93.7%, 5.7 points better than the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year we posted a combined ratio for Allstate brand standard auto of 93. [inaudible] %, a 1 point increase compared to 2008. These results complete another year of excellent underwriting margins for auto, indicative of our strong capabilities in marketing, pricing and claims management. We have been operating at these margins or better for the last several years.
The loss cost trends for homeowners continue to be negatively impacted by non-catastrophe weather. Non-cat frequency increased 13.9% from prior year with lightning, wind, hail and water claims being the primary drivers of the increase. Homeowners paid severity declined 8.5% quarter over quarter, reflecting the mix shift in the type of claims paid in the quarter. The combined ratio for the quarter was 89%, up 4.4 points from the fourth quarter of 2008 with catastrophe losses accounting for 9 points of that increase. The results excluding catastrophes were better in the quarter, but we will continue to reach for better returns in the future. We remain focused on gaining approval for appropriate rate changes to return this line to acceptable returns.
On Slide 5 we shift to Allstate Financial results. We generated an operating income of $95 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 7% from the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase was driven by lower DAC amortization and reduced operating expenses, somewhat offset by lower benefit and investment margins. The decline in DAC amortization was due to lower investment spreads and a lower amortization rate resulting from updated assumptions for fixed annuity performance. The reduced operating expenses primarily reflect proactive management actions taken through the Focus to Win restructuring program. As you will recall, the Focus to Win initiative is expected to produce annual cost savings of $90 million. Through the fourth quarter we’ve attained about 90% of the expected annual expense savings, with the remaining reductions to be achieved by 2011.
The benefit spread declined due to higher mortality experience, which as we said last quarter can bounce around a little bit, and non-recurring benefit costs. The lower investment margin was the result of intentionally making higher than normal levels of liquidity affecting the portfolio yield, as well as reduced asset balances, partly offset by lower interest credited on contract holder funds. From the top line perspective, the premium and deposits fell by $401 million to $1.2 billion as we continue to focus on generating acceptable returns and reducing our concentration in spread rate products.
Our focus remains on improving the overall returns to this business while seeking longer term solutions to consumers’ protection and retirement needs. Now I’ll turn it over to Don.

I’ll cover our investment portfolio and results and finish with a look at our capital position. 
During 2009 we generated strong results from our investments with substantially improved portfolio valuations more than offsetting lower investment income. We consistently acted in a proactive way to manage the risks and returns in our investment portfolio and our approach paid off throughout the year. By remaining focused on limiting our exposure to rising interest rates while maintaining our view of credit spreads and taking specific actions to reduce exposure to specific asset classes, we ended 2009 in a strong position.
On Slide 6 you can see a breakdown of our consolidated portfolio. At year end the value of the portfolio was $99.8 billion, a slight decline from September 2009 due to a lower balance in Allstate Financial and the $750 million debt repayment at corporate that we refinanced back in May. Fixed income securities still make up about 80% of the portfolio, with the bulk being high quality corporate and municipal bonds.
During the year we reduced exposure to commercial real estate by $5.4 billion, reduced municipal bond positions by $1.9 billion and reduced our durations by 5% and maintained derivative positions designed to protect against rising interest rates. Our fixed income portfolio continued to generate significant amounts of cash, with $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter, consistent with our track record throughout 2009. We aggressively deployed both these cash receipts in our short term cash position by a further $7 billion for the quarter.
On Slide 7, you’ll see our two year investment transfer income and realized capital gains. Our investment income declined for the fourth quarter, which was down 19% over the prior year but is consistent with the first three quarters of the year. The reasons remain the same, lower yields; our continuing emphasis on maintaining shorter durations in spite of the yield environment; higher levels of liquidity; and reduced average asset balances. For the quarter, we generated realized capital losses of $33 million, a huge improvement over the fourth quarter of 2008. We continued to experience some credit impairments, although it was down to $270 million for the fourth quarter, and we proactively took $215 million of intent writedowns, consistent with our desire to reduce exposure to commercial real estate. Subsequent to year end, we did sell the majority of these securities.
We also generated $390 million in realized capital gains through asset sales. Finally, we had a small net gain on derivatives related to rising interest rates at year end. Unrealized net capital gains and losses are on Slide 8. For the full year 2009, our pretax unrealized loss position improved dramatically from $8.8 billion to $2.3 billion while unrealized losses after tax and DAC showed similar declines from $3.7 billion to $0.9 billion. The primary driver was improved credit spreads during the year. During the fourth quarter, while pretax unrealized losses continued to improve, there was a disproportionate decrease in shadow DAC due to updated assumptions on the investment performance, which resulted in lower DAC amortization rates. While it was a volatile year in the investment markets, our unrealized capital loss position both before and after tax and DAC, are at roughly one-quarter the levels they were at the end of 2008.
Finally, on Slide 9 you can see our capital position for year end 2009 as well as the four preceding quarters. We finished the year with shareholders equity of $16.7 billion, an improvement of approximately $4.1 billion from year end 2008. As a result, book value per share at $30.84 climbed 31% during the year. Statutory surplus for both Allstate insurance and ALIC improved during the year as well, with estimated statutory surplus of $14.9 billion at AIC, inclusive of ALIC. 
Lastly, the holding company continues to maintain high levels of capital, with over $3 billion of capital with which to service our relatively light fixed charges. As a reminder, we continue to have full access to $1 billion of credit facilities which remained unused at year end, and our next corporate debt maturity is about $40 million in 2011, with a total of about $600 million coming due in 2012 and 2013 combined.
In summary, by consistently and proactively focusing on our priorities during 2009, we ended the year not just financially strong but well positioned and confident in our ability to grow our business and deliver shareholder value as we move into 2010 and beyond.

First of all, the shadow DAC to a large extent obviously is driven by the DAC amortization rate. So what we do every quarter, and I’m going to start with the income statement here, we will look at all the facts and circumstances that are available to us. We’ll look at both experience and what we anticipate for the future and then we’ll make a determination of what the proper DAC amortization rate should be for that quarter. And what we’ve done, if you’ll recall, in the third quarter which we followed in the fourth is decided not to recapitalize DAC for realized capital losses so that we did not jeopardize the future recoverability of that.
In the fourth quarter we did update our assumptions including anticipated results related to the fixed annuity investment performance. All that stuff goes into a box and we end up with what is essentially a DAC amortization rate. So that’s why when we talked about the DAC amortization on the income statement, we pointed out that it was lower during the fourth quarter.
And now I’m going to switch to shadow DAC, which of course only goes through OCI and not the income statement. In accordance with GAAP then we’ll take that shadow DAC, we’ll take that DAC amortization rate and apply it to the unrealized loss position on those investments in the portfolio, not all the investments that relate to the unrealized loss but only those relate to the products that we sell that relate to DAC. So let me take a step back. Shadow DAC, if you look at it on a year-over-year basis, it did kind of what you would have expected. So the unrealized loss position went down by about 75% and if you look at it net of tax and shadow DAC, it went down by a very similar amount.
It does move around in the quarters, though, and it moves around because to be honest I don’t think DAC was designed to operate necessarily smoothly in this sort of very volatile environment. So it did move around a bit in the quarter. So I think the answer, though, is we’re comfortable with the numbers on a year-over-year basis and there is some disproportionately in the fourth quarter on shadow DAC but that’s just kind of the outcome of how it works. As it relates to the amortization going forward, obviously because we’re not recapitalizing DAC, not shadow DAC now, talking about DAC on the I’ll call it real DAC, there will be less amortization going forward through the income statement.

What we have is a strategy of making sure we provide our customers the best service possible and offer all of our products and services in the best way with the most experienced people we can. You will see that the number of agencies that we have in the United States has gone down over a couple of years, and that’s due to a couple of things. One is A, as the business gets more competitive and more complex, those agencies need to be larger so that they can have more experienced people in them, whether they sell all let’s say financial products, they sell boat insurance or renters insurance, things beyond auto insurance. So the size and scale of those has increased. 
What you don’t necessarily see in that number is the number of people we have on the street, dedicated to only our products, which includes licensed sales professionals which in fact has gone up throughout that period as well. So we look at it and say how many people do we have working on behalf of our customers? And so you’ll see that that number has gone up. So the number of agencies is a little bit of a construct of just how many contracts do we have out there as opposed to how many people sit in that agency.
In addition, this year we’ve started putting standards in on performance as it relates to the agency loyalty index, which as I said in my earlier comments went up in every region across the country. All of our agencies did a better job for their customers. Those, however, that did not make that transition are leaving our organization. So I don’t see it as a risk to our organization, I see it as a benefit to all those agencies that are doing a great job for their customers. This raises the overall bar and raises our position in the marketplace.

Joe can make a comment about Encompass which you didn’t talk about but also obviously impacts our overall auto results, as Bob talked about.
On the Allstate agencies, I think it’s important to step back and look at the decisions we talked about in 2007 and 2008, which was in the face of what we saw as an upcoming difficulty in the economic environment we decided not to take price decreases in 2007, despite the fact that some of our big competitors were. We didn’t think those price decreases were justified. We didn’t think it was the right thing to do to buy growth and we chose to work on value and not reduce prices to grow. That turned out to be a good choice for us. We didn’t know the economy was going to get as bad as it did, but we’re glad that we have that strong source of profitability.
It also turned out to be a good choice because many of our competitors are now increasing their prices. They started in the second half of ’08 and throughout ’09, so I think in the third quarter, Joe, I think it was about three to one increases to decreases when you look at the industry. He’s nodding acceptance of that. And so that turned out to be a good choice. When you look at the Allstate brand business itself, I would say there are three components you have to look at for growth. One is new business, which as you correctly point is up; two is retention, which is flat basically. But the leading indicator being customer loyalty headed up gives us some confidence that we should be able to move that number up, combined with the fact that our competitors are raising prices, we think that should help us some there as well. The third component which is less obvious is just the trend line. 
And so if you’re down because over that ’07 to ’09 period we did reduce the number of policies we have in force, that trend you’ve got to kind of turn around. We call that availables but you’ve got to do enough on new business, you’ve got to do enough on retention to offset that trend line. You’re starting to see that work its way out so we would hope to be able to see that business begin to grow as Joe pointed out as we move through 2010. Encompass you didn’t ask about, but I think it would be worthwhile to get Joe to give some perspective on that as well.

And we have developed what we have laid out as a six part strategy but I’ll kind of do the 80/20 rule here and focus on just two core pieces of that. The first is that we’re kind of making an all in bet. We believe the pot, the pot of gold here, is the existing Allstate channel and the existing Allstate customers and the ability to leverage the 12,000 storefronts and the mammoth customer base, the 17 million households that we have and supplement that with some worksite. So we are going to refocus and redeploy some of our resources, not necessarily to the exclusion of some of the other channels, but we are certainly going to minimize some of the investments being made in some of the other channels to allow us to really focus on the channel that we think has the greatest long-term opportunity.
And at the same time we’re focusing on that channel, we’re focusing on some different product sets. I think as the last 18 to 24 months have shown, an over concentration in spread based business, specifically book value annuities and some institutional funds, have hurt us. And we are shifting our concentration towards the underwritten products, the mortality and morbidity based products. And to the extent that we need and should offer income preservation products to our customers, we’ll probably do that through a different type of annuity that has a better risk return ratio, such as the market value adjusted annuities. And to the extent that we can get it to work in our environment, through equity indexed annuities that provide strong value to the customers as well as to Allstate.
So what you’ll see is a shift. You’ll see a concentration shift, again away from the spread based business towards the more underwritten products. And you’ll see a shift of resources towards working together with a protection organization and approaching our business here, not as an independent operating entity trying to compete in the vast life and retirement space, but to build enterprise value, working in conjunction with the rest of the organization, that we think actually gives us far greater leverage, a greater competitive advantage and a greater likelihood of success.

This quarter’s operational financial results were really a combination of the trends in progress we made throughout 2009. We had strong profitability in auto insurance. The homeowners business continued to underperform as we experienced near-record catastrophe losses, Allstate Financial made further progress in reinventing its strategic focus, and our investment results continued to reflect low interest rate, but improving fixed income markets.
The net results were we generated $375 million of operating income and $120 million of net income as you can see on slide 2. The overall combined ratio was 98.9. The underlying combined ratio excludes the catastrophe losses in prior-year reserve re-estimates was 89.1, which is right in the middle of our full-year forecast of 88 to 90.
Investment income was $1.1 billion. That’s 10.7% lower than Q1 2009, which primarily reflects two things; lower short-term interest rates and risk mitigation efforts we have taken to protect the portfolio from large economic losses if interest rates increase. Our turn optimization programs served us well as the unrealized loss on $100 billion investment portfolio decreased from$2.3 billion at year-end 2009 to about $850 million at the end of March 2010. This improvement reflects our decision to stay long in corporate credit and the continued decline in corporate credit spreads.
As a result of all of that, book value per share was up 42% over the last 12 months, an increase of 5% during the first quarter. The operating results underneath these numbers also reflects steady progress on our goal of creating shareholder value by raising returns in homeowners in Allstate Financial and growing our businesses. We are staying focused on improving returns in homeowners through a comprehensive set of profit improvement initiatives. We have tightened our underwriting guidelines, reducing market share on highly volatile areas, restructured reinsurance programs and continually evaluated our claims practices.
We have raised pricing so that average premiums are up 7% this quarter over the first quarter of last year. In addition, this quarter we received approval for price increases in another six states of that average about 7%. The weather however continued to outrun the benefits to these initiatives, so we have more work to do. Our goal is turn the homeowners business into a competitive advantage instead of a burden on returns.
Allstate Financial made progress in raising returns by discontinuing sales of its fixed annuities to financial institutions at the end of the quarter. It is also now about 93% of the way home and is focused to win expense reduction initiative. We will grow our auto business by keeping more of our existing customers and increasing new business. We do well on raising customer loyalty, which increased for the fifth quarter in a row and should drive higher retention rates. Retention was up versus last year’s first quarter, but was flat to the preceding quarter.
New business was up slightly, reflecting declines in Florida and California, and Encompass business also declined due to profitability initiatives. Average premium essentially offset the decline in overall units.
Looking forward, we have to stay focused on increasing items in force to drive long-term growth. Allstate Financial’s Workplace business continues to grow rapidly and is now the second largest domestic insurance provider of voluntary products at the worksite. We are also well along the path of launching several new products this year, both for Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial, which will be supported by new marketing programs.
Let me now have Bob take you through the operating results in greater detail.

Turning to slide 3, we provided premium and underwriting trends for property liability. Starting with the topline, total net written premium fell slightly in the first quarter about $11 million to $6.258 billion. This was driven primarily by p",943,"Thanks Don. Turning to slide 3, we provided premium and underwriting trends for property liability. Starting with the topline, total net written premium fell slightly in the first quarter about $11 million to $6.258 billion. This was driven primarily by profit improvement actions in our Encompass brand, included in all other line on the slide where net premium fell by $71 million. Allstate standard auto net written premium grew 1.1% to just over $4 billion. An increase in average premium more than offset a decline in units.
After a strong year in 2009 for new business, our new issued applications fell in the first quarter of 2010. Profit actions taken in Florida and California significantly reduced the new business flows in those two states. Partially offsetting those declines were increases in new business flows for most of the states where we introduced enhanced discounts for our multiline customers. Retention, a key metric, increased by two-tenths of a point compared to the first quarter of 2009 and about the same improvement we saw in the last two quarters of 2009.
Allstate brand homeowners premium increased by 1.5% in the quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2009. Increases in average premiums driven by rate actions that we have taken over the last year more than offset declines in units. We will continue to seek rate changes in order to drive this line to acceptable margins.
On the bottom half of this slide, we give the combined ratio trends. Our overall combined ratio for the first quarter was 98.9, an increase from first quarter of 2009 of 2.1 points. Catastrophe losses accounted for 10 points of the combined ratio versus 7.8 points in the first quarter of 2009. Prior-year reserve re-estimates excluding those affecting catastrophe losses were favorable in 2010 whereas they were slightly unfavorable in the first quarter of 2009. The net result, our underlying combined ratio finished the quarter at 89.1%, two-tenths of a point higher than prior year in right in the middle of our annual outlook range of 88 to 90.
A word on catastrophe losses for 2010. At $648 million this quarter represents the worst first quarter Cat loss since 1994. In fact, we have experienced three straight years of elevated catastrophe losses in the first quarter of the year. About half of the quarter’s estimated losses occurred in the month of March, including one weather pattern that affected almost half the country and is estimated to cost $250 million.
Slide 4 provides a look at the components of loss costs for auto. Property damage frequency was down slightly in the quarter, despite the weather we experienced in the quarter. Bodily injury frequency increased over 5% in the quarter, a trend we are carefully watching. Paid severities for both bodily injury and (inaudible) 1.3% and property damage at only 0.4% increase were well within the expectations, and in the case of bodily injury helped to mitigate some of the increase in frequency.
The combined ratio for the Allstate brand standard auto came in at 94.4%, 1.1 point higher than the 93.3% posted in the first quarter of 2009 and essentially in the same range it has been for the last five quarters. The loss trends for homeowners shown in slide 5 are mixed this quarter. Excluding catastrophe losses, claim frequency continues to increase, reflecting the influence of non-Cat weather. Offsetting this trend, paid severity, excluding the impact of catastrophes declined in the quarter. Given the way increases taken in the last few years, the combined ratio excluding catastrophes declined in the quarter by 5.1 points. We will continue to seek rate changes designed to improve the margins in this line of business.
On slide 6, we switch the focus to Allstate Financial results for the quarter. And as Tom mentioned, we are moving to improve returns to this business, by reducing the concentration of spread-based business and focusing on mortality and morbidity business. The top half of the slide depicts premium and deposits activity for the last five quarters. In total, the volume was down to $1.1 billion from $1.53 billion last year. But underwritten products, interest-sensitive life, traditional life and accident and health grew by $102 million. About half of this growth came from Allstate Workplace Division where we have made good progress penetrating the large employer segment.
The decline in bank deposits reflects the fact that we held the savings account promotion in the first quarter of 2009 and did not get that repeat that this year. The bottom half of the slide shows the income results. We had a small net income in the quarter versus a loss in the first quarter of 2009 of $327 million. Operating income of $139 million in the quarter was an increase of $54 million over the previous year’s results. The increase of operating income was due to lower DAC amortization including lower amortization rate on fixed annuities and the unlock. As is our practice, we completed a detailed study of our deferred acquisition costs to the term and if an unlock assumption was appropriate, this unlock had a favorable impact on operating income in 2010 of $26 million, while last year’s unlock in the first quarter was a favorable $15 million.
The total impact of the DAC unlock on 2010 net income was a favorable $8 million. The investment spread increased almost 28% from prior year due to lower deferred sales induced from amortization partially offset by lower net investment income. The benefits spread declined slightly on unfavorable mortality experience, offset by the growth in the accident and health products.
With that, I will turn it over to Don.

On slide 7, the total value of our investments finished",521,"Thanks Bob. First, I will cover our investment performance and conclude with a quick review of our capital position. In the first quarter, we continued to proactively manage our investment portfolio. On slide 7, the total value of our investments finished the quarter at just over $100 billion. Fixed income securities remained the largest portion of the portfolio at $81 billion, an increase of $2.5 billion. Strategically, we maintained a significant exposure to corporate credit, which again proved to be the right call as market conditions improved and fixed income spreads narrowed.
Consistent with our economic outlook, we continue to reduce our exposure to commercial real estate and municipal bonds with both asset classes declining in the quarter from year-end 2009. Municipals were reduced by $1.3 billion of amortized costs, primarily through net sales which resulted in a small trading gain, the commercial real estate portfolio made up of mortgage loans, CMBS and real estate funds declined by $0.6 billion of amortization costs, partly due to our aggressive pursuit of mortgage loan payoffs, and we did reduce our equity allocation during the quarter by $1.4 billion of costs as part of a repositioning of the portfolio.
On slide 8, we lay out the investment income and realized capital gains loss trends for the last five quarters. Investment income fell 10.7% versus Q1 2009 as we maintained our defensive stance relative to rising interest rates. Realized net capital losses were $348 million for the first quarter, about the same level as in Q1 2009, but the makeup of this result was very different from last year. OTTI impairments of $255 million were $470 million less than Q1 2009. Gains from sales were significantly less than in the first quarter of 2009 to $88 million, derivative generated to $185 million loss as macro hedges against interest rate and equity market tail risks remained in place throughout the quarter one as expected. Limited partnerships performed much better this quarter, posting a small gain versus a substantial loss in Q1 2009.
On slide 9, we provide the details of unrealized net capital gains and losses position at the end of the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, narrowing credit spreads improved our fixed income valuation by $1.3 billion and the rising equity markets benefited our position by about $200 million compared to year-end 2009. On an after-tax and DAC basis, we now have only a small net loss of $84 million, $3.7 billion better than a year-ago March.
Finally, on slide 10, you can see our capital position, which now stands $17.6 billion on a GAAP basis. That’s a $5.4 billion increase from March 2009. Book value per share rose to $32.26, an increase of 42.4% from Q1 2009 and 4.6% from year-end 2009. Asset to the holding company level remained at $3 billion and our estimated statutory surplus results were roughly unchanged from year-end 2009.
So, in summary, our financial position today is significantly improved from a year-ago. Our proactive management of risk mitigation and return on optimization continues to pay off for us and our shareholders.
With that, I will turn back to Tom.

The advertising, this business has become much more marketing-driven over the last, really since 2002 when we began to - Geico and Progress at that point were spending somewhere around a couple of hundred million dollars a year and we were spending less than that. And if you remember, in 2003, we said we were going to step away up and that really began a series of competitive responses which leave marketing as a significant in which this business competes today, besides just price. So, it’s - what you see over a long period of time is that the bigger players who advertise a lot tend to grow faster than those that do not.
So, whether you look at the top 10 or you look at the heavy advertisers. So, I think you should expect to continue to see advertising be a successful and ever-increasing weapon used to grow. Sometimes, Bob, people confuse advertising with channel, that’s it big advertising that drives. It certainly got to be competitive, you need to have all the different channels, so you need to do it with people, you need to do it through call centers, you need to do it over the Internet, but what you will see is continued high levels of spend this year. I can’t speak for our competitors, but looking at the airways, it looks like they are spending about what they did last year at Progressive or at Geico. Progressive seems like it dialed up a little bit with flow, and we have been recently steady in the first part of this year as we seek to reposition some of our advertising towards our target customers and talk more about longer-term value. Last year, we spent a lot of time on price, which we needed to do because of our silence on price before that, we would perceive this too high, not longer, we brought that measure way down.
So, we are shifting our focus, I mean, you should expect to continue to see us be aggressive in advertising as we go throughout this year.

And we had a couple of states where we had to temper that a little bit in the first part of this year and really a little bit in the last part of the fourth quarter of last year. That slowing in new business is helping drag down that PIP number a little bit. We do believe that that’ a near-term issue and are actively continuing on all the initiatives that Tom touched on and a number of more to improve customer loyalty and improve retention to make our value proposition clear in the marketplace and the competitiveness of our products cleared to drive crisper advertising message with focused spend there to drive callers and shoppers into our different distribution channels and potential new product initiatives later in the year. So, we are confident we are moving in the right direction, but you see near-term slowing.
We are adding a fair amount of initiatives with PPD [ph] discounts and targeting our model on homeowners’ customers.

We work hard at trying to maintain our relationships with our customers. So, in Florida, for example, we went from a double-digit market share in homeowners to around 2.5% to 3% I think now is where we are at, yet at the same time, our market share went up, that was around 13% or something like that. So, we were able to manage our way through it in part by offering customers homeowners products that are provided by other people. So, we maintain that strong relationship between our agency owners, so that they are still covered just not on our books.
So, we have been able to do that. The other item that Joe was referring to is the economies of PPD, which is a discount for people who have their home insurance and their car insurance with us and we have about 3 million homeowners who do not buy car insurance from us. It is our goal to have each and every one of those buy auto insurance, it really makes no sense to have a lower turn business for good customers and have Geico or Progressive take the high return of auto business. So, we have dramatically changed the discounts, increased them for those customers. So, when we go out to somebody and we say, hey Josh, the bad news is your homeowner insurance went from $1,000 a year to $1,150 a year, so you are up 15%. That’s the bad news. The good news is, is our discount is much higher on auto insurance. So, if you were to move your cars to us, we can package it together and maybe we can save your money in total.
That’s the program that Joe has talked about that is being very successful today. Not only will help us improve our homeowner business by getting the right prices there, but it gives us good solid auto business, which then has great retention to it, because we have everything with them.

Of course, sometimes you make people made at you, we call it, don’t offer continuing coverage as opposed to non-renewed. But if we don’t offer them continuing coverage, sometimes they get mad about that, but if you do it in the right way, we actually help them shop. We give them different alternatives. So, we have found that we have been able to maintain that balance. And have been doing that really since 2005. So, we have got a lot of experience built into the system as how to do that.

We have been working on those initiatives over the last several quarters and with success. We have the temper. Some of that new business drive a little bit in the late fourth quarter and the early part of this year.

Paul, when you look at the non-standard business, we grew that business very rapidly a decade ago. We were actually at one point in the late 90s selling more non-standard than we were standard insurance on our weekly basis. Unfortunately, that business was mispriced and so, in about 2001, we began to reduce that book of business. And so, you will see actually our market share in policy count start to go down which was the intention on our product, because we were losing money. In 2004, we had to make a choice between whether we wanted to prioritize Your Choice Auto or growth in non-standard.
At that point in the cycle, we thought prioritizing Your Choice Auto was the right thing to do. So, we did that and of course we are now I think over 5 million Your Choice Auto policies, which has really helped stabilize and protect that standard auto book. At the same time, then later in, it was about 2007 or 2008, we rolled out Allstate Blue, which was a restaged, more consumer-friendly, non-standard product, obviously targeted towards high-risk drivers, that the growth in that business is in the new state has been good, but it has not been enough to overcome the continued slide down in the non-standard business. So, the net of all that is that businesses a fraction of what it used to be, which is the bad news. The good news is that is an opportunity for us to grow. It shouldn’t continue to go down. It has become such a small piece of the overall book, but it doesn’t actually impact the total book anymore which is a bad thing from our standpoint, because it’s a good customer segment we have to figure out how to go after. So, that’s work that is underway. So, maybe you want to jump in, Joe, and talk about specifically what non-standard (inaudible).

There is some element of the non-standard marketplace that it’s not appropriate to sort of interact with it on a most customer-friendly orientation. There is a lot of complexity inside of that business in the operating model to make it run effectively and profitably, it’s somewhat different than you need in a standard and preferred marketplace. We are using our current programs now to sort of expand from our core, we will take the learnings there and leverage them to gradually and thoughtfully expand into that long-term attractive markets. But it won’t be at the pace that you saw us do it last time.
Relative to Encompass, Encompass’ core business was a homeowners’ bundle business for relatively higher network in sort of the medium or middle-income America, and we are going to bring that business near term back to its core. We tried for a while to expand more significantly in that brand to a standard and near-standard auto play. And it didn’t match the distribution channel position that we had, the shelf space that we were occupying inside of agent’s offices and our operational capabilities weren’t as well matched to that as they needed to be. The core product offerings, the core niche of that business has provided to independents agents. It’s a good one a strong one and we are going to adjust our execution and focus around that and then build from there which you are going to see near term. It’s a continued retrenchment if you will to fix some of those items that will last for a couple of more quarters as we get refocused.

So, without giving you a revenue guidance, you can look at those rate increases and you can look at the ones that we have received approval for, which will roll themselves forward. There should be some continued movement on pricing, and we are not just one renewal cycle or one pricing cycle away from getting the returns where we want and need to them to be, and we are committed to using our homeowners business as a competitive advantage and not as a burden on returns.

I am just wondering one way, back to the early question of testing growth and so forth, is there - you need to think a little bit about expanding the appetite a little bit, meaning there has been throughout I guess, it has been closer, there is focus on high lifetime value, and maybe Joe obviously at this past employer let him through an expansion of appetite. I am wondering if that’s something you are thinking about that. I am not saying you are pushing on standard or anything but you need to be sort of expand the target range a little bit, because it seems like the Geicos and the Progressives are trying to creep up from their most inner customer towards your more preferred, do you need to restart that a little bit to get that growth?

18711,99159588,59388,"Allstate Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","The Allstate Corporation","Executives","Thanks, for joining us today and your continuing interest in Allstate. I'll share my thoughts on the results for the quarter, putting them in context of the programs we put in place over the last couple of years and looking forward for the priorities we h",658,"Thanks, for joining us today and your continuing interest in Allstate. I'll share my thoughts on the results for the quarter, putting them in context of the programs we put in place over the last couple of years and looking forward for the priorities we have in place for 2010. And then Bob is going to go through the business unit results and Don will cover investments and our financial position, then we'll get to your questions.
This quarter's operational financial results were really a combination of the trends and progress we made throughout 2009. We had strong profitability in Auto Insurance. The Homeowners business continued to underperform as we experienced near-record catastrophe losses. Allstate Financial made further progress in reinventing its strategic focus. And our investment results continued to reflect low interest rates but improving fixed income markets.
The net result, we generated $375 million of operating income and $120 million of net income, as you can see on Slide 2. The overall combined ratio was 98.9. The underlying combined ratio excludes the catastrophe losses in prior-year reserve re-estimates, was 89.1, which is right in the middle of our full-year forecast of 88 to 90. Investment income was $1.1 billion. That's 10.7% lower than Q1 2009, which primarily reflects two things: Lower short-term interest rates and risk mitigation efforts we've taken to protect the portfolio from large economic losses if interest rates increase.
Our return optimization programs served us well as the unrealized loss on $100 billion investment portfolio decreased from $2.3 billion at year-end 2009 to about $850 million at the end of March 2010. This improvement reflects our decision to stay along corporate credit and the continued decline in corporate credit spreads. As a result of all of that, our book value per share was up 42% over the last 12 months and increased 5% during the first quarter.
The operating results underneath these numbers also reflect steady progress on our goal of creating shareholder value by raising returns in Homeowners in Allstate Financial and growing our businesses. 
We are staying focused on improving returns in Homeowners through a comprehensive set of profit improvement initiatives. We've tightened our underwriting guidelines, reduced market share in highly volatile areas, restructured reinsurance programs and continually evaluated our claims practices. We've raised pricing so that average premiums are up 7% this quarter over the first quarter of last year.
In addition, this quarter we received approval for price increases in another six states of an average of about 7%. The weather, however, continue to outrun the benefits of these initiatives so we have more work to do. Our goal is to turn the Homeowners business into a competitive advantage instead of a burden on returns. Allstate Financial made progress in raising returns by discontinuing sales of its fixed annuities to financial institutions at the end of the quarter. It is also now about 93% of the way home on its focus to win expense-reduction initiatives.
We will grow our Auto business by keeping more of our existing customers and increasing new business. We did well on raising customer loyalty, which increased for the fifth quarter in a row and should drive higher retention rates. Retention was up versus last year's first quarter but was flat for the preceding quarter. New business was up slightly, reflecting declines in Florida and California. Our Encompass business also declined due to profitability initiatives. Average premium essentially offset the decline in overall units.
Looking forward, we have to stay focused on increasing items and force to drive long-term growth. Allstate Financial's Workplace business continues to grow rapidly and is now the second-largest domestic insurance provider of voluntary products at the work site. We're also well along the path of launching several new products this year, both for Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial, which will be supported by new marketing programs. 
Let me now have Bob take you through the operating results in greater detail."

Turning to Slide 3, we provide premium and underwriting trends for property liability. Starting with the top line, total net written premium fell slightly in the first quarter by $11 million to $6,258,000,000. This was driven primarily by pro",931,"Thanks, Tom. Turning to Slide 3, we provide premium and underwriting trends for property liability. Starting with the top line, total net written premium fell slightly in the first quarter by $11 million to $6,258,000,000. This was driven primarily by profit improvement actions in our Encompass brand, included in the all other line on the slide where net premium fell by $71 million.
Allstate Standard Auto net written premium grew 1.1% to just over $4 billion. An increase in average premium more than offset a decline in units. After a strong year-end 2009 for New business, our new issued applications fell in the first quarter of 2010. Profit actions taken in Florida and California significantly reduced the new business flows in those two states.
Partially offsetting those declines were increases in new business flows for most of the states where we introduced enhanced discounts for our multi-line customers. Retention, a key metric, increased by 0.20% of a point compared to the first quarter 2009, and about the same improvement we saw in the last two quarters of 2009. 
Allstate brand homeowner premium increased by 1.5% in the quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2009. Increases in average premium driven by rate actions that we've taken over the last year more than offset declines in units.  We will continue to see great changes in order to drive this line to acceptable margins. 
On the bottom half of this slide, we give the combined ratio trends. Our overall combined ratio for the first quarter was 98.9%, an increase from first quarter 2009 of 2.1 points. Catastrophe losses accounted for 10 points of the combined ratio versus 7.8 points in the first quarter 2009.
Prior-year reserve re-estimates, excluding those affecting catastrophe losses, were favorable in 2010 whereas they were slightly unfavorable in the first quarter of 2009. The net result, our underlying combined ratio, finished the quarter at 89.1%, $0.20 of a point higher than prior year and right in the middle of our annual outlook range of 88% to 90%. 
A word on catastrophe losses for 2010. At $648 million this quarter, represents the worst first quarter Cat loss since 1994. In fact, we have experienced three straight years of elevated catastrophe losses in the first quarter of the year. About half of the quarter's estimated losses occurred in the month of March, including one weather pattern that affected almost half the country and is estimated across $250 million.
Slide 4 provides a look at the components of lost cost per auto. Property damage frequency was down slightly in the quarter despite the weather we experienced in the quarter. Bodily Injury frequency increased over 5% in the quarter, a trend we are carefully watching. Paid severities for both bodily injury at minus 1.3% and property damage at only 0.4% increase were well within the expectations, and in the case of Bodily Injury, helped to mitigate some of the increase in frequency. The combined ratio for the Allstate brands Standard Auto came in at 94.4%, 1.1 points higher than the 93.3% posted in the first quarter of 2009, and essentially in the same range it has been for the last five quarters.
The loss trends for homeowners shown on Slide 5 are mixed this quarter. Excluding catastrophe losses, claim frequency continues to increase, reflecting the influence of non-Cat weather. Offsetting this trend, paid severity, excluding the impact of catastrophes, declined in the quarter. Given the rate increases taken in the last two years, the combined ratio excluding catastrophes declined in the quarter by 5.1 points. We will continue to see great changes designed to improve the margins in this line of business.
On Slide 6, we switched the focus to Allstate financial results for the quarter. As Tom mentioned, we're moving to improve returns to this business by reducing the concentration of spread-based business and focusing on Mortality and Morbidity business. The top half of the slide depicts premium and deposits activity for the last five quarters. In total, the volume was down to $1.1 billion from $1.53 billion last year. But underwritten products, interest-sensitive life, traditional life and accident health grew by $102 million. About half of this growth came from Allstate workplace division, where we have made good progress penetrating the large employer segment.  The decline in bank deposits reflects the fact that we held a savings account promotion the first quarter 2009 and did not repeat that this year. 
The bottom half of the slide shows the income result. We had a strong net income in the quarter versus a loss in the first quarter of 2009 of $327 million. Operating income of $139 million in the quarter was an increase of $54 million over the previous year's results. The increase in operating income was due to lower DAC amortization, including a lower amortization rate on fixed annuities and the unlock. As is our practice, we completed a detailed study of our deferred acquisition costs to determine if an unlock of assumption was appropriate. This unlock had a favorable impact on operating income in 2010 of $26 million while last year's unlock in the first quarter was a favorable $15 million.  The total impact of the DAC unlock on 2010 net income was a favorable $8 million. 
The investment spread increased almost 28% from prior year due to lower deferred sales and induced amortization, partially offset by a lower net investment income. The benefit spread declined slightly on unfavorable mortality experience, offset by the growth in the accident and health products. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Don."

First, I'll cover our investment performance and conclude with a quick review of our capital position. In the first quarter, we continued to proactively manage our investment portfolio. On Slide 7, the total value of our investments finished",522,"Thanks, Bob.  First, I'll cover our investment performance and conclude with a quick review of our capital position. In the first quarter, we continued to proactively manage our investment portfolio. On Slide 7, the total value of our investments finished the quarter at just over $100 billion. Fixed income securities remained the largest portion of the portfolio at $81 billion, an increase of $2.5 billion. Strategically, we maintained a significant exposure to corporate credit, which again proved to be the right call as market conditions improved and fixed income spreads narrow.
Consistent with our economic outlook, we continue to reduce our exposure to commercial real estate and municipal bonds with both asset classes declining in the quarter from year-end 2009.  Municipals were reduced by $1.3 billion of amortized costs, primarily through net sales which resulted in a small trading gain. The commercial real estate portfolio, made up of mortgage loans, CMBS and real estate funds, declined by $0.6 billion of amortized cost, partly due to our aggressive pursuit of mortgage loan payoffs. And we did reduce our equity allocation during the quarter by $1.4 billion of cost as part of our repositioning of the portfolio.
On Slide 8, we lay out the investment income and realized capital gains loss trends for the last five quarters. Investment income fell 10.7% versus Q1 2009 as we maintained our defensive stance relative to rising interest rates. 
Realized net capital losses were $348 million for the first quarter, about the same level as in Q1 2009, but the makeup of this result was very different from last year. OTTI impairments of $255 million were $470 million less than Q1 2009. Gains from sales were significantly less than in the first quarter of 2009 to $88 million. 
Derivative generated $185 million loss as macro hedges against interest rate and equity market tail risks remained in place throughout the quarter and performed as expected.  The limited partnerships performed much better this quarter, posting a small gain versus a substantial loss in Q1 2009. 
On Slide 9, we provide the details of unrealized net capital gains losses position at the end of the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, narrowing credit spreads improved our fixed income valuation by $1.3 billion, and the rising equity markets benefited our position by about $200 million compared to year-end 2009. On an after-tax and DAC basis, we have now have only a small net loss of $84 million, $3.7 billion better than a year-ago March. 
Finally, on Slide 10, you can see our capital position, which now stands at $17.6 billion on a GAAP basis. That's a $5.4 billion increase for March 2009. Book value per share rose to $32.26, an increase of 42.4% from Q1 2009 and 4.6% from year-end 2009.  Assets at the holding company level remained at $3 billion and our estimated statutory surplus results were roughly unchanged from year-end 2009. 
So in summary, our financial position today is significantly improved from a year ago. Our proactive management of risk mitigation and return optimization continues to pay off for us and our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Tom."

This business has become much more marketing driven over the last, really, since 2002 when we began -- GEICO and Progressive where at that point we're spending somewhere around $200 million a year, and we were spending less than that. And you remember in 2003, we said we're going to step it way up, and it really began a series of competitive responses, which lead marketing as a significant way in which this business competes today, besides just price. And what you see over a long period of time is that the bigger players who advertise a lot tend to grow faster than those that do not. So whether you look at the top 10 or you look at the heavy advertisers. So I think you should expect to continue to see advertising be a successful and ever-increasing weapon used to grow. Sometimes, Bob, people confuse advertising with channels, that it's big advertising that drives it. Certainly, you got to be competitive, you need to have all the different channels, so you need to do it with people, you need to do it through call centers, you need to go over the Internet. But what you'll see is continued high levels of spend this year. I can't speak for our competitors but from looking at the airwaves, it looks like they're spending about what they did last year at GEICO. Progressive seems like its dialed up a little bit with flow. And we've been reasonably steady in the first part of this year. As we seek to reposition some of our advertising to be towards our target customers and talk more about longer-term value.

And we had a couple of states where we had to temper that a little bit in the first part of this year and really, a little bit in the last part of the fourth quarter last year. That slowing in new business is helping drag down that PIP number a little bit.

We worked hard at trying to maintain our relationship with our customers. So in Florida, for example, we went from a double-digit market share in Homeowners to around 2.5% to 3%, I think now is where we're at. Yet at the same time, our market share went up, and that was around 13% or something like that. So we were able to manage our way through it in part by offering customers homeowners products that are provided by other people. So we maintain that strong relationship between our agency owners, so that they are still covered. It's Just not on our books. So we've been able to do that. The other item that Joe was referring to is, the acronym PPD [ph], which is a discount for people who have their home insurance and their car insurance with us. And we have about 3 million homeowners who do not buy car insurance from us. It is our goal to have each and every one of those buy auto insurance from us. It really makes no sense to have a lower turn business for good customers and have GEICO or Progressive take the high return of Auto business. So we've have dramatically changed the discounts, increase them, for those customers. So, when we go out to somebody and we say, hey Josh, the bad news is your homeowner insurance went from $1,000 a year to $1,150 a year, so you're up 15%. That's the bad news. The good news is our discount is much higher on auto insurance. So, if you were to move your cars to us, we can package it together and maybe we can save your money in total.  That's the program that Joe has talked about that is being very successful today. Not only will help us improve our Homeowner business by getting the right prices there. It gives us good solid Auto business, which then has great retention to it, because we have everything with them. So it's sort of a win-win deal."

And he can certainly talk about Encompass as well. Paul, when you look at the Non-Standard business, we grew that business very rapidly a decade ago. We were actually at one point in the late 90s selling more Non-standard than we were Standard insurance on our weekly basis. Unfortunately, that business was mispriced. And so about 2001, we began to reduce that book of business. And so, you'll see actually our market share and policy count start to go down, which was the intention on our part, because we were losing money. In 2004, we had to make a choice between whether we wanted to prioritize Your Choice Auto or growth in Non-standard. At that point in the cycle, we thought prioritizing Your Choice Auto was the right thing to do. So we did that and of course we are now I think over 5 million Your Choice Auto policies, which has really helped stabilize and protect that standard auto book. At the same time, then later in, it was about 2007 or 2008, we rolled out Allstate Blue, which was a restaged, more consumer-friendly, non-standard product, obviously targeted towards high-risk drivers, that the growth in that business is in the new state has been good, but it has not been enough to overcome the continual slide down in the Non-Standard business. So the net of all that is that business is a fraction of what it used to be, which is the bad news. The good news is that is an opportunity for us to grow. It shouldn't continue to go down. It has become such a small piece of the overall book, it doesn't actually impact the total book anymore which is a bad thing from our standpoint, because it's a good customer segment we have to figure out how to go after. So that is work that is underway. So maybe you want to jump in, Joe, and talk about specifically non-standard,

It is related to weather, it's been very difficult to prove. We've tried for years to do that. But it gets difficult even if you use meteorological data, by the amount of rainfall, amount of snow. We built all kinds of algorithms on it, but it mattered if you get freezing rain at 2 a.m., it's different than if you get it at 3:30 p.m. because people on the road at 3:30 p.m., there's not time to clean it up.

We are the only people in the industry who do it, we sell it, it is a -- we did it because it is a differentiated product. We never expected that it would drive growth off the top of the charts. It was really about giving customers what they want, helping them understand the products better. So it's simply packaged, it helps them remember what they have, do they have gold, platinum or did they go with the value products. So they don't get all hung up and clause to Page 3 of the contract. So being customer-focused, building the products around them, it did lead to -- we believe it led to incremental growth, although trying to prove that is a little difficult because we obviously sell a lot of auto insurance every year anyway. We do know that we sold more up than down as we got into the program, so that average premiums were up and we do know that retention was better for those people because they knew what they had and they thought the sales process are better. As we move through this current recession, one of the great benefits of that product is we've seen a -- if you look over from really, I think it was about middle of last - middle of, maybe it was even end of '08 through the end of '09. The number of people moving from platinum down to either gold, standard or value just went up. And so what that shows is we have a relationship and a product structure that enables us to work with our customers overtime in a way that's simple, that they understand, that enables them to manage their premiums, which they've had to do in this economic recession. So I would say that it serves the purposes. We never thought that it was -- competitors don't give up their customers willingly. This is not a high turnover business in general. So it's not like you buy a new cup of coffee every day but most of people try to stay with us. So it worked around retention, it's got a lot of retention features built into it. But I would echo what Joe said, is that as we look forward, those people who like Your Choice Auto tended to be those people who don't shop as much. As we expand more marketing, we need to expand to those people who are shopping more, which is the challenge that he and his team have in front of him now."

We do it a couple of ways. One is we're good at what we do and second, we just take action and move forward. So we do have three priorities here: Improving customer loyalty; growing our businesses; and then reinventing protection retirements, so that we differentiate ourselves versus the competitors. When we do that, that will end up in reducing volatility, raising returns and growing the business, which will end up driving shareholder value.

We appreciate your continuing interest in Allstate. I'll begin with an overview of our results for the quarter. Bob will then discuss the details of the business unit results, and Don will cover our investment performance and balance sheet position. Then we'll get to your questions. 
Our results for the second quarter are continuation of the positive momentum we established over the last year and a half despite the ever present volatility of weather in the financial markets. We generated $441 million of operating income or $0.81 per share, a sizable increase over last year's results, reflecting lower catastrophe losses as you can see on Slide 2. You'll remember that last year, we had record second quarter catastrophe losses. 
In Allstate Protection, the combined ratio was 96.8, 3.2 points below the second quarter of 2009. The underlying combined ratio of 88.1 remains in line with our annual guidance of 88 to 90. Allstate Financial continue to take positive steps towards its goal of raising returns while repositioning the business.
Operating income was $125 million for the quarter. Investments generated strong returns, reflecting our risk mitigation and return optimization strategies. Net investment income flattened sequentially as portfolio yields stabilized. Valuations improved as declining interest rates more than offset wider credit spreads.
We produced $145 million in net income, a decline from last year's second quarter results due primarily to realized capital losses from our risk mitigation programs, which were more than offset with unrealized gains in the portfolio. We ended the quarter with $400 million net unrealized gain on the investment portfolio versus unrealized losses of $849 million three months ago and a $7.3 billion unrealized loss one year ago. 
As a result of all of our efforts this quarter, our book value per share increased 3% from March 2010, almost 8% from the beginning of the year and 19% from Q2 2009. We remained focus on our priorities for 2010, and our operating results show continued progress in executing our strategies. 
Our Auto business continues to generate excellent returns. While many of our standard Auto growth initiatives are working, they're not generating enough volume yet to increase overall policies enforced. Our new business trends are improving as we continue to refine our product and price offerings to our targeted customer segments. We feel particularly good about our cross-line sales efforts as Bob will discuss. 
Offsetting these positives is a reduction in the size of Encompass and our California Auto business, as well as lower growth in Florida. Homeowners' profitability remains a challenge as catastrophe losses remained above average this quarter, though not as high as last year. We have made progressed and remained focused on improving returns in this line of business. Consequently, we will continue to see price increases, tightened underwriting standards and work to build more sophisticated risk management tools.
As you know, our strategies to improve the returns in Allstate Financial include reducing the spread-based business by exiting some distribution channels, focusing on the Allstate customer base and expanding our Websize [ph] business. We made good progress in all of these areas.
Looking forward, we must stay focused on our goal to generate long-term profitable growth. We will achieve this by retaining more of our existing customers while continuing to increase new business. Our focus on improving customer loyalty is designed to do that, which is to drive improvements in retention and referrals. Our customer loyalty index results, however, slipped slightly this quarter as did those of the entire industry. Focusing on the customer, however, remains the key strategy in our efforts to grow profitably. Therefore, we will continue to introduce new products, new prices and new marketing support to help us win at the local level.
With that, let me turn it back over to Bob for a more in-depth look at the operating results."
18711,99159598,72495,"Allstate Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-05-2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","The Allstate Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. On Slide 3, we show the premium and underwriting income trends for Property-Liability. For the quarter, we experienced modest top line growth while maintaining our underlying margins within the range of our annual outlook. Total net premium",990,"Thanks, Tom. On Slide 3, we show the premium and underwriting income trends for Property-Liability. For the quarter, we experienced modest top line growth while maintaining our underlying margins within the range of our annual outlook. 
Total net premium written increased slightly to $6.64 billion from the second quarter 2009. The increases in Allstate brand Auto and Homeowners net premium written were partly offset by declines in our Encompass brand. Allstate brand Standard Auto net premium written grew 1.9% in the quarter. Increases in the average premium driven by rate actions taken over the last few quarters more than offset the decline in overall unit volume.
New business volume increased 0.4% quarter-over-quarter, and was up 14.3% if you exclude Florida and California, as profit improvement actions in those two markets mask the positive results of growth initiatives targeted at our customer segments, which are gaining traction in the local market level. For example, our efforts to cross sell autos to our monoline property customers is progressing nicely. Both the close rate and the quality of the business is better than average. We are exploring more ways to improve the effectiveness of our cross-sell processes. 
Auto retention remained level at 89%, after increasing slightly in the first quarter. So while new business volume increased, there was not enough of an increase to overcome the business loss at renewal. Thus, policies in force fell 1.7% from June 2009 levels and 0.3% from March 2010.
Allstate brand Homeowners net written premium of $1,565,000,000 grew 2.2% quarter-over-quarter. This was driven primarily by an increase in average premium of 6.1% as rate actions work into the book of business. We expect to continue to see great changes where necessary to improve the returns over time.
The combined ratio for the quarter was 96.8 all in, an improvement from the second quarter 2009 of 3.2 points. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophe losses and prior-year reserve re-estimates, remains within the range we established for the year at 88.1. 
Just a few words on catastrophe losses for the quarter. In the second quarter, we experienced 30 events estimated at $758 million or 11.6 points, almost matching the record quarter we had last year. Partially offsetting the current quarter's losses were favorable reserve re-estimates of $83 million for prior years and $39 million for catastrophe losses that occurred in the first quarter of 2010. 
So in total, we had $636 million or 9.8 points of catastrophe losses in the quarter, an improvement of 2.7 points from the second quarter 2009. In addition to the $83 million of prior year reserve re-estimates for catastrophe losses, we had another $67 million of favorable reserve re-estimates. These adjustments were primarily due to favorable severity trends in auto physical damage.
On Slide 4, we get a look at auto loss cost trends, which in total were within our expectations. Both bodily injury and property damage reported frequencies increased over the second quarter 2009, 4.2% and 1.9%, respectively as shown on the charts on the left side of the page. Offsetting these increases were decreases in paid severities for both coverages of 1% to 1.5%, displayed in the upper right hand corner. 
These results, when coupled with the loss costs results of the other Auto coverages and an increase in earned premium from rate increases taken over the last several quarters, produce the combined ratio slightly better than the prior year's quarter and one that is consistent with our experience over the last year and a half.
Slide 5 has similar loss costs information for Homeowners, where profit improvement actions continue as catastrophe loss activity remained above average offsetting a moderation in non-catastrophe loss costs trends. In the top two charts, we show our frequency and paid severity results, excluding catastrophe losses. Frequency continues to run ahead of prior year, while paid severity trends remained in negative territory relative to 2009.
In the lower left hand corner, we show Homeowners' catastrophe losses as a percentage of Homeowners earned premium. Catastrophe losses in the second quarter 2010 equate to about 35 points of Homeowners' earned premium versus an average since 1992 of around 29 points. 
And finally, in the lower right, the combined ratio came in at 104.4 for the Allstate brand, an improvement of almost 12 points from last year's second quarter. The loss ratio, excluding catastrophe losses, was 47.9 compared to 49.3 for the second quarter 2009, 1.4 points better. Bringing this line of business to acceptable levels of profitability remains a priority. 
Shifting to Allstate Financial. Slide 6 provides a snapshot of the second quarter's results, which indicates solid progress being made. Premium and deposits, totaling just over $1 billion, declined substantially from the second quarter 2009 as we shift the focus to underwritten products and away from spread-based business. Underwritten products, interest-sensitive life, traditional life and accident and health, grew 12% over prior year while annuity fell about 60%.
Operating income for the quarter was $125 million or $60 million better than prior year. This increase was driven primarily by lower DAC [deferred acquisition costs] amortization and improved investment spread, offset somewhat by lower benefit spread. There were some one-off items included in these results, but they netted out to a favorable after-tax effect on operating income of about $10 million to $15 million.
For the quarter, Allstate Financial had a net loss of $107 million as we had $226 million of after-tax in DAC realized capital losses, or $353 million on a pre-tax basis. Taking a closer look at those pretax realized losses, $179 million related to derivatives, primarily designed to protect against rising interest rates, so there was an offsetting economic benefit with higher portfolio valuations. The $200 million of impairment and change in intent write-downs were $29 million less than the second quarter 2009. And sales at a gain of $18 million were $145 million less than last year.
Now I'll turn it over to Don."

First, I will cover our investment performance for the quarter, and I'll finish with a quick recap on our capital position. As we have in recent quarters, we remained focused on continuing to effectively manage risk and return in the portfolio, and our proactive approach served us well again this quarter. 
On Slide 7, you can see the allocation by asset class for the Investment portfolio, which totaled $99.9 billion. Fixed income securities remained the largest portion of the portfolio at 82%. We remain along corporate credit as we have in previous quarters. Consistent with our outlook, we reduced our allocation to municipal bonds by $1.6 billion and commercial real estate by $966 million in the quarter. And we benefited by lowering the allocation to equities in the first quarter as the market declined and maintained that underweight position throughout the second quarter.
Slide 8 provides trends for investment income and realized capital gains and losses for the last six quarters. Focusing on the top section of the slide, in total, net investment income fell 5.3% from prior year, but was almost leveled with Q1 2010. We remain in a defensive position relative to the interest outlook, with reinvestment proceeds being placed in shorter duration instruments and derivatives being used to manage the overall duration of the portfolio.
Shifting to the bottom of the slide, realized capital losses in the quarter amounted to $451 million pre-tax compared with $328 million gain in Q2 2009. Total write-downs from other-than-temporary impairments were comparable to prior year at $306 million, with credit-related impairments trending down by $52 million compared to Q2 2009. The gain from sales was $118 million less at $145 million. 
The big swing category this quarter was on derivatives. Instruments used primarily to protect the portfolio valuation from the negative effects of rising interest rates and equity market declines.  For this quarter, we had $310 million in losses versus a gain of $419 million in last year's second quarter. While we recorded a loss this quarter, the economic offset of these transactions was positive as the valuation of the portfolio improved as interest rates declined. 
This improvement in valuation is shown on Slide 9. We moved from unrealized loss position at March 31 of $849 million to a gain of $400 million at the end of the second quarter. In total, fixed income securities improved by $1.7 billion, with credit spreads widening during the quarter. This increased valuation is attributable to declining interest rates, which more than offset our realized losses on derivatives. Equities fell $483 million from March 2010, after-tax and DAC or unrealized position improved from a small loss to a gain position of $328 million.
Finally, on Slide 10. The combined impact of our income and the improvement in unrealized capital gains resulted in an improvement in capital to $18 billion, driving book value per share of 3% from March 2010 and 19% from June 2009. Assets at the holding company remained at $3.1 billion, and while our estimated statutory surplus declined slightly to $14.9 billion, we did take a dividend of $200 million from the insurance company up to the holding company. 
All in all, it was a solid quarter. We continue to proactively manage our portfolio and our focus on executing on our strategic priorities. With that, I'll turn it back to Tom."

We're down about 1 million policies in Homeowners as we've exited things like earthquake insurance, high-risk zones, including New York. Of course, there's the 1938 hurricane that went across Long Island, which has happened because dramatic flooding in New York and lots of severe damage. So we are getting smaller around the Coast, and we'll continue to get smaller around the Coast until such time as somebody comes up with a way to predict and price for hurricane risk.

Another layer is just the returns we've got in those areas, and the third is how do we deal with, what a lot of times we'll call non-model cats, meaning things other than hurricanes and earthquakes. Returns, they are -- sometimes that's a function of adjusting the coverages. Sometimes it's a function of rate. And then just profitability in the underlying book overall. We've got big pockets of the country where we feel terrific about things right now. We've got other pockets that are one or two renewal cycles away from where we need them to be, and we've got other pockets that are further away. We're banging away at all of those items and making significant progress. I think you can see improvements in the underlying combined ratio in Homeowners. You can see impacts on the written rate that we're taking relative to loss costs trends. Then we're going to keep pounding away. We believe this is a business where you can make an appropriate return on the core piece of it. We've got more angst about the aggregate cat exposures, but we think that there are ways to improve the position, and we're going to keep pounding our way at those.

Customer loyalty, whether statistically significant or not was down a couple of tens the way we measure it. So the things we are -- but it bounces around from quarter-to-quarter. The things we try to do to drive retention and referrals are obviously treating people well, having good level of interaction. The way when we measure our interaction, we're actually doing better now than we've done in the past. The way we are -- that are making that real is if people do not do a good job for our customers, and we have them measure down to individual agencies and individual claim adjusters then they no longer have the opportunity to be part of our team. So in addition to that, we have a number of positive things we've done like put it into the 401(k), so that our 36,000 employees, part of their retirement is based on getting customer loyalty up. And then we have a number of other, I'll call them, operational programs in terms of how to explain the premium changes, all the things we do every day and the millions of calls we get to make sure we do a better job there. The high discounts that you're referencing really aren't driven as much towards retention. We don't have a retention-based pricing model as you would see states fund does. Those are around the cross-line sales. And so Joe may want to make a separate comment about how that is a twofor in terms of driving retention. And then I don't think we can comment on other people's growth. I think you can look at what we have. We're up 14-plus percent if you exclude a couple of places. That said, you can't exclude a couple of places in total because we're supposed to grow in total. We think we're making conscious decisions to do what's right overall. But I can't speak for why other people are growing. Joe, maybe you want to talk some about the discounts and the other things you have in mind."

I don't think, and our data suggest and a lot of customer insight suggest, that price is important. But people don't make buying decisions solely on price. If you're fundamentally out of whack on pricing, that's an issue. But if you're in the game, there's other things that folks think about. So we're focusing on a full breadth of those. Sometimes that's product breadth, sometimes that's ease of access, sometimes it's the customer service that Tom was talking about. It's a lot of things, and we do well and are working on improving a lot of those. The strength in Your Choice Auto, on the ability to have a more effective homeowners product and be able to bundle that, the ability to let discounts from multi-line customers interact drives increased retention and drives increased customer satisfaction. And then in some cases, there are some interplay that we find in loss ratio, relative to those items. As you take your question on discounts, if you look at one individual item, sure. If we sell the same customer and we didn't have a discount before and we do have a discount now, that obviously reduces profitability. The issue is isolating that one item without looking at everything else that sort of works underneath it. And I guess the best I can give you without providing competitive intel is we're not moving off of our combined ratio outlook, the 88 to 90. So what we're doing sits inside of that range, so that may help you get a sense of what that's worth."

But I think when you look at growth, you also need to look at advertising. And oftentimes the Street looks at distribution channels and relates that to growth as opposed to the entire way you go to market, which includes your distribution channel but also includes the amount of advertising you do. Obviously, some channels like direct require more advertising and can support more advertising because of their economic structure. But also larger sizes can support a fair amount of advertising. So you see us continue to do more advertising. We've changed our advertising in this quarter. It is, I won't say a war, but it's pretty close to escalating. We continue to step up. And you'll see our advertising last year, we did a lot of price of shop and save. We did that because we felt we were being viewed as too high priced relative to others because of our silence and not because of where we actually were. So last year, we did a lot of shop and saving, say $500 or $350 by switching to Allstate. This year, you'll see us shifting more to value, which is the new component we've added to our advertising program, which may adds is dollar for dollar, and nobody protects you better than Allstate. That has a price message embedded in it. But it's really, to Joe's point, it's about price and the value you get from it. You'll see our ads also target -- this set of ads targets a younger group, whereas the continuation of our Dennis Haysbert initiative is targeted to the broader brand positioning."

Well, actually I think they did show up in the quarterly results. The underwritten products, which is as Bob said, interest-sensitive life, traditional life and accident and health actually grew 12% over a prior year. The drop that you saw in premium and deposits was on the annuity side, which fell about 60%. So I think we did see the exact growth, that we refer to our strategic prong -- two primarily strategic prongs are, as you said, to increase underwritten products and de-emphasize spread-based products, number one. And from a distribution channel perspective, to focus on the Allstate agencies and the work side division. And both of those are the areas we saw growth in, and the de-emphasis of the spread-based products, as Tom mentioned in his remarks, as you know we reported last quarter, that we exited the outside bank and broker-dealer channel, which was almost exclusively a spread-based product channel for us that had the result of immediately decreasing the amount of spread-based business that was being put on the books. So maybe you can tell me if there's something else that you're looking at that would imply something differently."

In terms of share repurchase, Don said it well, which is we're comfortable where we're at. We're longer capital today than we were at the beginning of the year, which has been one of our objectives for the year. We've always had to track record of giving that money back to shareholders when we think the company no longer needs it. So I think over the last 10 or 12 years, we've generated about $28 billion of capital, about $24 billion of that has gone back to the shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We have no reason to change our strikes on that one. If we have a good use for the money, we'll put it to use. If we don't, we'll give it back.

We appreciate your continuing interest in Allstate. I'll begin with an overview of our results for the quarter. Bob will then discuss the details of the business unit results, and Don will cover our investment performance and balance sheet position. Then we'll get to your questions. 
Our results for the second quarter are continuation of the positive momentum we established over the last year and a half despite the ever present volatility of weather in the financial markets. We generated $441 million of operating income or $0.81 per share, a sizable increase over last year's results, reflecting lower catastrophe losses as you can see on Slide 2. You'll remember that last year, we had record second quarter catastrophe losses. 
In Allstate Protection, the combined ratio was 96.8, 3.2 points below the second quarter of 2009. The underlying combined ratio of 88.1 remains in line with our annual guidance of 88 to 90. Allstate Financial continue to take positive steps towards its goal of raising returns while repositioning the business.
Operating income was $125 million for the quarter. Investments generated strong returns, reflecting our risk mitigation and return optimization strategies. Net investment income flattened sequentially as portfolio yields stabilized. Valuations improved as declining interest rates more than offset wider credit spreads.
We produced $145 million in net income, a decline from last year's second quarter results due primarily to realized capital losses from our risk mitigation programs, which were more than offset with unrealized gains in the portfolio. We ended the quarter with $400 million net unrealized gain on the investment portfolio versus unrealized losses of $849 million three months ago and a $7.3 billion unrealized loss one year ago. 
As a result of all of our efforts this quarter, our book value per share increased 3% from March 2010, almost 8% from the beginning of the year and 19% from Q2 2009. We remained focus on our priorities for 2010, and our operating results show continued progress in executing our strategies. 
Our Auto business continues to generate excellent returns. While many of our standard Auto growth initiatives are working, they're not generating enough volume yet to increase overall policies enforced. Our new business trends are improving as we continue to refine our product and price offerings to our targeted customer segments. We feel particularly good about our cross-line sales efforts as Bob will discuss. 
Offsetting these positives is a reduction in the size of Encompass and our California Auto business, as well as lower growth in Florida. Homeowners' profitability remains a challenge as catastrophe losses remained above average this quarter, though not as high as last year. We have made progressed and remained focused on improving returns in this line of business. Consequently, we will continue to see price increases, tightened underwriting standards and work to build more sophisticated risk management tools.
As you know, our strategies to improve the returns in Allstate Financial include reducing the spread-based business by exiting some distribution channels, focusing on the Allstate customer base and expanding our work side business. We made good progress in all of these areas.
Looking forward, we must stay focused on our goal to generate long-term profitable growth. We will achieve this by retaining more of our existing customers while continuing to increase new business. Our focus on improving customer loyalty is designed to do that, which is to drive improvements in retention and referrals. Our customer loyalty index results, however, slipped slightly this quarter as did those of the entire industry. Focusing on the customer, however, remains the key strategy in our efforts to grow profitably. Therefore, we will continue to introduce new products, new prices and new marketing support to help us win at the local level.
With that, let me turn it back over to Bob for a more in-depth look at the operating results."
18711,99159598,75863,"Allstate Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-05-2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","The Allstate Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. On Slide 3, we show the premium and underwriting income trends for Property-Liability. For the quarter, we experienced modest top line growth while maintaining our underlying margins within the range of our annual outlook. Total net premium",990,"Thanks, Tom. On Slide 3, we show the premium and underwriting income trends for Property-Liability. For the quarter, we experienced modest top line growth while maintaining our underlying margins within the range of our annual outlook. 
Total net premium written increased slightly to $6.64 billion from the second quarter 2009. The increases in Allstate brand Auto and Homeowners net premium written were partly offset by declines in our Encompass brand. Allstate brand Standard Auto net premium written grew 1.9% in the quarter. Increases in the average premium driven by rate actions taken over the last few quarters more than offset the decline in overall unit volume.
New business volume increased 0.4% quarter-over-quarter, and was up 14.3% if you exclude Florida and California, as profit improvement actions in those two markets mask the positive results of growth initiatives targeted at our customer segments, which are gaining traction in the local market level. For example, our efforts to cross sell autos to our monoline property customers is progressing nicely. Both the close rate and the quality of the business is better than average. We are exploring more ways to improve the effectiveness of our cross-sell processes. 
Auto retention remained level at 89%, after increasing slightly in the first quarter. So while new business volume increased, there was not enough of an increase to overcome the business loss at renewal. Thus, policies in force fell 1.7% from June 2009 levels and 0.3% from March 2010.
Allstate brand Homeowners net written premium of $1,565,000,000 grew 2.2% quarter-over-quarter. This was driven primarily by an increase in average premium of 6.1% as rate actions work into the book of business. We expect to continue to see great changes where necessary to improve the returns over time.
The combined ratio for the quarter was 96.8 all in, an improvement from the second quarter 2009 of 3.2 points. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophe losses and prior-year reserve re-estimates, remains within the range we established for the year at 88.1. 
Just a few words on catastrophe losses for the quarter. In the second quarter, we experienced 30 events estimated at $758 million or 11.6 points, almost matching the record quarter we had last year. Partially offsetting the current quarter's losses were favorable reserve re-estimates of $83 million for prior years and $39 million for catastrophe losses that occurred in the first quarter of 2010. 
So in total, we had $636 million or 9.8 points of catastrophe losses in the quarter, an improvement of 2.7 points from the second quarter 2009. In addition to the $83 million of prior year reserve re-estimates for catastrophe losses, we had another $67 million of favorable reserve re-estimates. These adjustments were primarily due to favorable severity trends in auto physical damage.
On Slide 4, we get a look at auto loss cost trends, which in total were within our expectations. Both bodily injury and property damage reported frequencies increased over the second quarter 2009, 4.2% and 1.9%, respectively as shown on the charts on the left side of the page. Offsetting these increases were decreases in paid severities for both coverages of 1% to 1.5%, displayed in the upper right hand corner. 
These results, when coupled with the loss costs results of the other Auto coverages and an increase in earned premium from rate increases taken over the last several quarters, produce the combined ratio slightly better than the prior year's quarter and one that is consistent with our experience over the last year and a half.
Slide 5 has similar loss costs information for Homeowners, where profit improvement actions continue as catastrophe loss activity remained above average offsetting a moderation in non-catastrophe loss costs trends. In the top two charts, we show our frequency and paid severity results, excluding catastrophe losses. Frequency continues to run ahead of prior year, while paid severity trends remained in negative territory relative to 2009.
In the lower left hand corner, we show Homeowners' catastrophe losses as a percentage of Homeowners earned premium. Catastrophe losses in the second quarter 2010 equate to about 35 points of Homeowners' earned premium versus an average since 1992 of around 29 points. 
And finally, in the lower right, the combined ratio came in at 104.4 for the Allstate brand, an improvement of almost 12 points from last year's second quarter. The loss ratio, excluding catastrophe losses, was 47.9 compared to 49.3 for the second quarter 2009, 1.4 points better. Bringing this line of business to acceptable levels of profitability remains a priority. 
Shifting to Allstate Financial. Slide 6 provides a snapshot of the second quarter's results, which indicates solid progress being made. Premium and deposits, totaling just over $1 billion, declined substantially from the second quarter 2009 as we shift the focus to underwritten products and away from spread-based business. Underwritten products, interest-sensitive life, traditional life and accident and health, grew 12% over prior year while annuity fell about 60%.
Operating income for the quarter was $125 million or $60 million better than prior year. This increase was driven primarily by lower DAC [deferred acquisition costs] amortization and improved investment spread, offset somewhat by lower benefit spread. There were some one-off items included in these results, but they netted out to a favorable after-tax effect on operating income of about $10 million to $15 million.
For the quarter, Allstate Financial had a net loss of $107 million as we had $226 million of after-tax in DAC realized capital losses, or $353 million on a pre-tax basis. Taking a closer look at those pretax realized losses, $179 million related to derivatives, primarily designed to protect against rising interest rates, so there was an offsetting economic benefit with higher portfolio valuations. The $200 million of impairment and change in intent write-downs were $29 million less than the second quarter 2009. And sales at a gain of $18 million were $145 million less than last year.
Now I'll turn it over to Don."

First, I will cover our investment performance for the quarter, and I'll finish with a quick recap on our capital position. As we have in recent quarters, we remained focused on continuing to effectively manage risk and return in the portfolio, and our proactive approach served us well again this quarter. 
On Slide 7, you can see the allocation by asset class for the Investment portfolio, which totaled $99.9 billion. Fixed income securities remained the largest portion of the portfolio at 82%. We remain along corporate credit as we have in previous quarters. Consistent with our outlook, we reduced our allocation to municipal bonds by $1.6 billion and commercial real estate by $966 million in the quarter. And we benefited by lowering the allocation to equities in the first quarter as the market declined and maintained that underweight position throughout the second quarter.
Slide 8 provides trends for investment income and realized capital gains and losses for the last six quarters. Focusing on the top section of the slide, in total, net investment income fell 5.3% from prior year, but was almost leveled with Q1 2010. We remain in a defensive position relative to the interest outlook, with reinvestment proceeds being placed in shorter duration instruments and derivatives being used to manage the overall duration of the portfolio.
Shifting to the bottom of the slide, realized capital losses in the quarter amounted to $451 million pre-tax compared with $328 million gain in Q2 2009. Total write-downs from other-than-temporary impairments were comparable to prior year at $306 million, with credit-related impairments trending down by $52 million compared to Q2 2009. The gain from sales was $118 million less at $145 million. 
The big swing category this quarter was on derivatives. Instruments used primarily to protect the portfolio valuation from the negative effects of rising interest rates and equity market declines.  For this quarter, we had $310 million in losses versus a gain of $419 million in last year's second quarter. While we recorded a loss this quarter, the economic offset of these transactions was positive as the valuation of the portfolio improved as interest rates declined. 
This improvement in valuation is shown on Slide 9. We moved from unrealized loss position at March 31 of $849 million to a gain of $400 million at the end of the second quarter. In total, fixed income securities improved by $1.7 billion, with credit spreads widening during the quarter. This increased valuation is attributable to declining interest rates, which more than offset our realized losses on derivatives. Equities fell $483 million from March 2010, after-tax and DAC or unrealized position improved from a small loss to a gain position of $328 million.
Finally, on Slide 10. The combined impact of our income and the improvement in unrealized capital gains resulted in an improvement in capital to $18 billion, driving book value per share of 3% from March 2010 and 19% from June 2009. Assets at the holding company remained at $3.1 billion, and while our estimated statutory surplus declined slightly to $14.9 billion, we did take a dividend of $200 million from the insurance company up to the holding company. 
All in all, it was a solid quarter. We continue to proactively manage our portfolio and our focus on executing on our strategic priorities. With that, I'll turn it back to Tom."

Another layer is just the returns we've got in those areas, and the third is how do we deal with, what a lot of times we'll call non-model cats, meaning things other than hurricanes and earthquakes. Returns, they are -- sometimes that's a function of adjusting the coverages. Sometimes it's a function of rate. And then just profitability in the underlying book overall. We've got big pockets of the country where we feel terrific about things right now. We've got other pockets that are one or two renewal cycles away from where we need them to be, and we've got other pockets that are further away. We're banging away at all of those items and making significant progress. I think you can see improvements in the underlying combined ratio in Homeowners. You can see impacts on the written rate that we're taking relative to loss costs trends. Then we're going to keep pounding away. We believe this is a business where you can make an appropriate return on the core piece of it. We've got more angst about the aggregate cat exposures, but we think that there are ways to improve the position, and we're going to keep pounding our way at those. It's just slower and more arduous process than we or I think anybody in the industry would like, but it's an achievable one.  And by the way, if you want to talk about your auto policy, I'm available afterwards."

And we went into a much more standard and near standard monoline segment of the auto marketplace. We expanded distribution there, and we got ourselves a little out ahead of our skis and got some profitability problems there. As we've been working on that to fix it, a lot of what you're seeing is an impact in our comments were around top line. We've got to get some of that roll some of that business off or remediated or move it from a pricing perspective. We've got to take some actions with some of those more monoline auto distributors and that's got top line pressure on that business. We're trying to be as laser focused as we can on that, but sometimes as we're shooting at those problem areas, it's rippling a little bit into what I would say is our core wheelhouse and we're trying to mitigate that issue.

In terms of retention, as we said, retention was flat this quarter. Customer loyalty, whether it's statistically significant or not, was down a couple of tenths the way we measure it. So the things we are -- but it bounces around from quarter-to-quarter. The things we try to do to drive retention and referrals are obviously treating people well, having good level of interaction. The way when we measure our interaction, we're actually doing better now than we've done in the past. The way we are -- that are making that real is if people do not do a good job for our customers, and we have them measured down to individual agencies and individual claim adjusters then they no longer have the opportunity to be part of our team. So in addition to that, we have a number of positive things we've done like put it into the 401(k), so that our 36,000 employees, part of their retirement is based on getting customer loyalty up. And then we have a number of other, I'll call them, operational programs in terms of how to explain the premium changes, all the things we do every day and the millions of calls we get to make sure we do a better job there. The high discounts that you're referencing really aren't driven as much towards retention. We don't have a retention-based pricing model as you would see states fund does. Those are around the cross-line sales. And so Joe may want to make a separate comment about how that is a twofor in terms of driving retention. And then I don't think we can comment on other people's growth. I think you can look at what we have. We're up 14-plus percent if you exclude a couple of places. That said, you can't exclude a couple of places in total because we're supposed to grow in total. We think we're making conscious decisions to do what's right overall. But I can't speak for why other people are growing. Joe, maybe you want to talk some about the discounts and the other things you have in mind."

I don't think, and our data suggests and a lot of customer insight suggest, that price is important. But people don't make buying decisions solely on price. If you're fundamentally out of whack on pricing, that's an issue. But if you're in the game, there's other things that folks think about. So we're focusing on a full breadth of those. Sometimes that's product breadth, sometimes that's ease of access, sometimes it's the customer service that Tom was talking about. It's a lot of things, and we do well and are working on improving a lot of those. The strength in Your Choice Auto, the ability to have a more effective homeowners product and be able to bundle that, the ability to let discounts from multi-line customers interact drives increased retention and drives increased customer satisfaction. And then in some cases, there are some interplay that we find in loss ratio, relative to those items. As you take your question on discounts, if you look at one individual item, sure. If we sell the same customer and we didn't have a discount before and we do have a discount now, that obviously reduces profitability. The issue is isolating that one item without looking at everything else that sort of works underneath it. And I guess the best I can give you without providing competitive intel is we're not moving off of our combined ratio outlook, the 88 to 90. So what we're doing sits inside of that range, so that may help you get a sense of what that's worth."

But I think when you look at growth, you also need to look at advertising. And oftentimes the Street looks at distribution channels and relates that to growth as opposed to the entire way you go to market, which includes your distribution channel but also includes the amount of advertising you do. Obviously, some channels like direct require more advertising and can support more advertising because of their economic structure. But also larger sizes can support a fair amount of advertising. So you see us continue to do more advertising. We've changed our advertising in this quarter. It is, I won't say a war, but it's pretty close to escalating. We continue to step up. And you'll see our advertising last year, we did a lot of price of shop and save. We did that because we felt we were being viewed as too high priced relative to others because of our silence and not because of where we actually were. So last year, we did a lot of shop and saving, say $500 or $350 by switching to Allstate. This year, you'll see us shifting more to value, which is the new component we've added to our advertising program, which may adds is dollar for dollar, and nobody protects you better than Allstate. That has a price message embedded in it. But it's really, to Joe's point, it's about price and the value you get from it. You'll see our ads also target -- this set of ads targets a younger group, whereas the continuation of our Dennis Haysbert initiative is targeted to the broader brand positioning."

In terms of share repurchase, Don said it well, which is we're comfortable where we're at. We're longer capital today than we were at the beginning of the year, which has been one of our objectives for the year. We've always had to track record of giving that money back to shareholders when we think the company no longer needs it. So I think over the last 10 or 12 years, we've generated about $28 billion of capital, about $24 billion of that has gone back to the shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We have no reason to change our strikes on that one. If we have a good use for the money, we'll put it to use. If we don't, we'll give it back. But at this point, any economic climate, where we are this year, we feel like it's better to be long capital than to be right at the edge given that no one's really yet certain where this whole economy will move."

We don't even go to the next regions until September and then we begin the rest of the national rollout between September and January of next year. So far though, we've worked out some of the kinks in the process and the kinks in the technology. The feedback from both the customers and from the distributors has been very good. So we're pleased with the initial feedback, and we're adopting some of the process changes that we learned during the pilot program to make the national launch better.

The product that Matt and his team have designed does it for them. So it says, ""Look, how much money do you have a month?"" It's got some simple packages so the demystification you talked about. So if you don't die, then you get half of your money back at 65. It's not a complicated formula. It's not here's what the investment portfolio does, here's the asset selection you got to make. It's really simple, it's really fast. It reflects the fact that they don't want to spend a ton of time on something where they're not putting that much money to work. So this is about really designing it from a customer back as opposed to from our risk perspective forward. So I think it's an -- and you'll see that in other things we do, other new products, a little bit what Your Choice Auto was about, some other new products we have coming up in Allstate Protection will be similar kinds of things, which is just make it simple, base it on how they think about the world, not how we think about the world."

We had some rollout of some new claim processes over the course in the last 18 months, for a little while, as we brought that new claim system online, that may have slowed us down a shade. And now we're back into our stride, so you may see a piece of that running through there. There maybe a little bit of it that's economy-related in terms of what we're seeing in underlying costs that maybe reversing some inflationary trends we saw last year. It's modest numbers overall, so we're watching them. Generally, the aggregate loss trends, when you combine frequency and severity, are in line with what we were expecting. So they're in line with what our pricing had anticipated. So I don't see a lot of change as a result of those."

The capital conversations as a company we were having with you where ones where you were concerned that we, did we have enough, not that we have too much. So we took a conservative view of our pricing there and I said, ""You know what, we're going to make sure our Auto business is performing."" We anticipated some adverse loss trends potentially coming around the economy, so we made sure we were quick on that. I think we're seeing some other competitors catch up with some of those observations and trailing where we were a little bit. But our goal was to make sure that business performed well in the environment with all that other uncertainty, and its done that. The loss trends weren't perhaps as pessimistic as we anticipated. And when you look at it over the course of maybe a total view of two years, we're in line with where we'd expect to be, but we may have timing and may have been a little accelerated."

During the Q&A session, we ask you that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up so that we can hear from as many of you as time allows. As is our practice, yesterday we provided our earnings press release, investor supplement and filed our 10-Q for the third quarter of 2010. We also posted a presentation that we will be using on today's call. All of these documents can be found in our website.
As noted on Slide 1 of the presentation, this discussion may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations and actual results may differ materially. So refer to our Form 10-K for 2009, Form 10-Q for the third quarter and our most recent press release for information on potential risks.
Also, this discussion may contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our press release and on our website.

Then we'll open it up for your questions.
In the third quarter, we were again successful in executing strategy that creates shareholder value despite the weak economy. So why don't we begin, go to Slide 2. In total, we generated $367 million net income on $7.9 million of revenue. There was an increase in net income of $146 million, that was primarily due to less realized capital losses this quarter than in Q3 2009.
Operating income was $452 million or $0.83 per share which was $86 million below the same quarter last year. And that's the result of lower operating income from Allstate Protection, our Property Liability segment. Property Liability had an underlying combined ratio of 89.2 for the quarter, bringing the full year for the nine months up to 88.8. That's squarely in the middle of our annual outlook of 88 to 90 that we provided in February. We did experience an increase in the third quarter, but remained comfortable with loss trends.
Growing Allstate Protection is critical to our success while we are able to largely maintain revenues from prior year levels, we need to generate more unit growth. Standard all policies in force declined from $17.8 million last year to $17.5 million this year as strong growth in new business in most of the country was offset by declines in several large states where we've taken action to improve profitability. This actions also had a negative impact on improving customer loyalty in the quarter. Since our major competitors also had declines in customer loyalty this quarter, it was really a missed opportunity for us to improve our relative position. 
Efforts to improve returns in homeowners and in Encompass Independent Agency business also had negative impact on growth. New business growth was a result of several things: it was up 2.4%, increased advertising, the successful addition of the Mayhem campaign to our marketing programs and targeted pricing actions to improve our auto competitive position.
Homeowners profitability remains a concern although progress is being made as our rate actions work into the numbers. Catastrophe loss this quarter were low relative to other third quarters, but we had no major hurricane losses. The amount of none model cat losses remained at high levels. We continue to see price and tightened underwriting standards while we deployed better risk management tools in order to generate acceptable returns.
Allstate Financial continues to generate, to strategically position its business while raising returns. Operating income of $108 million was below the last few quarters due to several positive onetime items earlier in the year. Premium deposit volume was down as expected as we ship from spread-based businesses to more quality and BBB [ph] products. Allstate Financial did grow both the work side and Allstate Agency businesses were premiums and processes on underwritten products were up 33% and 2%, respectively compared to Q3 of 2009.
Allstate Financial also completed its focus to win cost reduction efforts. Investments had another great quarter from a total return perspective as the portfolio continues to generate substantial cash and improve in value. The net unrealized gain on the portfolio rose to $2.7 billion. This gain reflects lower interest rates and improved valuation on structured securities. While lower interest rates do translate into higher valuations, it puts pressure on operating income. We've continued to reduce our municipal bonds and real estate holdings, which also puts downward pressure on operating income. Dan will cover the impact on that in a few minutes. 
The net result of this operating performance was to raise book value per share to 35.48, that's up 6.7% over the last three months and is almost 10% higher than a year ago. And now let's have Bob go through the results in greater detail."
18711,99159608,82764,"Allstate Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","The Allstate Corporation","Executives","Turning to Slide 3.

In the third quarter, we produced the net premium written of almost $6.8 million, which was a slight decline from Q3 2009. 
Total net written premium for the Allstate brand increased slightly, but was more than offset by a decline in our Encompass brand. Within the Allstate brand, our Standard Auto net written premium fell by 0.5%, small increases in the first two quarters of the year. Increases in new issued applications of 2.5% and average premium of 1.4% both compared to prior year's quarter, were more than offset by a decline in retention resulting in the premium shortfall. Total units also fell 0.3% sequentially and 1.7% from 3rd quarter 2009.
Homeowner net written premium increased quarter-over-quarter by 2.4%. Increases in average premium driven by approved rate increases in retention were more than enough to offset the 4% decline in total units. The recorded combined ratio for the third quarter was 95.9%, 1.2 points higher than the third quarter 2009. The underlying combined ratio which excludes the effects of catastrophe losses in prior-year reserve re-estimates was 89.2, right in the middle of our annual outlook range we provided at the start of the year. 
Catastrophe losses for the quarter were for $386 million on a recorded basis. This result was made up of $371 million of current quarter losses in 29 events, $57 million of additional losses from events occurring early in the year, primarily second quarter hailstorms and a $42 million reduction of a prior-year reserves. While the catastrophe loss was much less than the first two quarters, it was still relatively high for a third quarter given the absence of a major hurricane loss.
A few words on prior-year reserve re-estimates. Besides the $42 million reduction in catastrophe loss re-estimates, the third quarter included a $22 million increase for discontinued lines primarily for environmental reserves as we completed our annual reserve study for the discontinued lines and coverages. It also includes a $70 million litigation accrual charge to homeowners. 
On Slide 4, we provide a look at auto loss cost trends, which in total remained within our expectations. On the left-hand side of the exhibit we provide the quarterly frequency results for bodily injury and property damage. In both cases, the level of frequency is elevated relative to the previous five years. In the upper right-hand corner, we displayed the paid severity change over time. Here, the results remained very good with only slight increase in the quarter. When these results are combined with those of the remaining coverages in auto loss result as a combined ratio that is fairly flat for the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2009.
On Slide 5, we show similar loss information for homeowners. On the top half of the exhibit, you can see the frequency excluding catastrophe losses was 2.3% less than the third quarter 2009 results. The paid severity excluding catastrophe losses increased 2.1% compared to the third quarter of 2009. With the increase in average earned premium for rate increases working into the results, the underlying loss ratio, which excludes catastrophe losses and prior-year reserve re-estimates improved again this quarter. We continue to execute under profit improvement actions designed to get homeowners to an acceptable level of profitability.
Shifting to Allstate Financial. Slide 6 displays the top and bottom line results for the last two years by quarter. The trends continue to reflect positive momentum in our efforts to produce higher returns, shift our focus to underwritten products versus spread-based products and serve our customers through Allstate Agencies and the Allstate Workplace Division. Premium and deposits on underwritten products increased 8.6% compared to the third quarter of 2009, while annuities declined consistent with our strategic direction.
Operating income for the quarter was $108 million or $13 million more than the third quarter of 2009, I would describe this quarter's result as relatively clean in terms of a one off items. When we adjust the first two quarters of 2010 for these kinds of items, the operating income drops back to a range of $110 million to $115 million to those quarters. The benefit spread was slightly lower due to higher but typical immediate annuity benefits this quarter compared to the third quarter 2009, which had favorable results for that product. The investment spread increased to $127 million reflecting decreased interest credited to contract holder fund, partly offset by a lower net investment income. 
Operating costs were slightly elevated this quarter due to higher marketing cost and certain acquisition-related expenses associated with growth and the workplace division premium. The expense reduction actions associated with the focus to win program initiated in 2009 are now substantially complete in the program that has met our target. For the quarter, Allstate Financial recorded net income of $85 million versus a net loss of $38 million last year. Realized capital losses were significantly lower this quarter compared to the third quarter of 2009. At this point, I'll turn it over to Don."

I'm going to cover our investment performance for the quarter and the status of our capital position at the end of September. As you can see on Slide 7, the value of our investment portfolio increased to $102.2 billion in the third quarter. L",768,"Thanks, Bob. I'm going to cover our investment performance for the quarter and the status of our capital position at the end of September. As you can see on Slide 7, the value of our investment portfolio increased to $102.2 billion in the third quarter. Largely reflecting the benefit of the decline in interest rates during the quarter. We continue to be proactive in risk management activities. And again this quarter, we reduced exposures in our municipal bond and commercial real estate portfolios while also protecting against an increasing rate environment. We reduced municipal bonds by $2.4 billion of amortized costs in Q3. The reductions targeted specific sectors and higher risk geographies.
Commercial real estate reductions totaled $484 million of amortized cost, and this was accomplished through a combination of maturities and prepayments with some offset due to refinancing activity. The total portfolio maintained a defensive position against interest rate increases. Reinvestment proceeds were placed in shorter duration instruments with derivatives being used to further manage the overall duration.
That said, the continuation of lower rates and combination with our risk mitigation and duration management continues to adversely affect investment income. On Slide 8, you can see that net investment income fell to $1.0 billion, a 4.2% sequential drop and 7.3% decline from Q3 2009. Property liability investment income dropped 8.4% sequentially and 12.9% from Q3 2009 on reinvestment of the proceeds from our risk mitigation, rate management and investing activities and lower yielding and shorter duration securities, as well as the timing of equity dividends.
Allstate Financial investment income dropped 2.2% sequentially and 5% from Q3 2009, primarily the result of a drop in average portfolio balances. Our return optimization program included purchasing high yield corporate and asset-backed securities which have only partially offset the significant decline in interest rates. We continue to focus our investing activity to optimize both risk and return opportunities.
Net realized capital gains and losses shown on the bottom of the slide improved this quarter. We posted a pretax loss of $144 million compared to a loss of $519 million in Q3 2009. Other than temporary impairments, we're $167 million in the third quarter, less than half the amount experienced in Q3 2009. And they were concentrated primarily in the RMBS and CMBS portfolios.
Trading activity and risk mitigation actions drove net realized capital gains from sales of $319 million in the quarter, $118 million more than last year's third quarter. Most of the gains came from the fixed income portfolio, in particular public corporates, municipal bonds and agency paper. Equities contributed about a third of the gain. The derivatives loss for this quarter at $285 million was slightly better than the loss in Q2 2010, and $76 million better than Q3 2009.
We added additional breakout on this page to show our derivative experience by key risks. Our interest rate hedges produced a loss of $181 million this quarter, $100 million less than Q2 2010 and $219 million less than last year. These losses reflected the continued cost of protecting our portfolio from rising interest rates. Our equity had just lost $115 million as equity rallied about the same as last year's Q3. All this detail can be found in our 10-Q filing.
On Slide 9, you can see that our unrealized net capital gain position improved by $2.3 billion on a pretax basis from Q2 2010. And is $5 billion better than Q3 2009. After tax and DAC withstand at $1.3 billion, $964 million better than Q2 2010. Virtually every asset class participated in this improvement as we benefited this quarter from the declining interest rates and higher equity markets.  The improvement in the portfolio valuation more than offset the cost of our risk mitigation programs.
While our net unrealized gain position is clearly a substantial improvement from levels over the past two years in terms of our book value, the current low rate environment that creates this unrealized gain is also the reason we've been actively working to reduce exposure increases and rates. 
Finally on Slide 10, we provide you with a look at our capital position on both a GAAP and stat basis. Our overall GAAP equity climbed to $19.3 billion in the third quarter, a little more than 15% increase since year-end. Our current estimates of statutory surplus for Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company showed stable increase in capital levels in these companies. During the third quarter, the holding company received a $400 million dividend from AIC bringing the total for the year to $600 million. With that, I'll turn it back to Tom."

One was disappointing, one was mix and four where we had strong performance. Let me start with the disappointing. Our auto retention was down as we started managing profits in a couple of big states that offset the benefits from more marketing and the result was that items in our force in our Standard Auto business did not grow this quarter. That's the disappointing part. 
The mix. The homeowners is making progress although we still have a high level of cats. In the good category, our property liability combined ratio was in the middle of the range that we gave to you in February for both the quarter and the nine months. And this is our auto combined ratio has been in the positive zone that's below 100 for over a decade. 
Investment results. We have great investment results. Risk mitigation is making a lot of progress on that and our return optimization, obviously, we stayed in the right stuff as we had a good increase in the value of our portfolio. Allstate Financial is focused to win program is done and it's got a balanced approach of raising returns and book value is up 7% for the quarter and 15% for the year.

Let me start with capital, Bob, because we are probably talking about it. We obviously have been doing good job of building capital whether that's a statutory capital or book value from a GAAP basis. We feel good about that. As we've said, the first thing we use with capital make sure our business is sound and stable and in a good position. And given the economy and investment markets over the last year and a half, we've done everything to keep ourselves in the right position and fully capitalized. Second then, we obviously tried to deploy that in growth of the business. The easiest place to do that would be to do it or the most opportunity in place would be do it by growing our business organically and we'd love to do that. We've also said that if there are acquisitions that we think fit we'll do those. You've seen what we've done over time on acquisitions. We're not in the market all the time buying all kinds of stuff. We do try to buy stuff we think will grow us. So the Workplace business was number three when we bought it, it's number two now and we're liking its trend. So we tried to be smart about what we buy. And obviously then we return it to the shareholders we've talked before about our dividend policy, which I have my board look at every quarter. We do that based on sort of a percentage of earnings and I think you should expect this continuing set dividend policy based on the amount of money we make. And if we have capital above that, then we've also bought back stock. We've not announced the stock buyback program today and not about to because I feeling we're in pretty good shape. But if you could look at our track record, I'm returning capital to shareholders, it's been great. So I think you should expect that same philosophy to apply going forward."

We continue to look at it. Generally, the spread across the broad set of geographies, across a broad set of customer, vintages, if you will, tenure that we have with customers and across most ways that we can look at it. We are seeing a little bit of that spike being an increase in claims that are closed without payments, which might be a little bit of a tail impact on some of what we have see in prior periods. We made a big shift in our claims systems over the past couple of years which is done basically, but it does impact some of the prior period on claim practices. So a little bit of that frequency, we think might be some noise out of. But even if you take the noise out there is a bit of an uptick. We've seen some increases in gas purchases and miles driven which we -- some correlation to that. I'm not sure where to point were we declared a long-term trend but we're watching them. Relative to the growth question, we don't give forward-looking growth guidance or production guidance. What I will tell you is that we're focused on over the long term grow in our business. We are focused on preserving a strong track record of having very powerful margins and we'll keep those two items in mind as we march forward and I think the comments we've given you is that we've got new business up, double digit in states other than California and Florida where we've seen new business decline year-over-year. We focused on some specific profitability actions in those geographies and that will work its way through the system, at least the new business relativity year-over-year.

There's a core target that has long been its target of a bundled auto and home targeting sort of an a mass affluent customer base below the real high end that you see in some high-valued homeowners players. And we do well in that product. It's position well inside of agencies. They like the product, they like its performance. We fit into a well-defined niche there. And broadly, are happy with the performance on any given day, any given quarter. We might want to be a little bit better whether it's growth or profitability. Then there's the second part of the business. A couple of years ago, we tried it to expand our targeting to produce more Auto business through that brand. We ended up adding groups of agencies that were more specialist in auto. Broaden the product capability to target that monoline auto and found that our approach both through a combination of distribution and a combination of how we price construction of the product and managed the underwriting wasn't effective in that marketplace. And it hurt us from a profitability perspective. What you're seeing right now running through the numbers is the impact of unwinding that latter part of a book of business. Now as we do that, it had a little bit of a ripple over effect into the core. So that's getting splashed with the cleanup, if you will. As we move through that, we will continue and are continuing to focus on the core niche where Encompass has been affected. I'm very confident that we can be effective in that space, grow that business, make reasonable returns on it and then it's something that's desired by independent agents as distributor and has a good customer proposition. We just have to finish the cleanup of that auto specialists strategy."

But we weren't comfortable with the economic or investment outlook really starting in 2008. So at that point we chose to protect margins at the expense of growth. You are seeing the consequences of that both in '09 and '10 as we try to work through that because this has a long trends in it and you can't sort of because so much of our business is renewal.

The programs we have in place just to refresh your memory, we changed the reward system so both our agencies and our employees benefit from higher customer loyalty. Agencies and that some of there bonuses paid on retention. Our employees and that the profit sharing plan we switched it from profits to customer loyalty so people's 401(k) matches depending on getting up. So we have the reward side. On the accountability side, we continue to increase the accountability for results and if people don't take good care of our customers, they can't be part of our team.

Everything from calling people, doing protection reviews, calling them when they're bill is late to having better and clear communication. We've launch some sub called Insurance Made Simple. So there's a whole bunch of things that we do along the way which supports both accountability and recognition. One of the challenges we had this quarter was the benefit of all those programs, rewards, accountability and new initiatives did not offset the impact that reasonably large increases in price had in a couple of the big states.

With regard to income and there are many factors affecting investment income. First, we're in a low rate environment, rates are down, as everybody knows 100 to 150 basis points, 50 basis points in the quarter alone. We also have our proactive stance on risk mitigation and we've been doing that for a couple of years. We think it gives us a lot of flexibility in the portfolio, better positions us going forward. We've been focused largely on commercial real estate and municipal for the past year or so. And I'd say that those programs are largely complete. We've also done some duration shortening or duration management within the portfolio. And this quarter in particular, we took a hard look at the cash duration in the property and casualty portfolio and made some moves to shortened the cash duration. Because we felt we were using a derivative to a great extent more than we needed to in that portfolio and decided to bring down the cash duration and that impacted income as well. And then just normal trading activity in this low rate environment also impacts investment income. When you look at how to manage it going forward, you talk to any portfolio manager that has fixed income in their portfolio, you've got a situation where rates are low, they could stay low for an extended period of time and then you're looking at less income as a portfolio manager. Rates good decline further which the volume of a portfolio would go up but you end up with earning less. And then if rates rise, the value of the portfolio could fall, would fall but either you have more income. And I guess the actions that we're taking put us in a position where we feel that we have the flexibility to be proactive in managing the portfolio and driving shareholder value."

I'll come back to what has been our stock answer with that which isn't going to be very specific to what you asked, which is we look at everything that comes across the market. Sometimes we go on proactively look for stuff. We tend to be relatively conservative in the price we would pay and try to only buy things where we think we can add lots of value. So when we bought the Workplace division, a decade ago, we thought we could expand it geographically across the country, and we did that. We thought we could expand it to sales and Allstate Agencies, we did that. We thought we could expand from small companies to large companies and we did that. When we bought CNA as business had a combined ratio of 117, although Joe is not happy with its combined ratio at 100 it's been substantially below 100 since we've bought it and we've made good money on that. So that's kind of the approach we have. To answer your question about international versus domestic, much more interested in seizing the opportunity available in the domestic market than international. But if something was appropriately priced and we thought we could add value, we always look at it."

Then we'll open it up for your questions.
In the third quarter, we were again successful in executing strategy that creates shareholder value despite the weak economy. So why don't we begin, go to Slide 2. In total, we generated $367 million net income on $7.9 billion of revenue. There was an increase in net income of $146 million, that was primarily due to less realized capital losses this quarter than in Q3 2009.
Operating income was $452 million or $0.83 per share which was $86 million below the same quarter last year. And that's the result of lower operating income from Allstate Protection, our Property Liability segment. Property Liability had an underlying combined ratio of 89.2 for the quarter, bringing the full year for the nine months up to 88.8. That's squarely in the middle of our annual outlook of 88 to 90 that we provided in February. We did experience an increase in the third quarter, but remained comfortable with loss trends.
Growing Allstate Protection is critical to our success while we are able to largely maintain revenues from prior year levels we need to generate more unit growth. Standard all policies in force declined from $17.8 million last year to $17.5 million this year as strong growth in new business in most of the country was offset by declines in several large states where we've taken action to improve profitability. These actions also had a negative impact on improving customer loyalty in the quarter. Since our major competitors also had declines in customer loyalty this quarter, it was really a missed opportunity for us to improve our relative position.
Efforts to improve returns in homeowners and in Encompass Independent Agency business also had negative impact on growth. New business growth was a result of several things: it was up 2.4%, increased advertising, the successful addition of the Mayhem campaign to our marketing programs and targeted pricing actions to improve our auto competitive position.
Homeowners profitability remains a concern although progress is being made as our rate actions work into the numbers. Catastrophe loss at this quarter were low relative to other third quarters, but we had no major hurricane losses. The amount of none model cat losses remained at high levels. We continue to see price and tightened underwriting standards while we deployed better risk management tools in order to generate acceptable returns.
Allstate Financial continues to generate, to strategically position its business while raising returns. Operating income of $108 million was below the last few quarters due to several positive onetime items earlier in the year. Premium deposit volume was down as expected as we ship from spread-based businesses to more quality and BBB [ph] products. Allstate Financial did grow both the work side and Allstate Agency businesses were premiums and processes on underwritten products were up 33% and 2%, respectively compared to Q3 of 2009.
Allstate Financial also completed its focus to win cost reduction efforts. Investments had another great quarter from a total return perspective as the portfolio continues to generate substantial cash and improve in value. The net unrealized gain on the portfolio rose to $2.7 billion. This gain reflects lower interest rates and improved valuation on structured securities. While lower interest rates do translate into higher valuations, it puts pressure on operating income. We've continued to reduce our municipal bonds and real estate holdings, which also puts downward pressure on operating income. Don will cover the impact on that in a few minutes.
The net result of this operating performance was to raise book value per share to 35.48, that's up 6.7% over the last three months and is almost 10% higher than a year ago.
And now let's have Bob go through the results in greater detail."

Here are the Property-Liability premium and underwriting income results. In the third quarter, we produced the net premium written of almost $6.8 million, which was a slight decline from Q3 2009.Total net written premium for the Alls",840,"Turning to Slide 3. Here are the Property-Liability premium and underwriting income results. In the third quarter, we produced the net premium written of almost $6.8 million, which was a slight decline from Q3 2009.
Total net written premium for the Allstate brand increased slightly, but was more than offset by a decline in our Encompass brand. Within the Allstate brand, our Standard Auto net written premium fell by 0.5%, small increases in the first two quarters of the year. Increases in new issued applications of 2.5% and average premium of 1.4% both compared to prior year's quarter, were more than offset by a decline in retention resulting in the premium shortfall. Total units also fell 0.3% sequentially and 1.7% from 3rd quarter 2009.
Homeowner net written premium increased quarter-over-quarter by 2.4%. Increases in average premium driven by approved rate increases in retention were more than enough to offset the 4% decline in total units. The recorded combined ratio for the third quarter was 95.9%, 1.2 points higher than the third quarter 2009. The underlying combined ratio which excludes the effects of catastrophe losses in prior-year reserve re-estimates was 89.2, right in the middle of our annual outlook range we provided at the start of the year.
Catastrophe losses for the quarter were for $386 million on a recorded basis. This result was made up of $371 million of current quarter losses in 29 events, $57 million of additional losses from events occurring early in the year, primarily second quarter hailstorms and a $42 million reduction of prior-year reserves. While the catastrophe loss was much less than the first two quarters, it was still relatively high for a third quarter given the absence of a major hurricane loss.
A few words on prior-year reserve re-estimates. Besides the $42 million reduction in catastrophe loss re-estimates, the third quarter included a $22 million increase for discontinued lines primarily for environmental reserves as we completed our annual reserve study for the discontinued lines and coverages. It also includes a $70 million litigation accrual charge to homeowners.
On Slide 4, we provide a look at auto loss cost trends, which in total remained within our expectations. On the left-hand side of the exhibit we provide the quarterly frequency results for bodily injury and property damage. In both cases, the level of frequency is elevated relative to the previous five years. In the upper right-hand corner, we displayed the paid severity change over time. Here, the results remain very good with only slight increase in the quarter. When these results are combined with those of the remaining coverages in auto loss result as a combined ratio that is fairly flat for the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2009.
On Slide 5, we show similar loss information for homeowners. On the top half of the exhibit, you can see the frequency excluding catastrophe losses was 2.3% less than the third quarter 2009 results. The paid severity excluding catastrophe losses increased 2.1% compared to the third quarter of 2009. With the increase in average earned premium for rate increases working into the results, the underlying loss ratio, which excludes catastrophe losses and prior-year reserve re-estimates improved again this quarter. We continue to execute under profit improvement actions designed to get homeowners to an acceptable level of profitability.
Shifting to Allstate Financial. Slide 6 displays the top and bottom line results for the last two years by quarter. The trends continue to reflect positive momentum in our efforts to produce higher returns, shift our focus to underwritten products versus spread-based products and serve our customers through Allstate Agencies and the Allstate Workplace Division. Premium and deposits on underwritten products increased 8.6% compared to the third quarter of 2009, while annuities declined consistent with our strategic direction.
Operating income for the quarter was $108 million or $13 million more than the third quarter of 2009, I would describe this quarter's result as relatively clean in terms of a one off items. When we adjust the first two quarters of 2010 for these kinds of items, the operating income drops back to a range of $110 million to $115 million for those quarters. The benefit spread was slightly lower due to higher but typical immediate annuity benefits this quarter compared to the third quarter 2009, which had favorable results for that product. The investment spread increased to $127 million reflecting decreased interest credited to contract holder fund, partly offset by a lower net investment income.
Operating costs were slightly elevated this quarter due to higher marketing cost and certain acquisition-related expenses associated with growth and the workplace division premium. The expense reduction actions associated with the focus to win program initiated in 2009 are now substantially complete in the program has met our target. For the quarter, Allstate Financial recorded net income of $85 million versus a net loss of $38 million last year. Realized capital losses were significantly lower this quarter compared to the third quarter of 2009.
At this point, I'll turn it over to Don."
18711,99159608,82807,"Allstate Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","The Allstate Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. I'm going to cover our investment performance for the quarter and the status of our capital position at the end of September. As you can see on Slide 7, the value of our investment portfolio increased to $102.2 billion in the third quarter. L",769,"Thanks, Bob. I'm going to cover our investment performance for the quarter and the status of our capital position at the end of September. As you can see on Slide 7, the value of our investment portfolio increased to $102.2 billion in the third quarter. Largely reflecting the benefit of the decline in interest rates during the quarter. We continue to be proactive in risk management activities. And again this quarter, we reduced exposures in our municipal bond and commercial real estate portfolios while also protecting against an increasing rate environment. We reduced municipal bonds by $2.4 billion of amortized costs in Q3. The reductions targeted specific sectors and higher risk geographies.
Commercial real estate reductions totaled $484 million of amortized cost, and this was accomplished through a combination of maturities and prepayments with some offset due to refinancing activity. The total portfolio maintained a defensive position against interest rate increases. Reinvestment proceeds were placed in shorter duration instruments with derivatives being used to further manage the overall duration.
That said, the continuation of lower rates and combination with our risk mitigation and duration management continues to adversely affect investment income. On Slide 8, you can see that net investment income fell to $1.0 billion, a 4.2% sequential drop and a 7.3% decline from Q3 2009. Property liability investment income dropped 8.4% sequentially and 12.9% from Q3 2009 on reinvestment of the proceeds from our risk mitigation, rate management and investing activities and lower yielding and shorter duration securities, as well as the timing of equity dividends.
Allstate Financial investment income dropped 2.2% sequentially and 5% from Q3 2009, primarily the result of a drop in average portfolio balances. Our return optimization program included purchasing high yield corporate and asset-backed securities which have only partially offset the significant decline in interest rates. We continue to focus our investing activity to optimize both risk and return opportunities.
Net realized capital gains and losses shown on the bottom of the slide improved this quarter. We posted a pretax loss of $144 million compared to a loss of $519 million in Q3 2009. Other than temporary impairments, we're $167 million in the third quarter, less than half the amount experienced in Q3 2009. And they were concentrated primarily in the RMBS and CMBS portfolios.
Trading activity and risk mitigation actions drove net realized capital gains from sales of $319 million in the quarter, $118 million more than last year's third quarter. Most of the gains came from the fixed income portfolio, in particular public corporates, municipal bonds and agency paper. Equities contributed about a third of the gain. The derivatives loss for this quarter at $285 million was slightly better than the loss in Q2 2010, and $76 million better than Q3 2009.
We added additional breakout on this page to show our derivative experience by key risks. Our interest rate hedges produced a loss of $181 million this quarter, $100 million less than Q2 2010 and $219 million less than last year. These losses reflected the continued cost of protecting our portfolio from rising interest rates. Our equity had just lost $115 million as equity rallied about the same as last year's Q3. All this detail can be found in our 10-Q filing.
On Slide 9, you can see that our unrealized net capital gain position improved by $2.3 billion on a pretax basis from Q2 2010. And is $5 billion better than Q3 2009. After tax and DAC withstand at $1.3 billion, $964 million better than Q2 2010. Virtually every asset class participated in this improvement as we benefited this quarter from the declining interest rates and higher equity markets. The improvement in the portfolio valuation more than offset the cost of our risk mitigation programs.
While our net unrealized gain position is clearly a substantial improvement from levels over the past two years in terms of our book value, the current low rate environment that creates this unrealized gain is also the reason we've been actively working to reduce exposure increases and rates.
Finally on Slide 10, we provide you with a look at our capital position on both a GAAP and stat basis. Our overall GAAP equity climbed to $19.3 billion in the third quarter, a little more than 15% increase since year-end. Our current estimates of statutory surplus for Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company showed stable increase in capital levels in these companies. During the third quarter, the holding company received a $400 million dividend from AIC bringing the total for the year to $600 million.
With that, I'll turn it back to Tom."

One was disappointing, one was mix and four where we had strong performance. Let me start with the disappointing. Our auto retention was down as we started managing profits in a couple of big states that offset the benefits from more marketing and the result was that items in our force in our Standard Auto business did not grow this quarter. That's the disappointing part.
The mix. The homeowners is making progress although we still have a high level of Cats. In the good category, our property liability combined ratio was in the middle of the range that we gave to you in February for both the quarter and the nine months. And this is our auto combined ratio has been in the positive zone that's below 100 for over a decade.
Investment results. We have great investment results. Risk mitigation is making a lot of progress on that and our return optimization, obviously, we stayed in the right stuff as we had a good increase in the value of our portfolio.

And also just we'd continue to be curious how much of the PIF decline you're seeing is also tied to -- would also be a customer that potentially is leaving because of the homeowners underwriting actions? The second question I had was just on that SG&A, was curious if whether or not there was a pickup in ad spend just because it's the fall and how's the balls picking up and based off by adds, et cetera. And then the last one quickly was just -- there's obviously, it's in the press that Bank of America is potentially looking to sell Balboa, you've been mentioned, I don't know if that's realistic or not. But I'd be curious as to what the strategic rationale would be for that given that it's predominantly property?"

Let me start with capital, Bob, because we are probably talking about it. We obviously have been doing good job of building capital whether that's a statutory capital or book value from a GAAP basis. We feel good about that. As we've said, the first thing we use with capital make sure our business is sound and stable and in a good position. And given the economy and investment markets over the last year and a half, we've done everything to keep ourselves in the right position and fully capitalized. Second then, we obviously tried to deploy that in growth of the business. The easiest place to do that would be to do it or the most opportunity in place would be do it by growing our business organically and we'd love to do that. We've also said that if there are acquisitions that we think fit we'll do those. You've seen what we've done over time on acquisitions. We're not in the market all the time buying all kinds of stuff. We do try to buy stuff we think will grow us. So the Workplace business was number three when we bought it, it's number two now and we're liking its trend. So we tried to be smart about what we buy. And obviously then we return it to the shareholders we've talked before about our dividend policy, which I have my board look at every quarter. We do that based on sort of a percentage of earnings and I think you should expect this continuing set dividend policy based on the amount of money we make. And if we have capital above that, then we've also bought back stock. We've not announced the stock buyback program today and not about to because I feeling we're in pretty good shape. But if you could look at our track record, I'm returning capital to shareholders, it's been great. So I think you should expect that same philosophy to apply going forward."

Generally, the spread across the broad set of geographies, across a broad set of customer, vintages, if you will, tenure that we have with customers and across most ways that we can look at it. We are seeing a little bit of that spike being an increase in claims that are closed without payments, which might be a little bit of a tail impact on some of what we have see in prior periods. We made a big shift in our claims systems over the past couple of years which is done basically, but it does impact some of the prior period claim practices. So a little bit of that frequency, we think might be some noise out of. But even if you take the noise out there is a bit of an uptick.

There's a core target that has long been its target of a bundled auto and home targeting sort of a mass affluent customer base below the real high end that you see in some high-valued homeowners players. And we do well in that product. It's position well inside of agencies. They like the product, they like its performance. We fit into a well-defined niche there. And broadly, are happy with the performance on any given day, any given quarter. We might want to be a little bit better whether it's growth or profitability. Then there's the second part of the business. A couple of years ago, we tried to expand our targeting to produce more Auto business through that brand. We ended up adding groups of agencies that were more specialist in auto. Broaden the product capability to target that mono line auto and found that our approach both through a combination of distribution and a combination of how we price construction of the product and managed the underwriting wasn't effective in that marketplace. And it hurt us from a profitability perspective. What you're seeing right now running through the numbers is the impact of unwinding that latter part of a book of business. Now as we do that, it had a little bit of a ripple over effect into the core. So that's getting splashed with the cleanup, if you will. As we move through that, we will continue and are continuing to focus on the core niche where Encompass has been affected. I'm very confident that we can be effective in that space, grow that business, make reasonable returns on it and then it's something that's desired by independent agents as distributor and has a good customer proposition. We just have to finish the cleanup of that auto specialists strategy."

The programs we have in place just to refresh your memory, we changed the reward system so both our agencies and our employees benefit from higher customer loyalty. Agencies and that some of there bonuses paid on retention. Our employees and that the profit sharing plan we've switched it from profits to customer loyalty so people's 401(k) matches depending on getting up. So we have the reward side. On the accountability side, we continue to increase the accountability for results and if people don't take good care of our customers, they can't be part of our team. We also have a number of programs underway, underneath that to help us improve loyalty. Everything from calling people, doing protection reviews, calling them when they're bill is late to having better and clear communication. We've launch some sub called Insurance Made Simple. So there's a whole bunch of things that we do along the way which supports both accountability and recognition. One of the challenges we had this quarter was the benefit of all those programs, rewards, accountability and new initiatives did not offset the impact that reasonably large increases in price had in a couple of the big states. So as price goes up, obviously people get unhappy and you'd have to make them even more happy and we just didn't accomplish that.

With regard to income and there are many factors affecting investment income. First, we're in a low rate environment, rates are down, as everybody knows 100 to 150 basis points, 50 basis points in the quarter alone. We also have our proactive stance on risk mitigation and we've been doing that for a couple of years. We think it gives us a lot of flexibility in the portfolio, better positions us going forward. We've been focused largely on commercial real estate and municipal for the past year or so. And I'd say that those programs are largely complete.
We've also done some duration shortening or duration management within the portfolio. And this quarter in particular, we took a hard look at the cash duration in the property and casualty portfolio and made some moves to shortened the cash duration. Because we felt we were using a derivative to a great extent more than we needed to in that portfolio and decided to bring down the cash duration and that impacted income as well. And then just normal trading activity in this low rate environment also impacts investment income. When you look at how to manage it going forward, you talk to any portfolio manager that has fixed income in their portfolio, you've got a situation where rates are low, they could stay low for an extended period of time and then you're looking at less income as a portfolio manager. Rates could decline further which the volume of a portfolio would go up but you end up with earning less. And then if rates rise, the value of the portfolio could fall, would fall but either you have more income. And I guess the actions that we're taking put us in a position where we feel that we have the flexibility to be proactive in managing the portfolio and driving shareholder value."

Sometimes we go on proactively look for stuff. We tend to be relatively conservative in the price we would pay and try to only buy things where we think we can add lots of value. So when we bought the Workplace division, a decade ago, we thought we could expand it geographically across the country, and we did that. We thought we could expand it to sales and Allstate Agencies, we did that. We thought we could expand from small companies to large companies and we did that. When we bought CNA as business had a combined ratio of 117, although Joe is not happy with its combined ratio at 100 it's been substantially below 100 since we've bought it and we've made good money on that. So that's kind of the approach we have.

As noted on Slide 1 of the presentation, this discussion may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate’s operations and actual results may differ materially. So refer to our Form 10-K for 2009, Form 10-Q for the third quarter, and our most recent press release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion may contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our press release and on our website.

I am going to start with a quick overview of results for the quarter. Then Bob will go through each business units, and Don will cover our investment performance, balance sheet and capital positions. Then we’ll open it up for your questions.
In the third quarter we were again successful in executing strategy that creates shareholder value despite a weak economy. So, while we begin, go to Slide 2. In total, we generated $367 million in net income on $7.9 billion of revenue. There was an increase in net income of $146 million. That was primarily due to less realized capital losses this quarter than in Q3 2009.
Operating income was $452 million or $0.83 per share, which was $86 million below the same quarter last year. And that’s a result of lower operating income from Allstate Protection, our property-liability segment. Property-liability had an underlying combined ratio of $89.2 million for the quarter, bringing the full year or the nine months up to $88.8 million. That’s squarely in the middle of our annual outlook of $88 million to $90 million that we provided in February.
We did experience an increase in (inaudible) third quarter but remain comfortable with loss trends. Growing Allstate Protection is critical to our success. While we are able to largely maintain revenues from prior year levels, we need to generate more unit growth.
The Standard Auto policies in force declined from $17.8 million last year to $17.5 million this year, as strong growth in new business in most of the country was offset by declines in several large states where we have taken action to improve profitability. These actions also had a negative impact on improving customer loyalty in the quarter. Since our major competitors also had declines in customer loyalty this quarter, it was really a missed opportunity for us to improve our relative position.
Efforts to improve returns in homeowners and Encompass independent agency business also had a negative impact on growth. New business growth was a result of several things, it was up 2.4%; increased advertising a successful edition of the Mayhem campaign to our marketing programs and targeted pricing actions to improve our auto competitive position.
Homeowners’ profitability remains a concern although progress is being made as our rate actions work into the numbers. Catastrophe losses this quarter were low relative to other third quarters, but we had no major hurricane losses. The amount of non-model cat losses remained at high levels. We continue to see price and tight underwriting standards while we deployed better risk management tools in order to generate acceptable returns.
Allstate Financial continues to generate strategical reposition its business while raising returns. Operating income of $108 million was below the last two quarters due to several positive one-time items earlier in the year. Premium deposit volume was down as expected as we shift from spread-based businesses to mortality-morbidity products. Allstate Financial did grow both the worksite and Allstate agency businesses where premiums and deposits on underwritten products were up 33% and 2% respectively compared to Q3 2009. Allstate Financial also completed its focus to win cost reduction efforts.
Investments had another great quarter from total return perspective as the portfolio continues to generate substantial [cache] and proven value. The net unrealized gain in the portfolio rose to $2.7 billion. This gain reflects lower interest rate and improved valuations on structured securities. While lower interest rates do translate into higher valuations, it puts pressure on operating income. We’ve continued to reduce our municipal bond and real estate holdings, which also puts downward pressure on operating income. Don will cover the impact to that in a few minutes.
The net result of this operating performance was to raise book value per share to $35.48, that’s up 6.7% over the last three months, and is almost 10% higher than the year-ago. And now I’ll let Bob go through the results in greater detail.

In the third quarter, we produced a net premium written of almost $6.8 billion, which was a slight decline from Q3 2009. Total net written premium for the Allstate brand increased slightly but was more than offset by a decline in our Encompass brand. Within the Allstate brand, our Standard Auto net written premium fell by 0.5% after small increases in the first two quarters of the year. Increases in new issued applications of 2.5% and average premium of 1.4%, both compared to prior year’s quarter were more than offset by a decline in retention resulting in the premium shortfall. Total units also fell 0.3% sequentially and 1.7% from third quarter 2009.
Homeowner net written premium increased quarter-over-quarter by 2.4%. Increases in average premium driven by approved rate increases and retention were more than enough to offset the 4% decline in total units.
The recorded combined ratio for the third quarter was 95.9%, 1.2 points higher than the third quarter 2009. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the effects of catastrophe losses and prior-year reserve re-estimates was 89.2, right in the middle of our annual outlook range we provided at the start of the year.
Catastrophe losses for the quarter were $386 million or a recorded basis. This result was made up of $371 million of current quarter losses in 29 events, $57 million of additional losses from events occurring earlier in the year, primarily second quarter hailstorms and a $42 million reduction of prior year reserves. While the catastrophe loss was much less than the first two quarters, it was still relatively high for the third quarter given the absence of a major hurricane loss.
A few words on prior year reserve re-estimates. Besides the $42 million reduction in catastrophe loss re-estimates, the third quarter included a $22 million increase for discontinued lines, primarily for environmental reserves, as we completed our annual reserve study for the discontinued lines for the coverages. It also includes a $70 million litigation accrual charged to homeowners.
On Slide 4, we provide a look at auto loss cost trends which in total remain within our expectations. On the left hand side of the exhibit, we provide the quarterly frequency results for bodily injury and property damage. In both cases, the level of frequency is elevated relative to the previous five years. In the upper right hand corner, we displayed the paid severity change over time. Here the results remain very good with only slight increases in the quarter. When these results are combined with those of the remaining coverages in auto, the result is a combined ratio that is fairly flat for the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2009.
On Slide 5, we show similar loss information for Homeowners. On the top half of the exhibit you can see the frequency excluding catastrophe losses was 2.3% less than the third quarter 2009 results. The paid severity, excluding catastrophe losses, increased 2.1% compared to the third quarter of 2009.
With the increase in average earned premium for rate increases working into the results, the underlying loss ratio, which excludes catastrophe losses and prior year reserve re-estimates improved again this quarter. We continue to execute on our profit improvement actions designed to get homeowners to an acceptable level of profitability.
Shifting to Allstate Financial, Slide 6 displays the top and bottom line results for the last two years by quarter. The trends continue to reflect positive momentum in our efforts to produce higher returns, shift our focus to underwritten products versus spread-based products, and serve our customers through Allstate agencies, and the Allstate workplace division. Premium and deposits on underwritten products increased 8.6% compared to the third quarter of 2009, while annuities declined consistent with our strategic direction.
Operating income for the quarter was $108 million or $13 million more than the third quarter of 2009. I would describe this quarter’s result as relatively clean in terms of one-off items. When we adjust the first two quarters of 2010 for these kinds of items, the operating income drops back to a range of $110 million to $115 million for those quarters. The benefit spread was slightly lower due to higher but typical immediate annuity benefits this quarter compared to the third quarter of 2009 which had favorable results for that product.
The investment spread increased to $127 million reflecting decreased interest credited to contract holder funds, partly offset by lower net investment income. Operating costs were slightly elevated this quarter due to higher marketing costs and certain acquisition related expenses associated with growth in the workplace division premium. The expense reduction actions associated with the Focus to Win program initiated in 2009 are now substantially complete and the program has met our target.
For the quarter, Allstate Financial recorded net income of $85 million versus a net loss of $38 million last year. Realized capital losses were significantly lower this quarter compared to the third quarter of 2009. At this point, I will turn it over to Don.

I am going to cover our investment performance for the quarter, and the status of our capital position at the end of September.As you can see on Slide 7, the value of our investment portfolio increased to $102.2 billion in the third quarter",771,"Thanks, Bob. I am going to cover our investment performance for the quarter, and the status of our capital position at the end of September.
As you can see on Slide 7, the value of our investment portfolio increased to $102.2 billion in the third quarter, largely reflecting the benefit of the decline in interest rates during the quarter. We continue to be proactive in risk management activities and again this quarter, we reduced exposures in our municipal bond and commercial real estate portfolios while also protecting against an increasing rate environment. We reduced municipal bonds by $2.4 billion of amortized cost in Q3. The reductions targeted sectors and higher risk geographies. Commercial real estate reductions totaled $484 million of amortized cost and this was accomplished through a combination of maturities and prepayments with some offset due to refinancing activity. The total portfolio maintained a defensive position against interest rate increases. Reinvestment proceeds were placed in shorter duration instruments with derivatives being used to further manage the overall duration.
That said, the continuation of lower rates in combination with our risk mitigation and duration management continues to adversely affect investment income.
On Slide 8, you can see that net investment income fell to $1.0 billion, a 4.2% sequential drop and a 7.3% decline from Q3 2009. Property-liability investment income dropped 8.4% sequentially and 12.9% from Q3 2009 on reinvestment of the proceeds from our risk mitigation rate management and investing activities and lower yielding and shorter duration securities as well as the timing of equity dividends.
Allstate Financial investment income dropped 2.2% sequentially and 5% from Q3 2009, primarily the result of a drop in average portfolio balances. Our return optimization program included purchasing high yield corporate and asset-backed securities which have only partially offset the significant decline in interest rates. We continue to focus our investing activity to optimize both risk and return opportunities.
Net realized capital gains and losses shown on the bottom of the slide improved this quarter. We posted a pretax loss of $144 million compared to a loss of $519 million in Q3 2009. Other than temporary impairments were $167 million in the third quarter, less than half the amount experienced in Q3 2009. And they were concentrated primarily in the RMBS and CMBS portfolios.
Trading activity and risk mitigation actions drove net realized capital gains from sales of $319 million in the quarter, $118 million more than last year’s third quarter. Most of the gains came from the fixed income portfolio, in particular, public corporates, municipal bonds, and agency paper. Equities contributed about a third of the gain.
The derivatives loss for this quarter at $285 million was slightly better than the loss in Q2 2010 and $76 million better than Q3 2009. We added additional breakout on this page to show our derivative experience by key risk.
Our interest rate hedges produced a loss of $181 million this quarter, a $100 million less than Q2 2010 and $219 million less than last year. These losses reflected the continued cost of protecting our portfolio from rising interest rates. Our equity hedges lost $115 million as equities rallied about the same as last year’s Q3. All these detail can be found in our 10-Q filing.
On Slide 9, you can see that our unrealized net capital gain position improved by $2.3 billion on a pretax basis from Q2 2010 and is $5 billion better than Q3 2009. After tax and after-tax and DAC we stand at $1.3 billion, $964 million better than Q2 2010. Virtually every asset class participated in this improvement as we benefited this quarter from the declined interest rates and higher equity markets. The improvement in the portfolio valuation more than offset the cost of our risk mitigation programs.
While our net unrealized gain position is clearly a substantial improvement from levels over the past two years in terms of our book value, the current low rate environment that creates this unrealized gain is also the reason we’ve been actively working to reduce exposure rates - increases in rates.
Finally on slide10, we provide you with a look at our capital position on both the GAAP and Stat basis. Our overall GAAP equity climbed to $19.3 billion in the third quarter, a little more than 15% increase since yearend. Our current estimates of statutory surplus for Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company shows stabled increase in capital levels in these companies.
During the third quarter, the holding company received a $400 million from AIC bringing the total for the year to $600 million. With that I’ll turn it back to Tom.

Investment results, we had great investment results, risk mitigation making a lot of progress on that and our return optimization obviously we’ve stated the right stuff as we get a good increase in the value of our portfolio. Allstate Financial is focused to win program is done, and it’s got a balanced approach of raising returns and book value is up 7% for the quarter and 15% for the year.

Second then we obviously try to deploy that in growth of the business. The easiest place to do that would be to do it or the less - the most opportune place would be do it by growing our business organically and we’d love to do that.

We are - continue to look at it. It’s generally spread across a broad set of geographies, across a broad set of customer vintages if you will, 10 year we have with customers, and across most ways that we can look at it.
We are seeing a little bit of that spike, be an increase in claims that are closed without payments, which might be a little bit of a tail impact on some of what we’ve seen in prior periods.
We made a big shift in our claim system over the past couple of years, which is at the - which is done basically, but it does impact some of the prior period claim practices. So a little bit of that frequency we think there might be some noise out of that. But even if you take the noise out, there is a bit of an uptick.
We’ve seen some increases in gas purchases and miles driven which would be some correlation to that. I’m not sure where to point where we declared a long-term trend, but we’re watching it.
Relative to the growth question, we don’t give forward-looking growth guidance or production guidance. What I will tell you is that we’re focused on over the long term growing our business.
We are focused on preserving a strong track record of having very powerful margins and we’ll keep those two items in mind as we march forward. I think in the comments we’ve given you is that we’ve got new business up double digits in states other than California and Florida where we’re seeing new business decline year-over-year.
We focused on some specific profitability actions in those geographies and that will work its way through the system at least the new business relative to the year-over-year. We’ve been talking about this for three quarters, so you don’t have a year-over-year problem in another quarter or a quarter-and-a-half, that’s just algebra.
But in terms of where we’re projecting going forward, I’m going to avoid doing that.

I would encourage you to think about the Encompass business right now is having sort of two parts in it. There is core target that it has long been its target of a bundled auto and home targeting sort of a mass affluent customer base below the real high end that you see in some high value at homeowners players. And we do well in that product. It does - it’s positioned well inside of agencies, they like the product, they like its performance. We sit into a well-defined niche there. And broadly, are happy with the performance, on any given day, any given quarter we might want it do a little bit better whether its growth or profitability. Then there is a second part of the business, a couple of years ago we tried to expand our targeting to produce more auto business through that brand, we ended up adding groups of agencies that were more specialize in auto, broaden the product capability to target that monoline auto.
And it sounds that our approach both for a combination of distribution and a combination of how we priced and structured the product and managed the underwriting wasn’t effective in that marketplace. And it hurt us from a profitability perspective. What you’re seeing right now running through the numbers is the impacts of unwinding that latter part of the book of business. Now as we do that it had a little bit of ripple over effect into the quarter. So that’s getting splashed with the cleanup if you will, as we move through that we will continue and are continuing to focus on the core niche were Encompass has been effective.
I’m very confident that we can be effective in that space, grow that business, make reasonable returns on it. And then it’s something that’s desired by independent agents as distributor and has a customer proposition. We just have to finish the cleanup of that auto specialist strategy.

Agencies in that some of their bonuses pay down retention. Our employees and that the profit sharing plan is down, we switch it from profits to customer loyalty. So people for 1K matches dependent getting up. So we have the reward side.
On the accountability side, we’ve continued to increase the accountability for results and if people don’t take good care of our customers and they can’t be part of our team. We also have a number of programs underway, underneath that to help us improve loyalty, everything from calling people doing protection reviews, calling them when their bill is late to having better and clear communication with watch themselves called insurance made simple. So there is a whole bunch of things we do along the way which support both accountability and recognition.
One of the challenges we had this quarter was the benefit of all those programs, rewards, accountability and new initiatives did not offset the impact that reasonably large increases in price had in a couple of the big states. So as price goes up, obviously people get unhappy. And you have to make them even more happy and we just didn’t accomplish that. That said, we didn’t make as much progress in the other parts of the country as we need to. So it will stay a big focus for us.

With regard to income and many factors affecting investment income. First, we’re in a low-rate environment, rates are down as everybody knows 100 to 150 basis points, 50 basis points in the quarter alone. We also have our proactive stand on risk mitigations and we’ve been doing that for a couple of years. We think it gives us a lot of flexibility in the portfolio better positions us going forward. We’ve been focused largely on commercial real estate and municipals for the past year or so. And I’d say that those programs are largely complete.
We’ve also done some durations, shortening or duration management within the portfolio and this quarter in particular we took a hard look at the cash duration in the property and casualty portfolio and made some moves to shorten the cash duration, because we felt we were using a derivatives to a great extent more than we needed to in that portfolio and decided to bring down the cash duration and that impacted the income as well. And then just normal trading activity in this low rate environment also impacted investment income. When you look at how to manage it going forward, you talk to any portfolio manager that has fixed income in their portfolio, you’ve got a situation where rates are low, they could stay low for an extended period of time. And then you’re looking at less income as a portfolio manager.
Rates could decline further which value of the portfolio would go up but you end up with earning less and then if rates rise, the values of portfolio could fall - would fall but you’d earn more income and I guess, the actions that we’re taking put us in a position where we feel that we have the flexibility to be proactive in managing the portfolio and driving shareholder value.

And we’ll factor that into our pricing approach which will include all the things we talked about in terms of managing margins and thinking about how we run this business relative to the entire impact of the corporation.

I’ll come back to what has been our stock answer for that which isn’t going to be very specific to what you asked, which is we look at everything that comes across the market, sometimes we got out proactively look for stuff, we tend to be relatively conservative in the price we will pay unless, and try to only buy things when we think we can add lots of values. So when bought the Workplace Division a decade ago, we thought we could expand it geographically across the country. When we did that, we thought we’d get expanded to sales of Allstate agencies, we did that. We thought we could expand it from small carrier, small companies to large companies, we did that. And when we bought CNA business had a combined ratio of 117, and while Joe’s is not happy with its combine ratio at 100.
It’s been substantially below 100 since we bought it and we’ve made good money on that. So that’s kind of the approach we have. If you - to answer your question about international versus domestic. Much more interested in take - ceasing the opportunity available in the domestic market than international. But if something was appropriately priced and we thought we could add value, we always look at it.

During the Q&A session, we ask you that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up so that we can hear from as many of you as time allows. As is our practice, yesterday we provided our earnings press release, investor supplement and filed our 10-Q for the third quarter of 2010. We also posted a presentation that we will be using on today's call. All of these documents can be found in our website.
As noted on Slide 1 of the presentation, this discussion may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations and actual results may differ materially. So refer to our Form 10-K for 2009, Form 10-Q for the third quarter and our most recent press release for information on potential risks.
Also, this discussion may contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our press release and on our website.

I'm going to start with a quick overview of our results for the quarter then Bob will go through each business unit and Don will cover our investment performance and balance sheet and capital positions. Then we'll open it up for your questions.
In the third quarter, we were again successful in executing strategy that creates shareholder value despite the weak economy. So why don't we begin, go to Slide 2. In total, we generated $367 million net income on $7.9 billion of revenue. There was an increase in net income of $146 million, that was primarily due to less realized capital losses this quarter than in Q3 2009.
Operating income was $452 million or $0.83 per share which was $86 million below the same quarter last year. And that's the result of lower operating income from Allstate Protection, our Property Liability segment. Property Liability had an underlying combined ratio of 89.2 for the quarter, bringing the full year for the nine months up to 88.8. That's squarely in the middle of our annual outlook of 88 to 90 that we provided in February. We did experience an increase in the third quarter, but remained comfortable with loss trends.
Growing Allstate Protection is critical to our success while we are able to largely maintain revenues from prior year levels we need to generate more unit growth. Standard all policies in force declined from $17.8 million last year to $17.5 million this year as strong growth in new business in most of the country was offset by declines in several large states where we've taken action to improve profitability. These actions also had a negative impact on improving customer loyalty in the quarter. Since our major competitors also had declines in customer loyalty this quarter, it was really a missed opportunity for us to improve our relative position.
Efforts to improve returns in homeowners and in Encompass Independent Agency business also had negative impact on growth. New business growth was a result of several things: it was up 2.4%, increased advertising, the successful addition of the Mayhem campaign to our marketing programs and targeted pricing actions to improve our auto competitive position.
Homeowners profitability remains a concern although progress is being made as our rate actions work into the numbers. Catastrophe loss at this quarter were low relative to other third quarters, but we had no major hurricane losses. The amount of none model cat losses remained at high levels. We continue to see price and tightened underwriting standards while we deployed better risk management tools in order to generate acceptable returns.
Allstate Financial continues to generate, to strategically position its business while raising returns. Operating income of $108 million was below the last few quarters due to several positive onetime items earlier in the year. Premium deposit volume was down as expected as we ship from spread-based businesses to more quality and BBB [ph] products. Allstate Financial did grow both the work side and Allstate Agency businesses were premiums and processes on underwritten products were up 33% and 2%, respectively compared to Q3 of 2009.
Allstate Financial also completed its focus to win cost reduction efforts. Investments had another great quarter from a total return perspective as the portfolio continues to generate substantial cash and improve in value. The net unrealized gain on the portfolio rose to $2.7 billion. This gain reflects lower interest rates and improved valuation on structured securities. While lower interest rates do translate into higher valuations, it puts pressure on operating income. We've continued to reduce our municipal bonds and real estate holdings, which also puts downward pressure on operating income. Don will cover the impact on that in a few minutes.
The net result of this operating performance was to raise book value per share to 35.48, that's up 6.7% over the last three months and is almost 10% higher than a year ago.
And now let's have Bob go through the results in greater detail."
18711,99159608,83157,"Allstate Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","The Allstate Corporation","Executives","Turning to Slide 3. Here are the Property-Liability premium and underwriting income results. In the third quarter, we produced the net premium written of almost $6.8 million, which was a slight decline from Q3 2009.Total net written premium for the Alls",840,"Turning to Slide 3. Here are the Property-Liability premium and underwriting income results. In the third quarter, we produced the net premium written of almost $6.8 million, which was a slight decline from Q3 2009.
Total net written premium for the Allstate brand increased slightly, but was more than offset by a decline in our Encompass brand. Within the Allstate brand, our Standard Auto net written premium fell by 0.5%, small increases in the first two quarters of the year. Increases in new issued applications of 2.5% and average premium of 1.4% both compared to prior year's quarter, were more than offset by a decline in retention resulting in the premium shortfall. Total units also fell 0.3% sequentially and 1.7% from 3rd quarter 2009.
Homeowner net written premium increased quarter-over-quarter by 2.4%. Increases in average premium driven by approved rate increases in retention were more than enough to offset the 4% decline in total units. The recorded combined ratio for the third quarter was 95.9%, 1.2 points higher than the third quarter 2009. The underlying combined ratio which excludes the effects of catastrophe losses in prior-year reserve re-estimates was 89.2, right in the middle of our annual outlook range we provided at the start of the year.
Catastrophe losses for the quarter were for $386 million on a recorded basis. This result was made up of $371 million of current quarter losses in 29 events, $57 million of additional losses from events occurring early in the year, primarily second quarter hailstorms and a $42 million reduction of prior-year reserves. While the catastrophe loss was much less than the first two quarters, it was still relatively high for a third quarter given the absence of a major hurricane loss.
A few words on prior-year reserve re-estimates. Besides the $42 million reduction in catastrophe loss re-estimates, the third quarter included a $22 million increase for discontinued lines primarily for environmental reserves as we completed our annual reserve study for the discontinued lines and coverages. It also includes a $70 million litigation accrual charge to homeowners.
On Slide 4, we provide a look at auto loss cost trends, which in total remained within our expectations. On the left-hand side of the exhibit we provide the quarterly frequency results for bodily injury and property damage. In both cases, the level of frequency is elevated relative to the previous five years. In the upper right-hand corner, we displayed the paid severity change over time. Here, the results remain very good with only slight increase in the quarter. When these results are combined with those of the remaining coverages in auto loss result as a combined ratio that is fairly flat for the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2009.
On Slide 5, we show similar loss information for homeowners. On the top half of the exhibit, you can see the frequency excluding catastrophe losses was 2.3% less than the third quarter 2009 results. The paid severity excluding catastrophe losses increased 2.1% compared to the third quarter of 2009. With the increase in average earned premium for rate increases working into the results, the underlying loss ratio, which excludes catastrophe losses and prior-year reserve re-estimates improved again this quarter. We continue to execute under profit improvement actions designed to get homeowners to an acceptable level of profitability.
Shifting to Allstate Financial. Slide 6 displays the top and bottom line results for the last two years by quarter. The trends continue to reflect positive momentum in our efforts to produce higher returns, shift our focus to underwritten products versus spread-based products and serve our customers through Allstate Agencies and the Allstate Workplace Division. Premium and deposits on underwritten products increased 8.6% compared to the third quarter of 2009, while annuities declined consistent with our strategic direction.
Operating income for the quarter was $108 million or $13 million more than the third quarter of 2009, I would describe this quarter's result as relatively clean in terms of a one off items. When we adjust the first two quarters of 2010 for these kinds of items, the operating income drops back to a range of $110 million to $115 million for those quarters. The benefit spread was slightly lower due to higher but typical immediate annuity benefits this quarter compared to the third quarter 2009, which had favorable results for that product. The investment spread increased to $127 million reflecting decreased interest credited to contract holder fund, partly offset by a lower net investment income.
Operating costs were slightly elevated this quarter due to higher marketing cost and certain acquisition-related expenses associated with growth and the workplace division premium. The expense reduction actions associated with the focus to win program initiated in 2009 are now substantially complete in the program has met our target. For the quarter, Allstate Financial recorded net income of $85 million versus a net loss of $38 million last year. Realized capital losses were significantly lower this quarter compared to the third quarter of 2009.
At this point, I'll turn it over to Don."

I'm going to cover our investment performance for the quarter and the status of our capital position at the end of September. As you can see on Slide 7, the value of our investment portfolio increased to $102.2 billion in the third quarter. L",769,"Thanks, Bob. I'm going to cover our investment performance for the quarter and the status of our capital position at the end of September. As you can see on Slide 7, the value of our investment portfolio increased to $102.2 billion in the third quarter. Largely reflecting the benefit of the decline in interest rates during the quarter. We continue to be proactive in risk management activities. And again this quarter, we reduced exposures in our municipal bond and commercial real estate portfolios while also protecting against an increasing rate environment. We reduced municipal bonds by $2.4 billion of amortized costs in Q3. The reductions targeted specific sectors and higher risk geographies.
Commercial real estate reductions totaled $484 million of amortized cost, and this was accomplished through a combination of maturities and prepayments with some offset due to refinancing activity. The total portfolio maintained a defensive position against interest rate increases. Reinvestment proceeds were placed in shorter duration instruments with derivatives being used to further manage the overall duration.
That said, the continuation of lower rates and combination with our risk mitigation and duration management continues to adversely affect investment income. On Slide 8, you can see that net investment income fell to $1.0 billion, a 4.2% sequential drop and a 7.3% decline from Q3 2009. Property liability investment income dropped 8.4% sequentially and 12.9% from Q3 2009 on reinvestment of the proceeds from our risk mitigation, rate management and investing activities and lower yielding and shorter duration securities, as well as the timing of equity dividends.
Allstate Financial investment income dropped 2.2% sequentially and 5% from Q3 2009, primarily the result of a drop in average portfolio balances. Our return optimization program included purchasing high yield corporate and asset-backed securities which have only partially offset the significant decline in interest rates. We continue to focus our investing activity to optimize both risk and return opportunities.
Net realized capital gains and losses shown on the bottom of the slide improved this quarter. We posted a pretax loss of $144 million compared to a loss of $519 million in Q3 2009. Other than temporary impairments, we're $167 million in the third quarter, less than half the amount experienced in Q3 2009. And they were concentrated primarily in the RMBS and CMBS portfolios.
Trading activity and risk mitigation actions drove net realized capital gains from sales of $319 million in the quarter, $118 million more than last year's third quarter. Most of the gains came from the fixed income portfolio, in particular public corporates, municipal bonds and agency paper. Equities contributed about a third of the gain. The derivatives loss for this quarter at $285 million was slightly better than the loss in Q2 2010, and $76 million better than Q3 2009.
We added additional breakout on this page to show our derivative experience by key risks. Our interest rate hedges produced a loss of $181 million this quarter, $100 million less than Q2 2010 and $219 million less than last year. These losses reflected the continued cost of protecting our portfolio from rising interest rates. Our equity had just lost $115 million as equity rallied about the same as last year's Q3. All this detail can be found in our 10-Q filing.
On Slide 9, you can see that our unrealized net capital gain position improved by $2.3 billion on a pretax basis from Q2 2010. And is $5 billion better than Q3 2009. After tax and DAC withstand at $1.3 billion, $964 million better than Q2 2010. Virtually every asset class participated in this improvement as we benefited this quarter from the declining interest rates and higher equity markets. The improvement in the portfolio valuation more than offset the cost of our risk mitigation programs.
While our net unrealized gain position is clearly a substantial improvement from levels over the past two years in terms of our book value, the current low rate environment that creates this unrealized gain is also the reason we've been actively working to reduce exposure increases and rates.
Finally on Slide 10, we provide you with a look at our capital position on both a GAAP and stat basis. Our overall GAAP equity climbed to $19.3 billion in the third quarter, a little more than 15% increase since year-end. Our current estimates of statutory surplus for Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company showed stable increase in capital levels in these companies. During the third quarter, the holding company received a $400 million dividend from AIC bringing the total for the year to $600 million.
With that, I'll turn it back to Tom."

One was disappointing, one was mix and four where we had strong performance. Let me start with the disappointing. Our auto retention was down as we started managing profits in a couple of big states that offset the benefits from more marketing and the result was that items in our force in our Standard Auto business did not grow this quarter. That's the disappointing part.
The mix. The homeowners is making progress although we still have a high level of Cats. In the good category, our property liability combined ratio was in the middle of the range that we gave to you in February for both the quarter and the nine months. And this is our auto combined ratio has been in the positive zone that's below 100 for over a decade.
Investment results. We have great investment results. Risk mitigation is making a lot of progress on that and our return optimization, obviously, we stayed in the right stuff as we had a good increase in the value of our portfolio. Allstate Financial is focused to win program is done and it's got a balanced approach of raising returns and book value is up 7% for the quarter and 15% for the year.

We see some of that rippling through retention in California and a couple of other states. It's driven again by trying to get our selection mix from underwriting perspective in the right spot and getting our pricing where we want it to be. From a homeowners perspective, there is some impact, but not a big impact on the homeowners actions that we're taking. We have talked before about a preferred package discount that we used from a pricing perspective that makes it more attractive to have your auto and home with us, and that helps mitigate some of that issue."

Let me start with capital, Bob, because we are probably talking about it. We obviously have been doing good job of building capital whether that's a statutory capital or book value from a GAAP basis. We feel good about that. As we've said, the first thing we use with capital make sure our business is sound and stable and in a good position. And given the economy and investment markets over the last year and a half, we've done everything to keep ourselves in the right position and fully capitalized. Second then, we obviously tried to deploy that in growth of the business. The easiest place to do that would be to do it or the most opportunity in place would be do it by growing our business organically and we'd love to do that. We've also said that if there are acquisitions that we think fit we'll do those. You've seen what we've done over time on acquisitions. We're not in the market all the time buying all kinds of stuff. We do try to buy stuff we think will grow us. So the Workplace business was number three when we bought it, it's number two now and we're liking its trend. So we tried to be smart about what we buy. And obviously then we return it to the shareholders we've talked before about our dividend policy, which I have my board look at every quarter. We do that based on sort of a percentage of earnings and I think you should expect this continuing set dividend policy based on the amount of money we make. And if we have capital above that, then we've also bought back stock. We've not announced the stock buyback program today and not about to because I feeling we're in pretty good shape. But if you could look at our track record, I'm returning capital to shareholders, it's been great. So I think you should expect that same philosophy to apply going forward."

Generally, the spread across the broad set of geographies, across a broad set of customer, vintages, if you will, tenure that we have with customers and across most ways that we can look at it. We are seeing a little bit of that spike being an increase in claims that are closed without payments, which might be a little bit of a tail impact on some of what we have see in prior periods. We made a big shift in our claims systems over the past couple of years which is done basically, but it does impact some of the prior period claim practices. So a little bit of that frequency, we think might be some noise out of. But even if you take the noise out there is a bit of an uptick. We've seen some increases in gas purchases and miles driven which we -- some correlation to that. I'm not sure where to point we declared a long-term trend but we're watching them.

There's a core target that has long been its target of a bundled auto and home targeting sort of a mass affluent customer base below the real high end that you see in some high-valued homeowners players. And we do well in that product. It's position well inside of agencies. They like the product, they like its performance. We fit into a well-defined niche there. And broadly, are happy with the performance on any given day, any given quarter. We might want to be a little bit better whether it's growth or profitability. Then there's the second part of the business. A couple of years ago, we tried to expand our targeting to produce more Auto business through that brand. We ended up adding groups of agencies that were more specialist in auto. Broaden the product capability to target that mono line auto and found that our approach both through a combination of distribution and a combination of how we price construction of the product and managed the underwriting wasn't effective in that marketplace. And it hurt us from a profitability perspective. What you're seeing right now running through the numbers is the impact of unwinding that latter part of a book of business. Now as we do that, it had a little bit of a ripple over effect into the core. So that's getting splashed with the cleanup, if you will. As we move through that, we will continue and are continuing to focus on the core niche where Encompass has been affected. I'm very confident that we can be effective in that space, grow that business, make reasonable returns on it and then it's something that's desired by independent agents as distributor and has a good customer proposition.

Agencies and that some of there bonuses paid on retention. Our employees and that the profit sharing plan we've switched it from profits to customer loyalty so people's 401(k) matches depending on getting up. So we have the reward side. On the accountability side, we continue to increase the accountability for results and if people don't take good care of our customers, they can't be part of our team.

Everything from calling people, doing protection reviews, calling them when they're bill is late to having better and clear communication. We've launch some sub called Insurance Made Simple.

With regard to income and there are many factors affecting investment income. First, we're in a low rate environment, rates are down, as everybody knows 100 to 150 basis points, 50 basis points in the quarter alone. We also have our proactive stance on risk mitigation and we've been doing that for a couple of years. We think it gives us a lot of flexibility in the portfolio, better positions us going forward. We've been focused largely on commercial real estate and municipal for the past year or so. And I'd say that those programs are largely complete.
We've also done some duration shortening or duration management within the portfolio. And this quarter in particular, we took a hard look at the cash duration in the property and casualty portfolio and made some moves to shortened the cash duration. Because we felt we were using a derivative to a great extent more than we needed to in that portfolio and decided to bring down the cash duration and that impacted income as well. And then just normal trading activity in this low rate environment also impacts investment income. When you look at how to manage it going forward, you talk to any portfolio manager that has fixed income in their portfolio, you've got a situation where rates are low, they could stay low for an extended period of time and then you're looking at less income as a portfolio manager. Rates could decline further which the volume of a portfolio would go up but you end up with earning less. And then if rates rise, the value of the portfolio could fall, would fall but either you have more income. And I guess the actions that we're taking put us in a position where we feel that we have the flexibility to be proactive in managing the portfolio and driving shareholder value."

The actions we've taken in the past are functions of a what we thought was going on in maybe a very short-term view of where we think frequency might be headed. My comments before suggested that we're seeing some of these increases in the relatively recent periods. Parts of them when we look period-over-period, we think are a little bit attributable to the claim system changes we made over the past couple of years and parts of it appear to be more broad and environmental. And we're going to watch and see what's happening with those trends. See if in fact they are trends or a near-term anomaly and will factor that into our pricing approach, which will include all the things we talked about in terms of managing margins and thinking about how we run this business relative to the entire impact of the corporation."

I'll come back to what has been our stock answer with that which isn't going to be very specific to what you asked, which is we look at everything that comes across the market. Sometimes we go on proactively look for stuff. We tend to be relatively conservative in the price we would pay and try to only buy things where we think we can add lots of value. So when we bought the Workplace division, a decade ago, we thought we could expand it geographically across the country, and we did that. We thought we could expand it to sales and Allstate Agencies, we did that. We thought we could expand from small companies to large companies and we did that. When we bought CNA as business had a combined ratio of 117, although Joe is not happy with its combined ratio at 100 it's been substantially below 100 since we've bought it and we've made good money on that. So that's kind of the approach we have. To answer your question about international versus domestic, much more interested in seizing the opportunity available in the domestic market than international. But if something was appropriately priced and we thought we could add value, we always look at it."
