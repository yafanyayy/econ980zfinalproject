I hope you share our enthusiasm for all that was accomplished in 2009 and the financial results that we're able to produce during what was certainly a challenging economic environment.

I hope you share our enthusiasm for all that was accomplished in 2009 and the financial results that we're able to produce during what was certainly a challenging economic environment. I think we reacted appropriately to the downturn with the expense reductions that we have planned and inventory management and lowering our capital expenditures. We were able to completely transform Macy's by eliminating our historic division structure, some of which was our own and some of which we inherited through acquisition. But putting in place a very innovative My Macy's structure that we're quite excited about. As important as the change in the structure itself is the change in culture. It's been critical and critically important to see the transformation of the way we're just thinking about localizing our assortment offering and becoming much more of a customer-centric company.You will recall that my saying in February of last year that we would use 2009 to implement all the organization changes and put in the best talent and all of the key positions from around the various divisions that we had and to make any other changes, structural or otherwise, that we thought would be the right thing and that we had contemplated in the past. We wanted to do all of that as much as possible in 2009 so that we would be in a great position to take advantage of a leaner, meaner organization going into the 2010 period. And not everybody thought that, that was a good idea. In fact, some predicted a major disruption for 2009 and poor results to follow. And I'm just glad to report that, that just did not happen. Our sales performance was strong relative to most of our competitors, and we improved our EBIT rate by 60 basis points. We grew EPS by 12%, we increased our return on invested capital by 30 basis points and we generated approximately $1.4 billion in cash before financing activities. And I'm just incredibly proud of our organization and my senior management team that led us through all of this change while staying focused on executing the business.We're just beginning to see the potential of our new unified organization with the My Macy's field structure. The new team is working more closely with our vendor partners than ever before, most of whom are here in New York City. So they're just down the street from us. It makes it very easy for us to meet with our vendors on a very frequent basis. And we're making decisions faster as a result of that and marketing our ideas more effectively. And the My Macy's structure especially in our original pilot districts enabled us to eliminate the regional divisions without loosing sales in those markets. We've never been able to do that before. Whenever we were consolidating in the past, we were always worried about loosing sales. And this time, we held on to the sales in a very effective way. So we know it worked. We know the My Macy's structure was the reason for that to happen. In fact, this structure with the 69 districts in eight regions now that's fully operational and across the country has actually brought us much closer to the customer than we were with our former division structure. I'm also encouraged by what I've seen in the stores that I visited over the past six months, which have been many. I just made it a high priority for myself to be in stores every single week, and that's been without fail. The My Macy's structure and change in culture is just powerful. I'm even more excited now than I was last year when we're putting this together because I've seen it at work.There's three key benefits of how we're operating our My Macy's structure: First, it's just greater attention to detail. There's just more experienced eyes and ears and hands that are on the floor. I mean, remember, these are -- the people living in these 69 districts, many of them are former buyers and former planners from the central organizations that we relocated to these cities. And they have got this different set of eyes and ears when they're walking through the floor, and just in terms of their experience and what they bring to these new roles. And this allows us to do a much better job meeting the local needs of our assortments. And because they have a sense about what's available and that they're zeroing in on size and color and fabric weight differences. And we're now able to do a much better job of making our floors look more exciting again with this experience that they're bringing to the store's organization.Secondly, we're maximizing the opportunities of providing localized assortments, including those supporting local events and holidays. First, birthdays is something that was brought our attention in Hawaii that we're responding to them on a local basis. We were getting good at taking care of these big events. And this year, there was no exception. We sold a ton of merchandise in New Orleans around the Super Bowl. We were ready for it. We were ready for either team to win. But when New Orleans won, we were fast into action and sold a ton of inventory around before the game and after.And then Kentucky Derby, now we're responding locally to the local opportunities of dresses and hats and the like in that particular market. So there's lots and lots of these opportunities of maximizing local activities. And we can utilize local vendors like Patricia Locke Jewelry, which is based in Chicago for our Chicago stores; or Betsy Ann Chocolates in Pittsburgh, brings that localization and uniqueness to another level when we do that.The third is we are executing the central ideas better and faster as a result of our new structure. We saw an opportunity in the fourth quarter, as an example, with fashion watches, particularly in the sport digital looks and the color category. And we were able to expand case line presentations, negotiate for exclusive styles and position these goods in higher traffic locations. And we're able to react quicker, respond quicker, work with our vendors with one order and one buyer, making these decisions. And as a result of all of that, we were able to execute this across the country in a much more consistent fashion. And as a result, that business category or these fashion watches was up 10% for the fourth quarter, and that's clearly a result of taking action as we did.So those are just three ways of how it's working. But let me give you a few examples of some of the My Macy's successes of this recent period. It's just taken from a single category, just women's footwear, there's a little bit of men's footwear in here too, but primarily women's. But I want to give you a little bit of sense of the potential because again, this is just a little minor piece of all the activity that's beginning to happen.First at our State Street Chicago location, where our selling associates called out to our district team that there was high demand for basic wear-to-work pumps. And our State Street customer is heavily skewed to business professionals. And as the districts' merchants and planners walked the selling floor, we were in a great shape with fashion shoes and a great boot selection. But we didn't really have this comfortable basic pump that this woman was looking for. And the selling associates called it out to us. And so our customers told us exactly what they wanted. So we partnered with our central merchants and central planners in New York, and they went to the market. They specifically asked the vendors to provide them with what they were looking for in the store. And we sent the e-mail, digital photos, to the State Street store. And they had the selling associates along with the district planners worked together with customers and showing assortment of digitally and say, ""If we have these, would these be the kind of shoes that you'd be looking for?"" Long story short, we put this inventory that was directed by the store and the selling associates, and basically, the customers into the State Street store, and we've got an instant response from this product. And there's longer lead time on this but still the majority inventory is still coming in. But we're not waiting, we're taking advantage of downtown Washington DC and other cities where we know we have this career customer that's walking in the market and taking advantage of these things that we're learning.So that's just one example of that. But next is -- by the way, the business in that category, they're 20% in Chicago. So again, in an environment we just come off to note that we're able to drive the business so successfully, it's really because we're listening and responding to the customer. And we're in a position to be able to do that. Second is in fall of 2008, the new women's shoe district planner and the upper Midwest noted that functional cold weather boots were always depleted right around the holiday season. And when we bought it, but they just sold it so consistently in that particular part of the country. And we were never able to maximize and staying up with demand, and particularly after the holidays. So the stores continually talk about this to our district planners. And so we put in to place an action to do this in advance to buy in advance so that for that for fall 2009, and this was one of the pilot districts, we would be able to expand our offerings, set up a cold weather boot visual shop, ship  deliveries and then keep the inventory moving longer after the holiday period. And here again, we picked up 27% over the prior year just by focusing on the specific request of the store. And once again, we asked the store to describe for us, ""What do you mean exactly when it comes to this functional footwear?"" And they told us. So we let them help choose the product.And another example is completely different category is the sandal category. And we identified an opportunity to distort sandals in Florida. And even though it's cold in Florida, we sold a ton of sandals there. But it gave us great test, a sort of test and react. So we brought it in, in October and November and December and got a read from that. And as a result of what we learned in Florida, we picked up, we tested these embellished with sequin and mosaic top flat sandals and bought 2,000 for Florida. And in one particular pair ordered 120,000 for the rest of the country for April, May deliveries, and the same thing for a second EDV program that we have. We bought 2,000 for Florida and we're rolling at 220,000 for the country. So we've got this test and react early read that we believe will give us some fashion trends, but believe now will respond in a much quicker basis and do so on a national basis. Before, Florida was it's own division. And while we would report and mention it, the stores hadn't, or the buyer in Atlanta or the buyer in San Francisco, it wasn't her buyer or it wasn't his buyer, and it wasn't their experience. So they weren't actually sure whether that would sell there would translate [ph]. Now it's the same buyer making these decisions, and they can tweak and adjust for certain markets. But they know flat embellished sandals are going to sell in many parts of the country. And so we can jump on these trends and move more quickly.So those are just three examples from one category, just again to give you a flavor of some of the activity that's going on. Our top priority in 2010 is to continue to refine and fine tune all that we are doing here, keep learning, keep understanding how to do it better, what examples should be shared and just focus on executing and maximizing the potential of My Macy's. We'll also continue to focus on our four priorities of course that support My Macy's and our customer-centric culture. And the four priorities, you might remember, differentiating our service is very important, having obvious value throughout our store, upgrading our shopping experience and then making sure that our marketing is unique and that we focus on both brand marketing, as well as demand marketing, and that we do that differently than our competitors.Looking at the big picture, of course, I do worry about some of the macroeconomic issues. And I know that some people are saying that those are behind us. Look, business feels better, there's no question about it. But we still have high unemployment, and I still see tightening credit on consumers and issues of that nature. So I'm not going to be -- just bury those ideas and play ostrich. Those are real and company of our size must recognize that macroeconomics do matter. But we are planning to grow the business at both Macy's and Bloomingdale's and we'll continue to fuel our online business. And we're beginning an outlet strategy at Bloomingdale's, as I think you know. And we feel really, really good and that we are poised to aggressively go after any sales opportunities as we see them unfold and do so in a profitable way. So we feel real comfortable where we're at. Our inventory position is in good shape. It's fresh, it's current and we're ready to strike as we see the opportunities in individual markets and individual stores open up for us.So let me turn it back over to Karen. And at the end of her comments, we'll both be glad to take your questions."

I'll just hit the highlights of our fourth quarter performance and then on to 2010.Sales in the quarter were $7.8 billion. And on a comp store basis, sales were down 0.8%, which is better than the minus 1% to minus 2% we had anticipated. Th",1426,"Thanks, Terry. I'll just hit the highlights of our fourth quarter performance and then on to 2010.Sales in the quarter were $7.8 billion. And on a comp store basis, sales were down 0.8%, which is better than the minus 1% to minus 2% we had anticipated. This is a big improvement over the third quarter's minus 3.6%. And on a two-year basis, the fourth quarter improved to minus 3.9% from minus 4.8% in the third quarter. This acceleration in trend is encouraging.The key points to make about the strengths and weaknesses by family of business and geography are as follows: At first, the My Macy's pilots continue to outperform the other Macy's store's sales growth, although the gap did narrow in the fourth quarter now that we're seeing the benefit in all of the doors.For 2009, all 10 of our districts with the best sales performance versus last year were in fact pilot My Macy's districts. I should add that this will be the last call when we talk about pilots because My Macy's is now functional across the whole company.Geographically, we had good business across the country in the fourth quarter, with some of our strongest performing markets being Chicago, Oregon and Salt Lake City, all of which were My Macy's pilot districts. Bloomingdale's had a terrific fourth quarter with a significant improvement in sales versus earlier in the year.We are seeing more balance in the business with customers willing to buy brands that are better as long as the price relationship is fair. This bodes well for our 2010 business. By business, the major areas of strength in the quarter were shoes, men's and women's moderate apparel, Missy updated collections, men's collections and home, most notably mattresses, luggage, housewares and textiles.The common denominators of success included cold weather, private and exclusive brands like Martha Stewart or Tommy Hilfiger, and affordable trend-right newness. The weaker businesses in the quarter were dresses, traditional better women's sportswear, Christmas trim, men's suites, fragrances and handbags. The average unit retail was flat versus last year for Macy's in the quarter. We believe we have done a very good job balancing moderate intensification where appropriate by location while continuing to drive fashion and newness. At Bloomingdale's in the quarter, the average unit retail was above a year ago. And our Internet businesses continued to produce terrific results with a 27% increase in the fourth quarter. We believe the ability to better integrate the Internet with our stores provides continued great growth potential for the company as we go forward.  Gross margin in the quarter was 41.7%, up 240 basis points over last year's 39.3%. This performance was terrific. It is even 10 basis points higher than in 2007. We ended the year with inventory approximately 3% below last year. And on a comp store basis, it was lower than that. We were very comfortable with both the level and the content of our inventory as we started 2010. The fourth quarter margin was better than expected, benefiting from the stronger sales, as well as terrific inventory management.SG&A in the fourth quarter was $2.2 billion or 28.2% of sales. This is $44 million or 2% below a year ago and 20 basis points lower as a percent of sales. SG&A was lower than expected, due in part to better credit performance, the Visa settlement and lower stock-based compensation expense from the lower-than-expected stock price.Operating income or EBIT before consolidation costs and the asset goodwill impairment charges was $1,060,000,000, up 22% over last year and well ahead of our expectation. In the fourth quarter, we booked $71 million in consolidation and store closing-related charges. This is the end of the consolidation-related charges. And for the year as a whole, we booked $276 million, which when combined with the $30 million booked in the fourth quarter of last year, totals $306 million, which is well below the $400 million we had anticipated. We also booked $115 million in asset impairment charges in the fourth quarter this year related to approximately 20 of our properties. In these locations, the projected cash flow did not justify their book values.EPS on a diluted basis, excluding the unusual items, was $1.40 including the $0.05 tax settlement in the fourth quarter. This represents a 32% increase over the $1.06 we reported last year on the same basis.And for the full year, EPS on a diluted basis excluding the unusual items was $1.41, up 12% over last year's $1.26. We are very proud of that performance given the challenging conditions under which we operated combined with a company transformation that we executed through the year.Cash flow this past year also was very strong. Net cash provided by operating activities was only $116 million below a year ago on $1.4 billion lower sales, and we've more than offset that with reduced capital spending and higher asset sales. Net cash before financing activities was $1.37 billion versus $1.07 billion last year. Even after repaying over $950 million in debt, we increased cash by $300 million this year and ended 2009 with $1.7 billion of cash in the balance sheet. Return on invested capital for the full year was 14.9% versus 14.6% last year. Details of the calculation can be found on our website. Given the comp store sales decline, we are very pleased with this performance. So let's move on to 2010. As Terry mentioned, while not at all is uncertain as last year, there is still some concern about economic conditions we'll face in 2010. We are, however, feeling cautiously optimistic, especially about what we can control. We are assuming annual comp store sales growth in 2010 of plus 1% to 2%. And for the full year, we are expecting EPS on a diluted basis of $1.55 to $1.60. We are expecting EBIT rate improvement in 2010, which should result from a combination of a higher gross margin rate and a lower SG&A rate.While the SG&A rate is expected to improve, we are assuming SG&A dollars above last year. We are saving at least the annual $400 million to which we committed last year, but there are unfortunately other increases that offset some of those savings. For example, pension expense is planned up approximately $30 million in 2010. Depreciation and amortization is estimated at $1.18 billion for the year, with approximately $575 million to $580 million expected in the first half of the year. We are expecting SG&A dollars to be up over last year in the first half of the year and flattish in dollars relative to last year in the back half of the year.Our expense savings exceeded our expectations in the first half of 2009, in part because people left earlier than we had assumed, and hence, by the way, the lower severance and the one-time costs and also because people stopped spending money last spring on what I would characterize as non-critical activities during the early days of the transition. We didn't fully understand the magnitude of this until we started planning spring 2010. Also, the final piece of the expected savings coming from the transformation is the application of best practices to our stores, and that will take several months to be fully implemented.The reverse is happening with gross margin rate in terms of the timing of expected improvement. We are assuming all of the improvement that we expect to happen in 2010 to occur in the spring season, with a gross margin rate in the fall that is flattish to last year. Interest expense for the year is assumed to be approximately $540 million with approximately $275 million to $280 million in the first half of the year. And the tax rate should be assumed at 37% for the year as a whole. But as you know, it can vary by quarter.Our capital budget for 2010 is $550 million. We believe that by 2012, we will be spending at an annual level of approximately $800 million in capital. But given the lack of new store opportunities currently, we do not need to spend that amount yet. Our current estimate for the 2010 pension contribution is $325 million. And in fact, given our excess cash position, we made this contribution yesterday. We may or may not make an additional contribution later in the year.So that's a quick overview of the fourth quarter and our 2010 outlook. We are obviously very pleased with our performance and very excited about the potential for the transformed company. And now Terry and I will take any questions you have."

So what we just need -- the first four locations, look, we went out and negotiated with a couple of the key real estate developers, and Simon, of course, being a big one here. And so that was not any more complicated than that. We worked with them on what would be the right locations to get started. But we clearly have a goal of expanding this concept as soon as we get it right. But we're new at the business. We've got new people running the business for us. And we want to make sure we just get it right, the size right, the content right and what percent goes to this category, what percent goes to that category. So those learnings, that's all we need to fine tune the learnings for some period of time. And I don't know how it'd be, six months, 12 months, or something of that nature. I don't think much longer than that before we understand how to get the most productivity out of the box, and then we'll expand from there. They are the very big wide open arms out there in the developer community for us to participate here. And as far as the online is concerned, I think we were early in setting up state-of-the-art fulfillment centers. We've been continuing to upgrade our website and our talent pool here. We feel very good about the growth prospects in front of us. I do think Macy's is further along than Bloomingdale's. So we've got much more opportunity to help Bloomingdale's with some of both the infrastructure and web navigation opportunities there. But having said that, Bloomingdale's is very well-developed as a percent of their store line business. So I just think that we've got just tons more opportunity here and a big, big push for us in 2010 will be to go after the multi-channel consumer, so the consumer who's online, shopping with us, driving her to the stores. I always tell my stores, ""When you get a return from an online customer, give her a big hug because this is the chance for you to take this customer and turn her into a store customer. And almost always, when she returns $100, she buys $130 in the store."" So I really want to encourage this multi-channel opportunity in 2010. The same is true for the stores is using our systems in store to be able to sell customers products online as well."

There are still out there. But at least in our case, I feel really good, Adrianne, about -- we're sitting here in position with ability to launch inventory, to go after categories with communication coming from our field. And we just feel like it's a competitive advantage that cannot and will not be duplicated. People are not going to start and put in another 1,500 people out there to manage a field of district structure that we have. So we feel so strongly that it's a great advantage for us. So my belief is that we accomplished that in the initial rollout of the pilot districts. And as time goes on, we're starting to see the others, 49 districts catching up for those opportunities. And I think market share comes from an individual store. As I started to say earlier, I think rather than calling a market share a national strategy, I think market share comes from individual consumers, wallet share and individual stores, individual markets and districts. And that's where we're going to make progress is when we are more relevant to the consumer than our competitors are. So I still believe there's a lot more of that opportunity that's out there as opposed to just the general economics improving where all boats rise. I think that some boats will rise, and I'm counting on Macy's and Bloomingdale's to be among them."

I think that and the difference is, Adrianne, these promotions are planned promotions. 2009, they were planned promotions and 2010 will be planned promotions. So I don't think it's going to be a significantly different promotional calendar this year than last, particularly in the second half of last year. We'll tweak and fine tune of course, but I don't believe it'll be that much different. And it's all got to become more obvious to the consumer.

We've had it going for the last year, the vendor collaboration meetings with our top -- we had originally our top 25 vendors [indiscernible] of size and they moved into the top 50 vendors. And we continue to expand and where we have regular meetings with top management, our top management, their top management, and think through the opportunities that we see for each other in the new structure. And I'd say one of the most important things to our vendors is just the decisiveness. One of the things someone mentioned earlier is that the sizing opportunities. Well, what they have said back to us is that we've asked for size changes by markets in the past. But when we had Macy's East and Macy's West and Macy's Central and Macy's Florida, I mean we just couldn't agree. And Macy's West was thinking about a size profile for San Francisco but they were also responsible for Las Vegas. And they were very, very different. And so they were trying to do their whole region and ask for a size profile vendor-shipped tax [ph]. And that was so different in itself, but it was different for Macy's East's requests. So now we're not looking at it anymore by parts of the country. We're looking at it by individual store. And so we can say, ""But look, we've got all of these stores. And there's 120 of them that look like this. And there's 104 that look like this. And if you can't produce size packs [ph] to respond to that group, then it's going to be less markdowns for you and for us, because we're going to have it right at the end of the season selling to the right sizes."" So that decision-making process and that overall holistic look at the nation with specific detail by store as opposed to regions of the country or the former structure is a huge advantage for our vendors, and the quickness of coming to conclusions is helping in that regard. And as you know, we have several exclusive big vendor relationships now. And there are more of those brewing because they're watching what's happened with us with Tommy Hilfiger or a Rachel Roy, or these others. And they're seeing the fact that we're thinking we can grow this business into a meaningful, sizable business, be all that they had hoped for in their previous distribution structure, but doing it with one customer, and making decisions and responding quickly and really working side by side to affect the business and to affect change and to plan for the future. And so there's more and more of that happening on the vendor side. And then finally, a back out to the stores is they've always had their vendor reps out in the stores. Now they have somebody to talk to in the store. They've got the district team to talk to. When I go visit our stores and I always ask the cosmetics person, I said, ""Whose the rep for Estée Lauder?"" And she put out her cellphone and said, ""Here's her number. Do want to talk to her?"" I mean they are now linked in with the relationship with the vendor organization out in the field. And in many cases, the vendors are duplicating our district structures that are trying to align themselves to have a point person for each of our 69 districts to help respond more quickly and more locally. So I think the vendors and we are working extremely well together."

We had our own animated film this year, and it ran on CBS. And CBS ran a 30-minute TV show called Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus, and that was us. We and our marketing agency wrote that script and created it for television and -- no, I don't know any other retailer who's ever done anything like that. And obviously, we're doing it to reinforce the Macy's brand image, when people watch us and it's already been picked up for next year because it was the number one rated TV show in that time slot this past holiday season. So our hope is that we'll have Miracle on 34th Street, and then we'll have this constantly reminding you of America's department store, and that is Macy's. And so I think those are some of the unique things we're doing marketing wise. And I think we have to get -- become more unique on the promotional side of the equation. And that's what we hope to grow and improve on in 2010 and beyond."

Because the vendors were not taking any big risk either. They got hurt in 2008, so their inventory was lean in 2009. So there wasn't really a lot of ability to test and react in season. So we had to do some of this work in different ways. And the example I gave in Florida with sandals was an easy way for us to do it. Because what we did is we went to our vendors, we went to our own private brands and we went to some of the market brands. And we said, ""Let's put in some inventory that you were planning on thinking about for spring season, and let's just put in a broader assortment in the early fall before the season into Florida and next year we'll put it in Hawaii and parts of the Arizona, Las Vegas, California warm weather climates and test and react."" And so in that case, it's really not a risk for them. In fact, it's a big positive help. And so we'll get several months of early selling because of just simply weather changes there and be able to respond to what we know we've got a good reaction from three or four months later on their normal delivery cycle times. So I think those tests and reacts are a lot easier to do than would be the case for the in-store. However, I do think that you're going to start to see individual of our vendors starting to take a little bit more risk on things and items and subjects that they believe in, that they'll want to make sure that they have inventory to support, much more so than 2009. So I do think there'll be more in-season availability of product than there was last year. And as far as building of inventory, I'm not ready to do that in the spring season. I just think that -- I've got to wait and see how these macroeconomics play out. And so while I might take some risk in women's shoes if that's the hot trending business or in cosmetics categories, where there's no or little or no markdown risk or places like that, we certainly can do it. But as far as the Apparel business is concern, I still think we want to learn from what was successful in this past year of managing our inventory, trying to push for a higher turnover, chase the business a little bit before we, of say, let's load in the inventory and build the inventory."

So to me, this is one of the good things that have come out of a challenging year like 2009, you've learn to live with less of a lot of things and one of those things is inventory. And so we just have to be more edited, and we have to be more fine tuned. The next challenge and I'm doing this in stages, but right now, My Macy's is all about localization. The next phase will be tell me what you don't need. Now after you tell me what you need, now I want you guys in the districts to tell me what you don't need. I mean the buyer may want to buy it because of a relationship with the vendor, but you need to tell me that you don't need this particular brand because you're really not getting the sell-through, or if you had more of this other brand, you would need that particular brand. So the editing process to allow us to get more productivity out of our inventory is available to us. And then after that, I think it's how would each market different in Pittsburgh versus how would you market in Minneapolis. And so we'll get more of that flavor of localization in the marketing and special events and donations budgets, all those kinds of things coming from My Macy's. So I see this thing evolving into just a great detailed relationship with our communities. But you're exactly right about the inventory issue, we need to figure out what we can live without and edit and maximize our sales productivity."

Because we are not like Wal-Mart, we're not everyday low priced. We have brands like Ralph Lauren that have a window of time to sell at regular price, and then it gets cleared at first markdown and then on second -- so you're always going to have product in the assortment that's going to have regular to clear. And then we have the home store that's got irons, regular versus sale, and we've put them out at the everyday sale price, sometimes it works. But a lot of times when the customer comes in and says, ""I want to have a discount on top of that everyday low price because I'm used to getting it not because it's not a great value but because I'm used to getting it."" And so I wish there was an easy answer to your question, but I tried eliminating the coupons dramatically after we bought the May Company and it turned out to be a mistake. And I had to go back and put them back in because it really hurt our business, particularly in the May Company doors because those customers had been trained only by on coupons. And so trying to extract what you've got in place and have had in place for many years is a very difficult issue. So I don't disagree that we want to improve the clarity of our value message, that's why I call it obvious value and internally as of an objective for our own organization. But it is a challenge, and I know that my group and we and I spend a tremendous amount of time on this very issue. And in fact, a lot of the vendors did not like our simplified coupons, so we took the exclusions off. Because even though I try to put it on just sale and clearance, so we weren't taking it off of regular-priced merchandise, the vendors have a very strong point of view that they'd like to be excluded here. So this is a work in progress. The vendors have been very supportive because we've worked together to these tests and the tests have been successful. The customers do like these, these low few exclusion ideas better. But we're not done, we still got more work to do."

On today’s call I will summarize the key components of our performance in the quarter and then talk a bit about our outlook for the remainder of the year. At the end I will then take your questions. 
As we discussed at our analyst meeting a few weeks ago we are feeling increasingly confident our strategies are right and our execution is better than ever before. The combination of My Macy’s with its focus on customer centricity, localization and field empowerment combined with the One Macy’s unified structure is even more powerful than we had expected. 
Total sales in the first quarter were $5.574 billion and our comp store sales increased 5.5% which is well above what we had expected at the start of the year. As you recall the total sales now include revenue associated with the  sale of private brands to third parties and sales of unsold goods at the end of their selling period. These items do not, however, impact comp store sales. 
In the quarter sales exceeded our expectations in virtually every Macy’s market, at Bloomingdales and also from the internet. Sales from the internet were up 34% in the first quarter. We are continuing to expand our view of the internet opportunity to make it even more a part of a multi-channel strategy for both Macy’s and for Bloomingdales. Customers are increasingly using both channels for parts of their buying decisions regardless of where the transaction itself occurs. We believe our internet operations will continue to fuel significant growth for both of our brands. 
Other than Herald Square, which is performing exceptionally well, it was our smallest volume stores that achieved the biggest increase versus last year in the first quarter. This is very exciting to see and it shows that My Macy’s is working. 
Overall our sales were strongest in Men’s and in Home along with many businesses in women like updated apparel and fashion watches which were also very strong. Private brand and exclusives continue to have very strong performance in the first quarter. Our sales were less strong in the young businesses during the first quarter. The gross margin rate in the quarter was 39.4%, up 130 basis points over last year and 80 basis points over 2008. 
The accounting changes hurt us by 10 basis points in the quarter so we actually did a little bit better on a comparable basis. We are very pleased with this performance which resulted from a combination of strong sales, good inventory management and the strong private brand performance. 
Inventory at the end of the quarter was down 2%. SG&A in the quarter was $1.993 billion which was $37 million above last year. This was below our original expectation even with the higher than expected sales. As a percent of sales SG&A was down 180 basis points or 170 basis points excluding the accounting change versus last year, demonstrating the leverage in our business. 
Operating income was $203 million, up from $24 million excluding division consolidation [from] last year and $117 million in 2008 on that same basis. As a percent of sales, operating income was 3.6% this year compared to 0.5% last year and 2.0% in 2008. We had a great first quarter relative not just to 2009 but to 2008 as well. 
Interest expense in the quarter was $162 million and remember the quarter included $27 million of $0.04 per share of costs  associated with the $500 million of debt we repurchased earlier in the quarter. Taxes in the first quarter were $18 million which includes $4 million for the reduction in deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the recent healthcare reform and the elimination of the deductibility of retiree healthcare payments. 
Net income in the quarter was $23 million or $0.05 per share on a diluted basis. The diluted share count for the quarter is 426.2 million shares. This earnings per share compares to last year’s loss of $0.16 excluding the costs associated with division consolidation or a $0.21 improvement. 
With the better than expected sales and profits, cash flow generation was strong as well. Cash flow before financing defined as cash used by operations and investing activities was a use of $193 million in the quarter which was about $136 million worse than last year though remember this year we accelerated a pension contribution of $325 million into the first quarter. So the pension contribution this year versus last year was $295 million. So had we not accelerated that contribution the cash flow would have been $160 million favorable to last year. Also in the quarter we used cash to repurchase $505 million in debt and we still ended the quarter with over $980 million of cash on the balance sheet. 
We feel great about how we have started this year which is why we raised our annual guidance a few weeks ago. While we continue to see strong sales trends we don’t want to get ahead of ourselves. This is why we feel it is premature to raise annual guidance further at this time. We do expect to have more visibility on the back half of the year once we get further into the second quarter. 
As you think about the monthly sales in the second quarter remember that sales in the month of May will be negatively impacted by the timing of Memorial Day. The Sunday and Monday of the holiday weekend moves into Fiscal June as compared to being in May last year. This is assumed to hurt our sales in the month of May by 2.5-3.5 points. This shift will obviously benefit June but remember June is a 5-week month so the percentage benefit will not be the same as what we get hurt in May. All of this washes out for the second quarter. 
Let me share with you a few of our planning assumptions for the second quarter. First, we expect gross margin in the second quarter to increase over last year. Remember that the accounting change negatively impacts gross margin in the second quarter. In fact, had the changes been in effect last year our gross margin rate would have been 50 basis points lower as you can see on our website. However, we are expecting the increase to be enough that it will still be higher than last year on a reported basis. 
SG&A is expected to be relatively flat in dollars to the first quarter and like in the first quarter this will mean higher dollars than a year ago. Part of this relates to the accounting changes. Interest expense in the quarter is now expected to be approximately $130 million benefiting both from strong cash flow and debt repurchase completed earlier this year. 
This hopefully helps you understand some of our key planning assumptions for the second quarter. We are off to a great start this year and we have every expectation it will continue. Our organization has just recently passed its first anniversary together. We couldn’t be happier with our new team, the progress we have already made and the potential that lays in front of us. The My Macy’s culture and its structure are making an enormous difference in our business. 
With that I will open the call up for any questions you may have.

We have a series of things going on to do that. At the lowest level would be what we would call minimum standard projects where we are going into stores that just frankly aren’t up to having the Macy’s name attached to them and cleaning them up. We have got programs to do that across the country and attack all of our stores that have what we call low asset scores. 
The second piece of it relates to putting money into parts of the store where we think there is a huge sales potential whether it be Men’s, whether it be Cosmetics or Accessories and that is happening in many stores across the country as well. So what you are going to see versus the company in the past is significantly more smaller remodels and fewer of the major redo’s and expansion of an entire store that are a lot more expensive. We find we get a much better return when we go in and focus on a brand or focus on a vendor or a category of business. 
The last place we are spending money is in the signature businesses we had talked about at the analyst meeting; cosmetics, jewelry and shoes. So we will spend extra money in those obviously because we think they are signature categories. I guess the last place where we are also investing or beginning to invest in the stores is also in the world of technology to also improve the shopping experience. 
For example, the new registers that will have been rolled out across the company as of the second quarter are enabling us to do what we call search incent so the customers can utilize the Macys.com inventory while they are in-store and we think the potential for that is tremendous. It is sort of a long answer to the question but we are trying to both maintain the minimum standards and go after sales growth opportunities where we see them across the country.

On today's call, I will summarize the key components of our performance in the quarter and then talk a bit about our outlook for the remainder of the year. And at the end, I'll then take your questions.
As we discussed in our analyst meeting a few weeks ago, we are feeling increasingly confident that our strategies are right and our execution is better than ever before. The combination of My Macy’s, with its focus on customer centricity, localization and field empowerment, combined with the one Macy's unified structure is even more powerful than we had expected. 
Total sales in the first quarter were $5,574,000,000 and our comp store sales increased 5.5%, which is well above what we had expected at the start of the year. As you recall, the total sales now include revenue associated with the sale of private brands to third parties and sale of unsold goods at the end of their selling period. These items do not, however, impact comp store sales. In the quarter, sales exceeded our expectations in virtually every Macy's market, at Bloomingdale's and also on the Internet. Sales from the Internet were up 34% in the first quarter. We are continuing to expand our view of the Internet opportunity to make it even more a part of a multichannel strategy for both Macy's and for Bloomingdale's. Customers are increasingly using both channels for parts of their buying decisions, regardless of where the transaction itself occurs. We believe our Internet operations will continue to fuel significant growth for both of our brands.
Other than Herald Square, which is performing exceptionally well, it was our smallest volume stores that achieved the biggest increase versus last year in the first quarter. This is very exciting to see, and it shows that My Macy’s is working.
Overall, our sales were strongest in Men's and in Home, along with many businesses in Women's like updated apparel and fashion watches, which were also very strong. Private Brand and Exclusives continue to have very strong performance in the first quarter. Our sales were less strong in the young businesses during the first quarter.
The gross margin and the rate in the quarter was 39.4%, up 130 basis points over last year and 80 basis points over 2008. And the accounting changes hurt us by 10 basis points in the quarter, but we actually did a little bit better on a comparable basis.  We are very pleased with this performance which resulted from a combination of the strong sales, good inventory management and the strong Private Brand performance. Inventory at the end of the quarter was down 2%.
SG&A in the quarter was $1,993,000,000, which was $37 million above last year. This was below our original expectation even with the higher-than-expected sales. And as a percent of sales, SG&A was down 180 basis points or 170 basis points excluding the accounting change versus last year demonstrating the leverage in our business.
Operating income was $203 million, up from $24 million excluding division consolidation cost last year and $117 million in 2008 on that same basis. And as a percent of sales, operating income was 3.6% this year compared to 0.5% last year and 2.0% in 2008. We had a great first quarter relative not just to 2009 but to 2008 as well. Interest expense in the quarter was $162 million and remember that the quarter included $27 million or $0.04 a share of costs associated with the $500 million of debt that we repurchased earlier in the quarter.
Taxes in the first quarter were $18 million, which includes $4 million for the reduction in deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the recent healthcare reform and the elimination of the deductibility of retiree healthcare payment. Net income in the quarter was $23 million or $0.05 per share on a diluted basis. The diluted share count for the quarter is 426.2 million shares.  This earnings per share compares to last year's loss of $0.16, excluding the cost associated with division consolidation or a $0.21 improvement. 
With the better-than-expected sales and profits, cash flow generation was strong as well. And cash flow before financing, defined as cash used by operations and investing activities, was a use of $193 million in the quarter, which was about $136 million worse than last year. Although remember, this year, we accelerated a pension contribution of $325 million into the first quarter. So the pension contribution this year versus last year was $295 million. So had we not accelerated that contribution, the cash flow would've been $160 million favorable to last year. 
Also in the quarter, we used cash to repurchase $505 million in debt and we still ended the quarter with over $980 million of cash on the balance sheet. We feel great about how we started this year, which is why we raised our annual guidance a few weeks ago. While we continue to see strong sales trends, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. This is why we feel it is premature to raise annual guidance further at this time. We do expect to have more visibility on the back half of the year once we get further into the second quarter.
As you think about the monthly sales in the second quarter, remember that sales in the month of May will be negatively impacted by the timing of Memorial Day. The Sunday and Monday of the holiday weekend move into fiscal June as compared to being in May last year. This is assumed to hurt our sales in the month of May by 2.5 to 3.5 points. This shift will obviously benefit June, but remember, June is a five-week month so the percentage benefit will not be the same as what we get hurt in May. And all of this washes out for the second quarter.
Let me share with you a few of our planning assumptions for the second quarter. First, we expect gross margin in the second quarter to increase over last year. Remember that the accounting change negatively impacts gross margin in the second quarter. In fact, had the changes been in effect last year, our gross margin rate would've been 50 basis points lower as you can see on our website. However, we are expecting the increase to be enough that it will still be higher than last year on a reported basis. SG&A is expected to be relatively flat in dollars to the first quarter. And like in the first quarter, this will mean higher dollars than a year ago.  Part of this relates to the accounting changes. And interest expense in the quarter is now expected to be approximately $130 million, benefiting both from strong cash flow and debt repurchase completed earlier this year. This hopefully helps you understand some of our key planning assumptions for the second quarter. 
We are off to a great start this year, and we have every expectation that it will continue. Our organization has just recently passed its first anniversary together. We couldn't be happier with our new team, the progress we've already made and the potential that lays in front of us. The My Macy’s culture and its structure are making an enormous difference in our business. And with that, I'll open the call up for any questions you may have."

At the lowest level would be what we would call minimum standard projects where we're going into stores that just frankly aren't up to having the Macy's name attached",335,"It's a hard question to answer quickly but we have series of things going on to do that. At the lowest level would be what we would call minimum standard projects where we're going into stores that just frankly aren't up to having the Macy's name attached to them and cleaning them up, and we've got programs to do that across the country and to tap all of our stores that have what we call low asset scores. The second piece of it relates to putting money into parts of the store where we think there's a huge sales potential, whether it be Men's, whether it be Cosmetics, Accessories. And that's happening in many stores across the country as well. So what's you're going to see versus the company in the past is significantly more smaller remodels and fewer of the major redos and expansions of an entire store that are a lot more expensive. We finally get a much better return when we go in and focus on a brand or focus on the vendor or a category of business. And then the last place we're spending money is in the signature businesses that we had talked about at the analyst meeting, Cosmetics, Jewelry and Shoes. So we'll spend extra money in those obviously because we think they're signature category. And I guess the last place we were also investing or beginning to invest in the stores also was in the world of technology to also improve the shopping experience. So for example, the new registers that will have been rolled out across the company as of the second quarter are enabling us to do what we call, search and send so the customers can utilize the macys.com inventory while they're in store and we think the potential for that is tremendous. That's sort of a long answer to the question, but we're trying to both maintain the minimum standards and go after sales growth opportunities where we see them across the country."

On today's call, I will summarize the key components of our performance in the quarter and then talk a bit about our outlook for the remainder of the year. And at the end, I'll then take your questions.
As we discussed in our analyst meeting a few weeks ago, we are feeling increasingly confident that our strategies are right and our execution is better than ever before. The combination of My Macy’s, with its focus on customer centricity, localization and field empowerment, combined with the one Macy's unified structure is even more powerful than we had expected. 
Total sales in the first quarter were $5,574,000,000 and our comp store sales increased 5.5%, which is well above what we had expected at the start of the year. As you recall, the total sales now include revenue associated with the sale of private brands to third parties and sale of unsold goods at the end of their selling period. These items do not, however, impact comp store sales. In the quarter, sales exceeded our expectations in virtually every Macy's market, at Bloomingdale's and also on the Internet. Sales from the Internet were up 34% in the first quarter. We are continuing to expand our view of the Internet opportunity to make it even more a part of a multichannel strategy for both Macy's and for Bloomingdale's. Customers are increasingly using both channels for parts of their buying decisions, regardless of where the transaction itself occurs. We believe our Internet operations will continue to fuel significant growth for both of our brands.
Other than Herald Square, which is performing exceptionally well, it was our smallest volume stores that achieved the biggest increase versus last year in the first quarter. This is very exciting to see, and it shows that My Macy’s is working.
Overall, our sales were strongest in Men's and in Home, along with many businesses in Women's like updated apparel and fashion watches, which were also very strong. Private Brand and Exclusives continue to have very strong performance in the first quarter. Our sales were less strong in the young businesses during the first quarter.
The gross margin and the rate in the quarter was 39.4%, up 130 basis points over last year and 80 basis points over 2008. And the accounting changes hurt us by 10 basis points in the quarter, but we actually did a little bit better on a comparable basis.  We are very pleased with this performance which resulted from a combination of the strong sales, good inventory management and the strong Private Brand performance. Inventory at the end of the quarter was down 2%.
SG&A in the quarter was $1,993,000,000, which was $37 million above last year. This was below our original expectation even with the higher-than-expected sales. And as a percent of sales, SG&A was down 180 basis points or 170 basis points excluding the accounting change versus last year demonstrating the leverage in our business.
Operating income was $203 million, up from $24 million excluding division consolidation cost last year and $117 million in 2008 on that same basis. And as a percent of sales, operating income was 3.6% this year compared to 0.5% last year and 2.0% in 2008. We had a great first quarter relative not just to 2009 but to 2008 as well. Interest expense in the quarter was $162 million and remember that the quarter included $27 million or $0.04 a share of costs associated with the $500 million of debt that we repurchased earlier in the quarter.
Taxes in the first quarter were $18 million, which includes $4 million for the reduction in deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the recent healthcare reform and the elimination of the deductibility of retiree healthcare payment. Net income in the quarter was $23 million or $0.05 per share on a diluted basis. The diluted share count for the quarter is 426.2 million shares.  This earnings per share compares to last year's loss of $0.16, excluding the cost associated with division consolidation or a $0.21 improvement. 
With the better-than-expected sales and profits, cash flow generation was strong as well. And cash flow before financing, defined as cash used by operations and investing activities, was a use of $193 million in the quarter, which was about $136 million worse than last year. Although remember, this year, we accelerated a pension contribution of $325 million into the first quarter. So the pension contribution this year versus last year was $295 million. So had we not accelerated that contribution, the cash flow would've been $160 million favorable to last year. 
Also in the quarter, we used cash to repurchase $505 million in debt and we still ended the quarter with over $980 million of cash on the balance sheet. We feel great about how we started this year, which is why we raised our annual guidance a few weeks ago. While we continue to see strong sales trends, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. This is why we feel it is premature to raise annual guidance further at this time. We do expect to have more visibility on the back half of the year once we get further into the second quarter.
As you think about the monthly sales in the second quarter, remember that sales in the month of May will be negatively impacted by the timing of Memorial Day. The Sunday and Monday of the holiday weekend move into fiscal June as compared to being in May last year. This is assumed to hurt our sales in the month of May by 2.5 to 3.5 points. This shift will obviously benefit June, but remember, June is a five-week month so the percentage benefit will not be the same as what we get hurt in May. And all of this washes out for the second quarter.
Let me share with you a few of our planning assumptions for the second quarter. First, we expect gross margin in the second quarter to increase over last year. Remember that the accounting change negatively impacts gross margin in the second quarter. In fact, had the changes been in effect last year, our gross margin rate would've been 50 basis points lower as you can see on our website. However, we are expecting the increase to be enough that it will still be higher than last year on a reported basis. SG&A is expected to be relatively flat in dollars to the first quarter. And like in the first quarter, this will mean higher dollars than a year ago.  Part of this relates to the accounting changes. And interest expense in the quarter is now expected to be approximately $130 million, benefiting both from strong cash flow and debt repurchase completed earlier this year. This hopefully helps you understand some of our key planning assumptions for the second quarter. 
We are off to a great start this year, and we have every expectation that it will continue. Our organization has just recently passed its first anniversary together. We couldn't be happier with our new team, the progress we've already made and the potential that lays in front of us. The My Macy’s culture and its structure are making an enormous difference in our business. And with that, I'll open the call up for any questions you may have."

At the lowest level would be what we would call minimum standard projects where we're going into stores that just frankly aren't up to having the Macy's name attached to them and cleaning them up, and we've got programs to do that across the country and to tap all of our stores that have what we call low asset scores. The second piece of it relates to putting money into parts of the store where we think there's a huge sales potential, whether it be Men's, whether it be Cosmetics, Accessories. And that's happening in many stores across the country as well. So what's you're going to see versus the company in the past is significantly more smaller remodels and fewer of the major redos and expansions of an entire store that are a lot more expensive. We find we get a much better return when we go in and focus on a brand or focus on a vendor or a category of business. And then the last place we're spending money is in the signature businesses that we had talked about at the analyst meeting, Cosmetics, Jewelry and Shoes. So we'll spend extra money in those obviously because we think they're signature category. And I guess the last place we were also investing or beginning to invest in the stores also was in the world of technology to also improve the shopping experience. So for example, the new registers that will have been rolled out across the company as of the second quarter are enabling us to do what we call search and send. So the customers can utilize the macys.com inventory while they're in store, and we think the potential for that is tremendous. That's sort of a long answer to the question, but we're trying to both maintain the minimum standards and go after sales growth opportunities where we see them across the country."

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
We are very pleased with our results in the second quarter. We exceeded our expectations in all key components of our performance: Sales, gross margin, SG&A and cash flow. This both demonstrates the benefits of our strategic initiatives at Macy's and reflects the continued strong performance of Bloomingdale's. The key initiatives at Macy's include the new centralized structure and our My Macy’s localization efforts. 
Sales in the second quarter were $5,537,000,000, and comp store sales were up 4.9% in the quarter, which, like in the first quarter, exceeded our expectations. Sales were strong in most categories of business in the quarter with the only notable weaknesses in Women's traditional career apparel and Young Men's due particularly to tough denim performance. 
The best sales results in the quarter were in Men's, driven by collections, plus fashion watches, updated Women's apparel, seasonal categories like swimwear, luggage, furniture and mattresses. Private brand and exclusive product also continued to achieve terrific growth throughout the store during the quarter. 
Geographically, all regions did relatively well in the quarter, with the only cluster of weakness in some parts of California. On a two-year basis, the strongest regions for us were the North and the Midwest. Both of which were originally My Macy’s pilot regions. Chicago has been particularly strong. We find this to be very encouraging and demonstrates the ongoing benefits of the strategy. Year-to-date, all 69 of our districts were at or ahead of expectations. This widespread success is very encouraging. 
Our Internet businesses continue to grow rapidly, and we are developing strategies to further accelerate their growth, including in the realm of mobile. Both macys.com and bloomingdales.com are showing how important they are for driving store traffic in addition to producing great growth of their own. We now have the capability in all Macy's stores to access the dot-com inventory to satisfy a customer. We are finding tremendous excitement for this amongst both our store associates and our customers. 
Bloomingdale's also produced great sales this quarter and continue to outpace its peer competitors. The focus at Bloomingdale's has been on relationship selling, as well as the leverage of store inventory across all of their stores. Both of which helped to contribute to the strong performance of the company. 
Gross margin in the second quarter was 41.9%, up from last year's reported margin of 41.5%. Remember though that the accounting change related to sales to third-party retailers negatively impacts gross margin comparisons versus last year. On an apples-to-apples basis, assuming these changes have been in effect last year, we achieved 90 basis points of improvement, which is really terrific. This points to the benefit of strong sales and well-controlled inventory. We ended the second quarter with inventory about flat versus last year, which we believe positions us very well for the fall season. 
The My Macy’s approach has clearly enhanced our ability to more frequently have the right inventory in the right place at the right time, and the net result is stronger sales and gross margin rate. 
We also did better than expected in the second quarter on the expense line. The SG&A of $1,953,000,000 is approximately $40 million below what we had expected at the start of the second quarter. The major variances included lower stock-based compensation expense due to a lower stock price than we had anticipated, delay training expense and lower marketing expense. Some of the positive variances are timing related and will be reversed in the fall. These shifts will be included when I discuss the assumptions for fall expense. But even with these timing shifts, we were very pleased with our SG&A performance in the quarter, as well as the first half of the year. 
Compared to last year, SG&A in dollars was up 4.9% as reported and up 3.6% had the accounting change been in effect last year. The increases in expense relate to a higher bonus accrual due to the strong spring season performance, lower credit income due to the impact of the regulatory changes and higher sales variable expense resulting from the strong sales. However, SG&A as a percent of sales was 35.2%, down 80 basis points on a reported basis or down 50 basis points had the accounting change been in effect last year. 
Operating income in this year's second quarter was $370 million, up $88 million or 31% over last year, excluding last year's consolidation-related expenses. As a percent of sales, operating income was 6.7%, up 120 basis points over last year, excluding consolidation expense, or 140 basis points higher had the same accounting been in effect last year. 
Interest in the second quarter was $130 million, and tax expense was $93 million. Net income was $147 million. Earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.35, up 75% versus last year, excluding the division consolidation costs in 2009. This was clearly well above our expectations. 
Our year-to-date cash flow has also been very strong. We generated $164 million in cash from operating net of investing activities even after making an accelerated pension contribution of $325 million. Last year, we made the contributions of $60 million in the spring season and then in the fall, approximately $310 million. If we exclude the pension contribution from both years, cash flow before financing activities in the first half of the year would have been $177 million more than a year ago. And we ended July with $1.2 billion of cash on our balance sheet. 
As we look to fall, we expect this momentum to continue, although it is important to note that we will be up against stronger last-year numbers. We have raised our expectations for fall comp store sales up to 3% to 3 1/2%, which, together with our spring season actual sales, results in new annual guidance for a comp store increase of 4% to 4.2%. This is up from our expectation of 3% to 3 1/2% most recently and well above our original guidance for the year of 1% to 2% as we started this year. While we do recognize that there is risk in the economic environment, we believe the sales level is achievable based on our recent performance and market share gains, as well as our strategies for the fall season. 
During the spring season, the growth in total sales was roughly 200 basis points above the comp store increase. For the fall season of the back half of the year, we are expecting the delta between these two measures to be less, more like 160 basis points, due to the timing during the year of private brand sales to third parties. We are opening three department stores in the second half of 2010. This includes the Bloomingdale's in Santa Monica, which opened very strongly last week, and two Macy's stores, both former Gottschalks locations in California, one in Palmdale and the other in Tracy. We are also opening our first four Bloomingdale's outlets, about which we are very excited. 
We are assuming the gross margin rate in the back half of the year to be down slightly on a reported basis or flattish to 2009 had the accounting change been in effect last year. We are assuming SG&A as a percent of sales to decline in the second half of the year as we leverage the sales growth, but the SG&A dollars are expected to be up versus last year but less of a percentage increase than what we've experienced in the first half of the year. 
Also remember that last year SG&A would have been $47 million higher had the accounting change been in effect. The increase in SG&A this year is due in part to higher pension expense, higher expense supporting the Internet business and its growth, a shift in the timing of marketing expenditures and an increased investment in training of our selling associates, which I'll talk about in a few minutes. And also, the expense in the back half of the year is also increased because of the sales growth that we're projecting. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $255 million in the back half of the year, and we are still expecting to spend approximately $550 million in CapEx this year. 
Given these key planning assumptions, our earnings per share guidance for the fall is $1.45 to $1.50, or $1.85 to $1.90 for the full year. This is $0.10 above where we were at the start of the second quarter and $0.30 above where we were at the start of the year. Obviously, we are moving in the right direction. 
I feel a bit like a broken record as I talk about the key factors driving our success: the My Macy’s localization and field empowerment, combined with the faster, more nimble, more focused central merchandising and marketing teams, including our private brand organization. This combination is clearly having a positive impact. 
And this fall, we are adding one more element to our efforts, which we expect to further drive our top line, a more engaged selling team in our stores. By the start of September, we will have trained approximately 130,000 sales associates and managers on selling engagement. We have never done such a comprehensive training effort before, and we are very excited by the feedback we're already getting from our associates and from our customers. A key component of the program is more intense coaching of our associates on an ongoing basis by our store and district management teams. 
The start of back-to-school has been very encouraging. We are especially excited about the launch of our exclusive Material Girl line, which is designed by Madonna and her daughter, Lourdes. The initial selling across the country has been terrific, and we believe the excitement being generated helped sales beyond this specific brand. The buzz is incredible. And our new Slade Wilder Young Men's brand launched in mid-July also was off to a very strong start. 
As we look to the all-important fourth quarter, our team is more ready than ever before. We have reinvented our gift strategy, and we'll have a whole new level of newness, distinction and value in all of our doors, along with a terrific marketing campaign. We don't have a crystal ball on the economy, but we do have confidence that we can continue to gain share profitably no matter the environment. 
And with that, I'll take your questions."

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company’s most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
We are very pleased with our results in the second quarter. We exceeded our expectations in all key components of our performance; sales, gross margin, SG&A, and cash flow. This demonstrates the benefits of our strategic initiatives at Macy’s and reflects the continued strong performance at Bloomingdale’s. The key initiatives at Macy’s include the new centralized structure and our My Macy’s localization efforts.
Sales in the second quarter were $5.537 billion, and comp store sales were up 4.9% in the quarter, which like in the first quarter exceeded our expectations. Sales were strong in most categories of business in the quarter with the only notable weaknesses in women’s traditional career apparel and young men’s due particularly to tough denim performance.
The best sales results in the quarter were in men’s driven by collections plus fashion watches, updated women’s apparel, seasonal categories like swimwear, luggage, furniture and mattresses. Private brand and exclusive product also continued to achieve terrific growth throughout the store during the quarter.
Geographically, all regions did relatively well in the quarter with the only cluster of weakness in some parts of California. On a two-year basis, the strongest regions for us were the North and the Midwest, both of which were original My Macy’s pilot regions. Chicago has been particularly strong. We find this to be very encouraging and demonstrates the ongoing benefits of the strategy. Year-to-date, all 69 of our districts were at or ahead of expectations. This widespread success is very encouraging.
Our Internet businesses continue to grow rapidly, and we are developing strategies to further accelerate their growth, including in the realm of mobile. Both macys.com and bloomingdales.com are showing how important they are for driving store traffic in addition to producing great growth of their own. We now have the capability in all Macy’s stores to access the dotcom inventory to satisfy a customer. We are finding tremendous excitement for this amongst both our store associates and our customers.
Bloomingdale’s also produced great sales this quarter and continued to outpace its peer competitors. The focus of Bloomingdale’s has been on relationship selling as well as the leverage of store inventory across all of their stores, both of which helped to contribute to the strong performance of the company.
Gross margin in the second quarter was 41.9%, up from last year’s reported margin of 41.5%. Remember, though, that the accounting change related to sales to third-party retailers negatively impacts gross margin comparisons versus last year. On an apples-to-apples basis, assuming these changes had been effect last year, we achieved 90 basis points of improvement, which is really terrific. This points to the benefit of strong sales and well controlled inventory.
We ended the second quarter with inventory about flat versus last year, which we believe positions us very well for the fall season. The My Macy’s approach has clearly enhanced our ability to more frequently have the right inventory in the right place at the right time. And the net result is stronger sales and gross margin rate.
We also did better than expected in the second quarter on the expense line. The SG&A of $1.953 billion is approximately $40 million below what we had expected at the start of the second quarter. The major variances included lower stock-based compensation expense due to a lower stock price than we had anticipated, delayed training expense, and lower marketing expense.
Some of the positive variances are timing-related and will be reversed in the fall. These shifts will be included when I discuss the assumptions for fall expense. But even with these timing shifts, we were very pleased with our SG&A performance in the quarter as well as the first half of the year. Compared to last year, SG&A in dollars was up 4.9% as reported and up 3.6% had the accounting change been in effect last year.
The increases in expense relate to a higher bonus accrual due to the strong spring season performance, lower credit income due to the impact of the regulatory changes, and higher sales variable expense resulting from the strong sales. However, SG&A as a percent of sales was 35.2%, down 80 basis points on a reported basis or down 50 basis points had the accounting change been in effect last year.
Operating income in this year’s second quarter was $370 million, up $88 million or 31% over last year, excluding last year’s consolidation related expenses. As a percent of sales, operating income was 6.7%, up 120 basis points over last year, excluding consolidation expense, or 140 basis points higher had the same accounting been in effect last year. Interest in the second quarter was $130 million, and tax expense was $93 million.
Net income was $147 million. Earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.35, up 75% versus last year, excluding the division consolidation costs in 2009. This was clearly well above our expectation. Our year-to-date cash flow has also been very strong. We generated $164 million in cash from operating net of investing activities, even after making an accelerated pension contribution of $325 million.
Last year, we made the contributions of $60 million in the spring season, and then in the fall, approximately $310 million. If we exclude the pension contribution from both years, cash flow before financing activities in the first half of the year would have been $177 million more than a year ago. And we ended July with $1.2 billion of cash on our balance sheet.
As we look to fall, we expect this momentum to continue. Although it is important to note that we will be up against stronger last year numbers. We have raised our expectations for fall comp store sales up to 3.0% to 3.5%, which together with our spring season actual sales results in new annual guidance for a comp store increase of 4.0% to 4.2%.
This is up from our expectation of 3.0% to 3.5% most recently and well above our original guidance for the year of 1% to 2%, as we started this year. While we do recognize that there is risk in the economic environment, we believe the sales level is achievable based on our recent performance and market share gains, as well as our strategies for the fall season.
During the spring season, the growth in total sales was roughly 200 basis points above the comp store increase. For the fall season or the back half of the year, we are expecting a delta between these two measures to be less, more like 160 basis points due to the timing during the year of private brand sales to third parties.
We are opening three department stores in the second half of 2010. This includes the Bloomingdale’s in Santa Monica, which opened very strongly last week, and two Macy’s stores, both former Gottschalk locations in California; one in Palmdale and the other in Tracy. We are also opening our first four Bloomingdale’s outlets, about which we are very excited.
We are assuming the gross margin rate in the back half of the year to be down slightly on a reported basis or flattish to 2009 had the accounting change been in effect last year. We are assuming SG&A as a percent of sales to decline in the second half of the year, as we leverage the sales growth. But the SG&A dollars are expected to be up versus last year, but less of a percentage increase than what we’ve experienced in the first half of the year. Also remember that last year SG&A would have been $47 million higher had the accounting change been in effect.
The increase in SG&A this year is due in part to higher pension expense; higher expense supporting the Internet business and its growth; a shift in the timing of marketing expenditures; and an increased investment in training of our selling associates, which I’ll talk about in a few minutes. And also, the expense in the back half of the year is to also increase because of the sales growth that we’re projecting.
Interest expense is expected to be approximately $255 million in the back half of the year, and we are still expecting to spend approximately $550 million in CapEx this year. Given these key planning assumptions, our earnings per share guidance for the fall is $1.45 to $1.50, or $1.85 to $1.90 for the full year. This is $0.10 above where we were at the start of the second quarter and $0.30 above where we were at the start of the year. Obviously, we are moving in the right direction.
I feel a bit like a broken record as I talk about the key factors driving our success. The My Macy’s localization and field empowerment combined with the faster, more nimble, more focused central merchandising and marketing teams, including our private brand organization. This combination is clearly having a positive impact. In this fall, we are adding one more element to our efforts, which we expect to further drive our top line and more engage selling team in our stores.
By the start of September, we will have trained approximately 130,000 sales associates and managers on selling engagement. We have never done such a comprehensive training effort before and we are very excited by the feedback we are already getting from our associates and from our customers. A key component of the program is more intense coaching of our associates on an ongoing basis by our store and district management teams.
The start of back-to-school has been very encouraging. We are especially excited about the launch of our exclusive Material Girl line, which is designed by Madonna and her daughter Lourdes. The initial selling across the country has been terrific, and we believe the excitement being generated help sales beyond the specific brand. The buzz is incredible. And our new Slade Wilder young man’s brand launched in mid-July also was off to a very strong start.
As we look to the all-important fourth quarter, our team is more ready than ever before. We have reinvented our gift strategy and will have a whole new level of newness, distinction and value in all of our doors, along with a terrific marketing campaign. We don’t have a crystal ball on the economy, but we do have confidence that we can continue to gain share profitably no matter the environment.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.

We were very pleased with our results during the third quarter. While sales were a little bit softer than we had hoped in early October with the unexpectedly warm weather, especially relative to last year, we exceeded our sales and profit plan for the quarter. And given our confidence in our business trend, we utilized $500 million of excess cash to buy back debt with maturities between 2011 and 2016 during the quarter in the open market.  That brings our total debt reduction this year to over $1.2 billion, including the $150 million we paid at maturity on November 1. 
In the third quarter, our sales were $5,623,000,000, and on a comp-store basis, sales grew 3.9%. It was a good quarter overall for sales.  We opened two Macy's stores in California that had been Gottschalks stores, bringing our total Gottschalks conversion store up to four. These converted stores are performing very well. 
As we look by family of business, the standout performances on the positive side in the quarter came from fashion watches, our I.N.C. brand, cosmetics and fragrances, Men's and luggage. Other private brand and exclusives also had a very good quarter. The weakest performances were in cold-weather goods, traditional women's sportswear and tabletop. Geographically, we performed best across the south, all the way from Florida to Southern California where weather was less of an issue. Business, as you might imagine, was weaker in the northern climate zones due in large part to the warm weather.
The exception to this was the upper Midwest, the Chicago, Minneapolis and Detroit areas, which had a very strong performance for the third year in a row. macys.com also continued to grow rapidly in the third quarter. The growth in online sales can be attributed to a combination of better merchandising, new technologies like faceted navigation and quick view and a constant focus on on-the-channel tactics.
Our digital marketing included the more aggressive use of social media and it's very closely linked with the stores providing a seamless experience for our customers.  Also, our recent rollout of what we call Search and Send, where we can satisfy customer demand for items that are either not carried in a particular store or that are out of stock. We can satisfy them using the dot-com inventory. This has been very successful although these sales are not counted in our online sales.  As of the third quarter, the Search and Send technology was available to customers in all of our Macy’s stores. 
Bloomingdale's performed well in the quarter, with strong sales both in the stores and also online. In fact, Bloomingdale's sales trend has been comparing favorably to other upscale fashion retailers.  The Santa Monica store opened in the quarter and opened very strong, as did our first three outlet stores. The fourth outlet store expect to open next week.
Gross margin in the third quarter was 40%, which is up 20 basis points from last year had the current accounting treatment been in effect, but down 20 basis points from last year on a reported basis. This is as anticipated and consistent with our prior guidance of a flattish gross margin rate for the fall season, meaning the third and fourth quarters combined.
We ended the third quarter with the inventory up 1.9%. And while higher than it has been, the inventory level is still well below our comp store sales trend. We have focused on building fresh inventories in opportunity areas to help drive our fourth quarter sales.
SG&A in the quarter was $2,069,000,000, only up 0.6% had the accounting treatment been effect last year, and up 1.8% as reported. And as a percent of sales, SG&A was 36.9%, down 120 basis points from last year compared to the adjusted number, or down 160 basis point on a reported basis. This is also consistent with our guidance for the fall season.
Operating income in the third quarter was $177 million, more than double last year's $88 million before division consolidation costs. And as a percent of sales, operating income in the quarter was 3.1% versus 1.7% last year before division consolidation costs.
Interest expense in the quarter was $164 million, including $39 million of the non-recurring premium and fees associated with our open-market debt repurchase. Excluding this, interest expense would have been $125 million, down from last year's $137 million and slightly lower than expectations.
Net income in the quarter was $10 million, or $0.02 per share. Excluding the non-recurring expenses associated with the debt buyback, EPS was $0.08 per share compared to last year's loss of $0.03, excluding division consolidation costs.
Cash flow from operating activities was $346 million for the 39 weeks of 2010, down $60 million from last year. But remember that we contributed $325 million to the pension plan as of this point in the year versus approximately $146 million last year, which reduced our cash flow from operating activities year-over-year by $179 million.
Cash flow from investing activities was roughly the same as last year, and we used $1,032,000,000 for financing activities this year versus $926 million last year. And at the end of the third quarter, we had $750 million of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet versus $581 million last year. This demonstrates the cash flow potential of this business given how much debt we have eliminated this year while at the same time, supporting the capital needs of the company.
It was a good quarter, and we are now ready for the fourth quarter. So let's move on and talk about our guidance.
As we look at sales for the fourth quarter, our guidance is for our comp store increase of 3% to 4%. And we're anticipating approximately 130 basis point spread between total sales growth and comp store sales growth for the fourth quarter. We are expecting a lower gross margin rate in the fourth quarter than both the reported an adjusted rates last year. You'll recall that last year's gross margin rate in the fourth quarter was unusually high, even beating that of 2007. As we guided at the end of the second quarter, the gross margin rate for the fall season would be flattish compared to last year's adjusted number, and we would give that same guidance today.
We are expecting a larger increase in SG&A dollars in the fourth quarter than that, that we experienced in the third quarter due to a shift in marketing dollars from earlier in the year and also last year's Visa and MasterCard settlement. SG&A dollars for the two quarters combined is consistent though with prior guidance. And we continue to expect the SG&A as a percent of sales to decline compared to last year's adjusted number for both the fourth quarter and for the fall season.
Interest expense is now expected to be approximately $118 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the reduction in debt. This is about $20 million below last year. EPS is expected to be $1.42 to $1.47 in the fourth quarter, or $1.50 to $1.55 for the fall season, excluding the debt premium. And this is consistent with the increased guidance that we'd  provided last week.
So for the full year, assuming we achieve the fourth quarter as guided, EPS, excluding the non-recurring premiums associated with both the first and third quarter debt buybacks, would be $1.94 to $1.99. This compares to $1.41 last year, excluding asset impairment charges and division consolidation costs, or an increase of 38% to 41%. This would represent terrific performance.
We have momentum as we enter the fourth quarter. The My Macy's localization and field empowerment is making an enormous difference, and we have new initiatives this fall that are also helping to accelerate our comp store sales growth. The two biggest initiatives I'd like to highlight this morning are our MAGIC selling program and our gift strategy.
For MAGIC selling, as you know, this summer, we trained approximately 130,000 sales associates and sales managers on selling skills, and we are giving seasonal hires a shortened form of this training. Many of you have asked us what MAGIC steps stands for. The M is for meet and make a connection; the A, ask questions and listen; G, give options and give advice; I, inspire to buy; and C, celebrate the purchase. We also are working with our selling managers to improve their coaching skills as an ongoing follow up to this training.
And our gift strategy, we actually started developing our gift strategy for this holiday season in May of 2009 as soon as the new organization was put together, with the focus being on developing unique and fabulous product. As I look at this year's gift strategy, there's really three new components I'd like to highlight. The first is we have new gift shops in 400 doors, which feature limited-edition, exclusive fun gifts that are mostly under $50. And these shops, the G-Shops, will be year round, not just for Christmas.
The second would be our creative be-theme shops like be warm, be pampered, be glamorous, et cetera, that are across all families of business. And the third is our celebrity designer gifts. These are terrific exclusive selections from our celebrity designers like Jessica Simpson, Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, Martha Stewart, Calvin Klein, Michael Kors, Rachel Roy, Kenneth Cole. I could keep going, and as you walk through our stores today, you'll see these throughout the store.
And all of these great new product offerings are being presented in new and very interesting ways, both in our stores and also online. And the products are supported by a terrific marketing campaign.
Our organization is ready and prepared to execute the fourth quarter to a whole new level. We believe we have generated significant momentum in the business, and we expect customers to react well to the newness in our assortments, our engaged selling efforts and our marketing. We hope you will all get out and check out our stores and hopefully, do some holiday shopping.
And with that, I'll take your questions."

And one of the things you need to keep in mind is that, we, both at Macy’s and Bloomingdale's, have the benefit of being more of a fashion retailer and having a higher fashion content in our merchandise, which means that the input cost represents a lower percent of cost of sales and also, it gives us more flexibility in terms of the production, locale and also the materials we're using. So frankly, we are a relatively better position than many of our competitors. But as you said, this is where our increased collaboration with our vendors is going to pay off, both in addressing the sourcing challenges and working together to minimize those. And also, the collaborations are giving us opportunity to reduce other cost of doing business together, which will help us to offset some or all of the increases in the cost of goods. I should also add that, as you think about our private brands, while we're on this subject, we have a terrific sourcing organization with very strong relationships with our manufacturing partners. This, too, will help us minimize any impact we're seeing."

And frankly, until we get through the fourth quarter, I'll be superstitious and let's just wait and talk to them then.

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and 10-Q.
We were very pleased with our results during the third quarter. While sales were a little bit softer than we had hoped in early October with the unexpectedly warm weather, especially relative to last year, we exceeded our sales and profit plan for the quarter. And given our confidence in our business trend, we utilized $500 million of excess cash to buy back debt with maturities between 2011 and 2016 during the quarter in the open market. That brings our total debt reduction this year to over $1.2 billion, including the $150 million we paid at maturity on November 1. 
In the third quarter, our sales were $5,623,000,000, and on a comp-store basis, sales grew 3.9%. It was a good quarter overall for sales. We opened two Macy's stores in California that had been Gottschalks stores, bringing our total Gottschalks conversions up to four. These converted stores are performing very well. 
As we look by family of business, the standout performances on the positive side in the quarter came from fashion watches, our I.N.C. brand, cosmetics and fragrances, Men's and luggage. Other private brands and exclusives also had a very good quarter. The weakest performances were in cold-weather goods, traditional women's sportswear and tabletop. Geographically, we performed best across the south, all the way from Florida to Southern California where weather was less of an issue. Business, as you might imagine, was weaker in the northern climate zones due in large part to the warm weather.
The exception to this was the upper Midwest, the Chicago, Minneapolis and Detroit areas, which had a very strong performance for the third year in a row. macys.com also continued to grow rapidly in the third quarter. The growth in online sales can be attributed to a combination of better merchandising, new technologies like faceted navigation and quick view and a constant focus on omni-channel tactics.
Our digital marketing included the more aggressive use of social media and it's very closely linked with the stores providing a seamless experience for our customers. Also, our recent rollout of what we call Search and Send, where we can satisfy customer demand for items that are either not carried in a particular store or that are out of stock. We can satisfy them using the dot-com inventory. This has been very successful although these sales are not counted in our online sales. As of the third quarter, the Search and Send technology was available to customers in all of our Macy’s stores. 
Bloomingdale's performed well in the quarter, with strong sales both in the stores and also online. In fact, Bloomingdale's sales trend has been comparing favorably to other upscale fashion retailers. The Santa Monica store opened in the quarter and opened very strong, as did our first three outlet stores. The fourth outlet store is expected to open next week.
Gross margin in the third quarter was 40%, which is up 20 basis points from last year had the current accounting treatment been in effect, but down 20 basis points from last year on a reported basis. This is as anticipated and consistent with our prior guidance of a flattish gross margin rate for the fall season, meaning the third and fourth quarters combined.
We ended the third quarter with inventory up 1.9%. And while higher than it has been, the inventory level is still well below our comp store sales trend. We have focused on building fresh inventories in opportunity areas to help drive our fourth quarter sales.
SG&A in the quarter was $2,069,000,000, only up 0.6% had the accounting treatment been effect last year, and up 1.8% as reported. And as a percent of sales, SG&A was 36.9%, down 120 basis points from last year compared to the adjusted number, or down 160 basis point on a reported basis. This was also consistent with our guidance for the fall season.
Operating income in the third quarter was $177 million, more than double last year's $88 million before division consolidation costs. And as a percent of sales, operating income in the quarter was 3.1% versus 1.7% last year before division consolidation costs.
Interest expense in the quarter was $164 million, including $39 million of the non-recurring premium and fees associated with our open market debt repurchase. Excluding this, interest expense would have been $125 million, down from last year's $137 million and slightly lower than expectations.
Net income in the quarter was $10 million, or $0.02 per share. Excluding the non-recurring expenses associated with the debt buyback, EPS was $0.08 per share compared to last year's loss of $0.03, excluding division consolidation costs.
Cash flow from operating activities was $346 million for the 39 weeks of 2010, down $60 million from last year. But remember that we contributed $325 million to the pension plan as of this point in the year versus approximately $146 million last year, which reduced our cash flow from operating activities year-over-year by $179 million.
Cash flow from investing activities was roughly the same as last year, and we used $1,032,000,000 for financing activities this year versus $926 million last year. And at the end of the third quarter, we had $715 million of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet versus $581 million last year. This demonstrates the cash flow potential of this business given how much debt we have eliminated this year while at the same time, supporting the capital needs of the company.
It was a good quarter, and we are now ready for the fourth quarter. So let's move on and talk about our guidance.
As we look at sales for the fourth quarter, our guidance is for a comp store increase of 3% to 4%. And we're anticipating approximately 130-basis point spread between total sales growth and comp store sales growth for the fourth quarter. We are expecting a lower gross margin rate in the fourth quarter than both the reported and adjusted rates last year. You'll recall that last year's gross margin rate in the fourth quarter was unusually high, even beating that of 2007. As we guided at the end of the second quarter, the gross margin rate for the fall season would be flattish compared to last year's adjusted number, and we would give that same guidance today.
We are expecting a larger increase in SG&A dollars in the fourth quarter than that, that we experienced in the third quarter due to a shift in marketing dollars from earlier in the year and also last year's Visa and MasterCard settlement. SG&A dollars for the two quarters combined is consistent though with prior guidance. And we continue to expect the SG&A as a percent of sales to decline compared to last year's adjusted number for both the fourth quarter and for the fall season.
Interest expense is now expected to be approximately $118 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the reduction in debt. This is about $20 million below last year. EPS is expected to be $1.42 to $1.47 in the fourth quarter, or $1.50 to $1.55 for the fall season, excluding the debt premium. And this is consistent with the increased guidance that we provided last week.
So for the full year, assuming we achieve the fourth quarter as guided, EPS, excluding the non-recurring premiums associated with both the first and third quarter debt buybacks, would be $1.94 to $1.99. This compares to $1.41 last year, excluding asset impairment charges and division consolidation costs, or an increase of 38% to 41%. This would represent terrific performance.
We have momentum as we enter the fourth quarter. The My Macy's localization and field empowerment is making an enormous difference, and we have new initiatives this fall that are also helping to accelerate our comp store sales growth. The two biggest initiatives I'd like to highlight this morning are our M.A.G.I.C. selling program and our gift strategy.
For M.A.G.I.C. selling, as you know, this summer, we trained approximately 130,000 sales associates and sales managers on selling skills, and we are giving seasonal hires a shortened form of this training. Many of you have asked us what M.A.G.I.C.  steps stands for. The M is for meet and make a connection; the A, ask questions and listen; G, give options and give advice; I, inspire to buy; and C, celebrate the purchase. We also are working with our selling managers to improve their coaching skills as an ongoing follow-up to this training.
And our gift strategy, we actually started developing our gift strategy for this holiday season in May of 2009 as soon as the new organization was put together, with the focus being on developing unique and fabulous product. As I look at this year's gift strategy, there's really three new components I'd like to highlight. The first is we have new gift shops in 400 doors, which feature limited-edition, exclusive fun gifts that are mostly under $50. And these shops, the G-Shops, will be year round, not just for Christmas.
The second would be our creative be-theme shops like be warm, be pampered, be glamorous, et cetera, that are across all families of business. And the third is our celebrity designer gifts. These are terrific exclusive selections from our celebrity designers like Jessica Simpson, Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, Martha Stewart, Calvin Klein, Michael Kors, Rachel Roy, Kenneth Cole. I could keep going, and as you walk through our stores today, you'll see these throughout the store.
And all of these great new product offerings are being presented in new and very interesting ways, both in our stores and also online. And the products are supported by a terrific marketing campaign.
Our organization is ready and prepared to execute the fourth quarter to a whole new level. We believe we have generated significant momentum in the business, and we expect customers to react well to the newness in our assortments, our engaged selling efforts and our marketing. We hope you will all get out and check out our stores and hopefully, do some holiday shopping.
And with that, I'll take your questions."

And one of the things you need to keep in mind is that, we, both at Macy’s and Bloomingdale's, have the benefit of being more of a fashion retailer and having a higher fashion content in our merchandise, which means that the input cost represents a lower percent of cost of sales and also, it gives us more flexibility in terms of the production, locale and also the materials we're using. So frankly, we are in a relatively better position than many of our competitors. But as you said, this is where our increased collaboration with our vendors is going to pay off, both in addressing the sourcing challenges and working together to minimize those. And also, the collaborations are giving us opportunity to reduce other costs of doing business together, which will help us to offset some or all of the increases in the cost of goods. I should also add that, as you think about our private brands, while we're on this subject, we have a terrific sourcing organization with very strong relationships with our manufacturing partners.

If you could just walk through some of the assumptions behind that, what are you expecting for the promotional environment in the fourth quarter? Are you canning for the fact that December of last year was one of the coldest on record and this December forecasted to be a bit warmer? Maybe walk through some of the expectations there. And then the second question, any updates from discussions with the rating agencies? Any sense of when we could see a return in Macy’s to investment grade here?"

As you'll recall last year in the fourth quarter, it was record high, and we just think it's going to be hard to beat that this year. So again, we aren't expecting it to be any more promotional than last year. It's just that when we look at the timing of markdowns and how the quarter should end up, our merchants believe it's unrealistic to expect to increase that margin yet again. But again, that's not new news, and we aren't expecting it to be any more promotional. In terms of the rating agencies, we've not had any meaningful conversations through the year. And frankly, until we get through the fourth quarter, I'll be superstitious and let's just wait and talk to them then. But clearly, reducing debt and reducing the pension underfunding this year, clearly, makes our balance sheet significantly stronger in combination with the significant increase in EBITDA this year. And I think as you've read the reports this year, they are taking note. What that means in terms of investment grade timing, I can’t speak for them."

In terms of the credit penetration in the third quarter, it was actually down, about 100 basis points but still above 2008. So we are seeing pressure on the penetration, which we think is, in large part, a function of new acquisitions being more challenging relating to the CARD Act. So that has been a challenge, and again, better than two years ago. You may recall that last year as the economy was so weak, credit penetration spiked, and now we're seeing it come back to what I would call, more normal levels. And on the investment and warehouses for the direct-to-customer business, we have announced an expansion of our Portland, Tennessee facility which we will be doing, and most likely, we'll be building or taking over a new distribution center in 2011, 2012. So we're still working on the details for that. So we anticipate it will require significant capital, but at this point, can't give you a more specific number."
