Also with us today is Bill Lyons, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for both companies. This morning, we will be discussing fourth quarter and annual results for both companies. In addition, we will be discussing our outlook for 2010. Any forward-looking statements we may express for our expectations or results as you know are subject to business risks and we have enumerated those risks in both earnings releases issued this morning in our SEC 10-K filings. In addition, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose any proved or unproved reserves that the company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation test, to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions. We may use certain terms in this Conference Call such as net unrisked resources which SEC guidelines strictly prohibit us from filing with our filings with the SEC. We also caution you that the SEC views such net unrisked resource estimates as inherently unreliable, and that these estimates may be misleading to investors unless the investor is an expert in the gas industry. With that, let me begin the remarks and then take questions. We will start today with Bill Lyons. Bill?"

CONSOL Energy is reporting net income of $143 million or $0.78 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2009. This is ab",1465,"Thank you, Dan and thank you everyone for joining us this morning for the joint CONSOL Energy and CNX Gas earnings conference call. CONSOL Energy is reporting net income of $143 million or $0.78 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2009. This is about equal to the fourth quarter earnings of 2008, after adjusting for the special income item related to the recovery of black lung excise tax. For the full year 2009, CONSOL energy is reporting net income of $540 million or $2.95 per share. This is almost $100 million higher than the net income for the year 2008, which was $442 million or $2.40 per share. This is the second year in a row that CONSOL Energy has set an earnings record.Net cash provided from operating activities is $216 million, compared with $346 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the year, net cash provided from operating activities was $945 million, compared with $1.029 billion in 2008. EBITDA for 2009 was $1.224 billion, that's up $149 million from the $1.075 billion in 2008. The numbers speak for themselves. CONSOL Energy has established itself as a company that generates strong earnings and cash flows by utilizing a sustainable model that provides financial and operational flexibility. This flexibility enables us to react and adapt to changing economic environments and markets, while continuing to prudently invest in our businesses. The quarter and the year again demonstrated the financial power of being a low-cost diversified energy company. Let me go into the quarter, the year and the coming year in more detail. Our Met[Metallurgical] Coal business, we sold 1 million tons in the fourth quarter at an average price about $108 per ton. With costs at $40.48 per ton, we had all in margin of almost $68. I hope everyone had a chance to read our press release this morning announcing that we have sold five more vessels of high-vol coking coal, sourced from Bailey and Blacksville mines, and destined for integrated steel mills in China. The sales were made by Xcoal,, and as the continual result of our Asian marketing initiative that we announced last month. The sales from these five vessels total approximately 410,000 short tons. Combined with our earlier vessel to China that of 82,000 short tons, we have already sold a half a million tons of Northern Appalachian coal into the Asian met market in 2010.Our coal terminal in Baltimore provides us with dedicated capacity at 12 million tons per year for export to these high-value markets. We also have the ability to expand capacity of Baltimore by 6 million to 8 million tons, if markets warrant this expansion.Brett will talk more about the met markets and our met capabilities in a few minutes. On the thermal or steam coal side, we sold 14.5 million tons in the fourth quarter at an average price of $54 per ton. That was up 17% from last year's quarters average realized price per ton. Cost per ton of thermal coal in the quarter was just over $44, up about $5 from last year. The majority of this increase can be attributed to our decision to reduce production to help the market stay in equilibrium.Thermal coal financial margins for the fourth quarter, were $9.94 per ton or 32% higher than the $7.52 financial margin for the prior year's quarter. While many of our thermal coal contracts were priced in 2008 when the thermal coal market was tight, we believe that a substantial portion of this pricing reflect the continued scrubber build out. Increasingly, our thermal coal is being prized for its high heat content, its location and its stability of supply.You may have seen that last week, we restarted our Shoemaker mine after a $205 million multiyear refurbishment. This mine now joins our premier fleet of efficient low-cost Northern Appalachia longwall mines. The Shoemaker mine will have a production capability of approximately 5 million tons per year. Operationally, our mines continue to do well. Our longwall development is in great shape and we can ramp up some additional production, should the market warrant this effort. 2009 is the most profitable year we have ever had in our coal segment. As I've mentioned on previous earnings calls, margin expansion is the key driver in our step change in profitability. Our gas segment, CNX Gas of which we own 83.3% had another outstanding quarter. Production increased 13% quarter-over-quarter, to a record 25.1 Bcf. This record production was driven by better than anticipated results in our Virginia coalbed methane and our Marcellus Shale operations. In the fourth quarter of 2009, overall cost of CNX Gas operations were $3.47 per Mcf or $0.13 better than they were in the fourth quarter of 2008. However, the record production volumes and lower costs were not enough to overcome the depressed stock prices for natural gas.Even though we had 15.3 Bcf of our gas production hedged at $7.90 per Mcf in the quarter, our average realization per Mcf was $6.47, a reduction of 23% from last year's fourth quarter. Net income at CNX Gas was $41.1 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the fourth quarter, and this is down about 30% compared with the net income in the fourth quarter of 2008.The decrease in net income is solely the result of lower spot prices. For the year 2009, CNX Gas net income was $164.5 million or $1.09 per share and that's down $74.6 million from 2008. Annual production was 94.4 Bcf, a record and was up 23% from 2008.We continue to be excited about our Marcellus Shale opportunities. We increased our footprint by 20,000 acres in the quarter to 250,000 acres. 2/3 of these acres are considered to be Tier 1 acres. We are actively seeking additional acreage primarily in Southwestern Pennsylvania and Northern West Virginia where we have synergies with our other operations. Earlier this week, we issued our year-end gas reserve numbers. During 2009, CNX Gas increased its reserves by 34% to 1.9 trillion cubic feet. We achieved a drill bit finding cost of $0.39 per Mcf and replaced over 400% of our 2009 production in a falling price environment.Our financial position allows us to continue to prudently invest in our businesses, even in difficult economic times. In 2009, we invested almost $1 billion in CapEx, about the same amount we invested in 2008. We expect to invest a similar amount in 2010. And the 2010 numbers we've broken out about $500 million in coal, $400 million in gas and $100 million on other activities. The investments in coal operations are primarily in the efficiency area to maintain our position as a low-cost producer. The investments and the gap company are focused on growth with emphasis on expanding our Marcellus Shale acreage position, increasing drilling and increasing production. CNX Gas required approximately 19,000 acres of CBM leases and 63,700 acres of Marcellus Shale leases in 2009. In the Marcellus Shale area, our goal is to increase our position from 250,000 acres to 400,000 acres. We are ramping up drilling in the Marcellus Shale and plan to add a second rig in March. The new rig will be a flex rig, that will enable us to drill multiple wells on a single pad more efficiently. We have an option to add a third rig if the market dictates. We plan to drill 24 horizontal Marcellus Shale wells in 2010. We also will be drilling 175 Virginia CBM Wells and 25 horizontal wells in the Chattanooga Shale.As I've said, we're very excited about the potential of our Marcellus Shale assets. Next week, the first Marcellus Shale well that we drilled which was in October 2008, will have produced 1 billion cubic feet of gas. Now let me return to CONSOL Energy's overall financial position. Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have excellent liquidity. At December 31, 2009, CONSOL Energy and that's including CNX Gas had over $600 million in total liquidity available for immediate use at interest rates that are well below market. We remain steadfast in our confidence in our business model. Our balance sheet and our status as a safe low-cost producer, enables us to effectively compete and produce excellent earnings and cash flows even during times of economic turmoil. Among our met coal reserves and our thermal coal reserves and our gas reserves in Appalachia, CONSOL Energy controls the greatest concentration of Btus in the eastern United States. For almost 15 decades and through many business cycles, CONSOL Energy has remained committed for optimizing long-term shareholder value by putting safety first, by being respectful to the environment and the communities in which we operate and providing meaningful employment opportunities. We remain committed to these values.Brett, your comments on the quarter and the year?"

I'd like to talk about where I see the future and especially in the short-term. We'll talk somewhat about the long-term on both coal and gas. First thing I want to talk about is our initiative on safety. We have a safety program that we're trying to drive the company to zero accidents across the company. Zero is achievable, our gas company stays at zero in terms of their reporting and doing a very good job especially with all our expansion. And the coal company, I can say, the coal side is the best year we ever had in terms of safety. So we believe it's achievable. I think we'll see in our future a year where we're zero on all of our operations and we're looking forward to that.On CONSOL Energy in total, I want to talk about the cycles of energy between coal and gas. If you go back to 2008, because gas prices were up, a big contributor was gas as it grew on volume as well as price. It was a higher percentage of earnings in 2008 than coal was. We saw that reverse in 2009, and a higher percentage of coal added value to CONSOL Energy as gas prices dropped even though we added volume. In both cases, if you look at our ability to weather any environment and energy on two different cycles creates real value for our shareholders not only in the gas company, but in total and CONSOL Energy with its ownership of gas. These two cycles create record earnings as we run through the cycles. Our shareholders should be aware of that and understand that the growth of the gas company is directly related to the footprint of the coal company and the combination of those two create real value for our shareholders over time.I'm going to talk specifically about gas now. As Bill said, record year in production. 23% growth. Proven reserves were up 34%. Since we became public in the gas company in 2005, we have doubled our annual production. We have almost doubled our proven reserves. The interesting thing is we plan to do that again in the next five years. And our intention are to keep growing this company because it's a low-cost producer in any marketplace, and we'll always have the advantage on margins. We are the fastest growing company, I think of the United States in terms of gas but in Appalachia for sure, of major companies. We believe we could continue to do this and what another very interesting part of that, it's being done with its own cash flow. We're not borrowing money to grow it, so it's a very powerful position. I would say, when you look at the gas company, its future has never been brighter, it has a real strong position on Marcellus Shale, it has an annuity type project in Virginia, it continues growing both places and we see real value in both of those spots, and real potential to grow on the Marcellus Shale based on our fee footprint. We didn't borrow money to get this footprint. We have it in our company. Let's talk about those markets.We see storage on the gas side at about -- it's approaching a five-year average storage and we think that, that's a good place for gas at this point in time. We see switching from coal to gas at about 450 million, and when it touches that between 450 million and 500 million, we'll see switching between coal and gas on generation.We're very excited about the future of the gas company and where it's headed. Now let's talk about coal. Coal is very interesting at this point in time as well. Keep in mind we have the highest concentration of low-cost high-Btu coal anywhere in the United States. Now, what we're finding is that, that concentration on capital spend on that coal, especially in the Pittsburgh 8 [#8] seam is showing two different marketplace strengths. One is the traditional steam market, of which we've always been very powerful and high margin, and low cost driven. But if you go back in time, the same seem of coal is what made the steel business powerful in Pittsburgh itself. Steel came to Pittsburgh because of coal and water. This same coal is the coal we mine typically for steam, but has metallurgical characteristics that the world is now demanding. That's why you see us moving this coal into a marketplace when the value of the dollar is right, the transportation's right and the demand for this type of product lines up together. So it's important that you understand we're already capitalized to move into these marketplaces between steam and coal, especially with the investment that we have in our own facilities in Baltimore, to move the coal offshore when the time is right. We are a low-cost producer in this product and it creates real value for shareholders and margin expansion, as we move between these two different products.Now, let's not forget about Buchanan. Buchanan is the lowest cost, highest-quality low-vol coal in Appalachia, and so margin expansion there is rather easy as we see prices rising there. That is the solid mine, it's well capitalized, we've done a lot of work to make it more consistent over time and we see rising markets on that very high quality product itself. The high-vol coking coal that we call coming out of the Pittsburgh seam, we think that will range right now, the price is ranging between $70 and $85 a ton depending on the quality from mine-to-mine. What we see at Buchanan right now, we have 2.7 million tons to reprice. For 2010, we see it between $135 and $145 a ton if we sold that today. That's where we see the marketplace right now.Margin expansion is what drives us. If you saw what we did in 2009, even though we dropped volume, we were focused on optimum places, margin expansion and let me say something about the operations of the mines themselves. We pulled back and developed longwall panels, even though we didn't run longwalls, it put us in a great position for 2010. As the market's been unfolding, remember last time I talked about 2010 being a bridge for CONSOL to I think a brighter marketplace in 2011. We see that bridge shortening right now. These changes in the met market, as well as demand for electricity as it begins to rise, as well as cold weather that have drawn stockpiles down in our natural marketplace, puts us in a position where we think that prices on coal for steam will rebound quicker than what we originally anticipated. More like the second half of 2010, versus the first half of 2011.We are spending money in the mines. We're spending money on longwall expansions to keep our costs down in terms of -- we're making the phases wider. And when we finish those projects, we will reevaluate what projects we're going forward. I see the expansion of the Gas business as our number one priority, we see the capitalization of what is already in place on the coal side as a priority in terms of maintaining what we have and expanding margins in that area.So I'm very enthused about both pieces. I'm enthused about the steam side, the metallurgical side, the gas side, the Marcellus Play, and if you go right down into the -- on the gas side down into Virginia, where every hole we poke in the ground, we make a lot of money, that's also the base of our gas company and we're excited about that as well. So with all those pieces, I'm enthused about our ability to work our way through tough marketplaces, and I'm very impressed with this company's assets and the people's ability to adjust to the marketplaces as we see them shift. This is a very valuable company with great assets. And I would be glad to open this up for questions at this point in time."

But that will be kind of  year-by-year depending on where we see the marketplace. But our emphasis from a CONSOL Energy perspective, is going to be very, very rapid growth in the Gas business because of our low-cost position there. So I would look at the company as the coal side would be well-capitalized creating cash to grow the gas business until we see real demand for coal while the nation tries to figure out what's it going to do between coal and gas. It's nice to have that optionality. That looks like what we're going to do in the next five years."

And the customers that we've typically always supply, we have good relationships for some  but we always supply based on agreed prices. And if we see real demand for this coal in China and in Asia, that becomes a swing supply for other sources for them. They might want us -- we think China burns about 200 million tons a year of met coal, and so for us to move 5 to 10 million tons of met coal from Pittsburgh gates seeing, it's a drop in the bucket to them but it's also a swing supply for them because we are very dependable. We have the four facilities, and we have the ability to get there. And they have a lot of strength in terms of shipping. So I would say the market's changing and the demand for energy coming out of Asia, especially China. And remember two quarters ago, I never would've said that we'd be shipping coal to China. I am pleasantly surprised to how this -- so it could end up being a long-term relationship."

One is CO2 legislation, what does that really mean to the coal industry? I think well-capitalized mines like what we have will supply the big power plants for the next 25 to 30 years no matter what. And the question is how much restraints can be put on the utilities? What I think will happen, if you do a lot of CO2 legislation, you're going to end up stopping capital from coming into the development of coal supply, and that will drive the price of coal up to the utilities. And in the short term, I think, well-capitalized companies make a lot of money. In the long term, I think that the cost of energy's going to rise pretty fast in the United States. The other thing that's going to be hit very hard, and this is in on the gas side and the coal side, the EPA is very focused on water and discharge of water, whether it's a drilled hole or a mined whole [indiscernible], and that water is going to be, it strikes a new air. Remember the 90s? All the changes in the air regulation? We're seeing the same kind of thing on water, and it's going to drive the price of energy up domestically.

A new year is traditionally time for enthusiasm, excitement and often a start of change. These certainly apply to CONSOL Energy. The first quarter of 2010 continued our string of strong financial results, and with the acquisition of Dominion Resources' Appalachian E&P business, 2010 will be a year that will change the landscape of CONSOL energy.
The key event in the first quarter of course is the acquisition of the Dominion Appalachian E&P business for $3.475 billion. This is a transforming event for the company. During our deal road show and in today's release we have spoken at length on the merits of this transaction. So I won't repeat them there. However I would like to briefly comment on the financial side of the deal.
On March 26th, CONSOL energy offered $44.3 million common shares, concurrently with $2.75 billion high yield notes split between two tranches and that's of 7 and 10 year senior notes. The simultaneous offerings were marketed over four day road show that covered over 250 accounts in New York, Boston, New Orleans, Los Angeles and San Francisco, achieving a 76% hit rate on one-on-one equity meetings.
The debt security is priced at 8% and 8.25% on the 7 and 10 year offerings and the order book was multiple times oversubscribed and when you add to the $2 billion credit facility that we are in a process of completing, that's over $6.5 billion that various investors have entrusted to us.
We are both humbled and inspired by the response of the tappable markets to investment leases. The Dominion E&P acquisition complements our existing assets and will be highly correlated to value creation for our shareholders. The Dominion transaction will close tomorrow.
The second major event of the year is our launching of the tender offer for the shares of CNX gas that we don't currently own. With the Dominion acquisition almost at hand, it makes sense for us to have all our gas assets managed as one business. With a tender price of $38.25 per share and with $25 million shares outstanding, we anticipate paying $965 million for those shares. We expect the tender offer to be completed by May 26.
Now let's review our results for the quarter. We had another excellent quarter. CONSOL energy is reporting net income of $100 million or $0.54 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2010, the GAAP net income that was impaired by several items. We incurred fees of $47 million associated with the Dominion acquisition.
We also incurred noncash charges totaling another $47 million. These charges include $25 million associated with reclamation accruals at the Fola mine and $22 million associated with certain legal accruals. If you choose to adjust for these items, our adjusted net income was $156 million or $0.85 per diluted share. Our adjusted EBITDA was $349 million. These numbers show the underlying strength of our assets.
Back in October we characterized 2010 as a bridge year. Then in January we acknowledged that the bridge appears to be a lot shorter than it was in October. Our first quarter results support our optimism for 2010. What has happened, in the low-vol coating coal last October, we expected to sell un-priced 2010 coal for around $135 or $145 per ton at the mine. Our latest sales are in the $170 per ton range.
Also last October, we had an entirely new - we've added an entirely new category of sales. This is our high-vol coking coal. This coal from our Pittsburgh 8 steam mines and Northern Appalachia is selling in Asia and Brazil for prices much higher the loans you get by selling it into the domestic thermal market. So, coal for 2010, we have sold or committed 2.1 million tons at an average price of $73.
The thermal business has improved since last October also. The colder than normal winter enabled generators to reduce stockpiles from the record levels of early December. Our thermal business has also benefited from our selling of the high-vol coal to Brazil, and Asia. Since it's the same coal that we sell to domestic thermal customers moving tons overseas has the added benefit of tightening up the domestic market.
Now that we are into the shoulder season, thermal demand has weakened a bit Inventories are still higher than we care to see somewhere around 55 to 60 days. On the gas side, spot prices have weakened considerably. At year-end, they were around $6 per Mcf. Today they are at $4.25. In our first quarter results for GAAP however, we had a very good average sales price of $7.24 per Mcf because of our strong hedge position.
With our strong hedge position for 2010, and our low cost structure, we expect to outperform our gas peers this year. In summary, both our low-vol business and our high-vol business are doing very well. The thermal coal business has improved considerably, and the gas business is outperforming its peers.
This quarter results show once again the value to shareholders and earnings shares in a diversified energy company that has best in class assets in four separate categories, world class low-vol assets at Buchanan, high-vol assets in the Pittsburgh seam that didn't exist six months and that we ship out of our 100% owned Baltimore terminal, the highest Btu thermal assets in the country and our gas company's leading position in possibly the world's largest gas formation, the Marcellus Shale. This collection of assets can't be duplicated by a portfolio manager cobbling together pure plays. You can only invest in these best of class assets by buying CONSOL Energy shares.
The numbers speak for themselves. CONSOL Energy has established himself as a company that generates strong earnings in cash flows by utilizing a sustainable model that provides financial flexibility. This flexibility enables us to react and to adapt the changing economic environments in markets while continuing to prudently invest in our businesses.
This quarter again demonstrated the financial power of being a low cost diversified energy company. We remain steadfast in our confidence in our business model. Our balance sheet and our status is a safe low cost producer enables us to effectively compete and produce exceptional earnings and cash flows even in uncertain economic times.
CONSOL Energy controls the greatest concentrations of Btu in the Eastern United States. For almost 15 decades now, and through many business cycles, CONSOL Energy has remained committed to optimizing shareholder value by putting safety first, by being respectful to the environment and the communities in which we operate, and by providing meaningful employment opportunities. We remain committed to these values.
With that Brett, could we have your comments for the quarter?

Thank you all for spending time with us to listen to us, and also give us the opportunity to answer your questions.Our format changed a little bit on our press release, so there's a lot of information there. I think it's very straightforwar",1300,"Thanks Bill. Thank you all for spending time with us to listen to us, and also give us the opportunity to answer your questions.
Our format changed a little bit on our press release, so there's a lot of information there. I think it's very straightforward information, and some of my comments are there, so I'll make mine brief and we'll get to the questions as soon as possible. But first I'd like to talk about some strategic things as well as forward-looking things.
First, let me say as a fourth generation coal miner myself, we grief for the 29 lost lives in West Virginia. And those are tough things for the entire industry. I can tell you, though, that CONSOL Energy has an unwavering commitment to zero accidents, and we believe that we are the generation that can bring these mines to zero accidents, and our intention is to steadfastly do that until we're at zero everywhere in our corporation.
Progress is been made inside CONSOL, and anytime we have an accident of any kind, it is an exception to our beliefs and our values, and we operate that way, and our shareholders need to be aware of that.
Let me move into the coal business. The met coal market plays itself we see as it's been very robust. Our expectations for the year have been exceeded on pricing. We've done some good deals on the pricing side, but let me talk about our China sales.
Our relationship with EXCO has been a good one. I can tell you as in 2010, that 90% of all met coal coming out of North America into China's steel mills will come directly from CONSOL and EXCO. That should give you focus on who is moving the coal into that country, into that great expanding market, and who has the legs up to do that.
With our relationship with EXCO, we've been able to do that, and I'm very proud of our marketing people and our abilities to get that done. We see that as a growing market. We believe we'll hit 3 million tons of that high-vol coal into China this year, and we believe it's going to grow into next year.
Now, we don't have firm numbers on what next year looks like, but we're optimistic, it will grow from 3 million, and that gives us the concept of continuing to push the BMX mine because of its high quality value, and it's a low cost structure that it will have on the high-vol met coal side as well as expansion of the Baltimore port when we see that that expansion is necessary for the use of our relationship and our shareholders.
I expect the market to be good enough to where we could approve the expansion of the Baltimore facilities in 2011. With this change in high-vol met and low-vol met, for 2010 we believe we will be the number one or number two met producer in all of North America. That is a strong function of our asset-based, and it's a test to the value of this Company across the Board.
Now let's talk about the steam coal side. The steam coal side is not getting the legs as quickly as we thought it might. I think the demand for power is down a little bit, but you can see their margins are robust and powerful, and as we see the demand for power in the U.S. come back, we believe that the supply will be short on the rebound, which will force upward pricing movement on all steam coal in the United States, especially for domestic power.
We think things will tighten dramatically on the environmental side as well as safety constraints related to the accident in West Virginia. And I can tell you, that on the steam side we are sold out at very high margins for 2010. We have no coal available in the Pittsburgh 8 seam for the steam market in 2010 beyond what's always been signed up.
Okay. Let's talk about gas. Great acquisition that we made, we're very excited about that. But I'm going to talk about what we're doing within CNX Gas first. The CBM side continues to be the low cost producer with expansion very rapidly on our Virginia properties, and at real value to our shareholders across the Board. That is been a great success. That's where we started into the gas business, and we see great success going forward there, as a low cost producer in any gas marketplace.
Now let's move to our Marcellus Shale piece. Now we already had that within our estate as we moved from CBM into Marcellus Shale. We saw the value there. We continue to siege huge value there. We're having great success on those wells, as you can see in the documentation that we put out.
It puts us in a position of the low cost producer in both CBM and Marcellus Shale in any marketplace we are going to be the highest margins just like we are at coal, and that brought us to the acquisition. When we saw the acquisition of Marcellus shale to be available, we move forward with a strong balance sheet, tied up very valuable resources in our backyard.
There's been some chatter about CONSOL's in going more into the gas business and walking away from coal. I can tell you from the earnings that we just announced, why would we walk away from the best assets in the country. What we've done is enhanced our position in our backyard for our shareholders, and that will create huge value over time.
Let's talk about the acquisition a little bit more directly. That's a big acquisition, and it has a lot of value. We are putting together plans to optimize what we see for the next 10 years for expansion in that Marcellus Shale, and what we intend to do is take the net present value of the value of that deal, and move it forward for our shareholders with innovations, and development of the resources, however that looks.
We are very flexible. We intend to do that and monetize the value of that as quickly as we can into the pockets of our shareholders. We are in a low cost high margin position across gas, Marcellus as well as CBM. On the met business, we are in a low cost high margin position in the steam business. We are in the low cost high margin position, and we have flexibility on every one of these assets with great transportation assets as well as skills and management to get this job done.
Let's talk about earnings a little bit. We did not have to rebound from the recession because we had a record year last year driven by the coal business. If you go back to 2008, our strong year was driven by gas. If you go to 2009, our strong year was driven by coal. If you look at 2010, our strong year is been driven by coal and coal margins.
We believe from 2011 and on, that our strong low cost position in coal and gas will drive on these two different cycles, real value to our shareholders and an expediential way from where we've been in the past. We are very excited about our ability to operate these two very valuable resources in our backyard, and when we call our backyard, we are talking about Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and this region right here where this is the energy of the Eastern United States, and we own the biggest low cost percentage of that.
With that, I'd like to answer questions. John, could you please instruct the listeners on the procedures for asking questions.

So, that's unfolding right now. We can't give you specifics, but what I can tell you is, when the economy rebounds dramatically and we think it will.

So that's the general sort of rig schedule, which correlates to drilling schedule. The specific drilling plans are laid out in detail and when you look at the major areas of where we have the 750,000 acres, right now obviously we've drilled 17 and put into sales 17 horizontal wells in the Greene County area, that's going to continue to be an area of focus for drilling.
We will be drilling wells, horizontal wells in the (inaudible) Barber County areas in Northern West Virginia late this year, and we will be drilling wells in sort of the Westmoreland County, Indiana County corridor as well by the end of 2010 and to 2011. What we see with regard to those two areas, that's the Northern West Virginia, and Indiana, Westmoreland County areas is exiting. These were the acres we picked up from the Dominion acquisition, and we started looking at well logs, vertical wells that were drilled by Dominion prior to the acquisition and horizontal wells drilled by third parties in both of those areas.

So what happens with regard to those specific wells, and once the implications moving forward, I think there's an upside potential with regard to what we've been assuming for recoverable reserve for the 17 that we've drilled to date and put into line? I also think that when you look at future wells that we're going to be drilling, 3500 foot plus laterals along with 10 plus frac stages for horizontal well are going to be the norm, and that will have a more than proportional increase in EUR and production curve NPV as opposed to capital cost.
So, from our perspective we are starting from a pretty conservative base on reserve, and the trick there obviously is improve upon that in incrementally increase the recoverable reserve with longer footage.

So if you go beyond that and you look at the high-vol mines themselves, six months ago we weren't even talking about China. In fact, I've chastised some of our competitors for even talking about it and then we got right into it. That's evolving and I would say if we look at next year - the 3 million tons this year we know are for real and the freight is showing up.
We're loading them up and we're getting the job done. They're being introduced as the steel mills. Like Bob, Bruce [ph] and Terry was there about a month ago and he saw this happening. We expect it to continue to expand as our reputation increases in China and opportunities unfold and so we have essentially 30 million tons of capacity that's already built into our mine of this kind of coal that can go that direction.
Of course, right now it's in the steam market and so I think we'll see a gradual movement and I don't know where it ends. Right now we see it at three. Next year, we probably can see it at double that. But we don't have that in hand. I'm just estimating. And it could move up to ten over time. We don't know. It's a new market, we're expanding and we'll give you blow by blow as we know. But we do know this is a real market and they're excited about it. Bob?

In total country wide I would say 25 million to 30 million and most of that will be in the - what I call the southern company area, would be to the south. We see a lot of gas generation there. If it stays around $4 we're going to see that happen. I also believe that we're going to see about 20 million to 25 million tons of capacity pulled out of the central App, just based on restrictions of mountain top mining and the permitting issues we see down there.
So there's a lot of combinations moving here but the growth on gas versus coal will not happen beyond that number I don't believe until we see more gas plants built and the utilities or somebody making the commitment to build these gas plants. I do believe that will happen in the next couple of years but right now with the demand for energy down overall, compared to where the market was a couple years ago, there is capacity in coal and gas to the point where all markets are being fed on existing plants. So the max we're going to see I think is about 25 million to 30 million tons a year until we see new gas plants build. But I think new gas plants will be built before new coal plants.

A new year is traditionally a time for enthusiasm, excitement and often a start of change. These certainly apply to CONSOL Energy. The first quarter of 2010 continued our string of strong financial results, and with the acquisition of Dominion Resources' Appalachian E&P business, 2010 will be a year that will change the landscape of CONSOL Energy.
The key event in the first quarter, of course, is the acquisition of the Dominion Appalachian E&P business for $3.475 billion. This is a transforming event for the company. During our deal roadshow and in today's release, we have spoken at length on the merit of this transaction, so I won't repeat them here. However, I would like to briefly comment on the financial side of the deal. On March 26, the CONSOL Energy offered 44.3 million common shares concurrently with $2.75 billion high-yield notes with between two tranches, and that's a seven- and 10-year senior notes. 
The simultaneous offerings were marketed over a four-day roadshow that covered over 250 accounts in New York, Boston, New Orleans, Los Angeles and San Francisco, achieving a 76% hit rate on one-on-one equity meetings. The debt securities priced at 8% and 8.25% on the seven- and 10-year offerings and the order book was multiple times oversubscribed. And when you add to it, the $2 billion credit facility that we are in the process of completing, that's over $6.5 billion that various investors have entrusted to us. We are both humbled and inspired by the response of the capital market to our investment leases. The Dominion E&P acquisition complements our existing assets, and will be highly correlated to value creation for our shareholders. The Dominion transaction will close tomorrow. 
The second major event of the year is our launching of the tender offer for the shares of CNX Gas that we don't currently own. With the Dominion acquisition almost at hand, it makes sense for us to have all our gas assets managed as one business. With the tender price of $38.25 per share, and with 25 million shares outstanding, we anticipate paying $965 million for those shares. We expect the tender offer to be completed by May 26.
So let's review our results for the quarter. We had another excellent quarter. CONSOL Energy is reporting net income of $100 million or $0.54 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2010. The GAAP net income though was impaired by several items. We incurred fees of $47 million associated with the Dominion acquisition. We also incurred non-cash charges totaling another $47 million. These charges include $25 million associated with reclamation accruals at the Fola Mine, and $22 million associated with certain legal accruals. If you choose to adjust for these items, our adjusted net income was $156 million or $0.85 per diluted share. Our adjusted EBITDA was $349 million. These numbers show the underlying strength of our assets.
Back in October, we characterized 2010 as a bridge year. Then in January, we acknowledged that the bridge appears to be a lot shorter than it was in October. Our first quarter results report our optimism for 2010. What has happened? In the low-vol coking coal last October, we expected to sell our unpriced 2010 coal for around $135 to $145 per ton at the mine. Our latest sales are in the $170 per ton range. 
Also last October, we've added an entirely new category of sales. This is our high-vol coking coal. This coal from our Pittsburgh 8 seam mines in Northern Appalachia is selling in Asia and Brazil for prices much higher than what we could get by selling it into the domestic thermal market. So far for 2010, we have sold or committed 2.1 million tons at an average price of $73. The thermal business has improved since last October also. The colder than normal winter enabled generators to reduce stockpiles from the record levels of early December. 
Our thermal business has also benefited from our selling of the high-vol coal to Brazil and Asia. Since it's the same coal that we sell to domestic thermal customers, moving tons overseas has the added benefit of tightening up the domestic market. Now that we're into the shoulder season, thermal demand has weakened a bit. Inventories are still higher than we care to see, somewhere around 55 to 60 days.
On the GAAP side, spot prices have weakened considerably. At year end, they were around $6 per Mcf. Today, they are at $4.25. In our first quarter results for gas, however, we had a very good average sales price of $7.24 per Mcf, because of our strong hedge position. With our strong hedge position for 2010 and our low-cost structure, we expect to outperform our gas peers this year. In summary, both our low-vol business and high-vol business are doing very well. The thermal coal business has improved considerably, and the gas business is outperforming its peers.
This quarter results show, once again, the value to shareholders in owning shares in a diversified energy company that has best-in-class assets in four separate categories: world class low-vol assets at Buchanan; high-vol assets in the Pittsburgh seam that didn't exist six months ago and that we shipped out of our 100% owned Baltimore terminal; the highest Btu thermal assets in the country; and our gas company's leading position, and possibly the world's largest gas formation, the Marcellus Shale. These collection of assets can't be duplicated by a portfolio manager cobbling together pure play. You can only invest in excessive class assets by buying CONSOL Energy shares. 
The numbers speak for themselves. CONSOL Energy has established itself as a company that generate strong earnings and cash flows by utilizing a sustainable model that provides financial flexibility. This flexibility enables us to react and to adapt to changing economic environments and markets, while continuing to prudently invest in our businesses. This quarter, again, demonstrated the financial power of being a low-cost diversified energy company. 
We remain steadfast that our confidence in our business model, our balance sheet and our status as a safe low-cost producer enables us to effectively compete and produce exceptional earnings and cash flows, even in uncertain economic times. CONSOL Energy controls the greatest concentration of Btus in the Eastern United States. For almost 15 decades now and through many business cycles, CONSOL Energy has remain committed to optimizing shareholder value by putting safety first, by being respectful to the environment and the communities in which we operate and by providing meaningful employment opportunities. We remain committed to these values. With that, Brett, can we have your comments for the quarter?"

Thank you all for spending time with us to listen to us and also give us the opportunity to answer your questions. Our format's changed a little bit on our press release. There's a lot of information there. I think it's very straightforward",1259,"Thanks, Bill. Thank you all for spending time with us to listen to us and also give us the opportunity to answer your questions. Our format's changed a little bit on our press release. There's a lot of information there. I think it's very straightforward information, and some of my comments are there. So I'll make mine brief, and we'll get to the questions as soon as possible. But first, I'd like to talk about some strategic things, as well as forward-looking things. 
First, let me say, as a fourth generation coal miner myself, we grieve for the 29 lost lives in West Virginia, and those are tough things for the entire industry. I can tell you, though, that CONSOL Energy has an unwavering commitment to zero accidents, and we believe that we are in the generation that can bring these mines to zero accidents. And our intention is to steadfastly do that until we're zero everywhere in our corporation. Progress is being made inside CONSOL. And anytime we have an accident of any kind, it is an exception to our beliefs and our values, and we operate that way. And our shareholders need to be aware of that.
Let me move into the Coal business. The met coal marketplace itself. We see it as being very robust. Our expectation for the year has been exceeded on pricing. We've done some good deals on the pricing side. But let me talk about our China sales. Our relationship with Xcoal has been a good one. I can tell you, in 2010, that 90% of all the met coal coming out of North America into China's steel mills will come directly from CONSOL and Xcoal. That should give you focus on who's moving the coal into that country, into that great expanding market, and who has the legs up to do that. With our relationship with Xcoal, we've been able to do that, and I'm very proud of our marketing people and our ability to get that done. 
We see that as a growing market. We believe we'll hit 3 million tons of that high-vol coal into China this year. And we believe it's going to grow into next year. Now we don't have firm numbers on what next year looks like, but we're optimistic it will grow from 3 million. And that gives us the concept of continuing to push the BMX mine, because of its high-quality value and its low-cost structure that it will have on the high-vol met coal side, as well as expansion on the Baltimore port when we see that, that expansion is necessary for the use of our relationship and our shareholders. I expect the margin to be good enough to where we could approve the expansion of the Baltimore facilities in 2011. 
With this change in high-vol met and low-vol met, for 2010, we believe we'll be either the number one or number two met producer in all of North America. That is a strong function of our asset base and a test to the value of this company across the board. Now let's talk about the steam coal side.
The steam coal side is not getting the legs as quickly as we thought it might. I think the demand for power is down a little bit, but you can see their margins are robust and powerful. And as we see the demand for power in the U.S. come back, we believe that the supply will be short on the rebound, which will force upward pricing movement on all steam coal in the United States, especially for domestic power. We think things will tighten dramatically on the environmental side, as well as safety constraints related to the accident in West Virginia. And I can tell you that on the steam side, we are sold out at very high margins for 2010. We have no coal available in the Pittsburgh 8 seam for the steam market in 2010, beyond what's always been signed up. 
Let's talk about gas. Great acquisition that we made, we're very excited about that. But I'm going to talk about what we're doing in CNX Gas first. The CBM site continues to be the low-cost producer, with expansion very rapidly on our Virginia properties and add real value to our shareholders across-the-board. That has been a great success. That's where we started in the gas business, and we see great success going forward there as the low-cost producer in any gas marketplace.
Now let's to move to our Marcellus Shale piece. Now we already have that within our estate as we move from CBM into Marcellus Shale. We saw the value there. We continue to see huge value there. We're having great success on those wells, as you can see in the documentation that we put out. It puts us in a position of the low-cost producer in both CBM and Marcellus Shale. In any marketplace, we're going to be the highest margins, just like we are at coal. And that brought us to the acquisition. When we saw the acquisition of Marcellus Shale to be available, we moved forward with a strong balance sheet, tied up very valuable resources in our backyard. There's been some chatter about CONSOL going more into gas business and walking away from coal. I can tell you, from the earnings that we just announced, why would we walk away from the best assets in the country? What we've done is enhanced our position in our backyard for our shareholders, and that will create huge value over time. 
Let's talk about the acquisition a little bit more directly. That the big acquisition, and it has a lot of value, we are putting together plans to optimize what we see for the next 10 years for expansion in that Marcellus Shale. And what we intend to do is take the net present value of the value of that deal and move it forward for our shareholders with innovation and development of the resources, however that looks. We're very flexible, and we intend to do that and monetize the value of that as quickly as we can into the pockets of our shareholders. 
We are in a low-cost, high-margin position across gas, Marcellus, as well as CBM. On the Met business, we're on the low-cost, high-margin position. In the Steam business, we're in the low-cost, high-margin position. And we have flexibility on everyone of these assets, with great transportation, assets, as well as skills and management to get the job done.
Let's talk about earnings a little bit. We did not have to rebound from a recession because we had a record year last year, driven by the Coal business. If you go back to 2008, our strong year was driven by gas. If you go to 2009, our strong year was driven by coal. If you look at 2010, our strong year is being driven by coal and coal margins. We believe from 2011 and on, that our strong low-cost position of coal and gas, will drive on these two different cycles, real value to our shareholders in an exponential way from where we've been in the past. 
We're very excited about our ability to operate these two very valuable resources in our backyard. And when we call our backyard, we're talking about Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and this region right here. This is the energy of the Eastern United States, and we own the biggest, low-cost percentage of that. With that, I'd like to answer questions."

So I think on the permitting side, we're a little more concerned about, because the EPA has been very tight with their permitting in the Central App. And I think they're looking at state by state, with new interpretations and laws that we have to adjust to. So that's unfolding right now. We can't give you specifics. But what I can tell you is, when the economy rebounds dramatically and we think it will, the supply was short going in to the recession, and those supply will be tighter coming out.

And when you look at the major areas of where we have the 750,000 acres, right now, obviously we've drilled 17 and put into sales 17 horizontal wells in the Green County area. That's going to continue to be an area of focus for drilling. And we will be drilling wells, horizontal wells in the upshore Barbara County areas and Northern West Virginia late this year. And we'll be drilling wells in sort of the Westmorland County, Indiana County corridor as well by the end of 2010 into 2011. What we see with regard to those two areas, that's the Northern West Virginia and Indiana Westmorland County areas, is excited. These were the acres we've picked up from the Dominion acquisition. And we started at looking at well logs, vertical wells that were drilled by Dominion prior to the acquisition, and horizontal wells drilled by third parties in both of those areas.

I think there is an upside potential with regard to what we've been assuming for recoverable reserve, for the 17 that we've drilled to date and put into line. I also think that when you look at future wells that we're going to be drilling, 3,500 foot plus laterals, along with 10 plus frac stages for horizontal wells are going to be the norm. And that will have a more than proportional increase in EUR and production curve NPV, as opposed to capital cost. So from our perspective, we're starting from a pretty conservative base on reserve.

I don't believe until we see more gas plants built and the utilities or somebody making the commitment to build these gas plants. I do believe, that will happen in the next couple of years. But right now, with the demand for energy down, overall, compared to where the market was a couple of years ago, there's capacity in coal and gas to the point where all markets were being fed on existing plants. And so the max we're going to see, I think, is about 25 to 30 million tons a year, until we see new gas plants built. But I think, new gas plants will be built before new coal plants."

The second quarter 2010 continued our string of financially strong and operationally significant quarters, combined with",1295,"Thank you, Dan, and thank you, everyone for joining us this morning for CONSOL Energy's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. The second quarter 2010 continued our string of financially strong and operationally significant quarters, combined with meaningful asset expansion and development. 
On the financial side, we had record quarterly revenue of $1.3 billion, which is up 20% from the second quarter of 2009. This growth was driven by over $1 billion of revenue from the Coal Division. For the six months ended June 30, 2010, our revenue was $2.5 billion, up 10% from the six months ended June 30, 2009. Revenue growth is critical, as it provides us the capability to more rapidly expand and develop our large asset position. 
Through the  quarter ended June 30, 2010, adjusted EBITDA was $350 million or 18% higher than the adjusted EBITDA of the second quarter of 2009. Net cash flow from operations for the second quarter 2010 was $332 million, up 5% from the second quarter of 2009. Net cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2010, was $506 million. 
If you referenced the net operating cash flows for the full year of 2009 of $945 million and for the full year of 2008 of $1.03 billion, you can see that we are well on our way to matching the strong cash flows of the past two years. Substantial and consistent cash flows from operations are critical to our success by providing the financial flexibility to invest in our key projects or to adjust to unforeseen economic circumstances.
Our operating units in both the Coal and Gas divisions are working in accordance to what's planned [ph] are without major incidents. The safety of our employees and contractors, the stewardship to the environment in which we operate and responsible citizenship in the communities in which we work and live continue to be the benchmarks by which we judge ourselves. 
One item of significant operational note is the quarterly production record of 31.9 Bcf obtained by our gas division. This was 42% higher than the 22.5 Bcf achieved in the second quarter of 2009. This record was achieved from the addition of the Dominion E&P [Dominion Appalachian E&P] business on April 30, 2010, and our ongoing drilling program in the coal bed methane in Marcellus Shale operations. Now even without the Dominion acquisition, we would have still achieved a production record for the quarter. 
We have seen outstanding results in the last five Marcellus Shale wells, including three wells brought online in the second quarter. The estimated ultimate recoveries of these wells range from 5.5 Bcf to 9.9 Bcf. These estimated ultimate recoveries, though still preliminary, are far higher than the standard type curve that we have previously seen. 
The second quarter of 2010 also saw the completion of a substantial expansion of our Gas division. On April 30, 2010, CONSOL Energy closed on the $3.5 billion Dominion acquisition. The acquired assets exclude 1 trillion cubic feet of proved reserves and 500,000 acres of Marcellus Shale. Nearly all the Marcellus Shale acreage acquired is held by production. Such acreage has no drilling commitments, thus allowing capital to be allocated on the basis of economics, not simply to hold expiring leases. The majority of acquired acreage has a 12.5% royalty, except for about 20,000 acres held in fee, thus having no royalty. Most of the Marcellus Shale acres are in Central and Southwestern Pennsylvania and Northern West Virginia. 
On May 28 of 2010, CONSOL Energy completed a tender offer for all the shares that the CNX Gas common stock that we did not previously own at a cash price of $38.25 per share. CONSOL Energy paid $991 million to acquire 25.3 million shares of CNX Gas common stock and outstanding vested options. CONSOL Energy completed an equity offering on March 31 of 2010, of 44.3 million shares of common stock, which generated net proceeds of approximately $1.8 billion. And on April 1 of 2010, CONSOL Energy issued $1.5 billion of 8% senior secured notes that are due in 2017 and $1.25 billion of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due in 2020.
Let's now turn to the markets where we see many positives. Given the continued projected growth in the Chinese economy, the shortage of high-quality metallurgical coal and the relatively low steel inventories, we anticipate that metallurgical coal markets will continue to provide strong, long-term pricing similar to what we have seen in the first half of 2010. The thermal coal outlook continues to improve due to the unseasonably hot weather in the eastern United States, the decline in inventories and increasing industrial activity. Also, inventories at utilities in our major market areas, which is the Mid-Atlantic and the South Atlantic markets, are lower than in other regions of the United States with inventories at some plants below 30 days of burn as of the end of June. The thermal coal market in Northern Appalachia is also being strengthened by CONSOL Energy's exporting of coal from its Northern Appalachian mines to Asia and South America as high-vol coking coal, and in Europe as thermal coal. Longer term, exports of thermal coal look increasingly more favorable. This is driven by economic growth in developing countries like China and India and shifting of traditional supply to meet these growth demands. Regulatory pressures in Central Appalachia continue to reduce coal supplies as permits become increasingly more difficult to obtain and cost increase. CONSOL Energy estimates that annual production from Central Appalachia will decline another 40 million tons by 2015. The issues in Central Appalachia, combined with the general economic recovery, are expected to increase coal sales opportunities and expand market share of CONSOL Energy in both the short and long term. CONSOL Energy's low cost Northern Appalachian mining operations are well positioned to replace production declines in Central Appalachia. 
We believe that coal will continue to provide the baseload of the nation's energy needs through our efforts during the last 10 years to improve operating efficiencies at our major coal production sites. We believe we are well positioned to continue to provide our customers with a stable, long-term supply of high-quality coal that will generate substantial returns to our shareholders.
On the gas side, CONSOL Energy's position on the Marcellus Shale will allow us to be profitable in the current pricing environment due to the basis premium for being close to important northeast markets and our position as a low-cost producer within the Marcellus play. 
In summary, both our Low-Vol business and our High-Vol business are doing very well. The Thermal Coal business has improved considerably and the Gas business is expanding and outperforming its peers. This quarter's results show once again the value of owning shares in a diversified energy company that has best-in-class assets in four separate categories. We're talking about world-class low-vol assets at Buchanan, high-vol assets in the Pittsburgh 8 seam that is shipped out of our 100%-owned Baltimore terminal, the highest Btu thermal assets in the country and our Gas division's leading position and possibly the world's largest gas formation, the Marcellus Shale. CONSOL Energy controls the greatest concentration of energy in the eastern United States. 
CONSOL Energy has established itself as a company that generates strong earnings and cash flows by utilizing a sustainable model that provides financial flexibility. This flexibility enables us to react and adapt to changing economic environments and markets while continuing to prudently invest in our businesses. This quarter again demonstrated the financial power of being a low-cost, diversified energy company. We remain steadfast in our confidence in our business model. Our balance sheet and our status as a safe low cost producer enable us to effectively compete and produce exceptional earnings and cash flows. 
Brett, your comments on the quarter."

Bill has given a lot of details here, but I'd like to look at some of the major issues and look forward with the shareholders today.First of all, I'd like to talk about safety. Because of all the issues around",1053,"Thank you, Bill, and welcome to everybody. Bill has given a lot of details here, but I'd like to look at some of the major issues and look forward with the shareholders today.
First of all, I'd like to talk about safety. Because of all the issues around safety and new laws being written in Congress or being contemplated, CONSOL has been very involved with Labor, as well as Congress to talk about the future safety, especially in underground mines and this is a critical issue to us. We take it very serious. We have influence on the new laws. We'll adapt to the new laws and we'll recommend to the government laws that makes the mines safe for individuals and eliminate risks for big problems as we've seen. We are committed to zero. Our people are committed to zero, not only on the coal side, but on the gas side as we see new technologies being developed in the Marcellus Shale. We look at our processes, we look at our techniques and we continue to be at zero from our gas company since 1994. We will continue to do that and our commitment is there, from the board level to the management level, all the way down to all the employees. Safety has no rank. Zero is a real number and we intend to drive the company towards that goal. We don't believe we're perfect, but we believe we can achieve a perfect place when it comes to the safety of individuals.
Let's talk about assets a little bit. Coal assets, 4.3 billion tons from the position in the Pittsburgh 8 seam, I think the most prolific and valuable seam of coal in North America. We're in a very low-cost position there, high-margin positions you see what we've put out. And that we are committed to the Coal business and we'll expand that Coal business as the markets develop going forward.
Let's talk about gas. Between CNX Gas acquisition all the way back in and the Dominion acquisition, we have a very powerful division, tight [ph] CONSOL of 2.9 trillion cubic feet of gas that is proven, with a lot more to prove out. Huge opportunities as Bill talked about that these opportunities do not have a timeframe on them. We will drill them and do it according to the value that we see in the marketplace on the timeframe that's good for our shareholders. Very high margin position, low-cost position there and I think what's interesting in any gas market that we've seen in the last 10 years, this division has value and has margins that is substantial to keep adding volume there. 
Two great assets that we plan to develop. One is the BMX Mine, I believe would be the lowest cost mine in the Pittsburgh 8 seam and one of the highest quality mines in the Pittsburgh 8 seam that would be sold as high-vol met coal into the international markets or in the domestic markets. Clearly, we made the acquisition on the Marcellus Shale from Dominion and to all the other assets they had on the E&P side because we saw the value and that value will be developed for our shareholders going forward. There's 750,000 acres of Marcellus Shale we will prove out to show that, that was a very good acquisition. And by the end of the year, and we'll have 30 wells in that to prove that and you can see the results as we announce. They're better than we thought it was going to be and we think that will just continue to be a great story for our shareholders. 
So growth in gas and coal are real to us. We have the financial strength to internally do this. Between our balance sheet and our borrowing capabilities to expand these values for our shareholder going forward. We are focused on creating shareholder value. We will develop low-cost assets in both coal and gas. We are investigating, monetizing non-core assets in coal and gas that are beyond our 10- to 15-year plan. We are serious about that. We intend to bring net present value to our shareholders in a proper way so as reflects in the share price. 
We continue to expand coal market segments in Asia, South America, Europe and both high-vol met coal, low-vol met coal and steam coal; and as you see, at the highest margins, I think in the industry. 
The acquisition of the Dominion E&P business in Appalachia has given us the opportunity to double our earnings capability on the same geologic, geographic, political and possible fuel footprint that we've been operating on since 1864. 70% of electricity fuel comes from these two products in the most energy intense part of the world. We believe we have the best position in both of those. We did not have to leave our backyard to add more value for our shareholders, and we believe that we can double our earnings capability by the end of 2012 by the acquisition of this Dominion assets. 
We are solidly in a very solid position market-wise on our met contracts for the year. We think they're great opportunities for next year. We will meet whatever the world price is on the met side and have the highest margin based on our low-cost position. Rising steam prices that we see now, based on a heavy burn in the winter and now a heavy burn in the summer, we see real value being created for the end of 2010 and 2011, as we negotiate steam prices in our major domestic markets. And we see real opportunity to continue to move coal into Asia based on the high-vol marketing that we've done recently. 
What we're seeing in the marketplace right now is the drag is in on the industrial load side of the utilities. The utilities are telling us that industrial load was off year-to-year 12% to 15%. It's a gain of about 1% per month, back on the industrial load. So there is a rebound in the economy and we think that not only strengthens steam coal prices, but will eventually strengthen gas prices as well. 
So having said that, I'd like to open it up and see what's on the mind of everybody and answer the question."

I think going forward, there will be some regulatory issues and that cost hasn't been decided put into our model yet as we see what the new laws so forth are. Keep in mind, Northern App coal is the lowest cost position in all of Appalachia coal. Central App tends to be a higher cost because I think there's a movement towards underground mining, a surge of underground mining based on lack of permits on surface mining. So you're going to see those costs rise. As it relates directly to CONSOL, I believe that we probably will stay in a position we're in, in Central App and expand our low-cost position in Northern App because it's much higher margin position for us and has better economics. We're not seeing a lot of pressure right now on commodities. Labor seems to be pretty stable, and I think if you look at the second quarter itself is more volume issue. As I've always said on these calls, CONSOL is very lumpy in terms of cost structure quarter-to-quarter. But over the year, we're very close to what we predicted and I think we'll be that way this year."

But we will prove that out and we'll have a rig in there by the end of the month. So we're optimistic about that piece of it. In terms of the overall, we have a big footprint in gas, we have a lot of opportunity. There were other opportunities even beyond the Marcellus shale, in the E&P side of what we bought from Dominion and we also have the Huron Shale and the Chattanooga piece down south. We're seeing real opportunities in all of those. And what we look at as we put our 10- to 15-year plan together, clearly that is not what we would consider core value to us based on transportation and how it's located within the rest of the acreage that we have. We will find some way to monetize that and then we'll monetize that to the benefit of the present value to our shareholders, which will reflect in share price. That is all in operation. We're talking to people. We have a good plan in place and I'm very optimistic that this value is going to come back to our shareholders quicker than what we originally thought."

We believe that there's going to be a big supply of gas coming out of the Marcellus Shale. We also believe it's going to take billions of dollars to develop it. We believe that the price of gas is more related to the industrial load in the United States right now than it is to supply. Say for instance, if our economy got hot in the next 18 months, we believe gas prices would rise pretty fast just based on supply. So a lot of talk you hear about -- people believe that Marcellus Shale is already capitalized. It's just beginning. And so it will take years to develop it out and you'll see a shift in supply in gas, but what you're going to do is see companies like CONSOL have the lowest cost position in any given market. In the meantime, we'll either deploy our money to the Marcellus Shale or will deploy it to the BMX project or both depending on where we see that these markets. So I wouldn't -- I remember in 2001 and 2004 where the prediction of $2 gas to $3 gas and then there was $4 gas to $5 gas, and every time that market spiked right behind that. So a lot of this chatter I think's premature because the gas supply is not that robust at this point in time. The demand is down, but the supply hasn't changed that much."

And remember, both of these components the same issue applies. 95 plus percentage breadths that is held by production. So the treadmill, so to speak,, that many in the base that are on with regard to drilling commitments, that does not apply to us. And that's critically important because, a, it buys us timing and, b, it creates optionality for any potential buyer our JV partner that would want to come in. They know that they'll be able to drill at higher rates when gas prices are high and they'll be able to stop or throttle back when gas prices are low. If you have drilling commitments, you can't do that. You got to drill to hold the leases. So with that being said, you look at the 750,000 acres, it's two broad groups. One group are the acres, as Brett said, that we'll get to in the next 10 to 15 years, throw in development plan. It's built in, we got the operating cash flow to get to that. And frankly, that math becomes pretty simple with regard to a JV or they're willing to pay more than we think we can do with it on our own development plan. The second group are the acres we're not going to get to.

The third quarter 2010 continued our string of financially strong and operationally significant quarters. Revenues co",1449,"Thank you, Brandon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning for CONSOL Energy's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. The third quarter 2010 continued our string of financially strong and operationally significant quarters. Revenues continued at a record pace with third quarter revenues of $1.3 billion, which is up 23% from the third quarter of 2009. This growth was driven by over $1 billion of revenue from our Coal division, which was up 22% from the third quarter of 2009. For the nine months ended September 30, our total revenue was up $3.8 billion, up 15% from the nine months ended September 30 of 2009. Now revenue growth is critical as it provides us the capability to expand and develop our large asset position.
Net income was $75 million or $0.33 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2010. This compares with $87 million or $0.48 per diluted share in the 2009 quarter. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was up $347 million or 45% higher than the adjusted EBITDA of the third quarter of 2009. 
We are pleased with the third quarter operating results. On the Coal side, the third quarter is usually the most challenging financial quarter for us because of normal vacation shutdowns. In addition, these vacation periods provide us with the opportunity to do a wide range of maintenance while the mines are not in operation. These conditions normally result in lower production and higher operating costs in the third quarter.
The Coal segment produced a total of 14.7 million tons in the third quarter of 2010 compared with 13.5 million tons in the third quarter of 2009. The quarterly production, combined with a reduction of steam coal inventories, resulted in 15.6 million tons of sales in this quarter compared to 13.7 million tons in the 2009 quarter. Coal inventories were 2.2 million tons at September 30, of 2010, and we currently plan to reduce Coal inventories by another 500,000 tons before the end of this year.
On a GAAP side of the business, the quarterly production record of 35.8 Bcf was attained. This was 44% higher than the 24.8 Bcf achieved in the third quarter of 2009. The record was achieved due to the addition of the Dominion E&P business, which occurred on April 30 of 2010, as well as the ongoing drilling program in our coalbed methane in Marcellus Shale operations. Our production record was also been achieved in the third quarter without the Dominion E&P business.
Now the Dominion E&P business, this acquisition has changed the mix of our production makeup. Historically, CNX Gas production has been about approximately 90% coalbed methane, with the acquisition of approximately 65% of our production is now Coalbed Methane. So just to summarize that, in 2009, 90% was coalbed methane, about 10% was Marcellus Shale. In 2010, coalbed methane will be about 65%, Marcellus remains 10% and now conventional gas is 25%.
Now this conventional gas is higher cost operations, and this filtered in into the increased cost we had on the Gas side. Now the Gas segment operating cost were $4.08 per Mcf in the third quarter of 2010 and this was compared to $3.44 per Mcf for 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to the 40% per Mcf higher depreciation, depletion and amortization cost, $0.14 per Mcf higher lifting costs and $0.07 per Mcf higher severance cost in a period-to-period comparison.
Now the increase in DD&A was primarily due to the acquisition of the Dominion E&P business, which was primarily reflected in conventional gas. Now higher lifting costs were due to higher well tending cost, and again, primarily due to the acquisition of the older Dominion conventional wells having a higher cost structure than our historical results. And finally, the higher severance cost result of higher average realization. And again, this is done before the impact of the hedging program. So you can see that overall, our coalbed methane cost really haven't changed much, but the increase in cost is attributable to the increase in our conventional Gas business.
Now there were two financial accruals that were made in the third quarter that are worthy to mention. First is Fola reclamation. At our Fola operations, we accrued $28 million related to future reclamation work at that complex. This charge is the result of the final phase of a comprehensive engineering view of the reclamation plan that we started in the first quarter of this year. The charge is the result of changing market conditions, permitting issues, new regulatory requirements and the resulting change in mining plans. Mining in some areas is anticipated to be curtailed early than originally anticipated. And in some cases, the quantity of material required to reclaim the operation in its present state has increased.
The second item is in Mine 84. Mine 84, we took a $14 million non-cash charge that was related to the abandonment of a portion of the previously-developed area of the mine. A change in the mine conditions resulted in an area of the mine being sealed with no future plans to re-enter that area. Charges previously capitalized were expensed to reflect this change.
Our operating units in both the Coal and Gas divisions are working in accordance with plans. The safety of our employees and contractors, the stewardship of the environment in which we operate and responsible citizenship in the communities in which we work and live continue to be the benchmarks by which we judge ourselves.
Net cash flows from operations for the third quarter of 2010 were $373 million, that's up 130% from the third quarter of 2009. Net cash flows from operations for the nine months of 2010 were $879 million. Now if you reference the net operating cash flows for the full year of 2009 at $945 million and for the full year of 2008 at $1.03 billion, you can see that we are well on our way to matching or exceeding the strong cash flows of the past two years. Substantial and consistent cash flows from operations are critical to our success and provide the financial flexibility to invest in key projects or to adjust to unforeseen economic circumstances.
Our financial flexibility was also strengthened in the third quarter by the successful refinancing of $103 million of the industrial development bond  associated with our wholly-owned terminal in Baltimore, Maryland. The new bonds mature in September 2025 and carrying an interest rate of 5.75%. The previous bonds were to mature on December 10 and October 2011, and carried an interest rate of 6.5%. Our $1.5 billion credit facility we have on the CONSOL Energy side, $136 million of outstanding borrowings and $268 million of outstanding letters of credit, leaving approximately $1.1 billion of capacity at September 30 of 2010. CNX Gas has $700 million credit facility, had $78 million of outstanding borrowings and $15 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving approximately $607 million of capacity at September 30, 2010. We have no debt due until March of 2012, and that's $250 million.
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $244 million compared to a prior year third quarter of $193 million. For the year-to-date period, capital expenditures were $822 million compared to $689 million. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were about 55% attributable to the Coal segment and 45% attributable to the Gas segment. We continue to spend capital within our cash flows that we've generated from operations.
We continue to invest in high-return projects in both the Coal and Gas segments of our business, while remaining disciplined to maintain financial flexibility, with strong operating cash flow generation and available credit capacity to adjust to changes in the marketplace or to these unforeseen economic circumstances.
In summary, both our low-vol business and our high-vol business are doing are doing very well. The Thermal coal business has improved considerably. And overall, the Gas business is expanding and continues to grow production volumes. This quarter results showed again the value of a diversified energy company that has best-in-class assets in four separate categories. This a low-vol assets at the  Cana [ph] (0:29:21), the high-vol assets in the Pittsburgh scene that can be shipped out of our wholly-owned Baltimore Terminal and the highest Btu thermal assets in the country and our Gas division's leading position and possibly the world's largest gas formation, which is the Marcellus Shale.
CONSOL Energy controls the greatest concentration of energy in the Eastern United States. We remain steadfast and confident in our business model. Our balance sheet and our status as a safe, low-cost producer enables us to effectively compete and produce exceptional earnings and cash flows. 
With that, Brent, your comments on the quarter."

From my perspective, to all of you, it's always good to talk about the quarter and give you my views on where we're at. First, I'd like to talk about safety. We're still improving towards zero. Like I said on the last call,",1192,"Thank you, Bill, and welcome. From my perspective, to all of you, it's always good to talk about the quarter and give you my views on where we're at. 
First, I'd like to talk about safety. We're still improving towards zero. Like I said on the last call, we're not perfect, but we would like to achieve perfect in terms of being at zero. Our Gas division has been at zero for many, many years and continues to be there. We're very proud of that, and that's excellent performance. Our River operations in our port facilities are at zero and have been there for a long time. We're working hard to get our underground mines at zero and we will continue to do that. We've made great strides this year towards that, and we will continue to make that our number one priority.
One thing I want the shareholders to be aware of, many of the things we do, we do to get to zero beyond the law self. Many actions that we take are things that are done as we assess the risk of the mines, we do it for the good of our employees on the road to zero. Sometimes, a lot catches up with us and it becomes part of law, and sometimes we accelerate beyond the law with the goal of protecting our people. We will always do that and continue to do it going forward.
Let's talk about the economy a little bit. The U.S. economy is growing, 2.5% to 2.8% this year, we believe. We think that's sluggish. We're concerned about the lows on the gas side as well as the electricity side. But that doesn't reflect in the coal price, and I'll talk about that in a little bit. When you look at the world marketplace, we think China is at 10% growth this year. And we think they're going to be at 8.5% to 9% next year. And that really adds a lot of value to our port facilities and our ability to move coal offshore into a growing world that is very hungry for the Btus that we create, especially being a low-cost producer with facilities that can move coal around the world.
Let me talk a little bit about our assets. One thing that I don't talk a lot about is our land assets, which really are the base of CONSOL Energy. We have 500,000 private acres, which gives us access to 2.5 million to 3 million acres just on the coal footprint, and now on the gas footprint is very much similar. Our coal position is very valuable, as everybody knows. But what I always want to drive is the fee position, 70% of what we own on the coal side is in fee, and that is owned by our shareholders. It is not being rented, so to speak, from the federal government, and that is an asset that we will always have and our shareholders will benefit from that.
We are the low-cost producer of high-vol, low-vol of steam coal in the highest valued region of the United States. That is a great position. We will continue enhance that over time. That is our legacy, and we're committed to that.
We're also the low-cost producer on the Gas side. As we develop the Marcellus Shale -- now keep in mind, the Marcellus Shale is an infant in terms of supply to the region and to the nation. But it has a very high potential. That's why we made the purchase that we did. That potential is right underneath our feet, underneath our coal seams and right in our backyard of this huge footprint of acreage that we have. That's the value of the deal. Now that is a long-term deal. And as I talk about gas prices going forward, you'll understand that this is going to create huge value for our shareholders going forward as gas prices fluctuate between where the low price they are today to the high prices that we see in the future, based on demand by the utilities. We are following our customers. Our customers are going to build gas plants. We will supply them, and that will be the mantra of this company on the gas side going forward.
Now let's talk about the quarter a little bit. Third quarter is always a tough quarter for us. It's a vacation quarter. We do a lot of projects. Our costs rise. Our tonnage is typically done and reflects that in the numbers that you see. But as I talked to you last quarter, I said that would probably happen. When you look at the year though, you can see we're going to be at a higher tonnage for the fourth quarter. If you look at last year in total, our average cost across the board were about $44. And I think by the end of this year, we should be around $47 in total across the board. And that's including absorbing the higher royalties on the met coal coming out of the Cana.  The cost structure for Cana rose dramatically based on royalties more than anything else. We're okay with that, because we have expanding margins to go with that. But it does affect the overall average cost and gives a reflection, I think, to our shareholders that the cost are rising more rapidly than they really are in terms of real cost at the mines.
Let's talk about gas. We have a great opportunity here in the Marcellus Shale, as well as everything as we bought from Dominion. Gas prices are low. We see our competitors under huge amounts of strain. They're in position where they're going to lose leases if they don't drill. Most of everything we have, in fact, over 95% of what we have is held by production. We don't have to drill it. And we won't drill it in today's world of gas prices for growth. We will drill it to delineate the value of what we have, and then we will assess what we have and add capital based on the value to our shareholders going forward as we see gas prices rise, which we believe they will. Keep in mind, the demand for gas on the generation side is going to exponentially move and we'll be ready for that. We think that will drive price and drive value, especially as we see the pushback on coal from the EPA and others, especially in this region.
So having said that, I think we're well set up. Our Gas business will show discipline on that side. And we'll also grow the Coal side based on where we see the markets. I'm very enthused about the world market for coal. I feel strongly enthused about even the steam markets. In a poor economy of the United States, the steam markets tend to be very strong. We think that the real strength of the economy rebounds, and we think we'll have real possibility and strength to expand our margins there going forward. 
And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions."

One is on the thermal side, which is a big part of our business, there is pressure on productivity based on the compliance to the law and everything else that we're seeing. So some of our tonnage, I think we're hedging ourselves a little bit, and we'll have a drop in productivity next year and we'll feel that in terms of tons. We also have taken the Emery Mine out of the equation year-to-year, which is about 1.1 to 1.2 million tons a year. So when you put all that together, you'll see us being a little bit cautious. We think on the Steam side, on our sales it's going to be a very solid year and we think very solid prices. But we're not going to produce more that needs to be produced. And I think that's where we see it right now. On the Met side, Cana coal is the strength of our Met side, and we see it is going to get demand very high prices, and it will be the highest met product we have. And we see continuing demand in Asia, and we believe we could go anywhere from 3 million tons a year on the high-vol side coming out of the Bailey-type operations, up to 5 or 6 million tons a year, depending what the demand is. So we're not negative year-to-year. We think we'll do as well next year as we did this year on the high-vol Met side, and we think the demand for this could rise. But we're not ready to say that yet till we have it in our hand."

We had a margins of $104 a ton, and that was driven by a 70% increase in realization. I know people have focused on the cost and said that Cana would increase their cost by $11 a ton. But over half of that is related to royalties and production tax because the increase in realization.

The Marcellus, from our perspective, across wide varying regions and even within a subregion such as Greene County, Pennsylvania, our experience to date has been that the geologies. We tend to look at Marcellus as a single uniform play. The geology does vary, even within a region like Greene County, Pennsylvania. And that sort of manifested itself with regard to the results that you saw that we recorded today. We've got certain areas in Greene County, Pennsylvania as an example where there are relatively slow initial production rate compared to what we've seen historically, but relatively zero decline, again, for an early period of time, say, 60 to 90 days. We've got other areas within Greene County with relatively higher initial production rates but also higher decline curves. And I think the answer to this goes back once again to geology. As time unfolds, we'll get a better feel for which one of those two well profiles gives us a higher EUR. In other words if that remains at zero decline for a significant period of time, at some point, the high IP rate, high decline well passes under that production level that could have an impact with regard to which type of sub-area has a higher EUR. So this is a great example of why this is still an opportunity across the entire industry. There's probably 5% of the way to fruition. There's an awful lot to learn. We learn something every single day we drill a well. And to think that the industry is 75% or 80% away there, just doesn't reflect where we're at across the board."

The third quarter 2010 continued our string of financially strong and operationally significant quarters. Revenues co",1452,"Thank you, Brandon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning for CONSOL Energy's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. The third quarter 2010 continued our string of financially strong and operationally significant quarters. Revenues continued at a record pace with third quarter revenues of $1.3 billion, which is up 23% from the third quarter of 2009. This growth was driven by over $1 billion of revenue from our Coal division, which was up 22% from the third quarter of 2009. For the nine months ended September 30, our total revenue was up $3.8 billion, up 15% from the nine months ended September 30 of 2009. Now revenue growth is critical as it provides us the capability to expand and develop our large asset position.
Net income was $75 million or $0.33 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2010. This compares with $87 million or $0.48 per diluted share in the 2009 quarter. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was up $347 million or 45% higher than the adjusted EBITDA of the third quarter of 2009. 
We are pleased with the third quarter operating results. On the Coal side, the third quarter is usually the most challenging financial quarter for us because of normal vacation shutdowns. In addition, these vacation periods provide us with the opportunity to do a wide range of maintenance while the mines are not in operation. These conditions normally result in lower production and higher operating costs in the third quarter.
The Coal segment produced a total of 14.7 million tons in the third quarter of 2010 compared with 13.5 million tons in the third quarter of 2009. The quarterly production, combined with a reduction of steam coal inventories, resulted in 15.6 million tons of sales in this quarter compared to 13.7 million tons in the 2009 quarter. Coal inventories were 2.2 million tons at September 30, of 2010, and we currently plan to reduce Coal inventories by another 500,000 tons before the end of this year.
On the GAAP side of the business, the quarterly production record of 35.8 Bcf was attained. This was 44% higher than the 24.8 Bcf achieved in the third quarter of 2009. The record was achieved due to the addition of the Dominion E&P business, which occurred on April 30 of 2010, as well as the ongoing drilling program in our coalbed methane in Marcellus Shale operations. Our production record would’ve also been achieved in the third quarter without the Dominion E&P business.
Now the Dominion E&P business, this acquisition has changed the mix of our production makeup. Historically, CNX Gas production has been about approximately 90% coalbed methane, with the acquisition of approximately 65% of our production is now coalbed methane. So just to summarize that, in 2009, 90% was coalbed methane, about 10% was Marcellus Shale. In 2010, coalbed methane will be about 65%, Marcellus remains 10% and now conventional gas is 25%.
Now this conventional gas is higher cost operations, and this filtered in into the increased cost we had on the Gas side. Now the Gas segment operating costs were $4.08 per Mcf for the third quarter of 2010 and this was compared to $3.44 per Mcf for 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to the $0.40 per Mcf higher depreciation, depletion and amortization cost, $0.14 per Mcf higher lifting costs and $0.07 per Mcf higher severance cost in a period-to-period comparison.
Now the increase in DD&A was primarily due to the acquisition of the Dominion E&P business, which was primarily reflected in conventional gas. Now higher lifting costs were due to higher well tending costs, again primarily due to the acquisition of the older Dominion conventional wells having a higher cost structure than our historical results. And finally, the higher severance costs were a result of higher average realization. And again, this is done before the impact of the hedging program. So you can see that overall, our coalbed methane costs really haven't changed much, but the increase in cost is attributable to the increase in our conventional Gas business.
Now there were two financial accruals that were made in the third quarter that are worthy to mention. First is Fola reclamation. At our Fola operations, we accrued $28 million related to future reclamation work at that complex. This charge is the result of the final phase of a comprehensive engineering view of the reclamation plan that we started in the first quarter of this year. The charge is the result of changing market conditions, permitting issues, new regulatory requirements and the resulting change in mining plans. Mining in some areas is anticipated to be curtailed early than originally anticipated. And in some cases, the quantity of material required to reclaim the operation in its present state has increased.
The second item is at Mine 84. Mine 84, we took a $14 million non-cash charge that was related to the abandonment of a portion of the previously developed area of the mine. A change in the mine conditions resulted in an area of the mine being sealed with no future plans to re-enter that area. Charges previously capitalized were expensed to reflect this change.
Our operating units in both the Coal and Gas divisions are working in accordance with plans. The safety of our employees and contractors, the stewardship of the environment in which we operate and responsible citizenship in the communities in which we work and live continue to be the benchmarks by which we judge ourselves.
Net cash flows from operations for the third quarter of 2010 were $373 million, that's up 130% from the third quarter of 2009. Net cash flows from operations for the nine months of 2010 were $879 million. Now if you reference the net operating cash flows for the full year of 2009 at $945 million and for the full year of 2008 at $1.03 billion, you can see that we are well on our way to matching or exceeding the strong cash flows of the past two years. Substantial and consistent cash flows from operations are critical to our success and provide the financial flexibility to invest in key projects or to adjust to unforeseen economic circumstances.
Our financial flexibility was also strengthened in the third quarter by the successful refinancing of $103 million of the industrial development bonds associated with our wholly-owned terminal in Baltimore, Maryland. The new bonds mature in September 2025 and carry an interest rate of 5.75%. The previous bonds were to mature on December 10 and October 2011, and carried an interest rate of 6.5%. Our $1.5 billion credit facility we have on the CONSOL Energy side has $136 million of outstanding borrowings and $268 million of outstanding letters of credit, leaving approximately $1.1 billion of capacity at September 30 of 2010. CNX Gas has $700 million credit facility, had $78 million of outstanding borrowings and $15 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving approximately $607 million of capacity at September 30, 2010. We have no debt due until March of 2012, and that's $250 million.
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $244 million compared to a prior year third quarter of $193 million. For the year-to-date period, capital expenditures were $822 million compared to $689 million. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were about 55% attributable to the Coal segment and 45% attributable to the Gas segment. We continue to spend capital within our cash flows that we've generated from operations.
We continue to invest in high return projects in both the Coal and Gas segments of our business, while remaining disciplined to maintain financial flexibility, with strong operating cash flow generation and available credit capacity to adjust to changes in the marketplace or to these unforeseen economic circumstances.
In summary, both our low-vol business and our high-vol business are doing are doing very well. The Thermal coal business has improved considerably. And overall, the Gas business is expanding and continues to grow production volumes. This quarter results showed again the value of a diversified energy company that has best-in-class assets in four separate categories. This a the low-vol assets at the  Buchanan, the high-vol assets in the Pittsburgh scene that can be shipped out of our wholly-owned Baltimore Terminal and the highest Btu thermal assets in the country, and our Gas division's leading position and possibly the world's largest gas formation, which is the Marcellus Shale.
CONSOL Energy controls the greatest concentration of energy in the Eastern United States. We remain steadfast and confident in our business model. Our balance sheet and our status as a safe, low-cost producer enables us to effectively compete and produce exceptional earnings and cash flows. 
With that, Brett, your comments on the quarter."

From my perspective, to all of you, it's always good to talk about the quarter and give you my views on where we're at. First, I'd like to talk about safety. We're still improving towards zero. Like I said on the last call,",1194,"Thank you, Bill, and welcome. From my perspective, to all of you, it's always good to talk about the quarter and give you my views on where we're at. 
First, I'd like to talk about safety. We're still improving towards zero. Like I said on the last call, we're not perfect, but we would like to achieve perfect in terms of being at zero. Our Gas division has been at zero for many, many years and continues to be there. We're very proud of that, and that's excellent performance. Our River operations in our port facilities are at zero and have been there for a long time. We're working hard to get our underground mines at zero and we will continue to do that. We've made great strides this year towards that, and we will continue to make that our number one priority.
One thing I want the shareholders to be aware of, many of the things we do, we do to get to zero to beyond the law itself. Many actions that we take are things that are done as we assess the risk of the mines, we do it for the good of our employees on the road to zero. Sometimes, a lot catches up with us and it becomes part of law, and sometimes we accelerate beyond the law with the goal of protecting our people. We will always do that and continue to do it going forward.
Let's talk about the economy a little bit. The U.S. economy is growing, 2.5% to 2.8% this year, we believe. We think that's sluggish. We're concerned about the lows on the gas side as well as the electricity side. But that doesn't reflect in the coal price, and I'll talk about that in a little bit. When you look at the world marketplace, we think China is at 10% growth this year. And we think they're going to be at 8.5% to 9% next year. And that really adds a lot of value to our port facilities and our ability to move coal offshore into a growing world that is very hungry for the Btus that we create, especially being a low-cost producer with facilities that can move coal around the world.
Let me talk a little bit about our assets. One thing that I don't talk a lot about is our land assets, which really are the base of CONSOL Energy. We have 500,000 private acres, which gives us access to 2.5 million to 3 million acres just on the coal footprint, and now on the gas footprint is very much similar. Our coal position is very valuable, as everybody knows. But what I always want to drive is the fee position, 70% of what we own on the coal side is in fee, and that is owned by our shareholders. It is not being rented, so to speak, from the federal government, and that is an asset that we will always have and our shareholders will benefit from that.
We are the low-cost producer of high-vol, low-vol of steam coal in the highest valued region of the United States. That is a great position. We will continue to enhance that over time. That is our legacy, and we're committed to that.
We're also the low-cost producer on the Gas side. As we develop the Marcellus Shale -- now keep in mind, the Marcellus Shale is an infant in terms of supply to the region and to the nation. But it has a very high potential. That's why we made the purchase that we did. That potential is right underneath our feet, underneath our coal seams and right in our backyard of this huge footprint of acreage that we have. That's the value of the deal. Now that is a long-term deal. And as I talk about gas prices going forward, you'll understand that this is going to create huge value for our shareholders going forward as gas prices fluctuate between where the low price they are today to the high prices that we see in the future, based on demand by the utilities. We are following our customers. Our customers are going to build gas plants. We will supply them, and that will be the mantra of this company on the gas side going forward.
Now let's talk about the quarter a little bit. Third quarter is always a tough quarter for us. It's a vacation quarter. We do a lot of projects. Our costs rise. Our tonnage is typically down and reflects that in the numbers that you see. But as I talked to you last quarter, I said that would probably happen. When you look at the year though, you can see we're going to be at a higher tonnage for the fourth quarter. If you look at last year in total, our average costs across the board were about $44. And I think by the end of this year, we should be around $47 in total across the board. And that's including absorbing the higher royalties on the met coal coming out of the Buchanan.  The cost structure for Buchanan rose dramatically based on royalties more than anything else. We're okay with that, because we have expanding margins to go with that. But it does affect the overall average cost and gives a reflection, I think, to our shareholders that the costs are rising more rapidly than they really are in terms of real costs at the mines.
Let's talk about gas. We have a great opportunity here in the Marcellus Shale, as well as everything as we bought from Dominion. Gas prices are low. We see our competitors under huge amounts of strain. They're in position where they're going to lose leases if they don't drill. Most of everything we have, in fact, over 95% of what we have is held by production. We don't have to drill it. And we won't drill it in today's world of gas prices for growth. We will drill it to delineate the value of what we have, and then we will assess what we have and add capital based on the value to our shareholders going forward as we see gas prices rise, which we believe they will. Keep in mind, the demand for gas on the generation side is going to exponentially move and we'll be ready for that. We think that will drive price and drive value, especially as we see the pushback on coal from the EPA and others, especially in this region.
So having said that, I think we're well set up. Our Gas business will show discipline on that side. And we'll also grow the Coal side based on where we see the markets. I'm very enthused about the world market for coal. I feel strongly enthused about even the steam markets. In a poor economy of the United States, the steam markets tend to be very strong. We think that the real strength if the economy rebounds, and we think we'll have real possibility and strength to expand our margins there going forward. 
And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions."

One is on the thermal side, which is a big part of our business, there is pressure on productivity based on the compliance to the law and everything else that we're seeing. So some of our tonnage, I think we're hedging ourselves a little bit, and we'll have a drop in productivity next year and we'll feel that in terms of tons. We also have taken the Emery Mine out of the equation year-to-year, which is about 1.1 to 1.2 million tons a year. So when you put all that together, you'll see us being a little bit cautious. We think on the Steam side, on our sales it's going to be a very solid year and we think very solid prices. But we're not going to produce more than needs to be produced. And I think that's where we see it right now. On the met side, Buchanan coal is the strength of our met side, and we see it is going to get demand very high prices, and it will be the highest met product we have. And we see continuing demand in Asia, and we believe we could go anywhere from 3 million tons a year on the high-vol side coming out of the Bailey type operations, up to 5 or 6 million tons a year, depending what the demand is. So we're not negative year-to-year. We think we'll do as well next year as we did this year on the high-vol met side, and we think the demand for this could rise.

Let's take a look at our low vol met business, for example. We didn't hit a home run there. We hit a grand slam home run this quarter. When you take a look at our production volumes of 1.3 million tons, that's a run rate of over $5 million, which is higher than we normally achieve. We had margins of $104 a ton, and that was driven by a 70% increase in realization. I know people have focused on the cost and said at Buchanan we’ve increased our cost by $11 a ton. But over half of that is related to royalties and production tax because the increase in realization. So you're going to see increases in cost that, quite frankly, are related to increases in profitability, and we're certainly okay with that trade off and that ratio. Overall, our costs are not out of line. There was no significant increase in cost. So again, as I said, operationally, we're very pleased with the quarter in terms of our operations.

The Marcellus, from our perspective, across wide varying regions and even within a subregion such as Greene County, Pennsylvania, our experience to date has been that the geologies -- we tend to look at Marcellus as a single uniform play. The geology does vary, even within a region like Greene County, Pennsylvania. And that sort of manifests itself with regard to the results that you saw that we recorded today. We've got certain areas in Greene County, Pennsylvania as an example where there are relatively slow initial production rate compared to what we've seen historically, but relatively zero decline, again, for an early period of time, say 60 to 90 days. We've got other areas within Greene County with relatively higher initial production rates but also higher decline curves. And I think the answer to this goes back once again to geology. As time unfolds, we'll get a better feel for which one of those two well profiles gives us a higher EUR. In other words if that remains at zero decline for a significant period of time, at some point, the high IP rate, high decline well, passes under that production level that could have an impact with regard to which type of sub area has a higher EUR. So this is a great example of why this is still an opportunity across the entire industry that's probably 5% of the way to fruition. There's an awful lot to learn. We learn something every single day we drill a well. And to think that the industry is 75% or 80% of the way there, just doesn't reflect where we're at across the board."
