We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing fourth quarter and full-year 2009 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward",1966,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing fourth quarter and full-year 2009 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have an outline in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Effective January 1, 2010, the SEC now permits oil gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves,  but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast, including those from the Barnett Shale, North Dakota Bakken, Horn River in Haynesville, may include estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SECs latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference, the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our Press Release and Investor Relations page of our website.With me this morning are Loren Leiker, Senior VP, EVP of Exploration; Gary Thomas, Senior EVP of Operations; Bob Garrison, EVP of Exploration; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations; and Jill Miller, Manager of Engineering and Reserves. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night and we included first quarter and full-year 2010 guidance in yesterday's press release. I'll discuss our 2010 business plan in a minute when I review operations.I'll now review our fourth quarter and full-year net income available to common stockholders and discretionary cash flow and then I'll review our year end reserves and finding costs. I'll follow with recent operational highlights. Tim Driggers will then provide some financial details and I'll close with some macro comments and concluding remarks.As outlined in our press release, for the fourth quarter, EOG reported net income available to common stockholders of $400 million or $1.58 per share, and $547 million or $2.17 per share for the full-year 2009. For investors, you follow the practice of industry analysts, who focus on non-GAAP net income available to common stockholders to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain one-time adjustments as outlined in the press release. EOG's fourth quarter adjusted net income available to common stockholders was $234 million or $0.92 per share, and $755 million or $3 per share for the full year.For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the fourth quarter was $868 million and $3.2 billion for the full year. There are two salient points that emanate from these fourth quarter and full-year reserves. First, we had no significant financial write-downs in either 2009 or 2008. We are one of only a few companies in the peer group who can make that statement, and we believe this is a testament to the way EOG runs its business. And second, in February 2009, we provided a 3% full-year 2009 production disclosed target which increased in subsequent quarters to 5.5% and then 6%, and we ended the year with 6.5% actual growth. Historically, we've consistently hit our volume growth targets, and that should give investors confidence regarding our 2010 target.Now I'll address 2009 reserve replacement and finding costs. For total company, we replaced 364% of our production at a $1.18 per Mcfe all in cash costs including total reserve revisions. In the U.S., we replaced 431% of our production at $1.21 per Mcfe all in cash costs including total reserve revisions. Total company proved reserves increased 24% to 10.8 Tcfe. These are strong overall numbers, especially since they include 786 Bcf of price related and 95 Bcfe of performance related negative revisions.The biggest single portion of the negative revisions was in our Canadian shallow gas assets. For the 22nd consecutive year, DeGolyer and MacNaughton has done an outstanding engineering analysis of our reserves and their overall number was within 5% of our internal estimate. Their analysis covered 81% of our proved reserves this year. Please see the earnings press release for the calculation of reserve replacement and finding cost.I'll now address our 2010 business plan and then our 2009 operational results. Our 2010 production growth expectations were essentially identical to what we outlined last quarter. 13% overall growth consisting of 47% total company liquids growth, and 2% North American gas growth. Our 47% liquids growth is comprised of 55% crude oil growth, and a 28% NGL increase. This comports with our macro views since we are bullish on oil and believe North American gas prices will be weak for the first half of this year, and strengthen into second half. Accordingly, on a quarterly basis, our natural gas production profile is expected to increase sequentially this year. The majority of our gas growth will come from the Haynesville, Horn River and Marcellus Plays, while the liquids growth will emanate primarily from the Bakken, Barnett Combo and Waskada areas.I'll now discuss each of these plays starting with the Bakken, where we've got three noteworthy items to report. The first item relates to Three Forks Formation, where we have achieved positive results from three wells. The Van Hook 100-15H well, IP at 1,390 barrels of oil per day, the Austin 101-15H well at 510 barrels of oil per day and the Burke 100-20H well at 430 barrels of oil per day. These are the first tests of the Three Forks Formation on our 500,000 net acres. And we can conclude that the Three Forks is productive over some portion of our acreage, and that the average Three Forks well yield similar reserves to our Bakken Lite wells, which is about 240,000 barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty, and generates a 35% after-tax reinvestment rate of return at current prices.Secondly, we successfully drilled the Bakken step out in Williams County, North Dakota, 90 miles west of our Parshall Field. The Round Prairie 1-17H where we have a 95% working interest, is producing at a stabilized rate 450 barrels of oil per day. And likely, has similar reserves to our other Bakken Lite wells. This well along with results from other operators, indicates that a large amount of our total acreage is likely to be productive in either the Bakken or Three Forks or both zones. The third new Bakken data point is results from our first longer lateral well the James Hill 01-31H. To date, all of our wells have been moderate links laterals or aka 640s. The James Hill well has 1.5x of reserves of a Bakken Lite wells, which is proportional to its increased lateral link.We are evaluating the efficacy of drilling longer laterals, both 960s and 1280s compared to our 640s and haven't yet decided which is more efficient. There's been a wide range of reported IP rates from different companies in this Bakken Play. Part of the reason is that some companies are completing 1280 wells, which will have higher IPs, similar to two 640 space wells and others are drilling 640s or 960s. I'll try and clear up another possibly confusing terminology issue.  What EOG calls our Bakken Lite is equivalent to everybody else's Bakken. We've differentiated between our Bakken Core and Lite because we own the lion's share of the Core. Based on our analysis, outside EOG's Bakken Core, the Bakken or EOG's Bakken Lite Rock has a relatively constant quality across the basin. On the logistical front, our North Dakota crude by rail project is up and running. We are now able to increase our netback by selling oil in Cushing, Oklahoma and opposed to Clearbrook, Minnesota, while also avoiding major trucking costs. We bought this project to fruition in an eight months period. Our Prairie Rose rich national gas pipeline is also now in service. This will allow us to sell our Bakken gas and NGLs in the Chicago market, also increasing our netbacks.Now I'll move to the Barnett Combo Play. The bottom line here is that our fourth quarter drilling results further confirm our estimates that we provided last quarter of 220 and 280 net after royalty Mboe per well for vertical and horizontal wells, respectively. We referenced six of these wells in our press release, and I won't repeat them here. We plan to drill 120 vertical and 126 horizontal Combo wells this year, and are testing various spacing patterns. Since we own essentially 100% of the Combo Play, and it's not possible to triangulate EOG's results for other operators, I'll provide a conceptual way to visualize the Combo in relation to the Barnett gas areas such as Johnson or Tarrant County. Horizontal wells in our Montague County Combo Play yield on a value basis, about 1/3 crude oil, 1/3 NGLs and 1/3 gas, hence the Combo name.I'll briefly mention two other horizontal oil plays where we are having continued good results. Our 2009 Manitoba Waskada were as predicted. Last year, we drilled 48 wells and achieved an 88% after-tax reinvestment rate of return, and this year we expect to drill 100 similar wells. In our mid-continent horizontal Cleveland Play, we recently completed two strong wells. The Glass 134-2H (sic) [#2H Glass 134][ph] well IP'd at 1,000 barrels of oil per day and 1.1 million cubic feet of gas per day, and the Wilson 45 [ph] #3H. IP'd at 650 barrels of oil per day with 700 Mcf of gas. We plan to drill 24 Cleveland wells this year.Now I'll switch to our natural gas play starting with the Haynesville. The big news here is that our initial test in the Bossier was successful. The Bossier is a shale interval, 200 feet above the Haynesville with similar rock properties. The Sustainable Forest 5 - No. 2 Alternate well and DeSoto Parish flow tested at a 13 million cubic feet  a day flow rate with 7625 psi flowing tubing pressure. Helps [ph] surface frac and pressure analysis indicates this Bossier zone is separate from the underlying Haynesville zone. This means we have two viable targets over a portion of our 160,000 total net acres or both zones are present. We plan to drill 70 Gross, Haynesville and Bossier wells this year, and this area will be the largest single driver of our 2% year-over-year North American gas growth. In the Barnett gas window, last year, we completed 132 wells, primarily in Johnson County, with a direct finding cost of $1.52 and a total finding cost of $1.82 per Mcf. This year, we'll turn 171 wells to sales at similar expected finding costs. We continue to add new locations on our core gas acreage through enhanced completion techniques that allow us to recover economic gas in and around formally prohibited geologic hazards.In the Horn River Basin, we are continuing our steady ramp up, and expect to drill 12 Gross horizontal wells this year. We've closely monitored production performance of the wells we completed in 2008 and 2009, and are pleased to note that performance to date has met or exceeded our expectations. In the Pennsylvania Marcellus Shale, we operated two rig programs throughout the year. We have been obtained the high IP rates reported by some companies, but we're consistently getting 3 million to 5 million cubic feet per day initial rates, which yield good economics and will be implementing some upgraded fracs when we restart the completion this summer.Regarding our activities outside North America, we still expect to have results from our China horizontal program by mid-year, and we'll give you those results on our second quarter call. We'll also have some results from our East Irish Sea drilling program within a few months. I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

For the fourth quarter 2009, total cash exploration and development expenditures were $836 million, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. Total acquisitions for the quarter, including non-cash, were $501 million, $113 million were cash acquisitions. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment expenditures were $85 million.For the full year, total exploration and development expenditures were $3.1 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset-retirement obligations. Total acquisitions for the year, including non-cash were $707 million, $318 million were cash acquisitions. In addition, total gathering, processing plants and other property plant and equipment expenditures were $326 million. For 2009, approximately 37% of the drilling program CapEx was exploration, and 63% was development.At year-end 2009, total debt outstanding was $2.8 billion, and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 22%. At December 31, we had $686 million of cash, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $2.1 billion for a net debt to total cap ratio of 17%. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 36%, the effective tax rate for the year was 37% and the deferred tax ratio was 54%.We also announced another increase of the dividend on the common stock. This is the 11th increase in 11 years. Effectively with the next dividend, the annual indicated rate was $0.62 per share.Yesterday, we included the guidance table with earnings press release for the first quarter and full year 2010. I'll note one item on the cost side. unit transportation costs are expected to increase on a sequential basis and for the full year. This is being driven by the projects that EOG is undertaking in-house, primarily the crude by rail operation from Stanley, North Dakota to Cushing, Oklahoma. This increase is being offset by a reduction to the WTI differentials on our U.S. crude oil that is being reflected in the guidance that we have provided.For the first quarter and full-year 2010, the effective tax range is 35% to 45%. We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the first quarter and the full year. EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf change in wellhead natural gas prices is approximately $30 million for net income and $45 million for cash flow. For each $1 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the related change in NGL price, the sensitivity is approximately $22 million for net income and $33 million for cash flow. Now I'll turn it back to Mark to discuss the macro and his concluding remarks"

We believe the gas market is tightening, and prices will recover about mid-year. We continue to believe that EIA-914 supply data is too high. Analysis of weather-adjusted storage throw down paints a picture of a tightening market, which conforms to EOG's supply modeling. Our gas hedge position is shown in our presentation, and is unchanged from last quarter. We have only a small amount of gas hedge through June and are unhedged  thereafter. Our oil view continues to be that 2010-2012 NYMEX is reasonably reflective of future prices. We are long-term bullish on oil and at no oil hedges. Now let me summarize.  In my opinion, there are four points to take away from this call. First, the impact of our horizontal oil plays is clearly gaining momentum. During 2008 and 2009, we organically grew total company liquids at 42% and 28%, respectively. This year, we are targeting 47% year-over-year. The driver of this large growth has been horizontal oil. Last year, 42% of our total drilling CapEx was directed toward oil. This year, that number will be approximately 60%. From the highlights we've provided, it's apparent that all three of our key liquids plays, the Bakken, Barnett Combo and Waskada are performing as advertised. Additionally, we continue to work on other new play concepts.Second, we haven't neglected the natural gas side of the ledger, and our gas resource plays are also performing as advertised. We are especially pleased with the upside from our recent closure test.Third, EOG has a 10-year track record of our ROCE leadership in the peer group and a lower 2009 ROCE was a low 5% due to weak hydrocarbon prices. We're likely one of the few pure E&P companies to report a positive GAAP ROCE for 2009. As we transition towards a higher percent of oil production, I want to remind everyone that the historic hallmarks of EOG focus on returns, low debt and low cost, will continue.And finally, just a housekeeping item. We plan to host an Analyst Conference on April 7 to get an overall operational update. And we'll also provide a three-year volume outlook. We'll also talk about our capital plans at that time.  Thanks for listening, and I will go to Q&A."

As we see it now, we draw a separate well to develop the Bossier and another well to develop the Haynesville. So we're not looking at two laterals in the same well bore at least at this junction. The significance of what we said is that it looks to us, based on the couple of months production performance from this sustainable Forest well, that the productivity in the reserves from the Bossier are about identical to our typical Haynesville well. And that's pretty critical and we frac-monitored this sustainable Forest well and we know that the frac did not go down into the Haynesville, i.e, what's coming out of the well over that well is really Bossier production and not Haynesville production. And where that leads us to, if you take our 160,000 acres our best guess at this time is at over half of that acreage has those zones. So this is a pretty big deal in terms of what it could mean for total reserves on our acreage in Haynesville."

So part of our plan is to go relatively slow on well completions until the summer and then blitz it during the temperate weather periods in North Dakota. So what you're going to see is a big ramp up at that point in time really. So that's the biggest single driver of the trajectory other than just -- we've got cumulative higher rig activity that's going occur in the drilling this year. On the uncompleted well count, we've never had significant amount of uncompleted wells. We've got a few Johnson County wells that we'll be completing as we get into this year.

We believe will be able to keep that differential and the main reason, you got me started on this one, Ray, why we believe we are going to keep that ROCE differential is that the preponderance of our CapEx on a go-forward basis is going to be invested in oil-related projects. And simply put, the value you get per BTU of oil we believe is going to considerably exceed the value that's received per BTU of gas. So relative to a lot of other companies who basically are going to be reinvesting primarily in gas over the next five years, we're going to be doing primarily in oil and just think it's going to be a higher net back to us.

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing fourth quarter and full-year 2009 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have an outline in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Effective January 1, 2010, the SEC now permits oil gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves,  but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast, including those from the Barnett Shale, North Dakota Bakken, Horn River in Haynesville, may include estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SECs latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference, the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our Press Release and Investor Relations page of our website.With me this morning are Loren Leiker, Senior VP, EVP of Exploration; Gary Thomas, Senior EVP of Operations; Bob Garrison, EVP of Exploration; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations; and Jill Miller, Manager of Engineering and Reserves. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night and we included first quarter and full-year 2010 guidance in yesterday's press release. I'll discuss our 2010 business plan in a minute when I review operations.I'll now review our fourth quarter and full-year net income available to common stockholders and discretionary cash flow and then I'll review our year end reserves and finding costs. I'll follow with recent operational highlights. Tim Driggers will then provide some financial details and I'll close with some macro comments and concluding remarks.As outlined in our press release, for the fourth quarter, EOG reported net income available to common stockholders of $400 million or $1.58 per share, and $547 million or $2.17 per share for the full year 2009. For investors, you follow the practice of industry analysts, who focus on non-GAAP net income available to common stockholders to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain one-time adjustments as outlined in the press release. EOG's fourth quarter adjusted net income available to common stockholders was $234 million or $0.92 per share, and $755 million or $3 per share for the full year.For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the fourth quarter was $868 million and $3.2 billion for the full year. There are two salient points that emanate from these fourth quarter and full year reserves. First, we had no significant financial write-downs in either 2009 or 2008. We're one of only a few companies in the peer group who can make that statement, and we believe this is a testament to the way EOG runs its business. And second, in February 2009, we provided a 3% full year 2009 production growth target, which we increased in subsequent quarters to 5½% and then 6%, and we ended the year with 6½% actual growth. Historically, we've consistently hit our volume growth targets and that should give investors confidence regarding our 2010 target.Now I'll address 2009 reserve replacement and finding costs. For total company, we replaced 364% of our production at $1.18 per Mcfe all in cash costs including total reserve revisions. In the U.S., we replaced 431% of our production at $1.21 per Mcfe all in cash costs including total reserve revisions. Total company proved reserves increased 24% to 10.8 Tcfe. These are strong overall numbers, especially since they include 786 Bcf of price related and 95 Bcfe of performance related negative revisions.The biggest single portion of the negative revisions was in our Canadian shallow gas assets. For the 22nd consecutive year, DeGolyer and MacNaughton has done an engineering analysis of our reserves and their overall number was within 5% of our internal estimate. Their analysis covered 81% of our proved reserves this year. Please see the earnings press release for the calculation of reserve replacement and finding cost.I'll now address our 2010 business plan and then our 2009 operational results. Our 2010 production growth expectations were essentially identical to what we outlined last quarter. 13% overall growth consisting of 47% total company liquids growth and 2% North American gas growth. Our 47% liquids growth is comprised of 55% crude oil growth and a 28% NGL increase. This comports with our macro view since we're bullish on oil and believe North American gas prices will be weak for the first half of this year, and strengthen into second half. Accordingly, on a quarterly basis, our natural gas production profile is expected to increase sequentially this year. The majority of our gas growth will come from the Haynesville, Horn River and Marcellus plays, while the liquids growth will emanate primarily from the Bakken, Barnett Combo and Waskada areas.I'll now discuss each of these plays starting with the Bakken, where we've got three noteworthy items to report. The first item relates to the Three Forks Formation, where we have achieved positive results from three wells. The Van Hook 100-15H well, IP at 1,390 barrels of oil per day, the Austin 101-15H well at 510 barrels of oil per day and the Burke 100-20H well at 430 barrels of oil per day. These are the first tests of the Three Forks Formation on our 500,000 net acres. And we can conclude that the Three Forks is productive over some portion of our acreage, and that the average Three Forks well yield similar reserves to our Bakken Lite wells, which is about 240,000 barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty and generates a 35% after-tax reinvestment rate of return at current prices.Secondly, we successfully drilled a Bakken step-out in Williams County, North Dakota, 90 miles west of our Parshall Field. The Round Prairie 1-17H, where we have a 95% working interest, is producing at a stabilized rate of 450 barrels of oil per day, and likely has similar reserves to our other Bakken Lite wells. This well along with results from other operators indicates that a large amount of our total acreage is likely to be productive in either the Bakken or Three Forks or both zones. The third new Bakken data point is the results from our first longer lateral well, the James Hill 01-31H. To date, all of our wells have been moderate links laterals or aka 640s. The James Hill well has 1½x of reserves of a Bakken Lite wells, which is proportional to its increased lateral link.We're evaluating the efficacy of drilling longer laterals, both 960s and 1280s compared to our 640s and haven't yet decided which is more efficient. There's been a wide range of reported IP rates from different companies in this Bakken Play. Part of the reason is that some companies are completing 1280 wells, which will have higher IPs, similar to two 640 space wells and others are drilling 640s or 960s. I'll try and clear up another possibly confusing terminology issue. What EOG calls our Bakken Lite is equivalent to everybody else's Bakken. We've differentiated between our Bakken Core and Lite because we own the lion's share of the Core. Based on our analysis, outside EOG's Bakken Core, the Bakken or EOG's Bakken Lite Rock has a relatively constant quality across the basin. On the logistical front, our North Dakota crude by rail project is up and running. We're now able to increase our netback by selling oil in Cushing, Oklahoma and opposed to Clearbrook, Minnesota, while also avoiding major trucking costs. We bought this project to fruition in an eight-month period. Our Prairie Rose rich natural gas pipeline is also now in service. This will allow us to sell our Bakken gas and NGLs in the Chicago market, also increasing our netbacks.Now I'll move to the Barnett Combo Play. The bottom line here is that our fourth quarter drilling results further confirm our estimates that we've provided last quarter of 220 and 280 net after royalty Mboe per well for vertical and horizontal wells, respectively. We referenced six of these wells in our press release, and I won't repeat them here. We plan to drill 120 vertical and 126 horizontal Combo wells this year, and are testing various spacing patterns. Since we own essentially 100% of the Combo Play, and it's not possible to triangulate EOG's results with other operators, I'll provide a conceptual way to visualize the Combo in relation to the Barnett gas areas such as Johnson or Tarrant County. Horizontal wells in our Montague County Combo Play yield on a value basis about 1/3 crude oil, 1/3 NGLs and 1/3 gas, hence the Combo name.I'll briefly mention two other horizontal oil plays where we're having continued good results. Our 2009 Manitoba Waskada results were as predicted. Last year, we drilled 48 wells and achieved an 88% after-tax reinvestment rate of return, and this year we expect to drill 100 similar wells. In our mid-continent horizontal Cleveland Play, we recently completed two strong wells. The Glass 134-2H (sic) [#2H Glass 134] well, IP-ed at 1,000 barrels of oil per day and 1.1 million cubic feet of gas per day, and the Wilson 45 #3H (sic) [#3H Quida Wilson 45], IP-ed at 650 barrels of oil per day with 700 Mcf of gas. We plan to drill 24 Cleveland wells this year.Now I'll switch to our natural gas play starting with the Haynesville. The big news here is that our initial test in the Bossier was successful. The Bossier is a shale interval, 200 feet above the Haynesville with similar rock properties. The Sustainable Forest 5 - No. 2 Alternate well and DeSoto Parish flow tested at a 13 million cubic feet  a day flow rate with 7625 psi flowing tubing pressure. Helps [ph] surface frac and pressure analysis indicates this Bossier zone is separate from the underlying Haynesville zone. This means we have two viable targets over a portion of our 160,000 total net acres or both zones are present. We plan to drill 70 Gross, Haynesville and Bossier wells this year, and this area will be the largest single driver of our 2% year-over-year North American gas growth. In the Barnett gas window, last year, we completed 132 wells, primarily in Johnson County, with a direct finding cost of $1.52 and a total finding cost of $1.82 per Mcf. This year, we'll turn 171 wells to sales at similar expected finding costs. We continue to add new locations on our core gas acreage through enhanced completion techniques that allow us to recover economic gas in and around formally prohibited geologic hazards.In the Horn River Basin, we are continuing our steady ramp up, and expect to drill 12 Gross horizontal wells this year. We've closely monitored production performance of the wells we completed in 2008 and 2009, and are pleased to note that performance to date has met or exceeded our expectations. In the Pennsylvania Marcellus Shale, we operated two rig programs throughout the year. We have been obtained the high IP rates reported by some companies, but we're consistently getting 3 million to 5 million cubic feet per day initial rates, which yield good economics and will be implementing some upgraded fracs when we restart the completion this summer.Regarding our activities outside North America, we still expect to have results from our China horizontal program by mid-year, and we'll give you those results on our second quarter call. We'll also have some results from our East Irish Sea drilling program within a few months. I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

This increase is being offset by a reduction to the WTI differentials on our U.S. crude oil that is being reflected in the guidance that we have provided.For the first quarter and full year 2010, the effective tax range is 35% to 45%. We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the first quarter and the full year. EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf change in wellhead natural gas prices is approximately $30 million for net income and $45 million for cash flow. For each $1 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the related change in NGL price, the sensitivity is approximately $22 million for net income and $33 million for cash flow. Now I'll turn it back to Mark to discuss the macro and his concluding remarks"

We believe the gas market is tightening, and prices will recover about mid-year. We continue to believe that EIA-914 supply data is too high. Analysis of weather-adjusted storage throw down paints a picture of a tightening market, which conforms to EOG's supply modeling. Our gas hedge position is shown in our presentation, and is unchanged from last quarter. We have only a small amount of gas hedge through June and are unhedged  thereafter. Our oil view continues to be that 2010-2012 NYMEX is reasonably reflective of future prices. We are long-term bullish on oil and at no oil hedges. Now let me summarize.  In my opinion, there are four points to take away from this call. First, the impact of our horizontal oil plays is clearly gaining momentum. During 2008 and 2009, we organically grew total company liquids at 42% and 28%, respectively. This year, we are targeting 47% year-over-year. The driver of this large growth has been horizontal oil. Last year, 42% of our total drilling CapEx was directed toward oil. This year, that number will be approximately 60%. From the highlights we've provided, it's apparent that all three of our key liquids plays, the Bakken, Barnett Combo and Waskada are performing as advertised. Additionally, we continue to work on other new play concepts.Second, we haven't neglected the natural gas side of the ledger, and our gas resource plays are also performing as advertised. We are especially pleased with the upside from our recent closure test.Third, EOG has a 10-year track record of our ROCE leadership in the peer group and a lower 2009 ROCE was a low 5% due to weak hydrocarbon prices. We're likely one of the few pure E&P companies to report a positive GAAP ROCE for 2009. As we transition towards a higher percent of oil production, I want to remind everyone that the historic hallmarks of EOG focus on returns, low debt and low cost, will continue.And finally, just a housekeeping item. We plan to host an Analyst Conference on April 7 to get an overall operational update. And we'll also provide a three-year volume outlook. We'll also talk about our capital plans at that time.  Thanks for listening, and I will go to Q&A."

The significance of what we said is that it looks to us, based on the couple of months production performance from this sustainable Forest well, that the productivity in the reserves from the Bossier are about identical to our typical Haynesville well. And that's pretty critical and we frac-monitored this sustainable Forest well and we know that the frac did not go down into the Haynesville, i.e, what's coming out of the well over that well is really Bossier production and not Haynesville production. And where that leads us to, if you take our 160,000 acres our best guess at this time is at over half of that acreage has those zones.

And it's just more expensive to complete wells in winter time in North Dakota as you can visualize. So part of our plan is to go relatively slow on well completions until the summer and then blitz it during the temperate weather periods in North Dakota. So what you're going to see is a big ramp up at that point in time really. So that's the biggest single driver of the trajectory other than just -- we've got cumulative higher rig activity that's going occur in the drilling this year. On the uncompleted well count, we've never had significant amount of uncompleted wells. We've got a few Johnson County wells that we'll be completing as we get into this year.

I think the well we announced is obviously in DeSoto and we're looking at it in a number of other areas both with fresh modern logs and fresh modern core. Once again, we want to thank everyone for sitting in on the call and look forward to seeing many of you in person on April 7 in Houston. Thank you."

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing fourth quarter and full-year 2009 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have an outline in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Effective January 1, 2010, the SEC now permits oil gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves,  but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast, including those from the Barnett Shale, North Dakota Bakken, Horn River in Haynesville, may include estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SECs latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference, the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our Press Release and Investor Relations page of our website.With me this morning are Loren Leiker, Senior VP, EVP of Exploration; Gary Thomas, Senior EVP of Operations; Bob Garrison, EVP of Exploration; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations; and Jill Miller, Manager of Engineering and Reserves. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night and we included first quarter and full-year 2010 guidance in yesterday's press release. I'll discuss our 2010 business plan in a minute when I review operations.I'll now review our fourth quarter and full-year net income available to common stockholders and discretionary cash flow and then I'll review our year end reserves and finding costs. I'll follow with recent operational highlights. Tim Driggers will then provide some financial details and I'll close with some macro comments and concluding remarks.As outlined in our press release, for the fourth quarter, EOG reported net income available to common stockholders of $400 million or $1.58 per share, and $547 million or $2.17 per share for the full year 2009. For investors, you follow the practice of industry analysts, who focus on non-GAAP net income available to common stockholders to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain one-time adjustments as outlined in the press release. EOG's fourth quarter adjusted net income available to common stockholders was $234 million or $0.92 per share, and $755 million or $3 per share for the full year.For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the fourth quarter was $868 million and $3.2 billion for the full year. There are two salient points that emanate from these fourth quarter and full year reserves. First, we had no significant financial write-downs in either 2009 or 2008. We're one of only a few companies in the peer group who can make that statement, and we believe this is a testament to the way EOG runs its business. And second, in February 2009, we provided a 3% full year 2009 production growth target, which we increased in subsequent quarters to 5½% and then 6%, and we ended the year with 6½% actual growth. Historically, we've consistently hit our volume growth targets and that should give investors confidence regarding our 2010 target.Now I'll address 2009 reserve replacement and finding costs. For total company, we replaced 364% of our production at $1.18 per Mcfe all in cash costs including total reserve revisions. In the U.S., we replaced 431% of our production at $1.21 per Mcfe all in cash costs including total reserve revisions. Total company proved reserves increased 24% to 10.8 Tcfe. These are strong overall numbers, especially since they include 786 Bcf of price related and 95 Bcfe of performance related negative revisions.The biggest single portion of the negative revisions was in our Canadian shallow gas assets. For the 22nd consecutive year, DeGolyer and MacNaughton has done an engineering analysis of our reserves and their overall number was within 5% of our internal estimate. Their analysis covered 81% of our proved reserves this year. Please see the earnings press release for the calculation of reserve replacement and finding cost.I'll now address our 2010 business plan and then our 2009 operational results. Our 2010 production growth expectations were essentially identical to what we outlined last quarter. 13% overall growth consisting of 47% total company liquids growth and 2% North American gas growth. Our 47% liquids growth is comprised of 55% crude oil growth and a 28% NGL increase. This comports with our macro view since we're bullish on oil and believe North American gas prices will be weak for the first half of this year, and strengthen into second half. Accordingly, on a quarterly basis, our natural gas production profile is expected to increase sequentially this year. The majority of our gas growth will come from the Haynesville, Horn River and Marcellus plays, while the liquids growth will emanate primarily from the Bakken, Barnett Combo and Waskada areas.I'll now discuss each of these plays starting with the Bakken, where we've got three noteworthy items to report. The first item relates to the Three Forks Formation, where we have achieved positive results from three wells. The Van Hook 100-15H well, IP at 1,390 barrels of oil per day, the Austin 101-15H well at 510 barrels of oil per day and the Burke 100-20H well at 430 barrels of oil per day. These are the first tests of the Three Forks Formation on our 500,000 net acres. And we can conclude that the Three Forks is productive over some portion of our acreage, and that the average Three Forks well yield similar reserves to our Bakken Lite wells, which is about 240,000 barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty and generates a 35% after-tax reinvestment rate of return at current prices.Secondly, we successfully drilled a Bakken step-out in Williams County, North Dakota, 90 miles west of our Parshall Field. The Round Prairie 1-17H, where we have a 95% working interest, is producing at a stabilized rate of 450 barrels of oil per day, and likely has similar reserves to our other Bakken Lite wells. This well along with results from other operators indicates that a large amount of our total acreage is likely to be productive in either the Bakken or Three Forks or both zones. The third new Bakken data point is the results from our first longer lateral well, the James Hill 01-31H. To date, all of our wells have been moderate links laterals or aka 640s. The James Hill well has 1½x of reserves of a Bakken Lite wells, which is proportional to its increased lateral link.We're evaluating the efficacy of drilling longer laterals, both 960s and 1280s compared to our 640s and haven't yet decided which is more efficient. There's been a wide range of reported IP rates from different companies in this Bakken Play. Part of the reason is that some companies are completing 1280 wells, which will have higher IPs, similar to two 640 space wells and others are drilling 640s or 960s. I'll try and clear up another possibly confusing terminology issue. What EOG calls our Bakken Lite is equivalent to everybody else's Bakken. We've differentiated between our Bakken Core and Lite because we own the lion's share of the Core. Based on our analysis, outside EOG's Bakken Core, the Bakken or EOG's Bakken Lite Rock has a relatively constant quality across the basin. On the logistical front, our North Dakota crude by rail project is up and running. We're now able to increase our netback by selling oil in Cushing, Oklahoma and opposed to Clearbrook, Minnesota, while also avoiding major trucking costs. We bought this project to fruition in an eight-month period. Our Prairie Rose rich natural gas pipeline is also now in service. This will allow us to sell our Bakken gas and NGLs in the Chicago market, also increasing our netbacks.Now I'll move to the Barnett Combo Play. The bottom line here is that our fourth quarter drilling results further confirm our estimates that we've provided last quarter of 220 and 280 net after royalty Mboe per well for vertical and horizontal wells, respectively. We referenced six of these wells in our press release, and I won't repeat them here. We plan to drill 120 vertical and 126 horizontal Combo wells this year, and are testing various spacing patterns. Since we own essentially 100% of the Combo Play, and it's not possible to triangulate EOG's results with other operators, I'll provide a conceptual way to visualize the Combo in relation to the Barnett gas areas such as Johnson or Tarrant County. Horizontal wells in our Montague County Combo Play yield on a value basis about 1/3 crude oil, 1/3 NGLs and 1/3 gas, hence the Combo name.I'll briefly mention two other horizontal oil plays where we're having continued good results. Our 2009 Manitoba Waskada results were as predicted. Last year, we drilled 48 wells and achieved an 88% after-tax reinvestment rate of return, and this year we expect to drill 100 similar wells. In our mid-continent horizontal Cleveland Play, we recently completed two strong wells. The Glass 134-2H (sic) [#2H Glass 134] well, IP-ed at 1,000 barrels of oil per day and 1.1 million cubic feet of gas per day, and the Wilson 45 #3H (sic) [#3H Quida Wilson 45], IP-ed at 650 barrels of oil per day with 700 Mcf of gas. We plan to drill 24 Cleveland wells this year.Now I'll switch to our natural gas play starting with the Haynesville. The big news here is that our initial test in the Bossier was successful. The Bossier is a shale interval, 200 feet above the Haynesville with similar rock properties. The Sustainable Forest 5 - No. 2 Alternate well and DeSoto Parish flow tested at a 13 million cubic feet  a day flow rate with 7625 psi flowing tubing pressure. Helps [ph] surface frac and pressure analysis indicates this Bossier zone is separate from the underlying Haynesville zone. This means we have two viable targets over a portion of our 160,000 total net acres or both zones are present. We plan to drill 70 Gross, Haynesville and Bossier wells this year, and this area will be the largest single driver of our 2% year-over-year North American gas growth. In the Barnett gas window, last year, we completed 132 wells, primarily in Johnson County, with a direct finding cost of $1.52 and a total finding cost of $1.82 per Mcf. This year, we'll turn 171 wells to sales at similar expected finding costs. We continue to add new locations on our core gas acreage through enhanced completion techniques that allow us to recover economic gas in and around formally prohibited geologic hazards.In the Horn River Basin, we are continuing our steady ramp up, and expect to drill 12 Gross horizontal wells this year. We've closely monitored production performance of the wells we completed in 2008 and 2009, and are pleased to note that performance to date has met or exceeded our expectations. In the Pennsylvania Marcellus Shale, we operated two rig programs throughout the year. We have been obtained the high IP rates reported by some companies, but we're consistently getting 3 million to 5 million cubic feet per day initial rates, which yield good economics and will be implementing some upgraded fracs when we restart the completion this summer.Regarding our activities outside North America, we still expect to have results from our China horizontal program by mid-year, and we'll give you those results on our second quarter call. We'll also have some results from our East Irish Sea drilling program within a few months. I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

For the fourth quarter 2009, total cash exploration and development expenditures were $836 million, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. Total acquisitions for the quarter, including non-cash, were $501 million, $113 million were cash acquisitions. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment expenditures were $85 million.For the full year, total exploration and development expenditures were $3.1 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset-retirement obligations. Total acquisitions for the year, including non-cash were $707 million, $318 million were cash acquisitions. In addition, total gathering, processing plants and other property plant and equipment expenditures were $326 million. For 2009, approximately 37% of the drilling program CapEx was exploration, and 63% was development.At year-end 2009, total debt outstanding was $2.8 billion, and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 22%. At December 31, we had $686 million of cash, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $2.1 billion for a net debt to total cap ratio of 17%. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 36%, the effective tax rate for the year was 37% and the deferred tax ratio was 54%.We also announced another increase of the dividend on the common stock. This is the 11th increase in 11 years. Effectively with the next dividend, the annual indicated rate was $0.62 per share.Yesterday, we included the guidance table with earnings press release for the first quarter and full year 2010. I'll note one item on the cost side. unit transportation costs are expected to increase on a sequential basis and for the full year. This is being driven by the projects that EOG is undertaking in-house, primarily the crude by rail operation from Stanley, North Dakota to Cushing, Oklahoma. This increase is being offset by a reduction to the WTI differentials on our U.S. crude oil that is being reflected in the guidance that we have provided.For the first quarter and full year 2010, the effective tax range is 35% to 45%. We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the first quarter and the full year. EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf change in wellhead natural gas prices is approximately $30 million for net income and $45 million for cash flow. For each $1 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the related change in NGL price, the sensitivity is approximately $22 million for net income and $33 million for cash flow. Now I'll turn it back to Mark to discuss the macro and his concluding remarks"

We believe the gas market is tightening, and prices will recover about mid-year. We continue to believe that EIA-914 supply data is too high. Analysis of weather-adjusted storage throw down paints a picture of a tightening market, which conforms to EOG's supply modeling. Our gas hedge position is shown in our presentation, and is unchanged from last quarter. We have only a small amount of gas hedge through June and are unhedged  thereafter. Our oil view continues to be that 2010-2012 NYMEX is reasonably reflective of future prices. We are long-term bullish on oil and at no oil hedges. Now let me summarize.  In my opinion, there are four points to take away from this call. First, the impact of our horizontal oil plays is clearly gaining momentum. During 2008 and 2009, we organically grew total company liquids at 42% and 28%, respectively. This year, we are targeting 47% year-over-year. The driver of this large growth has been horizontal oil. Last year, 42% of our total drilling CapEx was directed toward oil. This year, that number will be approximately 60%. From the highlights we've provided, it's apparent that all three of our key liquids plays, the Bakken, Barnett Combo and Waskada are performing as advertised. Additionally, we continue to work on other new play concepts.Second, we haven't neglected the natural gas side of the ledger, and our gas resource plays are also performing as advertised. We are especially pleased with the upside from our recent closure test.Third, EOG has a 10-year track record of our ROCE leadership in the peer group and a lower 2009 ROCE was a low 5% due to weak hydrocarbon prices. We're likely one of the few pure E&P companies to report a positive GAAP ROCE for 2009. As we transition towards a higher percent of oil production, I want to remind everyone that the historic hallmarks of EOG focus on returns, low debt and low cost, will continue.And finally, just a housekeeping item. We plan to host an Analyst Conference on April 7 to get an overall operational update. And we'll also provide a three-year volume outlook. We'll also talk about our capital plans at that time.  Thanks for listening, and I will go to Q&A."

So we're not looking at two laterals in the same well bore at least at this junction. The significance of what we said is that it looks to us, based on the couple of months production performance from this sustainable Forest well, that the productivity in the reserves from the Bossier are about identical to our typical Haynesville well. And that's pretty critical and we frac-monitored this sustainable Forest well and we know that the frac did not go down into the Haynesville, i.e, what's coming out of the well over that well is really Bossier production and not Haynesville production. And where that leads us to, if you take our 160,000 acres our best guess at this time is at over half of that acreage has those zones.

And the big reason why second half loaded as opposed to the first quarter really relates to the Bakken. Again it's just due to seasonality on when we're going to frac a lot of the wells. And it's just more expensive to complete wells in winter time in North Dakota as you can visualize. So part of our plan is to go relatively slow on well completions until the summer and then blitz it during the temperate weather periods in North Dakota. So what you're going to see is a big ramp up at that point in time really. So that's the biggest single driver of the trajectory other than just -- we've got cumulative higher rig activity that's going occur in the drilling this year. On the uncompleted well count, we've never had significant amount of uncompleted wells. We've got a few Johnson County wells that we'll be completing as we get into this year.

So we've tied our internal models to the IHS data, and even though the gas rig count has gone up considerably over the last four, five months, what it tells us is that productions is still going to be down to the tune of about 3 Bcf a day relative to December '08 throughout all of 2010. And only will it be in 2011 when you start to see the reversal due to the rig count. And then the other data point that we think is probably the clearest data point -- something may be amiss with EIA data it's just the -- if you look at how much storage drawdown has occurred in December and January, how many Bcf has been pulled out of storage, and you relate that to degree days compared to last year, it's pretty good prima facing case that we must be tighter, and we were a year ago considerably on supply and demand. So it's either got to be less supply or more demand and we kind of believe it's probably less supply."

We believe will be able to keep that differential and the main reason, you got me started on this one, Ray, why we believe we are going to keep that ROCE differential is that the preponderance of our CapEx on a go-forward basis is going to be invested in oil-related projects. And simply put, the value you get per BTU of oil we believe is going to considerably exceed the value that's received per BTU of gas. So relative to a lot of other companies who basically are going to be reinvesting primarily in gas over the next five years, we're going to be doing primarily in oil and just think it's going to be a higher net back to us.

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing fourth quarter and full-year 2009 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have an outline in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Effective January 1, 2010, the SEC now permits oil gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves,  but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast, including those from the Barnett Shale, North Dakota Bakken, Horn River in Haynesville, may include estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SECs latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference, the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our Press Release and Investor Relations page of our website.With me this morning are Loren Leiker, Senior VP, EVP of Exploration; Gary Thomas, Senior EVP of Operations; Bob Garrison, EVP of Exploration; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations; and Jill Miller, Manager of Engineering and Reserves. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night and we included first quarter and full-year 2010 guidance in yesterday's press release. I'll discuss our 2010 business plan in a minute when I review operations.I'll now review our fourth quarter and full-year net income available to common stockholders and discretionary cash flow and then I'll review our year end reserves and finding costs. I'll follow with recent operational highlights. Tim Driggers will then provide some financial details and I'll close with some macro comments and concluding remarks.As outlined in our press release, for the fourth quarter, EOG reported net income available to common stockholders of $400 million or $1.58 per share, and $547 million or $2.17 per share for the full year 2009. For investors, you follow the practice of industry analysts, who focus on non-GAAP net income available to common stockholders to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain one-time adjustments as outlined in the press release. EOG's fourth quarter adjusted net income available to common stockholders was $234 million or $0.92 per share, and $755 million or $3 per share for the full year.For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the fourth quarter was $868 million and $3.2 billion for the full year. There are two salient points that emanate from these fourth quarter and full year reserves. First, we had no significant financial write-downs in either 2009 or 2008. We're one of only a few companies in the peer group who can make that statement, and we believe this is a testament to the way EOG runs its business. And second, in February 2009, we provided a 3% full year 2009 production growth target, which we increased in subsequent quarters to 5½% and then 6%, and we ended the year with 6½% actual growth. Historically, we've consistently hit our volume growth targets and that should give investors confidence regarding our 2010 target.Now I'll address 2009 reserve replacement and finding costs. For total company, we replaced 364% of our production at $1.18 per Mcfe all in cash costs including total reserve revisions. In the U.S., we replaced 431% of our production at $1.21 per Mcfe all in cash costs including total reserve revisions. Total company proved reserves increased 24% to 10.8 Tcfe. These are strong overall numbers, especially since they include 786 Bcf of price related and 95 Bcfe of performance related negative revisions.The biggest single portion of the negative revisions was in our Canadian shallow gas assets. For the 22nd consecutive year, DeGolyer and MacNaughton has done an engineering analysis of our reserves and their overall number was within 5% of our internal estimate. Their analysis covered 81% of our proved reserves this year. Please see the earnings press release for the calculation of reserve replacement and finding cost.I'll now address our 2010 business plan and then our 2009 operational results. Our 2010 production growth expectations were essentially identical to what we outlined last quarter. 13% overall growth consisting of 47% total company liquids growth and 2% North American gas growth. Our 47% liquids growth is comprised of 55% crude oil growth and a 28% NGL increase. This comports with our macro view since we're bullish on oil and believe North American gas prices will be weak for the first half of this year, and strengthen into second half. Accordingly, on a quarterly basis, our natural gas production profile is expected to increase sequentially this year. The majority of our gas growth will come from the Haynesville, Horn River and Marcellus plays, while the liquids growth will emanate primarily from the Bakken, Barnett Combo and Waskada areas.I'll now discuss each of these plays starting with the Bakken, where we've got three noteworthy items to report. The first item relates to the Three Forks Formation, where we have achieved positive results from three wells. The Van Hook 100-15H well, IP at 1,390 barrels of oil per day, the Austin 101-15H well at 510 barrels of oil per day and the Burke 100-20H well at 430 barrels of oil per day. These are the first tests of the Three Forks Formation on our 500,000 net acres. And we can conclude that the Three Forks is productive over some portion of our acreage, and that the average Three Forks well yield similar reserves to our Bakken Lite wells, which is about 240,000 barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty and generates a 35% after-tax reinvestment rate of return at current prices.Secondly, we successfully drilled a Bakken step-out in Williams County, North Dakota, 90 miles west of our Parshall Field. The Round Prairie 1-17H, where we have a 95% working interest, is producing at a stabilized rate of 450 barrels of oil per day, and likely has similar reserves to our other Bakken Lite wells. This well along with results from other operators indicates that a large amount of our total acreage is likely to be productive in either the Bakken or Three Forks or both zones. The third new Bakken data point is the results from our first longer lateral well, the James Hill 01-31H. To date, all of our wells have been moderate links laterals or aka 640s. The James Hill well has 1½x of reserves of a Bakken Lite wells, which is proportional to its increased lateral link.We're evaluating the efficacy of drilling longer laterals, both 960s and 1280s compared to our 640s and haven't yet decided which is more efficient. There's been a wide range of reported IP rates from different companies in this Bakken Play. Part of the reason is that some companies are completing 1280 wells, which will have higher IPs, similar to two 640 space wells and others are drilling 640s or 960s. I'll try and clear up another possibly confusing terminology issue. What EOG calls our Bakken Lite is equivalent to everybody else's Bakken. We've differentiated between our Bakken Core and Lite because we own the lion's share of the Core. Based on our analysis, outside EOG's Bakken Core, the Bakken or EOG's Bakken Lite Rock has a relatively constant quality across the basin. On the logistical front, our North Dakota crude by rail project is up and running. We're now able to increase our netback by selling oil in Cushing, Oklahoma and opposed to Clearbrook, Minnesota, while also avoiding major trucking costs. We bought this project to fruition in an eight-month period. Our Prairie Rose rich natural gas pipeline is also now in service. This will allow us to sell our Bakken gas and NGLs in the Chicago market, also increasing our netbacks.Now I'll move to the Barnett Combo Play. The bottom line here is that our fourth quarter drilling results further confirm our estimates that we've provided last quarter of 220 and 280 net after royalty Mboe per well for vertical and horizontal wells, respectively. We referenced six of these wells in our press release, and I won't repeat them here. We plan to drill 120 vertical and 126 horizontal Combo wells this year, and are testing various spacing patterns. Since we own essentially 100% of the Combo Play, and it's not possible to triangulate EOG's results with other operators, I'll provide a conceptual way to visualize the Combo in relation to the Barnett gas areas such as Johnson or Tarrant County. Horizontal wells in our Montague County Combo Play yield on a value basis about 1/3 crude oil, 1/3 NGLs and 1/3 gas, hence the Combo name.I'll briefly mention two other horizontal oil plays where we're having continued good results. Our 2009 Manitoba Waskada results were as predicted. Last year, we drilled 48 wells and achieved an 88% after-tax reinvestment rate of return, and this year we expect to drill 100 similar wells. In our mid-continent horizontal Cleveland Play, we recently completed two strong wells. The Glass 134-2H (sic) [#2H Glass 134] well, IP-ed at 1,000 barrels of oil per day and 1.1 million cubic feet of gas per day, and the Wilson 45 #3H (sic) [#3H Quida Wilson 45], IP-ed at 650 barrels of oil per day with 700 Mcf of gas. We plan to drill 24 Cleveland wells this year.Now I'll switch to our natural gas play starting with the Haynesville. The big news here is that our initial test in the Bossier was successful. The Bossier is a shale interval, 200 feet above the Haynesville with similar rock properties. The Sustainable Forest 5 - No. 2 Alternate well and DeSoto Parish flow tested at a 13 million cubic feet  a day flow rate with 7625 psi flowing tubing pressure. Helps [ph] surface frac and pressure analysis indicates this Bossier zone is separate from the underlying Haynesville zone. This means we have two viable targets over a portion of our 160,000 total net acres or both zones are present. We plan to drill 70 Gross, Haynesville and Bossier wells this year, and this area will be the largest single driver of our 2% year-over-year North American gas growth. In the Barnett gas window, last year, we completed 132 wells, primarily in Johnson County, with a direct finding cost of $1.52 and a total finding cost of $1.82 per Mcf. This year, we'll turn 171 wells to sales at similar expected finding costs. We continue to add new locations on our core gas acreage through enhanced completion techniques that allow us to recover economic gas in and around formally prohibited geologic hazards.In the Horn River Basin, we are continuing our steady ramp up, and expect to drill 12 Gross horizontal wells this year. We've closely monitored production performance of the wells we completed in 2008 and 2009, and are pleased to note that performance to date has met or exceeded our expectations. In the Pennsylvania Marcellus Shale, we operated two rig programs throughout the year. We have been obtained the high IP rates reported by some companies, but we're consistently getting 3 million to 5 million cubic feet per day initial rates, which yield good economics and will be implementing some upgraded fracs when we restart the completion this summer.Regarding our activities outside North America, we still expect to have results from our China horizontal program by mid-year, and we'll give you those results on our second quarter call. We'll also have some results from our East Irish Sea drilling program within a few months. I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

At December 31, we had $686 million of cash, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $2.1 billion for a net debt to total cap ratio of 17%. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 36%, the effective tax rate for the year was 37% and the deferred tax ratio was 54%.We also announced another increase of the dividend on the common stock. This is the 11th increase in 11 years. Effectively with the next dividend, the annual indicated rate was $0.62 per share.Yesterday, we included the guidance table with earnings press release for the first quarter and full year 2010. I'll note one item on the cost side. unit transportation costs are expected to increase on a sequential basis and for the full year. This is being driven by the projects that EOG is undertaking in-house, primarily the crude by rail operation from Stanley, North Dakota to Cushing, Oklahoma. This increase is being offset by a reduction to the WTI differentials on our U.S. crude oil that is being reflected in the guidance that we have provided.For the first quarter and full year 2010, the effective tax range is 35% to 45%. We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the first quarter and the full year. EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf change in wellhead natural gas prices is approximately $30 million for net income and $45 million for cash flow. For each $1 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the related change in NGL price, the sensitivity is approximately $22 million for net income and $33 million for cash flow. Now I'll turn it back to Mark to discuss the macro and his concluding remarks"

We believe the gas market is tightening, and prices will recover about mid-year. We continue to believe that EIA-914 supply data is too high. Analysis of weather-adjusted storage throw down paints a picture of a tightening market, which conforms to EOG's supply modeling. Our gas hedge position is shown in our presentation, and is unchanged from last quarter. We have only a small amount of gas hedge through June and are unhedged  thereafter. Our oil view continues to be that 2010-2012 NYMEX is reasonably reflective of future prices. We are long-term bullish on oil and at no oil hedges. Now let me summarize.  In my opinion, there are four points to take away from this call. First, the impact of our horizontal oil plays is clearly gaining momentum. During 2008 and 2009, we organically grew total company liquids at 42% and 28%, respectively. This year, we are targeting 47% year-over-year. The driver of this large growth has been horizontal oil. Last year, 42% of our total drilling CapEx was directed toward oil. This year, that number will be approximately 60%. From the highlights we've provided, it's apparent that all three of our key liquids plays, the Bakken, Barnett Combo and Waskada are performing as advertised. Additionally, we continue to work on other new play concepts.Second, we haven't neglected the natural gas side of the ledger, and our gas resource plays are also performing as advertised. We are especially pleased with the upside from our recent closure test.Third, EOG has a 10-year track record of our ROCE leadership in the peer group and a lower 2009 ROCE was a low 5% due to weak hydrocarbon prices. We're likely one of the few pure E&P companies to report a positive GAAP ROCE for 2009. As we transition towards a higher percent of oil production, I want to remind everyone that the historic hallmarks of EOG focus on returns, low debt and low cost, will continue.And finally, just a housekeeping item. We plan to host an Analyst Conference on April 7 to get an overall operational update. And we'll also provide a three-year volume outlook. We'll also talk about our capital plans at that time.  Thanks for listening, and I will go to Q&A."

And that's pretty critical and we frac-monitored this sustainable Forest well and we know that the frac did not go down into the Haynesville, i.e, what's coming out of the well over that well is really Bossier production and not Haynesville production. And where that leads us to, if you take our 160,000 acres our best guess at this time is at over half of that acreage has those zones.

And the big reason why second half loaded as opposed to the first quarter really relates to the Bakken. Again it's just due to seasonality on when we're going to frac a lot of the wells. And it's just more expensive to complete wells in winter time in North Dakota as you can visualize. So part of our plan is to go relatively slow on well completions until the summer and then blitz it during the temperate weather periods in North Dakota. So what you're going to see is a big ramp up at that point in time really. So that's the biggest single driver of the trajectory other than just -- we've got cumulative higher rig activity that's going occur in the drilling this year. On the uncompleted well count, we've never had significant amount of uncompleted wells. We've got a few Johnson County wells that we'll be completing as we get into this year.

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing First Quarter 2010 Earnings and Operational Results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Effective January 1, 2010, the SEC now permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve disclosures on this conference call and webcast, including those for the South Texas, Eagle Ford, North Dakota, Bakken, Three Forks, Barnett Shale, Haynesville-Bossier and Horn River place may include potential reserves, or estimated reserves, not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference, the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our Press Release and Investor Relations page of our website.
With me this morning are Loren Leiker, Senior EVP Exploration; Gary Thomas, Senior EVP Operations; Bob Garrison EVP Exploration; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President of Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included second quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance in yesterday's press release. We remain on track to achieve 13% total company organic production growth this year, dominated by U.S. liquids production. 
I'll now review our first quarter net income and discretionary cash flow and then I'll provide some operational highlights. Tim Driggers will provide some financial details and I'll close with some macro comments and concluding remarks.
As outlined in our press release, for the first quarter, EOG reported net income of $118 million or $0.46 per share for investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP net income, to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain one-time adjustments as outlined in the press release. EOG's first quarter adjusted net income was also $118 million or $0.46 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts and focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the first quarter was $765 million. 
I'll now address a few operational results. Our report today will be brief, since it's been only a few weeks since our April 7 Analyst Conference. The bottom line is that everything is on track, consistent with the information we provided at the conference. We still expect to grow total production 13% this year, with year-over-year liquids growth of 47%. Our projected CapEx level is unchanged, and we still expect to sell $1 billion to $1.5 billion of North American gas properties by year end. Also, we're investigating joint venture possibilities for our Marcellus and Horn River Shale gas acreage. The only new data since April 7 are a series of individual well results in some of our key plays. Most of these well results simply reinforce the overall Analyst Conference theme, but one well may have particular significance. This well was in the Barnett Combo play where we've completed our best producer to date.  The Settle B #1H well began producing at a rate of 1,852 barrels of oil per day, with 3.7 million cubic feet a day of liquids rich gas and we yield reserves considerably higher than our model horizontal well. This well was significant because it was drilled in the eastern portion of the play in the 25,000 acres we had designated for vertical drilling. 
The rock quality in this 25,000-acre area is the best in the play, which is why vertical wells are economic. However, if we can replicate the Settle results with additional horizontal wells, and these 25,000 acres can be exploited at a higher ROR and reserve recovery than we projected for vertical wells, we'll soon be drilling additional horizontals here and we'll apprise you of the results later this year.
In addition to the Settle well, we've also completed a number of horizontal wells in the Barnett combo play. The Alamo #1H, #2H and #3H wells were drilled on 55-acre spacing in Montague County. The wells began producing at a combined rate of over 900 barrels of oil per day, with 2.4 million cubic feet a day, and we have 97% working interest in these wells.
Our other well results are simply further confirmations of our key oil plays. In the Eagle Ford, we've completed our 17th oil well, the Harper #4H, which IP'd at 602 barrels of oil per day with 650 Mcf of gas per day. Not only we delineated our 120-mile Eagle Ford acreage, we're going to moderate our drilling activity for a few months until we have our 3D seismic shock and interpret it. So don't expect constant Eagle Ford news flow from EOG until late this year. Remember that our analyst conference data showed we expect to average only 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the Eagle Ford this year, factoring in the lag period for the 3Ds.
We completed the Lee Senial [ph] #22-6 and Austin #23-32 wells with IP rates of 1,060 and 955 barrels of oil per day respectively. We also completed the Van Hook 11-2 well for 1,565 barrels of oil per day. In the Lite, we completed the Sidonia #18-14 and the Ross #21-4 for 719 and 604 barrels of oil per day respectively. I'll note that these reference wells are all 648-acre laterals. We're currently drilling our first 1,280 acre lateral wells to test optimization. Now that the North Dakota weather has improved, we'll be intensifying our well completion and frac operations for the next five months. 
In the midcontinent horizontal Cleveland oil play, we recently completed the Appel 438 #5H and #6H wells,  which came online for 1,000 at barrels of oil per day with 2.5 million cubic feet of gas and 840 barrels of oil per day with 1 million cubic feet of gas per day, respectively. The Cleveland is one of our hybrid oil plays. This is a conventional oil reservoir where we've applied horizontal drilling and completion technology, increasing reserves per well by a factor of four, versus vertical drilling and greatly improving the economics of the play. 
In summary, our three big horizontal plays; the Barnett Combo, Eagle Ford and Bakken, are performing as or better than expected. We don't have any new data on the Niobrara Play and it will be yearend before we can provide an intelligent assessment of the potential Niobrara reserves on our 400,000 net acres in the DJ Basin of Northeast Colorado and Southeast Wyoming.
Our gas resource plays are all performing as expected, and we don't have any other further updates since our recent conference. In terms of our Gulf of Mexico exposure, about 1% of our total North American production is from the Gulf and we are not active drillers in this area. The current hold on new drilling in the Gulf does not have any impact on our operations. 
Outside North America, we're still continuing our one-rig operation in China and this summer we'll be completing two additional wells to see if we can replicate the results of our successful first well. In Trinidad, we've had some good production history from our successful first quarter #PA-12 well, and it's flowing at a rate of 59 million cubic feet a day, with 4,000 barrels of condensate a day.
Outside of operations, another part of our 2010 business plan involves the sale of some producing natural gas assets by year-end. We're focusing on selling our Canadian shallow gas properties and will have them on the market by midyear. Also, we're in the preliminary stage of investigating joint venture partners for our Marcellus and Horn River shale gas acreage where we would retain a significant interest and continue to operate. It's not at all certain that we'll implement a JV, but at least we'll investigate it. 
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

Total acquisitions for the quarter were $16 million including contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of $3 million related to a previously-disclosed unproved property acquisition. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $61 million. 
At quarter end, total debt outstanding was $2.8 billion and the debt-to-total-capitalization ratio was 22%. At March 31, we had $230 million of cash, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $2.6 billion, for a net-debt-to-total-cap ratio of 20%. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 40%, and the deferred tax ratio was 46%. 
Yesterday, we included a guidance table with the earnings press release for the second quarter and updated full year 2010. For the full year 2010, the effective tax range is 35% to 45%. We've also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the second quarter and for the full year. 
For the full year 2010, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf change in wellhead natural gas prices is approximately $30 million for net income and $45 million for operating cash flow. For the full year 2010, EOG's price sensitivity for each $1 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil from condensate price, combined with a related change in NGL price, is approximately $22 million for net income and $33 million for operating cash flow. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Mark."

Before I summarize, I want to cover a few items on the capital side. We mentioned at our analyst conference that we plan to maintain a low debt-to-cap ratio while still achieving the high level of organic production growth over the next three years that have been laid out for you. We intend to manage the net debt-to-cap ratio to a maximum of 25% by either selling mature North American natural gas properties, generating $1 billion to $1.5 billion of pre-tax proceeds by year end 2010, or by taking in a joint venture partner on a large natural gas shale position. Taking either scenario into account with the current NYMEX strip, we should be in a free cash flow position by 2012.
I'll now provide a few macro comments, which are consistent with our April 7 presentation. Regarding oil, we're rationally bullish; both short and long-term. We recently implemented some oil hedges. For September to December 2010, we hedged 2,000 barrels of oil per day at $91.50 and for the full year of 2011, we put in place a hedge position covering 6,000 barrels of oil per day at a price just above $93. We will likely implement additional oil hedges, should the market present further opportunities. 
Regarding North American gas, we're short-term moderately bullish and long-term rather bearish. We think last week's EIA-914 downward revision was only about one-third of what we calculate, so we continue to believe the market is tighter than common perception. We'll be watching the storage build this summer to confirm or disprove our thesis. We currently have only a very small 2010 gas hedge position and don't think this is the time to be adding gas hedges.
Now, let me summarize. In my opinion, there are three points to take away from this call:  First, the individual well data points we provided today give further affirmation that our key horizontal oil plays are performing as or better than expected. Second, although we haven't walked through any individual details today, all of our gas plays are all performing as expected. And finally, our capital plan is consistent with what we articulated in detail on our April 7. 
Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A."

So we're very cognizant of the fact that the gas market has got a whole lot of gas in storage right now and the last thing we need is everybody to be drilling a zillion gas wells in North America. And so what we've done is, we've tempered, significantly, our gas drilling in all those discretionary areas such as in our Rocky Mountain gas drilling area, and we've considerably slowed down in the Barnett Shale where we've got most of our acreage vested. And so that kind of leaves us with three places where we have to drill a certain amount to hold acreage. The biggest of those is the Haynesville and then we've got the Marcellus and, to some degree, the Horn River. At this stage, we're going to stick with our plan of running roughly 11 rigs and generating that 1% to 2% North American gas production growth. I guess if gas were to fall south of $4 and we were to believe that it was just going to stay there permanently, we'd reassess that. But that's not our current view right now, Michael."

We always knew that was the best quality acreage, but it's also the most tectonically complex; a lot of thrust faults and so on and so forth. And we had success with the vertical wells and so we said well, because this is complex geology, you can't image in 3D too well there, verticals are the way to go, and they give a pretty healthy return. And then we said, well, before we just commit vast quantities to verticals, let's try horizontal and see what happens. And this horizontal well, the Settle well has turned out much, much better than, frankly, than any horizontal combo well we've drilled so far; and it's kind of startling to us. And so the game plan now is to -- we've got a lot of verticals that we've already drilled that we'll be completing and we'll expect to get the typical results there. On the horizontals, we're just going to see if we can replicate the Settle results. The horizontal wells are going to cost us about $3.5 million a well. The verticals would be, I believe, it's about $2.1 million a well. So you have to get more reserves. But, right now, based on the Settle results, if we can replicate that, there's a pretty fair chance we'll just eliminate the vertical program and go to a horizontal program. But we need to drill three or four more wells to see if the Settle is an outlier or is that a typical well we can expect in this area."

We're not going to be able to do that over in these 25,000 Cooke County acres because you've got so many thrust faults and it's just tectonically more complex. But the question is, even though we can't stay in one individual layer, is the rock quality so much better there that that offsets the fact that we'll be going through multiple layers? And it's an interesting challenge, but it's fair to say right now, none of us expected the Settle well to be as strong as it is, so we're just kind of rethinking, what's the best way to deal with it?"

And ideally, with 3D seismic, we can make future wells in the longer laterals and it should have higher reserves per well. And then the concept of what we like to do in any of these plays is pick the sweetest part of a certain zone, for example in the Eagle Ford, there's probably a 20, 30-foot section that we consider the sweetest part of the Eagle Ford. And we want to keep the lateral in there for the whole length and that's pretty hard to do without 3D seismic. So our view is that once we get the 3D seismic shot interpreted, then we can go back and start a pretty intensive drilling program. And, there's a fair chance we're going to end up with better wells than the first 17 just because we've targeted more accurately. So that's why, if you look at that graph we provided on April 7 there, as to the production growth coming out of Eagle Ford, the 2010 production growth coming out of Eagle Ford is really pretty miniscule; 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we really don't get cranked up until '12 to start showing significant production growth. So we've got that planned into our program, into our three-year volume growth side, and we never expected that we were going to have vast amounts of Eagle Ford production this year."

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing First Quarter 2010 Earnings and Operational Results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Effective January 1, 2010, the SEC now permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve disclosures on this conference call and webcast, including those for the South Texas, Eagle Ford, North Dakota, Bakken, Three Forks, Barnett Shale, Haynesville-Bossier and Horn River place may include potential reserves, or estimated reserves, not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference, the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our Press Release and Investor Relations page of our website.
With me this morning are Loren Leiker, Senior EVP Exploration; Gary Thomas, Senior EVP Operations; Bob Garrison EVP Exploration; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President of Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included second quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance in yesterday's press release. We remain on track to achieve 13% total company organic production growth this year, dominated by U.S. liquids production. 
I'll now review our first quarter net income and discretionary cash flow and then I'll provide some operational highlights. Tim Driggers will provide some financial details and I'll close with some macro comments and concluding remarks.
As outlined in our press release, for the first quarter, EOG reported net income of $118 million or $0.46 per share for investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP net income, to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain one-time adjustments as outlined in the press release. EOG's first quarter adjusted net income was also $118 million or $0.46 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts and focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the first quarter was $765 million. 
I'll now address a few operational results. Our report today will be brief, since it's been only a few weeks since our April 7 Analyst Conference. The bottom line is that everything is on track, consistent with the information we provided at the conference. We still expect to grow total production 13% this year, with year-over-year liquids growth of 47%. Our projected CapEx level is unchanged, and we still expect to sell $1 billion to $1.5 billion of North American gas properties by year end. Also, we're investigating joint venture possibilities for our Marcellus and Horn River Shale gas acreage. The only new data since April 7 are a series of individual well results in some of our key plays. Most of these well results simply reinforce the overall Analyst Conference theme, but one well may have particular significance. This well was in the Barnett Combo play where we've completed our best producer to date.  The Settle B #1H well began producing at a rate of 1,852 barrels of oil per day, with 3.7 million cubic feet a day of liquids rich gas and we yield reserves considerably higher than our model horizontal well. This well was significant because it was drilled in the eastern portion of the play in the 25,000 acres we had designated for vertical drilling. 
The rock quality in this 25,000-acre area is the best in the play, which is why vertical wells are economic. However, if we can replicate the Settle results with additional horizontal wells, and these 25,000 acres can be exploited at a higher ROR and reserve recovery than we projected for vertical wells, we'll soon be drilling additional horizontals here and we'll apprise you of the results later this year.
In addition to the Settle well, we've also completed a number of horizontal wells in the Barnett combo play. The Alamo #1H, #2H and #3H wells were drilled on 55-acre spacing in Montague County. The wells began producing at a combined rate of over 900 barrels of oil per day, with 2.4 million cubic feet a day, and we have 97% working interest in these wells.
Our other well results are simply further confirmations of our key oil plays. In the Eagle Ford, we've completed our 17th oil well, the Harper #4H, which IP'd at 602 barrels of oil per day with 650 Mcf of gas per day. Not only we delineated our 120-mile Eagle Ford acreage, we're going to moderate our drilling activity for a few months until we have our 3D seismic shock and interpret it. So don't expect constant Eagle Ford news flow from EOG until late this year. Remember that our analyst conference data showed we expect to average only 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the Eagle Ford this year, factoring in the lag period for the 3Ds.
We completed the Lee Senial [ph] #22-6 and Austin #23-32 wells with IP rates of 1,060 and 955 barrels of oil per day respectively. We also completed the Van Hook 11-2 well for 1,565 barrels of oil per day. In the Lite, we completed the Sidonia #18-14 and the Ross #21-4 for 719 and 604 barrels of oil per day respectively. I'll note that these reference wells are all 648-acre laterals. We're currently drilling our first 1,280 acre lateral wells to test optimization. Now that the North Dakota weather has improved, we'll be intensifying our well completion and frac operations for the next five months. 
In the midcontinent horizontal Cleveland oil play, we recently completed the Appel 438 #5H and #6H wells,  which came online for 1,000 at barrels of oil per day with 2.5 million cubic feet of gas and 840 barrels of oil per day with 1 million cubic feet of gas per day, respectively. The Cleveland is one of our hybrid oil plays. This is a conventional oil reservoir where we've applied horizontal drilling and completion technology, increasing reserves per well by a factor of four, versus vertical drilling and greatly improving the economics of the play. 
In summary, our three big horizontal plays; the Barnett Combo, Eagle Ford and Bakken, are performing as or better than expected. We don't have any new data on the Niobrara Play and it will be yearend before we can provide an intelligent assessment of the potential Niobrara reserves on our 400,000 net acres in the DJ Basin of Northeast Colorado and Southeast Wyoming.
Our gas resource plays are all performing as expected, and we don't have any other further updates since our recent conference. In terms of our Gulf of Mexico exposure, about 1% of our total North American production is from the Gulf and we are not active drillers in this area. The current hold on new drilling in the Gulf does not have any impact on our operations. 
Outside North America, we're still continuing our one-rig operation in China and this summer we'll be completing two additional wells to see if we can replicate the results of our successful first well. In Trinidad, we've had some good production history from our successful first quarter #PA-12 well, and it's flowing at a rate of 59 million cubic feet a day, with 4,000 barrels of condensate a day.
Outside of operations, another part of our 2010 business plan involves the sale of some producing natural gas assets by year-end. We're focusing on selling our Canadian shallow gas properties and will have them on the market by midyear. Also, we're in the preliminary stage of investigating joint venture partners for our Marcellus and Horn River shale gas acreage where we would retain a significant interest and continue to operate. It's not at all certain that we'll implement a JV, but at least we'll investigate it. 
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure.

Total acquisitions for the quarter were $16 million including contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of $3 million related to a previously-disclosed unproved property acquisition. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $61 million. 
At quarter end, total debt outstanding was $2.8 billion and the debt-to-total-capitalization ratio was 22%. At March 31, we had $230 million of cash, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $2.6 billion, for a net-debt-to-total-cap ratio of 20%. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 40%, and the deferred tax ratio was 46%. 
Yesterday, we included a guidance table with the earnings press release for the second quarter and updated full year 2010. For the full year 2010, the effective tax range is 35% to 45%. We've also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the second quarter and for the full year. 
For the full year 2010, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf change in wellhead natural gas prices is approximately $30 million for net income and $45 million for operating cash flow. For the full year 2010, EOG's price sensitivity for each $1 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil from condensate price, combined with a related change in NGL price, is approximately $22 million for net income and $33 million for operating cash flow. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Mark.

Before I summarize, I want to cover a few items on the capital side. We mentioned at our analyst conference that we plan to maintain a low debt-to-cap ratio while still achieving the high level of organic production growth over the next three years that have been laid out for you. We intend to manage the net debt-to-cap ratio to a maximum of 25% by either selling mature North American natural gas properties, generating $1 billion to $1.5 billion of pre-tax proceeds by year end 2010, or by taking in a joint venture partner on a large natural gas shale position. Taking either scenario into account with the current NYMEX strip, we should be in a free cash flow position by 2012.
I'll now provide a few macro comments, which are consistent with our April 7 presentation. Regarding oil, we're rationally bullish; both short and long-term. We recently implemented some oil hedges. For September to December 2010, we hedged 2,000 barrels of oil per day at $91.50 and for the full year of 2011, we put in place a hedge position covering 6,000 barrels of oil per day at a price just above $93. We will likely implement additional oil hedges, should the market present further opportunities. 
Regarding North American gas, we're short-term moderately bullish and long-term rather bearish. We think last week's EIA-914 downward revision was only about one-third of what we calculate, so we continue to believe the market is tighter than common perception. We'll be watching the storage build this summer to confirm or disprove our thesis. We currently have only a very small 2010 gas hedge position and don't think this is the time to be adding gas hedges.
Now, let me summarize. In my opinion, there are three points to take away from this call:  First, the individual well data points we provided today give further affirmation that our key horizontal oil plays are performing as or better than expected. Second, although we haven't walked through any individual details today, all of our gas plays are all performing as expected. And finally, our capital plan is consistent with what we articulated in detail on our April 7. 
Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A.

So we're very cognizant of the fact that the gas market has got a whole lot of gas in storage right now and the last thing we need is everybody to be drilling a zillion gas wells in North America. And so what we've done is, we've tempered, significantly, our gas drilling in all those discretionary areas such as in our Rocky Mountain gas drilling area, and we've considerably slowed down in the Barnett Shale where we've got most of our acreage vested. And so that kind of leaves us with three places where we have to drill a certain amount to hold acreage. The biggest of those is the Haynesville and then we've got the Marcellus and, to some degree, the Horn River. At this stage, we're going to stick with our plan of running roughly 11 rigs and generating that 1% to 2% North American gas production growth. I guess if gas were to fall south of $4 and we were to believe that it was just going to stay there permanently, we'd reassess that. But that's not our current view right now, Michael.

The one that's on a bit faster track is the Marcellus, and we will be looking at an organized approach to screen interested parties to look and see if we can bring someone in there. And so I would say, the Marcellus, by year end, we should have an answer as to:  Are we going to do one? And if so, what are the terms? The Horn River will be a function more of what happens to the Kitimat project. And then, the Haynesville, we have no plans at this time to even consider a JV in that particular area.

The way we look at it now, we've got two tracks to meet our capital plan. Either track should be able to do it on its own. The one is to sell some of these Canadian shallow gas properties, and get the price that we would hope. But, if the market for gas properties just utterly collapses, then the second thing would be to do the JV in the Marcellus. And by our calculations, either one of those will get us where we need to be in terms of the debt-to-cap ceiling. So at this stage, the question would be:  Theoretically, if all of our plans fail, what is going to happen? But I'd say, right now, the best thing to do is to take the process we laid out on the April 7 Analyst Conference in terms of capital plan and the volume growth, and that is currently our best case estimate as to how this thing is going to play out.

We always knew that was the best quality acreage, but it's also the most tectonically complex; a lot of thrust faults and so on and so forth. And we had success with the vertical wells and so we said well, because this is complex geology, you can't image in 3D too well there, verticals are the way to go, and they give a pretty healthy return. And then we said, well, before we just commit vast quantities to verticals, let's try horizontal and see what happens. And this horizontal well, the Settle well has turned out much, much better than, frankly, than any horizontal combo well we've drilled so far; and it's kind of startling to us. And so the game plan now is to -- we've got a lot of verticals that we've already drilled that we'll be completing and we'll expect to get the typical results there. On the horizontals, we're just going to see if we can replicate the Settle results. The horizontal wells are going to cost us about $3.5 million a well. The verticals would be, I believe, it's about $2.1 million a well. So you have to get more reserves. But, right now, based on the Settle results, if we can replicate that, there's a pretty fair chance we'll just eliminate the vertical program and go to a horizontal program. But we need to drill three or four more wells to see if the Settle is an outlier or is that a typical well we can expect in this area.

And ideally, with 3D seismic, we can make future wells in the longer laterals and it should have higher reserves per well. And then the concept of what we like to do in any of these plays is pick the sweetest part of a certain zone, for example in the Eagle Ford, there's probably a 20, 30-foot section that we consider the sweetest part of the Eagle Ford. And we want to keep the lateral in there for the whole length and that's pretty hard to do without 3D seismic. So our view is that once we get the 3D seismic shot interpreted, then we can go back and start a pretty intensive drilling program. And, there's a fair chance we're going to end up with better wells than the first 17 just because we've targeted more accurately. So that's why, if you look at that graph we provided on April 7 there, as to the production growth coming out of Eagle Ford, the 2010 production growth coming out of Eagle Ford is really pretty miniscule; 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we really don't get cranked up until '12 to start showing significant production growth. So we've got that planned into our program, into our three-year volume growth side, and we never expected that we were going to have vast amounts of Eagle Ford production this year.

And kind of offsetting that is, the rock quality in the east appears to be a little bit better than in the west. And so the point is, if we drill, particularly in the east, off of just the 2D seismic - that old 2D seismic -- there's a pretty fair chance that if we try and drill longer laterals, we're just going to cross some sort of a fault. And so, what we're doing is, particularly in the east, is we're just saying; let's just hold off a bit here -- the geology is a little bit more complex there -- until we get 3D seismic, and then we can image these fault blocks properly and decide how best to go. But probably, what's going to happen is, the average lateral length on the play, will be such that the west laterals are longer than east laterals. But in both areas, the laterals will be longer on 3D than they are, than we're capable of doing on 2D.

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing First Quarter 2010 Earnings and Operational Results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Effective January 1, 2010, the SEC now permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve disclosures on this conference call and webcast, including those for the South Texas, Eagle Ford, North Dakota, Bakken, Three Forks, Barnett Shale, Haynesville-Bossier and Horn River place may include potential reserves, or estimated reserves, not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC’s latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference, the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our Press Release and Investor Relations page of our website.
With me this morning are Loren Leiker, Senior EVP Exploration; Gary Thomas, Senior EVP Operations; Bob Garrison, EVP Exploration; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President of Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included second quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance in yesterday's press release. We remain on track to achieve 13% total company organic production growth this year, dominated by U.S. liquids production. 
I'll now review our first quarter net income and discretionary cash flow and then I'll provide some operational highlights. Tim Driggers will provide some financial details and I'll close with some macro comments and concluding remarks.
As outlined in our press release, for the first quarter, EOG reported net income of $118 million or $0.46 per share for investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP net income, to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain one-time adjustments as outlined in the press release. EOG's first quarter adjusted net income was also $118 million or $0.46 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts and focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the first quarter was $765 million. 
I'll now address a few operational results. Our report today will be brief, since it's been only a few weeks since our April 7 Analyst Conference. The bottom line is that everything is on track, consistent with the information we provided at the conference. We still expect to grow total production 13% this year, with year-over-year liquids growth of 47%. Our projected CapEx level is unchanged, and we still expect to sell $1 billion to $1.5 billion of North American gas properties by year end. Also, we're investigating joint venture possibilities for our Marcellus and Horn River Shale gas acreage. The only new data since April 7 are a series of individual well results in some of our key plays. Most of these well results simply reinforce the overall Analyst Conference theme, but one well may have particular significance. This well was in the Barnett Combo play where we've completed our best producer to date. The Settle B #1H well began producing at a rate of 1,852 barrels of oil per day, with 3.7 million cubic feet a day of liquids rich gas and we yield reserves considerably higher than our model horizontal well. This well was significant because it was drilled in the eastern portion of the play in the 25,000 acres we had designated for vertical drilling. 
The rock quality in this 25,000-acre area is the best in the play, which is why vertical wells are economic. However, if we can replicate the Settle results with additional horizontal wells, and these 25,000 acres can be exploited at a higher ROR and reserve recovery than we projected for vertical wells, we'll soon be drilling additional horizontals here and we'll apprise you of the results later this year.
In addition to the Settle well, we’ve also completed a number of horizontal wells in the Barnett combo play. The Alamo #1H, #2H and #3H wells were drilled on 55-acre spacing in Montague County. The wells began producing at a combined rate of over 900 barrels of oil per day, with 2.4 million cubic feet a day, and we have 97% working interest in these wells.
Our other well results are simply further confirmations of our key oil plays. In the Eagle Ford, we've completed our 17th oil well, the Harper #4H, which IP'd at 602 barrels of oil per day with 650 Mcf of gas per day. Not only we delineated our 120-mile Eagle Ford acreage, we're going to moderate our drilling activity for a few months until we have our 3D seismic shocked and interpreted. So don't expect constant Eagle Ford news flow from EOG until late this year. Remember that our analyst conference data showed we expect to average only 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the Eagle Ford this year, factoring in the lag period for the 3Ds.
We completed the Leesfield [ph] #22-6 and Austin #23-32 wells with IP rates of 1,060 and 955 barrels of oil per day respectively. We also completed the Van Hook 11-2 well for 1,565 barrels of oil per day. In the Lite, we completed the Sidonia #18-14 and the Ross #21-4 for 719 and 604 barrels of oil per day respectively. I'll note that these referenced wells are all 640-acre laterals. We're currently drilling our first 1,280-acre lateral wells to test optimization. Now that the North Dakota weather has improved, we’ll be intensifying our well completion and frac operations for the next five months. 
In the midcontinent horizontal Cleveland oil play, we recently completed the Appel 438 #5H and #6H wells, which came online for 1,000 at barrels of oil per day with 2 1/2 million cubic feet of gas and 840 barrels of oil per day with 1 million cubic feet of gas per day, respectively. The Cleveland is one of our hybrid oil plays. This is a conventional oil reservoir where we’ve applied horizontal drilling and completion technology, increasing reserves per well by a factor of four versus vertical drilling and greatly improving the economics of the play. 
In summary, our three big horizontal plays, the Barnett Combo, Eagle Ford and Bakken, are performing as or better than expected. We don't have any new data on the Niobrara Play and it will be year end before we can provide an intelligent assessment of the potential Niobrara reserves on our 400,000 net acres in the DJ Basin of Northeast Colorado and Southeast Wyoming.
Our gas resource plays are all performing as expected, and we don't have any other further updates since our recent conference. In terms of our Gulf of Mexico exposure, about 1% of our total North American production is from the Gulf and we are not active drillers in this area. The current hold on new drilling in the Gulf does not have any impact on our operations. 
Outside North America, we're still continuing our one-rig operation in China and this summer we'll be completing two additional wells to see if we can replicate the results of our successful first well. In Trinidad, we've had some good production history from our successful first quarter PA-12 well, and it's flowing at a rate of 59 million cubic feet a day with 4,000 barrels of condensate per day.
Outside of operations, another part of our 2010 business plan involves the sale of some producing natural gas assets by year end. We're focusing on selling our Canadian shallow gas properties and will have them on the market by midyear. Also, we're in the preliminary stage of investigating joint venture partners for our Marcellus and Horn River shale gas acreage where we would retain a significant interest and continue to operate. It's not at all certain that we'll implement a JV, but at least we’ll investigate it. 
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

We intend to manage the net debt-to-cap ratio to a maximum of 25% by either selling mature North American natural gas properties, generating $1 billion to $1.5 billion of pre-tax proceeds by year end 2010, or by taking in a joint venture partner on a large natural gas shale position. Taking either scenario into account with the current NYMEX strip, we should be in a free cash flow position by 2012.
I'll now provide a few macro comments, which are consistent with our April 7 presentation. Regarding oil, we're rationally bullish; both short and long-term. We recently implemented some oil hedges. For September to December 2010, we hedged 2,000 barrels of oil per day at $91.50 and for the full year of 2011, we put in place a hedge position covering 6,000 barrels of oil per day at a price just above $93. We will likely implement additional oil hedges, should the market present further opportunities. 
Regarding North American gas, we're short-term moderately bullish and long-term rather bearish. We think last week's EIA-914 downward revision was only about one-third of what we calculate, so we continue to believe the market is tighter than common perception. We'll be watching the storage build this summer to confirm or disprove our thesis. We currently have only a very small 2010 gas hedge position and don't think this is the time to be adding gas hedges.
Now, let me summarize. In my opinion, there are three points to take away from this call:  First, the individual well data points we provided today give further affirmation that our key horizontal oil plays are performing as or better than expected. Second, although we haven't walked through any individual details today, all of our gas plays are all performing as expected. And finally, our capital plan is consistent with what we articulated in detail on our April 7. 
Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A."

So we're very cognizant of the fact that the gas market has got a whole lot of gas in storage right now and the last thing we need is everybody to be drilling a zillion gas wells in North America. And so what we've done is, we've tempered, significantly, our gas drilling in all those discretionary areas such as in our Rocky Mountain gas drilling area, and we've considerably slowed down in the Barnett Shale where we've got most of our acreage vested. And so that kind of leaves us with three places where we have to drill a certain amount to hold acreage. The biggest of those is the Haynesville and then we've got the Marcellus and, to some degree, the Horn River. At this stage, we're going to stick with our plan of running roughly 11 rigs and generating that 1% to 2% North American gas production growth. I guess if gas were to fall south of $4 and we were to believe that it was just going to stay there permanently, we'd reassess that. But that's not our current view right now, Michael."

We always knew that was the best quality acreage, but it's also the most tectonically complex; a lot of thrust faults and so on and so forth. And we had success with the vertical wells and so we said well, because this is complex geology, you can't image in 3D too well there, verticals are the way to go, and they give a pretty healthy return. And then we said, well, before we just commit vast quantities to verticals, let's try horizontal and see what happens. And this horizontal well, the Settle well has turned out much, much better than, frankly, than any horizontal combo well we’ve drilled so far; and it's kind of startling to us. And so the game plan now is to -- we've got a lot of verticals that we've already drilled that we'll be completing and we’ll expect to get the typical results there. On the horizontals, we're just going to see if we can replicate the Settle results. The horizontal wells are going to cost us about $3.5 million a well. The verticals would be, I believe, it’s about $2.1 million a well. So you have to get more reserves. But, right now, based on the Settle results, if we can replicate that, there's a pretty fair chance we'll just eliminate the vertical program and go to a horizontal program. But we need to drill three or four more wells to see if the Settle is an outlier or is that a typical well we can expect in this area."

So that's why, if you look at that graph we provided on April 7 there, as to the production growth coming out of Eagle Ford, the 2010 production growth coming out of Eagle Ford is really pretty miniscule; 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we really don't get cranked up until '12 to start showing significant production growth. So we've got that planned into our program, into our three-year volume growth side, and we never expected that we were going to have vast amounts of Eagle Ford production this year."

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing First Quarter 2010 Earnings and Operational Results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Effective January 1, 2010, the SEC now permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve disclosures on this conference call and webcast, including those for the South Texas, Eagle Ford, North Dakota, Bakken, Three Forks, Barnett Shale, Haynesville-Bossier and Horn River place may include potential reserves, or estimated reserves, not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC’s latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference, the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our Press Release and Investor Relations page of our website.
With me this morning are Loren Leiker, Senior EVP Exploration; Gary Thomas, Senior EVP Operations; Bob Garrison, EVP Exploration; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President of Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included second quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance in yesterday's press release. We remain on track to achieve 13% total company organic production growth this year, dominated by U.S. liquids production. 
I'll now review our first quarter net income and discretionary cash flow and then I'll provide some operational highlights. Tim Driggers will provide some financial details and I'll close with some macro comments and concluding remarks.
As outlined in our press release, for the first quarter, EOG reported net income of $118 million or $0.46 per share for investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP net income, to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain one-time adjustments as outlined in the press release. EOG's first quarter adjusted net income was also $118 million or $0.46 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts and focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the first quarter was $765 million. 
I'll now address a few operational results. Our report today will be brief, since it's been only a few weeks since our April 7 Analyst Conference. The bottom line is that everything is on track, consistent with the information we provided at the conference. We still expect to grow total production 13% this year, with year-over-year liquids growth of 47%. Our projected CapEx level is unchanged, and we still expect to sell $1 billion to $1.5 billion of North American gas properties by year end. Also, we're investigating joint venture possibilities for our Marcellus and Horn River Shale gas acreage. The only new data since April 7 are a series of individual well results in some of our key plays. Most of these well results simply reinforce the overall Analyst Conference theme, but one well may have particular significance. This well was in the Barnett Combo play where we've completed our best producer to date. The Settle B #1H well began producing at a rate of 1,852 barrels of oil per day, with 3.7 million cubic feet a day of liquids rich gas and we yield reserves considerably higher than our model horizontal well. This well was significant because it was drilled in the eastern portion of the play in the 25,000 acres we had designated for vertical drilling. 
The rock quality in this 25,000-acre area is the best in the play, which is why vertical wells are economic. However, if we can replicate the Settle results with additional horizontal wells, and these 25,000 acres can be exploited at a higher ROR and reserve recovery than we projected for vertical wells, we'll soon be drilling additional horizontals here and we'll apprise you of the results later this year.
In addition to the Settle well, we’ve also completed a number of horizontal wells in the Barnett combo play. The Alamo #1H, #2H and #3H wells were drilled on 55-acre spacing in Montague County. The wells began producing at a combined rate of over 900 barrels of oil per day, with 2.4 million cubic feet a day, and we have 97% working interest in these wells.
Our other well results are simply further confirmations of our key oil plays. In the Eagle Ford, we've completed our 17th oil well, the Harper #4H, which IP'd at 602 barrels of oil per day with 650 Mcf of gas per day. Not only we delineated our 120-mile Eagle Ford acreage, we're going to moderate our drilling activity for a few months until we have our 3D seismic shocked and interpreted. So don't expect constant Eagle Ford news flow from EOG until late this year. Remember that our analyst conference data showed we expect to average only 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the Eagle Ford this year, factoring in the lag period for the 3Ds.
We completed the Leesfield [ph] #22-6 and Austin #23-32 wells with IP rates of 1,060 and 955 barrels of oil per day respectively. We also completed the Van Hook 11-2 well for 1,565 barrels of oil per day. In the Lite, we completed the Sidonia #18-14 and the Ross #21-4 for 719 and 604 barrels of oil per day respectively. I'll note that these referenced wells are all 640-acre laterals. We're currently drilling our first 1,280-acre lateral wells to test optimization. Now that the North Dakota weather has improved, we’ll be intensifying our well completion and frac operations for the next five months. 
In the midcontinent horizontal Cleveland oil play, we recently completed the Appel 438 #5H and #6H wells, which came online for 1,000 at barrels of oil per day with 2 1/2 million cubic feet of gas and 840 barrels of oil per day with 1 million cubic feet of gas per day, respectively. The Cleveland is one of our hybrid oil plays. This is a conventional oil reservoir where we’ve applied horizontal drilling and completion technology, increasing reserves per well by a factor of four versus vertical drilling and greatly improving the economics of the play. 
In summary, our three big horizontal plays, the Barnett Combo, Eagle Ford and Bakken, are performing as or better than expected. We don't have any new data on the Niobrara Play and it will be year end before we can provide an intelligent assessment of the potential Niobrara reserves on our 400,000 net acres in the DJ Basin of Northeast Colorado and Southeast Wyoming.
Our gas resource plays are all performing as expected, and we don't have any other further updates since our recent conference. In terms of our Gulf of Mexico exposure, about 1% of our total North American production is from the Gulf and we are not active drillers in this area. The current hold on new drilling in the Gulf does not have any impact on our operations. 
Outside North America, we're still continuing our one-rig operation in China and this summer we'll be completing two additional wells to see if we can replicate the results of our successful first well. In Trinidad, we've had some good production history from our successful first quarter PA-12 well, and it's flowing at a rate of 59 million cubic feet a day with 4,000 barrels of condensate per day.
Outside of operations, another part of our 2010 business plan involves the sale of some producing natural gas assets by year end. We're focusing on selling our Canadian shallow gas properties and will have them on the market by midyear. Also, we're in the preliminary stage of investigating joint venture partners for our Marcellus and Horn River shale gas acreage where we would retain a significant interest and continue to operate. It's not at all certain that we'll implement a JV, but at least we’ll investigate it. 
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

For the first quarter 2010, total exploration and development expenditures were $1.1 billion excluding asset retirement obligations. Total acquisitions for the quarter were $16 million including contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of $3 million related to a previously disclosed unproved property acquisition. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $61 million. 
At quarter end, total debt outstanding was $2.8 billion and the debt-to-total-capitalization ratio was 22%. At March 31, we had $230 million of cash, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $2.6 billion, for a net-debt-to-total-cap ratio of 20%. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 40%, and the deferred tax ratio was 46%. 
Yesterday, we included a guidance table with the earnings press release for the second quarter and updated full year 2010. For the full year 2010, the effective tax range is 35% to 45%. We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the second quarter and for the full year. 
For the full year 2010, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf change in wellhead natural gas prices is approximately $30 million for net income and $45 million for operating cash flow. For the full year 2010, EOG's price sensitivity for each $1 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil from condensate price, combined with a related change in NGL price, is approximately $22 million for net income and $33 million for operating cash flow.

Before I summarize, I want to cover a few items on the capital side. We mentioned at our analyst conference that we plan to maintain a low debt-to-cap ratio while still achieving the high level of organic production growth over the next three years that have been laid out for you. We intend to manage the net debt-to-cap ratio to a maximum of 25% by either selling mature North American natural gas properties, generating $1 billion to $1.5 billion of pre-tax proceeds by year end 2010, or by taking in a joint venture partner on a large natural gas shale position. Taking either scenario into account with the current NYMEX strip, we should be in a free cash flow position by 2012.
I'll now provide a few macro comments, which are consistent with our April 7 presentation. Regarding oil, we're rationally bullish; both short and long-term. We recently implemented some oil hedges. For September to December 2010, we hedged 2,000 barrels of oil per day at $91.50 and for the full year of 2011, we put in place a hedge position covering 6,000 barrels of oil per day at a price just above $93. We will likely implement additional oil hedges, should the market present further opportunities. 
Regarding North American gas, we're short-term moderately bullish and long-term rather bearish. We think last week's EIA-914 downward revision was only about one-third of what we calculate, so we continue to believe the market is tighter than common perception. We'll be watching the storage build this summer to confirm or disprove our thesis. We currently have only a very small 2010 gas hedge position and don't think this is the time to be adding gas hedges.
Now, let me summarize. In my opinion, there are three points to take away from this call:  First, the individual well data points we provided today give further affirmation that our key horizontal oil plays are performing as or better than expected. Second, although we haven't walked through any individual details today, all of our gas plays are all performing as expected. And finally, our capital plan is consistent with what we articulated in detail on our April 7. 
Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A."

And so what we've done is, we've tempered, significantly, our gas drilling in all those discretionary areas such as in our Rocky Mountain gas drilling area, and we've considerably slowed down in the Barnett Shale where we've got most of our acreage vested. And so that kind of leaves us with three places where we have to drill a certain amount to hold acreage. The biggest of those is the Haynesville and then we've got the Marcellus and, to some degree, the Horn River. At this stage, we're going to stick with our plan of running roughly 11 rigs and generating that 1% to 2% North American gas production growth. I guess if gas were to fall south of $4 and we were to believe that it was just going to stay there permanently, we'd reassess that. But that's not our current view right now, Michael."

And we had success with the vertical wells and so we said well, because this is complex geology, you can't image in 3D too well there, verticals are the way to go, and they give a pretty healthy return. And then we said, well, before we just commit vast quantities to verticals, let's try horizontal and see what happens. And this horizontal well, the Settle well has turned out much, much better than, frankly, than any horizontal combo well we’ve drilled so far; and it's kind of startling to us. And so the game plan now is to -- we've got a lot of verticals that we've already drilled that we'll be completing and we’ll expect to get the typical results there. On the horizontals, we're just going to see if we can replicate the Settle results. The horizontal wells are going to cost us about $3.5 million a well. The verticals would be, I believe, it’s about $2.1 million a well. So you have to get more reserves. But, right now, based on the Settle results, if we can replicate that, there's a pretty fair chance we'll just eliminate the vertical program and go to a horizontal program.

And ideally, with 3D seismic, we can make future wells in the longer laterals and it should have higher reserves per well. And then the concept of what we like to do in any of these plays is pick the sweetest part of a certain zone, for example in the Eagle Ford, there’s probably a 20, 30-foot section that we consider the sweetest part of the Eagle Ford. And we want to keep the lateral in there for the whole length and that's pretty hard to do without 3D seismic. So our view is that once we get the 3D seismic shot interpreted, then we can go back and start a pretty intensive drilling program. And, there's a fair chance we're going to end up with better wells than the first 17 just because we've targeted more accurately. So that's why, if you look at that graph we provided on April 7 there, as to the production growth coming out of Eagle Ford, the 2010 production growth coming out of Eagle Ford is really pretty miniscule; 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we really don't get cranked up until '12 to start showing significant production growth. So we've got that planned into our program, into our three-year volume growth side, and we never expected that we were going to have vast amounts of Eagle Ford production this year."

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing second quarter 2010 earnings and operational results. 
This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. 
This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. 
Effective January 1, 2010, the SEC now permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve disclosures on this conference call and webcast, including those for the South Texas Eagle Ford, Barnett Shale and New Mexico Leonard plays may include potential reserves or estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC’s latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate, by reference, the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page in our website. 
With me this morning are Loren Leiker, Senior EVP, Exploration; Gary Thomas, Senior EVP, Operations; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included third quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance in yesterday's press release. We're still on track to deliver 13% total company organic production growth this year.
Our shift to a higher liquid ratio is proceeding as planned, and as with the first quarter in EOG's history where liquid revenues exceeded gas revenues. As we reported in our April analyst conference, production will increase every quarter this year, giving us strong momentum going into 2011. 
I'll now review our second quarter net income and discretionary cash flow, and then I'll provide operational highlights and discuss our capital structure. Tim Driggers will provide some financial details, and I'll close with comments regarding our macro hydrocarbon view in concluding remarks.
As outlined in our press release, for the second quarter, EOG reported net income of $59.9 million or $0.24 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain onetime adjustments as outlined in the press release, EOG's second quarter adjusted net income was $44.9 million or $0.18 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the second quarter was $656.2 million.
I'll now address operational results, and we have plenty of good news to report. Perhaps the two biggest new items were our New Mexico Leonard Shale horizontal oil discovery and the results from some of the best wells ever completed in the Haynesville Shale. 
In Southeastern New Mexico, we've been working over a year on our Red Hills area, Leonard Shale play, and our first horizontal well now has a 300-day production history. I'll note that the Leonard may also be called the Upper Bone Spring or Avalon Shale, as there are some industry variance in terminology. 
We now feel we have reserve potential of 65 million barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty reserves on 31,000 of the 120,000 net acres we have in the play, which completed seven horizontal and four vertical wells, and we believe typical for well reserves for horizontal wells or about 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty for $6.5 million well costs, which yields a 40% direct after-tax reinvestment rate of return using NYMEX future prices. 
Typical wells are at Lomas Rojas 26 #1H and #2H, which tested at 710 barrels of oil per day with 1.7 million cubic feet of rich natural gas, and 800 barrels of oil per day with 1.5 million cubic feet of rich natural gas, respectively. We have 100% working interest in these wells.
We're currently testing other portions of our 120,000 acres and we'll have results before year end. I'll note that the production stream from this accumulation is analogous to our Barnett Combo play, since 1/3 of the production is crude oil, 1/3 is NGLs and 1/3 is residue gas. This play is just starting up. It will be late 2011 before we see a substantial production contribution from this asset.
Moving to the Haynesville. During our April analyst conference, we advised that we delineated a new core area in Nacogdoches and San Augustine Counties in East Texas. Our most recent well results certainly confirm this. Our Murray #1H well have reached 25 million cubic feet a day of natural gas for the first 30 days, and the Crane #26-1H well average 27 million cubic feet a day for the same period. We have 96% working interest in those wells. 
Also in East Texas, at 49% working interest, Walter #1H well IPed at 21 million cubic feet a day. We believe the Murray and Crane Wells are two of the top three Haynesville wells completed anywhere in the Louisiana or Texas trend today.
We continue to limit our flow rates in the Haynesville to manage pressure drawn out of the reservoir, and these two wells were also limited by short-term pipeline constraints. Fortunately, a significant portion of our 160,000 Haynesville and Bossier net acres are in this Texas sweet spot. In our April analyst meeting, we also noted that the Bossier Shale was a separate target, and our recent 100% working interest Red River 5#3H confirms our view, testing at 15.2 million cubic feet a day with 6,750 psi flowing tubing pressure.
After several months of production, our Bossier wells appear to be as good as our Haynesville wells. Overall, we're extremely pleased with both our Haynesville and Bossier results, and this play will be the main driver to make up for the gas volumes being divested in our anticipated Canadian shallow gas property sale.
I'll now provide more color regarding four of our horizontal oil plays: the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Barnett Combo and Niobrara. In the Eagle Ford, we're continuing to get consistent results. We're currently drilling with only a moderate activity level until we get all of our 3D seismic shot interpreted. Also, our activity in this area has been constrained by the lack of frac equipment. I'll note that we've previously dealt with similar problems and equipment availability issues in the Barnett, and we created a proactive unique solution there and we'll do so again in the Eagle Ford.
Completion results we've noted this quarter, some of which we've articulated in our press release, indicate a consistent 120-mile-long accumulation with per well reserves similar to that outlined in analyst conference. Typical well completions are the Darlene #2H, Coalic 1H and Hoff 7H wells, which IPed at 1,033, 1,002 and 625 barrels of oil per day, respectively. The recently completed, the Borgfeld #1H and #2H wells, these are our first wells in Wilson County for 707 and 836 barrels of oil per day, respectively. We have 100% working interest in these wells. 
To date, we drilled and completed 31 wells in the Eagle Ford. We currently have 25 wells waiting on completion, which will contribute to the second half oil growth this year. We're currently running five rigs and we'll ramp up to 12 by year end.
One measure of the intensity of our future Eagle Ford development is that we plan to drill 245 gross wells in 2011 compared to 111 wells this year. The same story of consistent results holds true in our Bakken play. We have 12 rigs running there at a typical per well reserves for both the Core and the Lite are similar to those previously provided. Two recent Core wells, the Van-Hook 7-23H and Fertile 37-07H came online at 2,525 and 1,654 barrels of oil per day. We have 64% working interest in the Van-Hook well. That's a correction for the 99% we noted in our press release, and we have 81% working interest in the Fertile well.
A few days ago, we also completed the Van-Hook 8-36 well for 2,100 barrels of oil per day, which will contribute to third quarter volumes. Another note is the three recent wells on the western part of our acreage near the Montana state line, our Round Prairie, Carat and Hardscrabble wells, recently tested at rates that are typical over Bakken Lite wells, giving us greater confidence in the western extent of our acreage spread. This year, we plan to drill 42 Core wells, 57 Lite and 18 Three Forks wells. We'll also be drilling some longer reach laterals and will have results by year end. We are still early in drilling 1,280 acre space wells. 
A recent Eastern 1,280 space lateral is Palamo 2-18, which tested at 1,036 barrels of oil per day. In the Barnett Combo play, we're operating 14 rigs and our typical horizontal results are characterized by the Murray #1H well, which tested at 452 barrels of oil per day, with 2 million cubic feet of rich gas, and the Break 2H, which tested at 528 barrels of oil per day with 2 million cubic feet of rich gas. The King #1H and Olden B#1H wells were outlined in the press release and tested at 344 with 2.5 million cubic feet of gas, and 323 barrels of oil per day with 1.7 million cubic feet of gas. The Alamo B#6H well is still cleaning up and is producing 500 barrels of oil per day. 
We've expanded our definition of the Core Combo from the previous 125,000 net acres to 150,000 net acres based on recent drilling results. In all areas of the Combo, except the East, our results were similar to our models. On the last quarter's call, I noted outstanding results from the Settle B# 1H well, which was a horizontal drilled in the 25,000-acre eastern portion of our play previously designated for vertical exploitation. After producing this well for three months, we estimate it will produce 260,000 barrels of oil, 412,000 barrels of NGLs and three Bcf, net after royalty, in residue gas or 1.1 million barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty, for a $4 million well costs, and a greater than 100% direct after-tax reinvestment rate of return.
These reserves are considerably higher than our model well estimates. Additionally, results from our second horizontal in this same area, the Richardson #3H, seem positive, is a 325 barrel oil per day restricted rate while still cleaning up after frac. Additionally, or accordingly, we've changed our 2010 Combo program toward more horizontals and less verticals in the eastern area. Our original plan was 126 horizontal and 120 vertical wells. Now it's 200 horizontals and 34 vertical wells. This switch from verticals to horizontals, with 100% rate of return, will likely increase the overall oil ore of the Combo play. I'll also note that we currently have several large multi-well patterns on after frac flowback, and we expect to see a significant increase in our Combo production in the second half.
We also have some new data on our Colorado Niobrara play. We've completed two additional wells, the Critter Creek #02-03H and #04-09H, and they're producing at managed restricted rates of 570 and 600 barrels of oil per day, respectively. We have 100% working interest here. We have four rigs running in this play. But as we've previously stated, we want to observe production from these and earlier wells until year end, before we make a reserve estimate because the reservoir is heavily fractured. In Southwest Kansas, we also recently completed two nice shallow vertical wells with 100% working interest. The Cynthia 35-1 IPed at 1,700 barrels of oil per day, and the Brookover 8-2 well IPed at 260 barrels of oil per day. Several offsets to these wells are planned for the second half of the year.
Returning to our natural gas assets, we're continuing to have good results in the Barnett gas window. We're running two rigs in the Barnett gas area and recently completed six more unit wells in Tarrant County with an average IP of 7.5 million cubic feet a day each, with 68% working interest. Our all-in total Barnett gas finding cost year-to-date is $1.48 per Mcf.
In the Horn River Basin, we're completing 11 wells from our winter drilling program and anticipate having flow results on next quarter's call. In conjunction with Apache, we're making steady progress with Kitimat LNG, although we are still early into our project. The key to this project is securing an oil index LNG contract, and we're in the preliminary stages of discussions with potential off-takers.
In summary, all our North American operations are proceeding as expected, but we've had recent upsides in the New Mexico Leonard Shale, the Eastern portion of the Barnett Combo and the Texas Haynesville. Outside North America, our Trinidad asset is currently in a producing node. We plan to begin development drilling in the Toucan field during the fourth quarter. In China, we've completed a second horizontal gas well, and it's performing okay, but not as good as our first well. By year end, we'll have completed two more gas wells and one oil well, and we can assess the overall program.
Outside of operations, another part of our business plan this year involves the sale of some producing natural gas assets and some horizontal shale gas and oil acreage that we are looking to close by year end. This one encompass two separate packages. The first consists of Canadian shallow gas production of 170 million cubic feet of equivalents per day, which was put on the market two weeks ago. The second package will consist of 180,000 acres of domestic horizontal shale gas acreage in the Marcellus and Haynesville, and some rich gas and crude oil acreage in the Eagle Ford. We considered the JV related to this acreage, but instead decided on an outright sale because it's cleaner and less complicated. This acreage package is larger than we've contemplated three months ago. We spent about $1.7 billion over the last few years accumulating first mover horizontal shale acreage, and frankly, we have more good acreage now we can say grace over, given our manpower and capital structure plans. So we're going to monetize a bit in this acreage. Our intention is to close these sales by your end, and maintain a year end net debt-to-cap ratio of 25% or less for 2010 through 2012.
You'll note that our estimated CapEx for this year has increased $500 million from prior estimates, primarily because of higher frac cost and the increased number of production facilities, particularly in the Eagle Ford. All of this incremental CapEx is related to oil projects, roughly 270 of the incremental $500 million is due to EOG installing oil facilities that we previously plan to have a third-party midstream company installed. We did this because of timing and cost issues. Even with this higher CapEx, we expect to maintain a year end net debt-to-cap ratio of 25% or less. I'll note that the potential sale of a small portion of our Eagle Ford acreage doesn't affect our 900 million barrel of oil equivalent, net after royalty, captured reserve estimate we previously provided.
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $55 million. 
At quarter end, total long-term debt was $3.7 billion, and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 27%. At June 30, we had $650 million of cash, getting us non-GAAP net debt of $3.1 billion or net debt to total cap ratio of 23%. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 46%, and the deferred tax ratio was negative 24%.
Yesterday, with the earnings press release, we included a guidance table for the third quarter and updated full year 2010. For the full year 2010, the effective tax range is 40% to 50%. This higher range is due to the impact of international operations. We've also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the third quarter and for the full year.
Transportation costs exceeded the second quarter guidance that we have provided, due to the impact of several firm transportation contracts in the North Dakota accrued by rail project. These marketing arrangements generally ensure more reliable markets and better prices for our products. During the second quarter, we had better realizations for both U.S. gas and U.S. crude oil. We sold our U.S. gas at a premium to Henry Hub during the second quarter. For the Bakken crude that is being shipped to Cushing by rail, we are realizing full WTI at Cushing. 
Now I'll turn it back to Mark."

Regarding oil, we continue to be, what I'll call, rationally bullish, both short and long term. I'll note that 2010 global oil demand is currently expected to be 86 million barrels a day, the same level as in 2008. So oil demand has recovered from the global recession faster than almost anybody had predicted. The demand mix, of course, has changed, where China, India and the Middle East are bigger drivers than the OECD. Barring a doubled-dip recession will likely outlook for future oil prices. We have a small amount of oil hedged in the fourth quarter and have 6,000 barrels of oil a day hedged at $93.18 for 2011. 
North American gas, however, is more opaque. One hopeful sign is that recent U.S. storage has been filling at a net 2.6 Bcf a day lower rate than last year. Since May 1, we've injected 244 Bcf less over 91-day period. Additionally, Canadian storage has swung 128 Bcf year-over-year, or 1.4 Bcf per day during the same period. Combined, this is a four Bcf a day storage tightening year-over-year since May 1. This may be due to either hot weather, strengthening industrial demand or supply declines. 
We're also encouraged by the last two EIA-914 report showing flat production, which matches our internal models. We continue to be moderately bullish regarding short-term gas prices. We currently have 150 MMBtu per day hedged for 2011 at an average $5.44 price and 100 million BTU per day hedged for 2012 at an average of $5.44.
Now let me summarize. In my opinion, there are two points to take away from this call. First, our conversion from a natural gas weighted to an oil weighted North American company is proceeding very well. All of our oil plays are performing similarly to what was presented in our April Analyst Conference, and we've now added a new Leonard Shale play. You'll recall that in our April conference, we specifically noted that our oil production growth would be lumpy and not in a straight line quarter-to-quarter and that's exactly what is occurring.
This is the nature of the development of these horizontal assets for maximum reserve recovery, whereby we drill and complete a group of five to 15 wells together before bringing any of them to sales. I'll also note that as other E&P companies have subsequently proclaimed themselves to be liquids rich, the distinction between crude oil and lower-valued NGLs since to have been blurred. 
To recap, our acreage in Eagle Ford, Bakken and the Niobrara, our crude oil perspective with minimum NGLs, or the Barnett Combo and Leonard plays, provide both crude oil and NGLs. Although we have some associated NGL growth, overall, our program is dominated by crude oil growth, specifically, we expect roughly 75% of our 2010, '11 and '12 liquids production to be crude oil and condensate and 25% to be NGLs. 
And then our second closing point is that our capital plan is on track and consistent with that articulated at our Analyst Conference. Our intention is to shift this company to an oil mix organically, while maintaining a low debt level. 
Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A."

There are two issues going on currently in the States and specifically in a place such as the Eagle Ford. One is just the availability of profit, whether that's sand, resin-coated sand or some kind of intermediates casing profit. There's a very, very tight market. And then the second thing is just the availability of pumping services, if you will. And although the service companies are expanding their unit of pumping services and it's probably going to lag the system a bit. And so we're going to address both of the issues, the profit and the pumping services in a way that we believe is going to give us a long-term cost advantage, but we don't want to go with a lot of specificity at this juncture. But our view is, we did a similar thing in the Barnett because we have very significant gas and, of course, the Combo liquids reserves. And we're talking about close to 1 billion barrels at the Eagle Ford, and so we're gearing up for something very long term and very permanent kind of a solution."

So they're all bunched together in what we call the Hereford prospect, that 100,000 acres of our total of 400,000 acres. So they're on 640 spacing currently. We're testing some closer spacing in there right now. Regarding your second question about why we avoided Silo, as we said at the analyst conference, we have mapped that whole basin and try to understand where the geologic sweet spots were, and actually, Silo mapped up as a geologic sweet spot. But we felt it was already fairly well developed, although there are possible extensions to that field, down spacing to that field. But we did not focus our leasing efforts there, because we felt like most of them is already HBP, and we, instead, [indiscernible] in the other sweet spots that we had met. Relative the other oil plays, the big question we have here is, what is the contribution from the flow that we're getting from fractures versus matrix? And really, we have not much to update you on from the analyst conference. We still are looking at production. We're watching how fast pressure declines with production and trying to understand, are we seeing matrix kick in or not. We think we're seeing some positive indications on some and not on others. It's just too soon to tell. What we believe is it'll take the rest of this year. They're closely monitoring these wells and wells that we'll be drilling between now and then to really understand, is it going to be a very, very large play that includes matrix contribution? Or is it simply going to be strong economic good rate of return play but with less overall reserves because we have two space it at maybe 640s or 320s, instead of 163. So that's the big question we're trying to deal with right now. We are testing a lot of different kinds of completions and proppants and spacing and trying to understand what we can do to enhance matrix contribution, but it really is too soon to tell."

So I'd say, overall, we're still cautious. We don't want to proclaim victory but we're getting a little more positive feeling than we had three months ago, particularly in observation of the Jake and Elmer wells, since those wells have a little longer line.

What we really did, we made kind of a choice in the company, and we said, okay, we've got a plethora of acreage and whether it's on these shale gas plays or the oil plays. And for us, to properly address all that acreage, we would have to be running in 2011 and '12 well over 100 drilling rigs. And we would be, I would say, as a company, a little bit out of control in terms of optimally managing those 100-plus drilling rigs. And we could do it and they will be great, but it's a bit of an uncomfortable position. So what we decided to do is, we said, ""What do we really need to hit those growth targets that we've put out there for 2011, '12 and go forward? And do we really want to try and be in a little more controlled environment as far as our operational environment and maybe monetize a bit of this acreage?""

It's more -- it's basically going to be just an expansion drive reservoir there. But again, it's early days in terms of Eagle Ford. I'd tell our staff that if one of the big integrated companies had essentially 1 billion barrel oil discovery somewhere, they would probably have 200 technical people assigned to only that project. And we certainly don't have 200 technical people assigned to this essentially 1 billion barrel project. And so I'd say, we've got it identified as far as length, width, pretty darn well, but there's a lot of other things that we're going to be working on and just kind of try to optimize. So what is the right spacing here? Where is the right location that we can drill a well in this? In some portions, you have two targets perhaps, upper and lower Eagle Ford. In other portions, you only have one target. And then there's also the potential of you have the Austin Chalk and the Buda that are very dear to Eagle Ford there. That some of our explorationists are clamoring to drill some wells in because they feel there are significant potential in those that we certain haven't had in anywhere. So what I'd offer to you is, this year, as we mentioned on our April conference, this is just a very slow start-up year for the Eagle Ford. And we'll probably shift from low gear to second gear in 2011 in the Eagle Ford, and then third gear in 2012 and maybe high gear in 2013 or so. It's just -- it's not one we're going to able to just turn it on and have these rapid volumes, and we'll be learning the whole time come. That's why we're going a bit more slowly here with only five rigs. If we're making any errors, I think technically, we don't want to multiply it times 14 or 15 rigs at this time.

This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. 
Effective January 1, 2010, the SEC now permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve disclosures on this conference call and webcast, including those for the South Texas Eagle Ford, Barnett Shale and New Mexico Leonard plays may include potential reserves or estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC’s latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate, by reference, the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page in our website. 
With me this morning are Loren Leiker, Senior EVP, Exploration; Gary Thomas, Senior EVP, Operations; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included third quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance in yesterday's press release. We're still on track to deliver 13% total company organic production growth this year.
Our shift to a higher liquid ratio is proceeding as planned, and as with the first quarter in EOG's history where liquid revenues exceeded gas revenues. As we reported in our April analyst conference, production will increase every quarter this year, giving us strong momentum going into 2011. 
I'll now review our second quarter net income and discretionary cash flow, and then I'll provide operational highlights and discuss our capital structure. Tim Driggers will provide some financial details, and I'll close with comments regarding our macro hydrocarbon view in concluding remarks.
As outlined in our press release, for the second quarter, EOG reported net income of $59.9 million or $0.24 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain onetime adjustments as outlined in the press release, EOG's second quarter adjusted net income was $44.9 million or $0.18 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the second quarter was $656.2 million.
I'll now address operational results, and we have plenty of good news to report. Perhaps the two biggest new items were our New Mexico Leonard Shale horizontal oil discovery and the results from some of the best wells ever completed in the Haynesville Shale. 
In Southeastern New Mexico, we've been working over a year on our Red Hills area, Leonard Shale play, and our first horizontal well now has a 300-day production history. I'll note that the Leonard may also be called the Upper Bone Spring or Avalon Shale, as there are some industry variance in terminology. 
We now feel we have reserve potential of 65 million barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty reserves on 31,000 of the 120,000 net acres we have in the play, which completed seven horizontal and four vertical wells, and we believe typical for well reserves for horizontal wells or about 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty for $6.5 million well costs, which yields a 40% direct after-tax reinvestment rate of return using NYMEX future prices. 
Typical wells are at Lomas Rojas 26 #1H and #2H, which tested at 710 barrels of oil per day with 1.7 million cubic feet of rich natural gas, and 800 barrels of oil per day with 1.5 million cubic feet of rich natural gas, respectively. We have 100% working interest in these wells.
We're currently testing other portions of our 120,000 acres and we'll have results before year end. I'll note that the production stream from this accumulation is analogous to our Barnett Combo play, since 1/3 of the production is crude oil, 1/3 is NGLs and 1/3 is residue gas. This play is just starting up. It will be late 2011 before we see a substantial production contribution from this asset.
Moving to the Haynesville. During our April analyst conference, we advised that we delineated a new core area in Nacogdoches and San Augustine Counties in East Texas. Our most recent well results certainly confirm this. Our Murray #1H well have reached 25 million cubic feet a day of natural gas for the first 30 days, and the Crane #26-1H well average 27 million cubic feet a day for the same period. We have 96% working interest in those wells. 
Also in East Texas, at 49% working interest, Walter #1H well IPed at 21 million cubic feet a day. We believe the Murray and Crane Wells are two of the top three Haynesville wells completed anywhere in the Louisiana or Texas trend today.
We continue to limit our flow rates in the Haynesville to manage pressure drawn out of the reservoir, and these two wells were also limited by short-term pipeline constraints. Fortunately, a significant portion of our 160,000 Haynesville and Bossier net acres are in this Texas sweet spot. In our April analyst meeting, we also noted that the Bossier Shale was a separate target, and our recent 100% working interest Red River 5#3H confirms our view, testing at 15.2 million cubic feet a day with 6,750 psi flowing tubing pressure.
After several months of production, our Bossier wells appear to be as good as our Haynesville wells. Overall, we're extremely pleased with both our Haynesville and Bossier results, and this play will be the main driver to make up for the gas volumes being divested in our anticipated Canadian shallow gas property sale.
I'll now provide more color regarding four of our horizontal oil plays: the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Barnett Combo and Niobrara. In the Eagle Ford, we're continuing to get consistent results. We're currently drilling with only a moderate activity level until we get all of our 3D seismic shot interpreted. Also, our activity in this area has been constrained by the lack of frac equipment. I'll note that we've previously dealt with similar problems and equipment availability issues in the Barnett, and we created a proactive unique solution there and we'll do so again in the Eagle Ford.
Completion results we've noted this quarter, some of which we've articulated in our press release, indicate a consistent 120-mile-long accumulation with per well reserves similar to that outlined in analyst conference. Typical well completions are the Darlene #2H, Coalic 1H and Hoff 7H wells, which IPed at 1,033, 1,002 and 625 barrels of oil per day, respectively. The recently completed, the Borgfeld #1H and #2H wells, these are our first wells in Wilson County for 707 and 836 barrels of oil per day, respectively. We have 100% working interest in these wells. 
To date, we drilled and completed 31 wells in the Eagle Ford. We currently have 25 wells waiting on completion, which will contribute to the second half oil growth this year. We're currently running five rigs and we'll ramp up to 12 by year end.
One measure of the intensity of our future Eagle Ford development is that we plan to drill 245 gross wells in 2011 compared to 111 wells this year. The same story of consistent results holds true in our Bakken play. We have 12 rigs running there at a typical per well reserves for both the Core and the Lite are similar to those previously provided. Two recent Core wells, the Van-Hook 7-23H and Fertile 37-07H came online at 2,525 and 1,654 barrels of oil per day. We have 64% working interest in the Van-Hook well. That's a correction for the 99% we noted in our press release, and we have 81% working interest in the Fertile well.
A few days ago, we also completed the Van-Hook 8-36 well for 2,100 barrels of oil per day, which will contribute to third quarter volumes. Another note is the three recent wells on the western part of our acreage near the Montana state line, our Round Prairie, Carat and Hardscrabble wells, recently tested at rates that are typical over Bakken Lite wells, giving us greater confidence in the western extent of our acreage spread. This year, we plan to drill 42 Core wells, 57 Lite and 18 Three Forks wells. We'll also be drilling some longer reach laterals and will have results by year end. We are still early in drilling 1,280 acre space wells. 
A recent Eastern 1,280 space lateral is Palamo 2-18, which tested at 1,036 barrels of oil per day. In the Barnett Combo play, we're operating 14 rigs and our typical horizontal results are characterized by the Murray #1H well, which tested at 452 barrels of oil per day, with 2 million cubic feet of rich gas, and the Break 2H, which tested at 528 barrels of oil per day with 2 million cubic feet of rich gas. The King #1H and Olden B#1H wells were outlined in the press release and tested at 344 with 2.5 million cubic feet of gas, and 323 barrels of oil per day with 1.7 million cubic feet of gas. The Alamo B#6H well is still cleaning up and is producing 500 barrels of oil per day. 
We've expanded our definition of the Core Combo from the previous 125,000 net acres to 150,000 net acres based on recent drilling results. In all areas of the Combo, except the East, our results were similar to our models. On the last quarter's call, I noted outstanding results from the Settle B# 1H well, which was a horizontal drilled in the 25,000-acre eastern portion of our play previously designated for vertical exploitation. After producing this well for three months, we estimate it will produce 260,000 barrels of oil, 412,000 barrels of NGLs and three Bcf, net after royalty, in residue gas or 1.1 million barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty, for a $4 million well costs, and a greater than 100% direct after-tax reinvestment rate of return.
These reserves are considerably higher than our model well estimates. Additionally, results from our second horizontal in this same area, the Richardson #3H, seem positive, is a 325 barrel oil per day restricted rate while still cleaning up after frac. Additionally, or accordingly, we've changed our 2010 Combo program toward more horizontals and less verticals in the eastern area. Our original plan was 126 horizontal and 120 vertical wells. Now it's 200 horizontals and 34 vertical wells. This switch from verticals to horizontals, with 100% rate of return, will likely increase the overall oil ore of the Combo play. I'll also note that we currently have several large multi-well patterns on after frac flowback, and we expect to see a significant increase in our Combo production in the second half.
We also have some new data on our Colorado Niobrara play. We've completed two additional wells, the Critter Creek #02-03H and #04-09H, and they're producing at managed restricted rates of 570 and 600 barrels of oil per day, respectively. We have 100% working interest here. We have four rigs running in this play. But as we've previously stated, we want to observe production from these and earlier wells until year end, before we make a reserve estimate because the reservoir is heavily fractured. In Southwest Kansas, we also recently completed two nice shallow vertical wells with 100% working interest. The Cynthia 35-1 IPed at 1,700 barrels of oil per day, and the Brookover 8-2 well IPed at 260 barrels of oil per day. Several offsets to these wells are planned for the second half of the year.
Returning to our natural gas assets, we're continuing to have good results in the Barnett gas window. We're running two rigs in the Barnett gas area and recently completed six more unit wells in Tarrant County with an average IP of 7.5 million cubic feet a day each, with 68% working interest. Our all-in total Barnett gas finding cost year-to-date is $1.48 per Mcf.
In the Horn River Basin, we're completing 11 wells from our winter drilling program and anticipate having flow results on next quarter's call. In conjunction with Apache, we're making steady progress with Kitimat LNG, although we are still early into our project. The key to this project is securing an oil index LNG contract, and we're in the preliminary stages of discussions with potential off-takers.
In summary, all our North American operations are proceeding as expected, but we've had recent upsides in the New Mexico Leonard Shale, the Eastern portion of the Barnett Combo and the Texas Haynesville. Outside North America, our Trinidad asset is currently in a producing node. We plan to begin development drilling in the Toucan field during the fourth quarter. In China, we've completed a second horizontal gas well, and it's performing okay, but not as good as our first well. By year end, we'll have completed two more gas wells and one oil well, and we can assess the overall program.
Outside of operations, another part of our business plan this year involves the sale of some producing natural gas assets and some horizontal shale gas and oil acreage that we are looking to close by year end. This one encompass two separate packages. The first consists of Canadian shallow gas production of 170 million cubic feet of equivalents per day, which was put on the market two weeks ago. The second package will consist of 180,000 acres of domestic horizontal shale gas acreage in the Marcellus and Haynesville, and some rich gas and crude oil acreage in the Eagle Ford. We considered the JV related to this acreage, but instead decided on an outright sale because it's cleaner and less complicated. This acreage package is larger than we've contemplated three months ago. We spent about $1.7 billion over the last few years accumulating first mover horizontal shale acreage, and frankly, we have more good acreage now we can say grace over, given our manpower and capital structure plans. So we're going to monetize a bit in this acreage. Our intention is to close these sales by your end, and maintain a year end net debt-to-cap ratio of 25% or less for 2010 through 2012.
You'll note that our estimated CapEx for this year has increased $500 million from prior estimates, primarily because of higher frac cost and the increased number of production facilities, particularly in the Eagle Ford. All of this incremental CapEx is related to oil projects, roughly 270 of the incremental $500 million is due to EOG installing oil facilities that we previously plan to have a third-party midstream company installed. We did this because of timing and cost issues. Even with this higher CapEx, we expect to maintain a year end net debt-to-cap ratio of 25% or less. I'll note that the potential sale of a small portion of our Eagle Ford acreage doesn't affect our 900 million barrel of oil equivalent, net after royalty, captured reserve estimate we previously provided.
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure.

For the second quarter 2010, total exploration and development expenditures were $1.3 billion excluding asset retirement obligations. Total acquisitions for the quarter were $4 million. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $55 million. 
At quarter end, total long-term debt was $3.7 billion, and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 27%. At June 30, we had $650 million of cash, getting us non-GAAP net debt of $3.1 billion or net debt to total cap ratio of 23%. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 46%, and the deferred tax ratio was negative 24%.
Yesterday, with the earnings press release, we included a guidance table for the third quarter and updated full year 2010. For the full year 2010, the effective tax range is 40% to 50%. This higher range is due to the impact of international operations. We've also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the third quarter and for the full year.
Transportation costs exceeded the second quarter guidance that we have provided, due to the impact of several firm transportation contracts in the North Dakota accrued by rail project. These marketing arrangements generally ensure more reliable markets and better prices for our products. During the second quarter, we had better realizations for both U.S. gas and U.S. crude oil. We sold our U.S. gas at a premium to Henry Hub during the second quarter. For the Bakken crude that is being shipped to Cushing by rail, we are realizing full WTI at Cushing. 
Now I'll turn it back to Mark.

Regarding oil, we continue to be, what I'll call, rationally bullish, both short and long term. I'll note that 2010 global oil demand is currently expected to be 86 million barrels a day, the same level as in 2008. So oil demand has recovered from the global recession faster than almost anybody had predicted. The demand mix, of course, has changed, where China, India and the Middle East are bigger drivers than the OECD. Barring a doubled-dip recession will likely outlook for future oil prices. We have a small amount of oil hedged in the fourth quarter and have 6,000 barrels of oil a day hedged at $93.18 for 2011. 
North American gas, however, is more opaque. One hopeful sign is that recent U.S. storage has been filling at a net 2.6 Bcf a day lower rate than last year. Since May 1, we've injected 244 Bcf less over 91-day period. Additionally, Canadian storage has swung 128 Bcf year-over-year, or 1.4 Bcf per day during the same period. Combined, this is a four Bcf a day storage tightening year-over-year since May 1. This may be due to either hot weather, strengthening industrial demand or supply declines. 
We're also encouraged by the last two EIA-914 report showing flat production, which matches our internal models. We continue to be moderately bullish regarding short-term gas prices. We currently have 150 MMBtu per day hedged for 2011 at an average $5.44 price and 100 million BTU per day hedged for 2012 at an average of $5.44.
Now let me summarize. In my opinion, there are two points to take away from this call. First, our conversion from a natural gas weighted to an oil weighted North American company is proceeding very well. All of our oil plays are performing similarly to what was presented in our April Analyst Conference, and we've now added a new Leonard Shale play. You'll recall that in our April conference, we specifically noted that our oil production growth would be lumpy and not in a straight line quarter-to-quarter and that's exactly what is occurring.
This is the nature of the development of these horizontal assets for maximum reserve recovery, whereby we drill and complete a group of five to 15 wells together before bringing any of them to sales. I'll also note that as other E&P companies have subsequently proclaimed themselves to be liquids rich, the distinction between crude oil and lower-valued NGLs since to have been blurred. 
To recap, our acreage in Eagle Ford, Bakken and the Niobrara, our crude oil perspective with minimum NGLs, or the Barnett Combo and Leonard plays, provide both crude oil and NGLs. Although we have some associated NGL growth, overall, our program is dominated by crude oil growth, specifically, we expect roughly 75% of our 2010, '11 and '12 liquids production to be crude oil and condensate and 25% to be NGLs. 
And then our second closing point is that our capital plan is on track and consistent with that articulated at our Analyst Conference. Our intention is to shift this company to an oil mix organically, while maintaining a low debt level. 
Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A.

And so as we mentioned in our April conference, you can't project our production growth for either 2010, '11 and '12, that is a straight line quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter. If you try and do that, it's just flat, not going to work. And it so happens that our second quarter production happen to be a quarter, where we were completing a lot of wells, but not bringing them to sales. And the third and fourth quarters are ones, where we're going to be kind of in the opposite of that cycle. We'll be bringing a lot more on sales relative to our operational activity.

One is just the availability of profit, whether that's sand, resin-coated sand or some kind of intermediates casing profit. There's a very, very tight market.

And we're talking about close to 1 billion barrels at the Eagle Ford, and so we're gearing up for something very long term and very permanent kind of a solution.

I don't want to go specifically into what we expect in terms of price for these packages, but I don't want to signal anything to prospective buyers, but that's the way we formulated our plan. We've accumulated so much acreage at such a cheap price over the last three years by being in the first mover position that gives us flexibility that some other people maybe don't have. And then we've looked at the JV piece of this thing and to us, the JV kind of complicates the issues. We end up using our manpower for something less than 100% working interest on there.

And of course, remember that the first six months, they had pretty significant production, I think, 50,000 barrels or so in the first six months or whatever. So I'd say, overall, we're still cautious. We don't want to proclaim victory but we're getting a little more positive feeling than we had three months ago, particularly in observation of the Jake and Elmer wells, since those wells have a little longer line. But it's almost an issue of, okay, is this going to be, as Loren said, a very large oil reserve accumulation? Or is this going to be a more moderate size oil reserve accumulation? That's kind of the where we stand today on the overall play.

What we really did, we made kind of a choice in the company, and we said, okay, we've got a plethora of acreage and whether it's on these shale gas plays or the oil plays. And for us, to properly address all that acreage, we would have to be running in 2011 and '12 well over 100 drilling rigs. And we would be, I would say, as a company, a little bit out of control in terms of optimally managing those 100-plus drilling rigs. And we could do it and they will be great, but it's a bit of an uncomfortable position. So what we decided to do is, we said, ""What do we really need to hit those growth targets that we've put out there for 2011, '12 and go forward? And do we really want to try and be in a little more controlled environment as far as our operational environment and maybe monetize a bit of this acreage?"" So that's a little bit of the philosophy that's taken us to this asset acreage monetization strategy. We're going to be go on pretty much to the max in terms of our operational effectiveness in the second half of this year and in 2011 and '12, and we really don't want to go past that limit just because we have acreage that needs to be serviced, if you will.

It's more -- it's basically going to be just an expansion drive reservoir there. But again, it's early days in terms of Eagle Ford. I'd tell our staff that if one of the big integrated companies had essentially 1 billion barrel oil discovery somewhere, they would probably have 200 technical people assigned to only that project. And we certainly don't have 200 technical people assigned to this essentially 1 billion barrel project. And so I'd say, we've got it identified as far as length, width, pretty darn well, but there's a lot of other things that we're going to be working on and just kind of try to optimize. So what is the right spacing here? Where is the right location that we can drill a well in this? In some portions, you have two targets perhaps, upper and lower Eagle Ford. In other portions, you only have one target. And then there's also the potential of you have the Austin Chalk and the Buda that are very dear to Eagle Ford there. That some of our explorationists are clamoring to drill some wells in because they feel there are significant potential in those that we certain haven't had in anywhere. So what I'd offer to you is, this year, as we mentioned on our April conference, this is just a very slow start-up year for the Eagle Ford. And we'll probably shift from low gear to second gear in 2011 in the Eagle Ford, and then third gear in 2012 and maybe high gear in 2013 or so. It's just -- it's not one we're going to able to just turn it on and have these rapid volumes, and we'll be learning the whole time come. That's why we're going a bit more slowly here with only five rigs. If we're making any errors, I think technically, we don't want to multiply it times 14 or 15 rigs at this time. So that's more of an answer than you want to get, David.

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing the third quarter of 2010 earnings and operational results.
This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. 
This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. 
Effective January 1, 2010, the SEC now permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve disclosures on this conference call and webcast, including those for the South Texas, Eagle Ford, Barnett Combo and New Mexico Leonard Plays may include potential reserves or estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC’s latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website.
With me this morning are Loren Leiker, Senior EVP Exploration; Gary Thomas, Senior EVP, Operations;  Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President of Investor Relations. An updated Investor Relations presentation was posted to our website last night. We included 2010 and revised preliminary volume estimates for 2011 and 2012.
We've reduced our full year 2010 growth guidance from 13% to 9%. About 70% of this reduction relates to North American natural gas volumes, where we're now projecting minus 2% growth versus the previous estimate of plus 2%. Obviously, in this price environment, we're not incented to grow gas volumes. Our conversion from a natural gas to an oil company is still on track. And we expect total crude, condensate and natural gas liquids to comprise approximately 67% of our 2011 North American revenues. 
However, because of lower cash flows from weak gas prices, higher frac costs, delays in frac equipment availability and the pattern drilling used to maximize resource plays, we've also reduced our 2011 and 2012 liquids growth targets to better reflect real-world conditions. Even with these reductions, we expect to grow crude and condensate 36%, 53% and 30% in 2010, '11 and '12. We've also made progress regarding asset sales, and I'll report on that later in the call. 
I'll now review our third quarter net income and discretionary cash flows. Then I'll provide some highlights and discuss our capital structure. Tim Driggers will provide some financial details. And I'll close with comments regarding our macro hydrocarbon view in concluding remarks.
As outlined in our press release, for the third quarter, EOG reported a net loss of $70.9 million or $0.28 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark-to-market impacts of certain onetime adjustments as outlined in the press release, EOG's third quarter adjusted net income was $46.6 million or $0.18 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the third quarter was $755.4 million.
I'll now address operational results, and I'll start with the South Texas Eagle Ford. The bottom line here is that our confidence in individual well results and the total 900 million barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty reserve estimate, have increased since our April analyst conference. Because this is such a huge net oil accumulation, and I believe investors have undervalued this asset, I'm going to take several minutes and provide an update based on our results from the last six months. Our press release provided details on a number of good wells, most of which have only commenced sales in the last month. 
Here's what we know right now about our asset after drilling 77 wells, 59 of which are either producing or shedding for off-site fracs or waiting on fracs. 
First, the Eagle Ford formation is not a typical shale. But instead, it's a borderline conventional carbonate reservoir. Pressure and flow data from our wells indicate we're seeing a lot of matrix flow, i.e., a significant amount of flow from the rock fabric itself, which is a good sign. 
Second, the Eagle Ford is a predictable play. We've not drilled a large enough population of wells and we're getting very repeatable results across a 120-mile extent of acreage block. 
Third, we've had a 100% well success rate within the acreage and the horizons we originally defined to contain our estimated 0.9 billion barrels. For a startup play, this is outstanding. 
Fourth, for our 0.9 billion barrels of estimated reserves, the mix is 77% black oil. The oil in our portion of the reservoir has some unique characteristics that enhance the recovery factor.  We've kept this information proprietary until now. But with our acreage tied up, we can now talk without losing a competitive advantage. I'll apologize in advance for getting too technical. But this is a very important point, because some analysts have expressed concern regarding recovery factors from a pure oil reservoir. Specifically, there is an extraordinarily high differential between the initial reservoir pressure and the pressure at which solution gas breaks out of the oil, technically called the bubble point pressure.  Across our acreage, the original reservoir pressure averages 7,200 psi and the bubble point pressure averages 2,500 psi. This unusually high spread provides for a larger-than-normal fluid expansion recovery factor. That's why we're so confident with our 0.9 billion barrel reserve estimate.
Fifth, the reservoir can be broken into two zones, East and West. In the East, we have two targets, the Upper and Lower Eagle Ford. These zones are relatively thick and high-quality. A typical well here is the Harper #10H well, which IP-ed at 1,070 barrels of oil per day and 980 Mcf per day. In this same area, the Cusack Clampit wells, which were highlighted in the press release, IP-ed at rates ranging from 860 to 1,800 barrels of oil per day, with 1 to 1.8 million cubic feet a day of rich gas each. We have 100% working interest in all these Eastern wells. In this Eastern area, we typically drilling 4,000-foot laterals and expect the average reserves per well of 460 Mboe net after royalty.
The Western area has only one target, the Lower Eagle Ford, and the rock is a bit thinner. Typical wells here are the Haynes #1H and Hoff #6H wells, which IP-ed at 979 and 629 barrels of oil per day respectively. We have 100% working interest in these wells also. To maximize our economics in the West, we'll drill 6,000-foot-long laterals and expect 430 Mboe per well net after royalty. These per well recoveries are considerably higher than we noted in April.
Sixth, the typical decline curve for both areas indicate we'll produce 40% of our wells' reserves in the first five years. We originally thought we'd need roughly 2,800 wells to capture the 0.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. But now it will take us a lot fewer wells to monetize this asset. 
Overall, we believe we can achieve a $12 to $15 per Boe direct finding costs across the entire play. We plan to run 14 rigs, drill 231 net Eagle Ford wells in 2011. 
And seventh, the direct rates of returns that we expect to achieve from both East and Western wings of our sweet spot will return to the same return goals as we gave at our April analysts conference. As we exit the science stage and enter the program drilling phase in 2011 and '12, we expect to achieve the 0.66 and 95% direct after-tax rates return. In order to decrease our average completed well costs back to the original range by the end of next year on a normalized lateral length places, we're implementing drilling enhancements and completion design modifications as well as contractual and self-sourced frac solutions.
Let me take a minute here to discuss our volume growth projections. This applies not only to the Eagle Ford but also to our other oil resource plays. EOG is a company that has rarely missed its volume targets over the past 11 years. Yet now, we are revising our 2010-'12 numbers downward. Part of this is very simple. At current and projected gas prices, we have no interest in growing gas volumes. 
Regarding oil, our individual wells are performing as expected. But we underestimated the downtime for patent drilling and delays for frac equipment. As we previously stated, optimizing shale oil or gas recovery requires drilling five or six side-by-side wells, frac-ing them simultaneously and only then turning all wells to production. Therefore, if frac equipment is delayed, it doesn't affect only one well but cascades to five or six wells and the associated production. We believe our updated volume estimates now account for this methodology.
To give you a little more color on these frac equipment delays, we're currently experiencing delays in almost every one of our divisions and have about 100 wells experiencing delays. Since most of our budget is oil wells, this disproportionately affects oil volumes. These delays won't go away anytime soon. And our new 2011 and 2012 growth forecasts assume the frac delays continue until at least mid-2011.
Moving to an emerging oil play. We're pleased to report success on additional acreage in our New Mexico Leonard Shale. Last quarter, we told you we'd proven up 31,000 of our 120,000 net acres. And we can now report we've proven up an additional 18,000 acres. Our Elk Wallow 11 #1H and #2H wells are producing at 337 and 505 barrels of oil per day, with 3.1 million and 4.8 million cubic feet of rich natural gas, respectively from an upper and lower Leonard interval, indicating we have two separate targets in this area. We have 100% working interest in these wells.  We expect our Leonard reserves will likely increase from the original 65 million barrels of oil equivalent, in our estimate. Because acreage explorations aren't as critical here, we'll develop this asset at a relatively slow pace in 2011. 
Our Barnett Combo results continue to be consistent, and we're in a steady manufacturing mode. For the second quarter in a row, we've expanded the Core area. This time from 150,000 to 160,000 acres. This play keeps getting bigger. Earlier this year, we highlighted our first very good horizontal well in the Eastern portion of our acreage, where we'd previously recorded only verticals. Since then, we've completed many successful Eastern area wells in horizontals and verticals. Recent successful horizontals are Strickland A #2H, Settle C #3H and the Christian C #3H, with IP rates of 1,118, 731 and 954 barrels of oil per day. It's 1.6 million to 2.1 million cubic feet a day of rich gas. EOG has working interest varying from 90% to 98% in these wells. 
Two successful vertical wells in the East are the Strickland #1 and Slagle #1, which IP-ed at 865 and 539 barrels of oil per day. We have 96% and 100% working interest in these wells, respectively. 
We've also achieved good results in the Western portion of Montague County, with a Posey C#3H testing at 536 barrels of oil per day. We're currently operating 16 rigs in the Combo and plan to run 16 rigs here in 2011. 
One other interesting feature here, although the Combo increased about 1/3 oil, 1/3 NGLs and 1/3 residue gas, the current revenue split is over 90% liquids and less than 10% gas, consistent with our liquids shift. We plan to drill 258 Barnett Combo wells in 2011. 
On our Barnett gas activity, essentially all of our Johnson County acreage is now held by production, till we plan to drill zero Barnett gas wells in 2011.
Moving to the Bakken. Per well results continue to be as expected, and we continue to prove up acreage outside our Core area. The newest area is Southwest of the Core, where we drilled several 640-acre space wells with good IPs. The Mandaree 4-15, 2-9, 10-5 and 6-20 wells IP-ed at maximum growth rates of 1,490, 1,358, 840 and 1,175 barrels of oil per day, respectively. We have 63% to 90% working interest in these wells. 
Our drilling within the partial Core area has also yielded the expected results, and we've seen no unusual declines here. Overall, we're happy with our North Dakota results. And this asset is currently our single largest oil contributor, although that will change within a year or two as the Eagle Ford ramps up. We plan to run 10 Bakken and Three Forks rigs in 2011. Also about 25% of our 2010 wells were 1,280-acre space laterals, and that 25% will grow to about 70% next year.
The Manitoba Waskada oil volumes are finally drilling after one of the wettest summers in 60 years, which inhibited our activity. Net production has increased 4,600 barrels of oil a day in January, and we expect a year-end exit rate of 7,700 barrels per day.
The last oil play I'll mention is the Niobrara in Northeastern Colorado. We're currently running three rigs here. Two recent wells, the Critter Creek #5-10H and #9-15H had IP rates of 690 and 748 barrels of oil per day on restricted chokes. And we have 100% working interest in both of these wells. Even though natural gas isn't currently in vogue, we have some upbeat news from the Marcellus and continued good news from the Haynesville-Bossier, where we're drilling to hold acreage.
In the Marcellus, we've modified our frac program in our first four wells on the EOG/NSG joint venture acreage with these new style completions are very strong. The Clearfield County counts the 34H, 35H, 37H and 38H wells IP-ed at 9.2, 8.5, 7.1 and 8 million cubic feet a day respectively. EOG has 50% working interest in these wells.
In our Haynesville-Bossier area, we continue to make good wells such as AC LCO #1, Black Stone 4 #5 and Fremont Farms #1 wells, which IP-ed at 34, 23, and 26 million cubic feet a day, respectively. We have 48%, 75% and 75% working interest in these wells. 
We've refined our mapping of the play's sweet spots. Although we're not known as a major Haynesville player, we believe EOG has a Haynesville-Bossier sweet spot acreage position that's as good or better than any other operator in the play. Current Investor Relations presentation has a chart showing EOG with 67% of our total acreage position in the sweet spots of this play. During 2011, we plan to drill the minimum number of wells here that is necessary to maintain our acreage position.
In the Horn River Basin, we're in the process of completing several wells. And early results from three wells completed in the EB section show IPs between 16 million and 22 million cubic feet a day. We won't be as active here in 2011, as we've been in 2010.
Outside North America, our Trinidad asset is currently in the production mode, and we will begin developments early on our Toucan discovery in the fourth quarter. This will provide deliverability to meet our 2011-13 gas contracts in China, we expect to frac another well, the third, by year end. 
Outside of operations, part of our business plan involves selling some assets to partially cover our expected 2010 and 2011 operating cash flow shortfall. At our April analyst meeting, our goal was to sell assets this year and maintain a maximum 25% net-debt-to-capital ratio. Since April, gas prices have obviously collapsed, so we've come up with a new capital plan. We expect to sell between 600 million and 1 billion of acreage and oil-producing assets this year, with almost all of that expected to close in the fourth quarter. I want to stress most of these deals are not yet closed.  For 2011, we plan to sell at least $1 billion of primarily gas acreage or producing properties. And we've raised the conceptual upper limit on our net-debt-to-total-cap ratio from 25% to between 30% and 35%. 
Unlike others, we don't intend to sell or JV any of our horizontal oil plays. We intend to emerge from this transformation retaining 100% of the oil and combo assets that we've captured. And we're willing to liquidate gas assets, gas acreage or assets to achieve that goal. I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financial and capital structure."

During the third quarter, we accepted bids to sell a portion of our Canadian shallow natural gas assets for net proceeds of $320 million. Additionally, these assets were considered to be held for sale, and we've recorded a pretax impairment of $280 million to write down these assets to fair value.
At quarter end, total long-term debt was $3.8 billion, and the debt-to-total-cap ratio was 27%. At September 30, we had $28 million of cash, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $3.7 billion and a net-debt-to-total-cap ratio of 27%.
Yesterday with earnings press release, we included a guidance table for the fourth quarter and the updated full year 2010. For the full year 2010, the effective tax range is 40% to 50%.

Regarding oil, we're still rationally bullish based on the fact that global oil demand is currently 86 million barrels a day, the same as in 2008. And the demand has rebounded very nicely for last year. It's worth noting that 2010 global oil demand growth is the second greatest in the past 30 years. We've increased our 2011 hedge position slightly and currently have 10,000 barrels of oil a day hedged at $90.39. 
Regarding North America natural gas, the question is, ""Can it get much lower?"" And I guess time will tell. I expect the gas rig count to fall by about 200 rigs by mid-2011. We currently have 150 million cubic feet hedged at 2011 at a $5.44 price and 200 million a day hedged for 2012 at a $5.57 price.
Now let me summarize. In my opinion, there are three points to take away from this call. First, beginning in 2011, we are now predominantly an oil company based on our anticipated revenue mix. And there is no other company our size that's growing oil and NGL volumes similar to EOG's rate. 
Second, our oil assets are generating consistent and repeatable results. I'm particularly pleased with the results this quarter from the Eagle Ford, Barnett Combo, Leonard and Bakken. Regarding the Eagle Ford, two recent industry transactions for acreage in the oil window have ratified our asset value, particularly when noting that we were the first mover and have a premier oil window acreage. 
And third, although our capital plan has changed a bit since April, we're on track to sell significant natural gas properties in 2010 and have additional sales planned for 2011. Additionally, we've pared our 2011 dry gas CapEx to absolute minimum level to hold our Haynesville, Marcellus and Horn River acreage positions. Our goal is to retain and develop 100% of our oil assets without incurring excessive debt, and if we lighten up on some natural gas assets in the process, so be it.

And the Niobrara, we have divested a little bit of the 400,000 acres. But we'll definitely be keeping the majority of that 400,000 acres. The best way to explain all of this, Joe, is on the natural gas front, we've got a huge gas inventory clearly in the Haynesville/Bossier and the sweet spot hitting probably between nine and 10 Tcf. We're quite encouraged now with the Marcellus on our combined EOG/NFG acreage. We know we've got a ton of gas in the Horn River and certainly a bunch in the Uinta basin and some in Johnson County in the Barnett. And what we'd be looking at selling over the next 18 months are our properties that perhaps are long-life existing gas properties that may be time to pass down to another operator. We're a company that over the last decade, we haven't sold much. We've been in accumulating mode that whole time, so we've got a pretty good inventory of existing properties to liquidate. And there are buyers out there, even at these kind of gas price conditions. And so we'll be liquidating some of those and also on some acreage that either we have to invest in drilling-wise or the Ford expires or something along those lines.

We only sold a portion of that. And basically, what's announced in the press release is only a portion of that gas. And in terms of monetizing some gas assets, yes, I would say that relative to our April analysts conference, we're now more likely, particularly in 2011, to monetize some producing gas assets more than we were previously. If you look at our projected volume growth in North American gas for 2010, 2011 and 2012, it's negative in '11 And I think it's plus 1% for 2012. And those projected sales are reflecting in those volumes, so those volumes we provided are not pro forma. We're assuming that we sell property x say the first quarter next year, property Y by mid-year. And so that's why you're seeing on the North American volume growth. Our feeling is just on the macro view, I'd love to be more optimistic on gas. I hope I'm wrong.

We all knew that we want to complete these wells in bunches, four, five or six wells together. But what we assumed back in April was, if we called up a service company and say, we need you to frac a well in three weeks, that they'd show up in three weeks and we'd then frac five or six wells simultaneously. Now what we're finding is you have to schedule this four our five months in advance. And instead of three weeks, you're really looking at four to five months to get those things done. And what it does is it sets you back the whole, not one well but six wells. Production comes online many, many months later than what you expected. And then what it does for you is, we assumed we'd have an exit rate in December of this year, we'll say X back in April. Now we know that exit rate is going to be less than that and so that's why the gross volumes that were projected now and for 2012 are going to be less. We're sill going to have pretty dramatic year-over-year production, but we're compounding off a lower base than what we previously expected because we didn't achieve our this goal this year. And then we built into it the fact that miraculously this frac equipment does not become instantly available on January 1 of '11. We don't see any real improvement there. The biggest improvement we're going to see, we believe, in the frac equipment, sort of us outsourcing is, if the gas rig count drops by a couple of hundred rigs. And we believe by mid-next year, my guess is 200 rigs. Gary Thomas is guessing 300 rigs, the drop in gas rig count. When that happens, if that happens, then all of a sudden, whatever frac equipment is tied up there becomes available for oil plays. So we're kind of hoping that happens for multiple reasons, one is a great gas mark and two is just backup free up equipment. Hopefully, I gave you a little more color there, Brian."

And today, we're talking about 4,000 to 6,000-foot laterals. So if you go out a couple of years for, say, the Eagle Ford, it wouldn't surprise me if we end up talking about routinely 8,000 to 10,000-foot laterals. Because the reserves, one thing we found in pretty much all of these resort plays are the reserves are just a linear function of the lateral length. If you drill oil with twice the lateral length, you're likely to get twice the reserves. And the same thing will hold true for any of the other plays, whether it be the Leonard Shale, the Combo play or some of these things. So in many cases, you've got some limitations there, if you've got a lot of fall patterns. So the more highly focused an area is, you can't can go out and drill a 10,000 or 14,000-foot lateral. But the sense of the industry moving to longer laterals in all the play will very definitely occur."

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing the third quarter of 2010 earnings and operational results.
This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. 
This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. 
Effective January 1, 2010, the SEC now permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve disclosures on this conference call and webcast, including those for the South Texas, Eagle Ford, Barnett Combo and New Mexico Leonard Plays may include potential reserves or estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC’s latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website.
With me this morning are Loren Leiker, Senior EVP Exploration; Gary Thomas, Senior EVP, Operations;  Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President of Investor Relations. An updated Investor Relations presentation was posted to our website last night. We included 2010 and revised preliminary volume estimates for 2011 and 2012.
We've reduced our full year 2010 growth guidance from 13% to 9%. About 70% of this reduction relates to North American natural gas volumes, where we're now projecting minus 2% growth versus the previous estimate of plus 2%. Obviously, in this price environment, we're not incented to grow gas volumes. Our conversion from a natural gas to an oil company is still on track. And we expect total crude, condensate and natural gas liquids to comprise approximately 67% of our 2011 North American revenues. 
However, because of lower cash flows from weak gas prices, higher frac costs, delays in frac equipment availability and the pattern drilling used to maximize resource plays, we've also reduced our 2011 and 2012 liquids growth targets to better reflect real-world conditions. Even with these reductions, we expect to grow crude and condensate 36%, 53% and 30% in 2010, '11 and '12. We've also made progress regarding asset sales, and I'll report on that later in the call. 
I'll now review our third quarter net income and discretionary cash flows. Then I'll provide some highlights and discuss our capital structure. Tim Driggers will provide some financial details. And I'll close with comments regarding our macro hydrocarbon view in concluding remarks.
As outlined in our press release, for the third quarter, EOG reported a net loss of $70.9 million or $0.28 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark-to-market impacts of certain onetime adjustments as outlined in the press release, EOG's third quarter adjusted net income was $46.6 million or $0.18 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the third quarter was $755.4 million.
I'll now address operational results, and I'll start with the South Texas Eagle Ford. The bottom line here is that our confidence in individual well results and the total 900 million barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty reserve estimate, have increased since our April analyst conference. Because this is such a huge net oil accumulation, and I believe investors have undervalued this asset, I'm going to take several minutes and provide an update based on our results from the last six months. Our press release provided details on a number of good wells, most of which have only commenced sales in the last month. 
Here's what we know right now about our asset after drilling 77 wells, 59 of which are either producing or shedding for off-site fracs or waiting on fracs. 
First, the Eagle Ford formation is not a typical shale. But instead, it's a borderline conventional carbonate reservoir. Pressure and flow data from our wells indicate we're seeing a lot of matrix flow, i.e., a significant amount of flow from the rock fabric itself, which is a good sign. 
Second, the Eagle Ford is a predictable play. We've not drilled a large enough population of wells and we're getting very repeatable results across a 120-mile extent of acreage block. 
Third, we've had a 100% well success rate within the acreage and the horizons we originally defined to contain our estimated 0.9 billion barrels. For a startup play, this is outstanding. 
Fourth, for our 0.9 billion barrels of estimated reserves, the mix is 77% black oil. The oil in our portion of the reservoir has some unique characteristics that enhance the recovery factor.  We've kept this information proprietary until now. But with our acreage tied up, we can now talk without losing a competitive advantage. I'll apologize in advance for getting too technical. But this is a very important point, because some analysts have expressed concern regarding recovery factors from a pure oil reservoir. Specifically, there is an extraordinarily high differential between the initial reservoir pressure and the pressure at which solution gas breaks out of the oil, technically called the bubble point pressure.  Across our acreage, the original reservoir pressure averages 7,200 psi and the bubble point pressure averages 2,500 psi. This unusually high spread provides for a larger-than-normal fluid expansion recovery factor. That's why we're so confident with our 0.9 billion barrel reserve estimate.
Fifth, the reservoir can be broken into two zones, East and West. In the East, we have two targets, the Upper and Lower Eagle Ford. These zones are relatively thick and high-quality. A typical well here is the Harper #10H well, which IP-ed at 1,070 barrels of oil per day and 980 Mcf per day. In this same area, the Cusack Clampit wells, which were highlighted in the press release, IP-ed at rates ranging from 860 to 1,800 barrels of oil per day, with 1 to 1.8 million cubic feet a day of rich gas each. We have 100% working interest in all these Eastern wells. In this Eastern area, we typically drilling 4,000-foot laterals and expect the average reserves per well of 460 Mboe net after royalty.
The Western area has only one target, the Lower Eagle Ford, and the rock is a bit thinner. Typical wells here are the Haynes #1H and Hoff #6H wells, which IP-ed at 979 and 629 barrels of oil per day respectively. We have 100% working interest in these wells also. To maximize our economics in the West, we'll drill 6,000-foot-long laterals and expect 430 Mboe per well net after royalty. These per well recoveries are considerably higher than we noted in April.
Sixth, the typical decline curve for both areas indicate we'll produce 40% of our wells' reserves in the first five years. We originally thought we'd need roughly 2,800 wells to capture the 0.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. But now it will take us a lot fewer wells to monetize this asset. 
Overall, we believe we can achieve a $12 to $15 per Boe direct finding costs across the entire play. We plan to run 14 rigs, drill 231 net Eagle Ford wells in 2011. 
And seventh, the direct rates of returns that we expect to achieve from both East and Western wings of our sweet spot will return to the same return goals as we gave at our April analysts conference. As we exit the science stage and enter the program drilling phase in 2011 and '12, we expect to achieve the 0.66 and 95% direct after-tax rates return. In order to decrease our average completed well costs back to the original range by the end of next year on a normalized lateral length places, we're implementing drilling enhancements and completion design modifications as well as contractual and self-sourced frac solutions.
Let me take a minute here to discuss our volume growth projections. This applies not only to the Eagle Ford but also to our other oil resource plays. EOG is a company that has rarely missed its volume targets over the past 11 years. Yet now, we are revising our 2010-'12 numbers downward. Part of this is very simple. At current and projected gas prices, we have no interest in growing gas volumes. 
Regarding oil, our individual wells are performing as expected. But we underestimated the downtime for patent drilling and delays for frac equipment. As we previously stated, optimizing shale oil or gas recovery requires drilling five or six side-by-side wells, frac-ing them simultaneously and only then turning all wells to production. Therefore, if frac equipment is delayed, it doesn't affect only one well but cascades to five or six wells and the associated production. We believe our updated volume estimates now account for this methodology.
To give you a little more color on these frac equipment delays, we're currently experiencing delays in almost every one of our divisions and have about 100 wells experiencing delays. Since most of our budget is oil wells, this disproportionately affects oil volumes. These delays won't go away anytime soon. And our new 2011 and 2012 growth forecasts assume the frac delays continue until at least mid-2011.
Moving to an emerging oil play. We're pleased to report success on additional acreage in our New Mexico Leonard Shale. Last quarter, we told you we'd proven up 31,000 of our 120,000 net acres. And we can now report we've proven up an additional 18,000 acres. Our Elk Wallow 11 #1H and #2H wells are producing at 337 and 505 barrels of oil per day, with 3.1 million and 4.8 million cubic feet of rich natural gas, respectively from an upper and lower Leonard interval, indicating we have two separate targets in this area. We have 100% working interest in these wells.  We expect our Leonard reserves will likely increase from the original 65 million barrels of oil equivalent, in our estimate. Because acreage explorations aren't as critical here, we'll develop this asset at a relatively slow pace in 2011. 
Our Barnett Combo results continue to be consistent, and we're in a steady manufacturing mode. For the second quarter in a row, we've expanded the Core area. This time from 150,000 to 160,000 acres. This play keeps getting bigger. Earlier this year, we highlighted our first very good horizontal well in the Eastern portion of our acreage, where we'd previously recorded only verticals. Since then, we've completed many successful Eastern area wells in horizontals and verticals. Recent successful horizontals are Strickland A #2H, Settle C #3H and the Christian C #3H, with IP rates of 1,118, 731 and 954 barrels of oil per day. It's 1.6 million to 2.1 million cubic feet a day of rich gas. EOG has working interest varying from 90% to 98% in these wells. 
Two successful vertical wells in the East are the Strickland #1 and Slagle #1, which IP-ed at 865 and 539 barrels of oil per day. We have 96% and 100% working interest in these wells, respectively. 
We've also achieved good results in the Western portion of Montague County, with a Posey C#3H testing at 536 barrels of oil per day. We're currently operating 16 rigs in the Combo and plan to run 16 rigs here in 2011. 
One other interesting feature here, although the Combo increased about 1/3 oil, 1/3 NGLs and 1/3 residue gas, the current revenue split is over 90% liquids and less than 10% gas, consistent with our liquids shift. We plan to drill 258 Barnett Combo wells in 2011. 
On our Barnett gas activity, essentially all of our Johnson County acreage is now held by production, till we plan to drill zero Barnett gas wells in 2011.
Moving to the Bakken. Per well results continue to be as expected, and we continue to prove up acreage outside our Core area. The newest area is Southwest of the Core, where we drilled several 640-acre space wells with good IPs. The Mandaree 4-15, 2-9, 10-5 and 6-20 wells IP-ed at maximum growth rates of 1,490, 1,358, 840 and 1,175 barrels of oil per day, respectively. We have 63% to 90% working interest in these wells. 
Our drilling within the partial Core area has also yielded the expected results, and we've seen no unusual declines here. Overall, we're happy with our North Dakota results. And this asset is currently our single largest oil contributor, although that will change within a year or two as the Eagle Ford ramps up. We plan to run 10 Bakken and Three Forks rigs in 2011. Also about 25% of our 2010 wells were 1,280-acre space laterals, and that 25% will grow to about 70% next year.
The Manitoba Waskada oil volumes are finally drilling after one of the wettest summers in 60 years, which inhibited our activity. Net production has increased 4,600 barrels of oil a day in January, and we expect a year-end exit rate of 7,700 barrels per day.
The last oil play I'll mention is the Niobrara in Northeastern Colorado. We're currently running three rigs here. Two recent wells, the Critter Creek #5-10H and #9-15H had IP rates of 690 and 748 barrels of oil per day on restricted chokes. And we have 100% working interest in both of these wells. Even though natural gas isn't currently in vogue, we have some upbeat news from the Marcellus and continued good news from the Haynesville-Bossier, where we're drilling to hold acreage.
In the Marcellus, we've modified our frac program in our first four wells on the EOG/NSG joint venture acreage with these new style completions are very strong. The Clearfield County counts the 34H, 35H, 37H and 38H wells IP-ed at 9.2, 8.5, 7.1 and 8 million cubic feet a day respectively. EOG has 50% working interest in these wells.
In our Haynesville-Bossier area, we continue to make good wells such as AC LCO #1, Black Stone 4 #5 and Fremont Farms #1 wells, which IP-ed at 34, 23, and 26 million cubic feet a day, respectively. We have 48%, 75% and 75% working interest in these wells. 
We've refined our mapping of the play's sweet spots. Although we're not known as a major Haynesville player, we believe EOG has a Haynesville-Bossier sweet spot acreage position that's as good or better than any other operator in the play. Current Investor Relations presentation has a chart showing EOG with 67% of our total acreage position in the sweet spots of this play. During 2011, we plan to drill the minimum number of wells here that is necessary to maintain our acreage position.
In the Horn River Basin, we're in the process of completing several wells. And early results from three wells completed in the EB section show IPs between 16 million and 22 million cubic feet a day. We won't be as active here in 2011, as we've been in 2010.
Outside North America, our Trinidad asset is currently in the production mode, and we will begin developments early on our Toucan discovery in the fourth quarter. This will provide deliverability to meet our 2011-13 gas contracts in China, we expect to frac another well, the third, by year end. 
Outside of operations, part of our business plan involves selling some assets to partially cover our expected 2010 and 2011 operating cash flow shortfall. At our April analyst meeting, our goal was to sell assets this year and maintain a maximum 25% net-debt-to-capital ratio. Since April, gas prices have obviously collapsed, so we've come up with a new capital plan. We expect to sell between 600 million and 1 billion of acreage and oil-producing assets this year, with almost all of that expected to close in the fourth quarter. I want to stress most of these deals are not yet closed.  For 2011, we plan to sell at least $1 billion of primarily gas acreage or producing properties. And we've raised the conceptual upper limit on our net-debt-to-total-cap ratio from 25% to between 30% and 35%. 
Unlike others, we don't intend to sell or JV any of our horizontal oil plays. We intend to emerge from this transformation retaining 100% of the oil and combo assets that we've captured. And we're willing to liquidate gas assets, gas acreage or assets to achieve that goal. I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financial and capital structure.

Regarding oil, we're still rationally bullish based on the fact that global oil demand is currently 86 million barrels a day, the same as in 2008. And the demand has rebounded very nicely for last year. It's worth noting that 2010 global oil demand growth is the second greatest in the past 30 years. We've increased our 2011 hedge position slightly and currently have 10,000 barrels of oil a day hedged at $90.39. 
Regarding North America natural gas, the question is, ""Can it get much lower?"" And I guess time will tell. I expect the gas rig count to fall by about 200 rigs by mid-2011. We currently have 150 million cubic feet hedged at 2011 at a $5.44 price and 200 million a day hedged for 2012 at a $5.57 price.
Now let me summarize. In my opinion, there are three points to take away from this call. First, beginning in 2011, we are now predominantly an oil company based on our anticipated revenue mix. And there is no other company our size that's growing oil and NGL volumes similar to EOG's rate. 
Second, our oil assets are generating consistent and repeatable results. I'm particularly pleased with the results this quarter from the Eagle Ford, Barnett Combo, Leonard and Bakken. Regarding the Eagle Ford, two recent industry transactions for acreage in the oil window have ratified our asset value, particularly when noting that we were the first mover and have a premier oil window acreage. 
And third, although our capital plan has changed a bit since April, we're on track to sell significant natural gas properties in 2010 and have additional sales planned for 2011. Additionally, we've pared our 2011 dry gas CapEx to absolute minimum level to hold our Haynesville, Marcellus and Horn River acreage positions. Our goal is to retain and develop 100% of our oil assets without incurring excessive debt, and if we lighten up on some natural gas assets in the process, so be it. 
Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A.

But I believe it's going to be year-end 2011 before we truly know if we have a firm project or not. So over the last three months, we've clearly made some headway, but it's just going to be a slow progress. I believe the project's got a pretty strong chance of actually happening. I think all the elements are in place for it, but we still got a ways to go. So what we've adopted in light of these very dismal North American gas conditions is, we've done enough science wells now in the Horn River to have a pretty good feel for reserves, potential per well, drillability and so on. And we're just going to, for 2011, just take a minimalist approach in terms of our CapEx related to Horn River drilling in that particular area.

And the Niobrara, we have divested a little bit of the 400,000 acres. But we'll definitely be keeping the majority of that 400,000 acres. The best way to explain all of this, Joe, is on the natural gas front, we've got a huge gas inventory clearly in the Haynesville/Bossier and the sweet spot hitting probably between nine and 10 Tcf. We're quite encouraged now with the Marcellus on our combined EOG/NFG acreage. We know we've got a ton of gas in the Horn River and certainly a bunch in the Uinta basin and some in Johnson County in the Barnett. And what we'd be looking at selling over the next 18 months are our properties that perhaps are long-life existing gas properties that may be time to pass down to another operator. We're a company that over the last decade, we haven't sold much. We've been in accumulating mode that whole time, so we've got a pretty good inventory of existing properties to liquidate. And there are buyers out there, even at these kind of gas price conditions. And so we'll be liquidating some of those and also on some acreage that either we have to invest in drilling-wise or the Ford expires or something along those lines. So what we want to do is we want to emerge from this with the horsepower for gas of all those core plays I just mentioned to you. So if it turns out that the gas turns out to be a bullish commodity over the next five or eight years, we've got a kind of horsepower there. And we want to emerge from this with essentially 100% of all of our oil and combo plays. We believe we can do that during the next year or two, even while we're liquidating some gas-producing assets and some portions of some acreage.

If I give you one primary reason why we've had to lower our volume estimates here, it's been lack of availability of frac equipment. And as I mentioned earlier, we're literally just, in essentially every division, we're literally waiting months, not weeks, not days, months for availability of frac equipment. And the costs of that equipment, when it does show up, is I'd say have increased dramatically from our April analyst conference. And that's just the situation. We have to come up with a plan to obliterate that. And we have a plan, and we'll articulate it more clearly as we get to mid-year next year.

So we have extended our lateral links probably for an average of I think 3,500 feet in both areas in the past to maybe 4,000 feet in the Northeast and as Mark said earlier, about 6,000 feet in the Southwest. And the uplift that we're showing on our EUR is just really, you can tie almost all of that uplift just for the longer laterals at this point.

We all knew that we want to complete these wells in bunches, four, five or six wells together. But what we assumed back in April was, if we called up a service company and say, we need you to frac a well in three weeks, that they'd show up in three weeks and we'd then frac five or six wells simultaneously. Now what we're finding is you have to schedule this four our five months in advance. And instead of three weeks, you're really looking at four to five months to get those things done. And what it does is it sets you back the whole, not one well but six wells. Production comes online many, many months later than what you expected. And then what it does for you is, we assumed we'd have an exit rate in December of this year, we'll say X back in April. Now we know that exit rate is going to be less than that and so that's why the gross volumes that were projected now and for 2012 are going to be less. We're sill going to have pretty dramatic year-over-year production, but we're compounding off a lower base than what we previously expected because we didn't achieve our this goal this year. And then we built into it the fact that miraculously this frac equipment does not become instantly available on January 1 of '11. We don't see any real improvement there. The biggest improvement we're going to see, we believe, in the frac equipment, sort of us outsourcing is, if the gas rig count drops by a couple of hundred rigs. And we believe by mid-next year, my guess is 200 rigs. Gary Thomas is guessing 300 rigs, the drop in gas rig count. When that happens, if that happens, then all of a sudden, whatever frac equipment is tied up there becomes available for oil plays. So we're kind of hoping that happens for multiple reasons, one is a great gas mark and two is just backup free up equipment. Hopefully, I gave you a little more color there, Brian.

And the industry is doing the same thing up there. And when we started out in Eagle Ford, the data that we had back in April were really based on 2,900-foot laterals. And today, we're talking about 4,000 to 6,000-foot laterals. So if you go out a couple of years for, say, the Eagle Ford, it wouldn't surprise me if we end up talking about routinely 8,000 to 10,000-foot laterals. Because the reserves, one thing we found in pretty much all of these resort plays are the reserves are just a linear function of the lateral length. If you drill oil with twice the lateral length, you're likely to get twice the reserves. And the same thing will hold true for any of the other plays, whether it be the Leonard Shale, the Combo play or some of these things. So in many cases, you've got some limitations there, if you've got a lot of fall patterns. So the more highly focused an area is, you can't can go out and drill a 10,000 or 14,000-foot lateral. But the sense of the industry moving to longer laterals in all the play will very definitely occur.

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing the third quarter of 2010 earnings and operational results.
This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. 
This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. 
Effective January 1, 2010, the SEC now permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve disclosures on this conference call and webcast, including those for the South Texas, Eagle Ford, Barnett Combo and New Mexico Leonard plays may include potential reserves or estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC’s latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website.
With me this morning are Loren Leiker, Senior EVP Exploration; Gary Thomas, Senior EVP, Operations; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President of Investor Relations. An updated Investor Relations presentation was posted to our website last night. We included 2010 and revised preliminary volume estimates for 2011 and 2012.
We've reduced our full year 2010 growth guidance from 13% to 9%. About 70% of this reduction relates to North American natural gas volumes, where we're now projecting minus 2% growth versus the previous estimate of plus 2%. Obviously, in this price environment, we're not incented to grow gas volumes. Our conversion from a natural gas to an oil company is still on track. And we expect total crude, condensate and natural gas liquids to comprise approximately 67% of our 2011 North American revenues. 
However, because of lower cash flows from weak gas prices, higher frac costs, delays in frac equipment availability and the pattern drilling used to maximize resource plays, we've also reduced our 2011 and 2012 liquids growth targets to better reflect real-world conditions. Even with these reductions, we expect to grow crude and condensate 36%, 53% and 30% in 2010, '11 and '12. We've also made progress regarding asset sales, and I'll report on that later in the call. 
I'll now review our third quarter net income and discretionary cash flow. Then I'll provide some operational highlights and discuss our capital structure. Tim Driggers will provide some financial details. And I'll close with comments regarding our macro hydrocarbon view and concluding remarks.
As outlined in our press release, for the third quarter, EOG reported a net loss of $70.9 million or $0.28 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark-to-market impacts of certain onetime adjustments as outlined in the press release, EOG's third quarter adjusted net income was $46.6 million or $0.18 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the third quarter was $755.4 million.
I'll now address operational results, and I'll start with the South Texas Eagle Ford. The bottom line here is that our confidence in individual well results and a total 900 million barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty reserve estimate, has increased since our April analyst conference. Because this is such a huge net oil accumulation, and I believe investors have undervalued this asset, I'm going to take several minutes and provide an update based on our results from the last six months. Our press release provided details on a number of good wells, most of which have only commenced sales in the last month. 
Here's what we know right now about our asset after drilling 77 wells, 59 of which are either producing or shedding for off-site fracs or waiting on fracs. First, the Eagle Ford formation is not a typical shale. But instead, it's a borderline conventional carbonate reservoir. Pressure and flow data from our wells indicate we're seeing a lot of matrix flow, i.e., a significant amount of flow from the rock fabric itself, which is a good sign. 
Second, the Eagle Ford is a predictable play. We've now drilled a large enough population of wells and we're getting very repeatable results across a 120-mile extent of our acreage block. 
Third, we've had a 100% well success rate within the acreage and the horizons we originally defined to contain our estimated 0.9 billion barrels. For a start-up play, this is outstanding. 
Fourth, for our 0.9 billion barrels of estimated reserves, the mix is 77% black oil. The oil in our portion of the reservoir has some unique characteristics that enhance the recovery factor. We've kept this information proprietary until now. But with our acreage tied up, we can now talk without losing a competitive advantage. I'll apologize in advance for getting too technical. But this is a very important point, because some analysts have expressed concern regarding recovery factors from a pure oil reservoir. Specifically, there is an extraordinarily high differential between the initial reservoir pressure and the pressure at which solution gas breaks out of the oil, technically called the bubble point pressure. Across our acreage, the original reservoir pressure averages 7,200 psi and the bubble point pressure averages 2,500 psi. This unusually high spread provides for a larger-than-normal fluid expansion recovery factor. That's why we're so confident with our 0.9 billion barrel reserve estimate.
Fifth, the reservoir can be broken into two zones, East and West. In the East, we have two targets, the Upper and Lower Eagle Ford. These zones are relatively thick and high-quality. A typical well here is the Harper #10H well, which IP’d at 1,070 barrels of oil per day and 980 Mcf per day. In this same area, the Cusack Clampit wells, which were highlighted in the press release, IP’d at rates ranging from 860 to 1,800 barrels of oil per day, with 1 to 1.8 million cubic feet a day of rich gas each. We have 100% working interest in all these Eastern wells. In this Eastern area, we’ll typically drill 4,000-foot laterals and expect average reserves per well of 460 Mboe net after royalty.
The Western area has only one target, the Lower Eagle Ford, and the rock is a bit thinner. Typical wells here are the Haynes #1H and Hoff #6H wells, which IP’d at 979 and 629 barrels of oil per day, respectively. We have 100% working interest in these wells also. To maximize our economics in the West, we'll drill 6,000-foot-long laterals and expect 430 Mboe per well net after royalty. These per well recoveries are considerably higher than we noted in April.
Sixth, the typical decline curve for both areas indicates we'll produce 40% of our wells' reserves in the first five years. We originally thought we'd need roughly 2,800 wells to capture the 0.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. But now it will take us a lot fewer wells to monetize this asset. 
Overall, we believe we can achieve a $12 to $15 per Boe direct finding cost across the entire play. We plan to run 14 rigs, drill 231 net Eagle Ford wells in 2011. 
And seventh, the direct rates of return that we expect to achieve from both East and Western wings of our sweet spot will return to the same rate of return goals as we gave at our April analysts conference. As we exit the science stage and enter the program drilling phase in 2011 and '12, we expect to achieve the between 66% and 95% direct after-tax rates of return. In order to decrease our average completed well costs back to the original range by the end of next year on a normalized lateral length basis, we're implementing drilling enhancements and completion design modifications as well as contractual and self-sourced frac solutions.
Let me take a minute here to discuss our volume growth projections. This applies not only to the Eagle Ford but also to our other oil resource plays. EOG is a company that has rarely missed its volume targets over the past 11 years. Yet now, we are revising our 2010-'12 numbers downward. Part of this is very simple. At current and projected gas prices, we have no interest in growing gas volumes. 
Regarding oil, our individual wells are performing as expected. But we underestimated the downtime for pattern drilling and delays for frac equipment. As we’ve previously stated, optimizing shale oil or gas recovery requires drilling five or six side-by-side wells, frac-ing them simultaneously and only then turning all wells to production. Therefore, if frac equipment is delayed, it doesn't affect only one well but cascades to five or six wells and the associated production. We believe our updated volume estimates now properly account for this methodology.
To give you a little more color on these frac equipment delays, we're currently experiencing delays in almost every one of our divisions and have about 100 wells experiencing delays. Since most of our budget is oil wells, this disproportionately affects oil volumes. These delays won't go away anytime soon. And our new 2011 and 2012 growth forecasts assume the frac delays continue until at least mid-2011.
Moving to an emerging oil play. We're pleased to report success on additional acreage in our New Mexico Leonard Shale. Last quarter, we told you we'd proven up 31,000 of our 120,000 net acres. And we can now report we've proven up an additional 18,000 acres. Our Elk Wallow 11 #1H and #2H wells are producing at 337 and 505 barrels of oil per day, with 3.1 million and 4.8 million cubic feet of rich natural gas, respectively from an upper and lower Leonard interval, indicating we have two separate targets in this area. We have 100% working interest in these wells. We expect our Leonard reserves will likely increase from the original 65 million barrels of oil equivalent, in our estimate. Because acreage explorations aren't as critical here, we'll develop this asset at a relatively slow pace in 2011. 
Our Barnett Combo results continue to be consistent, and we're in a steady manufacturing mode. For the second quarter in a row, we've expanded the Core area, this time from 150,000 to 160,000 acres. This play keeps getting bigger. Earlier this year, we highlighted our first very good horizontal well in the Eastern portion of our acreage, where we'd previously recorded only verticals. Since then, we've completed many successful Eastern area wells in horizontals and verticals. Recent successful horizontals are the Strickland A #2H, Settle C #3H and the Christian C #3H, with IP rates of 1,118, 731 and 954 barrels of oil per day, with 1.6 million and 2.1 million cubic feet a day of rich gas. EOG has working interests varying from 90% to 98% in these wells. 
Two successful vertical wells in the East are the Strickland #1 and Slagle #1, which IP’d at 865 and 539 barrels of oil per day. We have 96% and 100% working interests in these wells, respectively. 
We've also achieved good results in the Western portion of Montague County, with a Posey C#3H testing at 536 barrels of oil per day. We're currently operating 16 rigs in the Combo and plan to run 16 rigs here in 2011. 
One other interesting feature here, although the Combo produces about 1/3 oil, 1/3 NGLs and 1/3 residue gas, the current revenue split is over 90% liquids and less than 10% gas, consistent with our liquids shift. We plan to drill 258 Barnett Combo wells in 2011. 
On our Barnett gas activity, essentially all of our Johnson County acreage is now held by production, so we plan to drill zero Barnett gas wells in 2011.
Moving to the Bakken. Per well results continue to be as expected, and we continue to prove up acreage outside our Core area. The newest area is Southwest of the Core, where we’ve drilled several 640-acre spaced wells with good IPs. The Mandaree 4-15, 2-9, 10-5 and 6-20 wells IP’d at maximum growth rates of 1,490, 1,358, 840 and 1,175 barrels of oil per day, respectively. We have 63% to 90% working interest in these wells. 
Our drilling within the partial Core area has also yielded the expected results, and we've seen no unusual declines here. Overall, we're happy with our North Dakota results. And this asset is currently our single largest oil contributor, although that will change within a year or two as the Eagle Ford ramps up. We plan to run 10 Bakken and Three Forks rigs in 2011. Also about 25% of our 2010 wells were 1,280-acre space laterals, and that 25% will grow to about 70% next year.
The Manitoba Waskada oil volumes are finally drilling after one of the wettest summers in 60 years, which inhibited our activity. Net production has increased 4,600 barrels of oil a day in January, and we expect a year-end exit rate of 7,700 barrels per day.
The last oil play I'll mention is the Niobrara in Northeastern Colorado. We're currently running three rigs here. Two recent wells, the Critter Creek #5-10H and #9-15H had IP rates of 690 and 748 barrels of oil per day on restricted chokes. And we have 100% working interest in both of these wells. Even though natural gas isn't currently in vogue, we have some upbeat news from the Marcellus and continued good news from the Haynesville-Bossier, where we're drilling to hold acreage.
In the Marcellus, we've modified our frac program in our first four wells on the EOG/NSG joint venture acreage with these new style completions are very strong. The Clearfield County counts the 34H, 35H, 37H and 38H wells IP’d at 9.2, 8.5, 7.1 and 8 million cubic feet a day, respectively. EOG has 50% working interest in these wells.
In our Haynesville-Bossier area, we continue to make good wells such as AC LCO #1, Black Stone 4 #5 and Fremont Farms #1 wells, which IP’d at 34, 23, and 26 million cubic feet a day, respectively. We have 48%, 75% and 75% working interest in these wells. 
We've refined our mapping of the play's sweet spots. Although we're not known as a major Haynesville player, we believe EOG has a Haynesville-Bossier sweet spot acreage position that's as good or better than any other operator in the play. Current Investor Relations presentation has a chart showing EOG with 67% of our total acreage position in the sweet spots of this play. During 2011, we plan to drill the minimum number of wells here that is necessary to maintain our acreage position.
In the Horn River Basin, we're in the process of completing several wells. And early results from three wells completed in the EB section show IPs of between 16 million and 22 million cubic feet a day. We won't be as active here in 2011, as we've been in 2010.
Outside North America, our Trinidad asset is currently in the production mode, and we will begin development drilling on our Toucan discovery in the fourth quarter. This will provide deliverability to meet our 2011-13 gas contracts. In China, we expect to frac another well, the third, by year end. 
Outside of operations, part of our business plan involves selling some assets to partially cover our expected 2010 and 2011 operating cash flow shortfall. At our April analyst meeting, our goal was to sell assets this year and maintain a maximum 25% net-debt-to-capital ratio. Since April, gas prices have obviously collapsed, so we've come up with a new capital plan. We expect to sell between 600 million and 1 billion of acreage and/or producing assets this year, with almost all of that expected to close in the fourth quarter. I want to stress most of these deals are not yet closed. For 2011, we plan to sell at least $1 billion of primarily gas acreage or producing properties. And we've raised the conceptual upper limit on our net-debt-to-total-cap ratio from 25% to between 30% and 35%. 
Unlike others, we don't intend to sell or JV any of our horizontal oil plays. We intend to emerge from this transformation retaining 100% of the oil and combo assets that we've captured. And we're willing to liquidate gas assets, gas acreage or assets to achieve that goal. I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financial and capital structure."

For the third quarter 2010, total exploration and development expenditures were $1.5 billion, excluding asset retirement obligations. Total acquisitions for the quarter were $3 million. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $107 million.
During the third quarter, we accepted bids to sell a portion of our Canadian shallow natural gas assets for net proceeds of $320 million. Additionally, these assets were considered to be held for sale, and we recorded a pretax impairment of $280 million to write down these assets to fair value.
At quarter end, total long-term debt was $3.8 billion, and the debt-to-total-cap ratio was 27%. At September 30, we had $28 million of cash, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $3.7 billion and a net-debt-to-total-cap ratio of 27%.
Yesterday with earnings press release, we included a guidance table for the fourth quarter and the updated full year 2010. For the full year 2010, the effective tax range is 40% to 50%. Note that this is on a GAAP basis. We have also provided an estimated range for the dollar amount of current assets that we expect to record during the fourth quarter and for the full year.

Regarding oil, we're still rationally bullish based on the fact that global oil demand is currently 86 million barrels a day, the same as in 2008. And the demand has rebounded very nicely from last year. It's worth noting that 2010 global oil demand growth is the second greatest in the past 30 years. We've increased our 2011 hedge position slightly and currently have 10,000 barrels of oil a day hedged at $90.39. 
Regarding North America natural gas, the question is, ""Can it get much lower?"" And I guess time will tell. I expect the gas rig count to fall by about 200 rigs by mid-2011. We currently have 150 million cubic feet hedged at 2011 at a $5.44 price and 200 million a day hedged for 2012 at a $5.57 price.
Now let me summarize. In my opinion, there are three points to take away from this call. First, beginning in 2011, we are now predominantly an oil company based on our anticipated revenue mix. And there is no other company our size that's growing oil and NGL volumes similar to EOG's rate. 
Second, our oil assets are generating consistent and repeatable results. I'm particularly pleased with the results this quarter from the Eagle Ford, Barnett Combo, Leonard and Bakken. Regarding the Eagle Ford, two recent industry transactions for acreage in the oil window have ratified our asset value, particularly when noting that we were the first mover and have a premier oil window acreage. 
And third, although our capital plan has changed a bit since April, we're on track to sell significant natural gas properties in 2010 and have additional sales planned for 2011. Additionally, we've pared our 2011 dry gas CapEx to absolute minimum level to hold our Haynesville, Marcellus and Horn River acreage positions. Our goal is to retain and develop 100% of our oil assets without incurring excessive debt, and if we lighten up on some natural gas assets in the process, so be it.

The best way to explain all this, Joe, is on the natural gas front, we've got a huge gas inventory clearly in the Haynesville/Bossier and the sweet spot we think probably between nine and 10 Tcf. We're quite encouraged now with the Marcellus on our combined EOG/NFG acreage. We know we've got a ton of gas in the Horn River and certainly a bunch in the Uinta Basin and some in Johnson County in the Barnett. And what we'd be looking at selling over the next 18 months are our properties that perhaps are long-life existing gas properties that may be time to pass down to another operator. We're a company that over the last decade, we haven't sold much. We've been in accumulating mode that whole time, so we've got a pretty good inventory of existing properties to liquidate. And there are buyers out there, even at these kind of gas price conditions. And so we'll be liquidating some of those and also on some acreage that either we’d have to invest in drilling-wise or the Board expires or something along those lines. So what we want to do is we want to emerge from this with the horsepower for gas of all those core plays I just mentioned to you.

And the other avenues, we'll just say that we expect to have those in place approximately mid-2011. And at that time, we'll discuss exactly what those other avenues are. If I give you one primary reason why we've had to lower our volume estimates here, it's been lack of availability of frac equipment. And as I mentioned earlier, we're literally just, in essentially every division, we're literally waiting months, not weeks, not days, months for availability of frac equipment. And the costs of that equipment, when it does show up, is I'd say has increased dramatically from our April analyst conference. And that's just the situation. We have to come up with a plan to ameliorate that. And we have a plan, and we'll articulate it more clearly as we get to mid-year next year."

And we now know how long we can drill a lateral before we get in trouble with faulting and that sort of thing. So we have extended our lateral lengths probably for an average of, say, 3,500 feet in both areas in the past to maybe 4,000 feet in the Northeast and as Mark said earlier, about 6,000 feet in the Southwest. And the uplift that we're showing on our EUR is just really, you can tie almost all of that uplift just to these longer laterals at this point.

We only sold a portion of it. And basically, what's announced in the press release is only a portion of that gas. And in terms of monetizing some gas assets, yes, I would say that relative to our April analysts conference, we're now more likely, particularly in 2011, to monetize some producing gas assets more than we were previously. If you look at our projected volume growth in North American gas for 2010, 2011 and 2012, it's negative ’10 and '11 And I think it's plus 1% for 2012. And those projected sales are reflected in those volumes, so those volumes we provided are not pro forma. We're assuming that we sell property x say the first quarter next year, property Y by mid-year. And so that's one of the reasons why you're seeing negative North American volume growth. Our feeling is just on a macro view, I'd love to be more optimistic on gas. I hope I'm wrong. But we are so long on gas assets in this company that we can liquidate some of these gas assets and still retain tremendous horsepower if we decide to grow gas assets in 2013, '14 or ’15."

And the price, we'll tell you the first of the year. But it's going to be even higher than your worst case scenario to frac this well. And if you don't like that particular price or availability, well, we've got a lot of other people that are needing fracs.” So it’s I would say -- we certainly had a peak drilling activity several years ago, when gas was $9 or $10 and there was a frenzy of activity.

We all knew that we want to complete these wells in bunches, four, five or six wells together. But what we assumed back in April was, if we called up a service company and said, we need you to frac a well in three weeks, that they'd show up in three weeks and we'd then frac five or six wells simultaneously. Now what we're finding is you have to schedule this four or five months in advance. And instead of three weeks, you're really looking at four or five months to get those things done. And what it does is it sets you back the whole, not one well but six wells. Production comes online many, many months later than what you expected. And then what it does for you is, we assumed we'd have an exit rate in December of this year, we'll say X back in April. Now we know that exit rate is going to be less than that and so that's why the gross volumes that were projected now and for 2012 are going to be less. We're still going to have pretty dramatic year-over-year production growths, that we're compounding off a lower base than what we previously expected because we didn't achieve our goal this year. And then we build into it the fact that miraculously this frac equipment does not become instantly available on January 1 of '11. We don't see any real improvement there. The biggest improvement we're going to see, we believe, in the frac equipment, short of our self-sourcing is, if the gas rig count drops by a couple of hundred rigs. And we believe by mid-next year, my guess is 200 rigs. Gary Thomas is guessing 300 rigs, the drop in gas rig count. When that happens, if that happens, then all of a sudden, whatever frac equipment is tied up there becomes available for oil plays. So we're kind of hoping that happens for multiple reasons, one is average gas mark and two is just backup free up equipment. Hopefully, that gives you a little more color there, Brian."

And today, we're talking about 4,000- to 6,000-foot laterals. So if you go out a couple of years for, say, the Eagle Ford, it wouldn't surprise me if we end up talking about routinely 8,000- to 10,000-foot laterals. Because the reserves, one thing we found in pretty much all these resort plays are the reserves are just a linear function of the lateral length. If you drill a well with twice the lateral length, you're likely to get twice the reserves. And the same thing would hold true for any of the other plays, whether it be the Leonard Shale, the Combo play or some of these things. So in many cases, you've got some limitations there, if you've got a lot of fault patterns. So the more highly faulted an area is, you can't can go out and drill a 10,000- or 14,000-foot lateral.

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing the third quarter of 2010 earnings and operational results.
 This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call.
 This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.
 Effective January 1, 2010, the SEC now permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve disclosures on this conference call and webcast, including those for the South Texas, Eagle Ford, Barnett Combo and New Mexico Leonard Plays may include potential reserves or estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC’s latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website.
 With me this morning are Loren Leiker, Senior EVP Exploration; Gary Thomas, Senior EVP, Operations;  Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President of Investor Relations. An updated Investor Relations presentation was posted to our website last night. We included 2010 and revised preliminary volume estimates for 2011 and 2012.
 We've reduced our full year 2010 growth guidance from 13% to 9%. About 70% of this reduction relates to North American natural gas volumes, where we're now projecting minus 2% growth versus the previous estimate of plus 2%. Obviously, in this price environment, we're not incented to grow gas volumes. Our conversion from a natural gas to an oil company is still on track. And we expect total crude, condensate and natural gas liquids to comprise approximately 67% of our 2011 North American revenues.
 However, because of lower cash flows from weak gas prices, higher frac costs, delays in frac equipment availability and the pattern drilling used to maximize resource plays, we've also reduced our 2011 and 2012 liquids growth targets to better reflect real-world conditions. Even with these reductions, we expect to grow crude and condensate 36%, 53% and 30% in 2010, '11 and '12. We've also made progress regarding asset sales, and I'll report on that later in the call.
 I'll now review our third quarter net income and discretionary cash flows. Then I'll provide some highlights and discuss our capital structure. Tim Driggers will provide some financial details. And I'll close with comments regarding our macro hydrocarbon view in concluding remarks.
 As outlined in our press release, for the third quarter, EOG reported a net loss of $70.9 million or $0.28 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark-to-market impacts of certain onetime adjustments as outlined in the press release, EOG's third quarter adjusted net income was $46.6 million or $0.18 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the third quarter was $755.4 million.
 I'll now address operational results, and I'll start with the South Texas Eagle Ford. The bottom line here is that our confidence in individual well results and the total 900 million barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty reserve estimate, have increased since our April analyst conference. Because this is such a huge net oil accumulation, and I believe investors have undervalued this asset, I'm going to take several minutes and provide an update based on our results from the last six months. Our press release provided details on a number of good wells, most of which have only commenced sales in the last month.
 Here's what we know right now about our asset after drilling 77 wells, 59 of which are either producing or shedding for off-site fracs or waiting on fracs.
 First, the Eagle Ford formation is not a typical shale. But instead, it's a borderline conventional carbonate reservoir. Pressure and flow data from our wells indicate we're seeing a lot of matrix flow, i.e., a significant amount of flow from the rock fabric itself, which is a good sign.
 Second, the Eagle Ford is a predictable play. We've not drilled a large enough population of wells and we're getting very repeatable results across a 120-mile extent of acreage block.
 Third, we've had a 100% well success rate within the acreage and the horizons we originally defined to contain our estimated 0.9 billion barrels. For a startup play, this is outstanding.
 Fourth, for our 0.9 billion barrels of estimated reserves, the mix is 77% black oil. The oil in our portion of the reservoir has some unique characteristics that enhance the recovery factor.  We've kept this information proprietary until now. But with our acreage tied up, we can now talk without losing a competitive advantage. I'll apologize in advance for getting too technical. But this is a very important point, because some analysts have expressed concern regarding recovery factors from a pure oil reservoir. Specifically, there is an extraordinarily high differential between the initial reservoir pressure and the pressure at which solution gas breaks out of the oil, technically called the bubble point pressure.  Across our acreage, the original reservoir pressure averages 7,200 psi and the bubble point pressure averages 2,500 psi. This unusually high spread provides for a larger-than-normal fluid expansion recovery factor. That's why we're so confident with our 0.9 billion barrel reserve estimate.
 Fifth, the reservoir can be broken into two zones, East and West. In the East, we have two targets, the Upper and Lower Eagle Ford. These zones are relatively thick and high-quality. A typical well here is the Harper #10H well, which IP-ed at 1,070 barrels of oil per day and 980 Mcf per day. In this same area, the Cusack Clampit wells, which were highlighted in the press release, IP-ed at rates ranging from 860 to 1,800 barrels of oil per day, with 1 to 1.8 million cubic feet a day of rich gas each. We have 100% working interest in all these Eastern wells. In this Eastern area, we typically drilling 4,000-foot laterals and expect the average reserves per well of 460 Mboe net after royalty.
 The Western area has only one target, the Lower Eagle Ford, and the rock is a bit thinner. Typical wells here are the Haynes #1H and Hoff #6H wells, which IP-ed at 979 and 629 barrels of oil per day respectively. We have 100% working interest in these wells also. To maximize our economics in the West, we'll drill 6,000-foot-long laterals and expect 430 Mboe per well net after royalty. These per well recoveries are considerably higher than we noted in April.
 Sixth, the typical decline curve for both areas indicate we'll produce 40% of our wells' reserves in the first five years. We originally thought we'd need roughly 2,800 wells to capture the 0.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. But now it will take us a lot fewer wells to monetize this asset.
 Overall, we believe we can achieve a $12 to $15 per Boe direct finding costs across the entire play. We plan to run 14 rigs, drill 231 net Eagle Ford wells in 2011.
 And seventh, the direct rates of returns that we expect to achieve from both East and Western wings of our sweet spot will return to the same return goals as we gave at our April analysts conference. As we exit the science stage and enter the program drilling phase in 2011 and '12, we expect to achieve the 0.66 and 95% direct after-tax rates return. In order to decrease our average completed well costs back to the original range by the end of next year on a normalized lateral length places, we're implementing drilling enhancements and completion design modifications as well as contractual and self-sourced frac solutions.
 Let me take a minute here to discuss our volume growth projections. This applies not only to the Eagle Ford but also to our other oil resource plays. EOG is a company that has rarely missed its volume targets over the past 11 years. Yet now, we are revising our 2010-'12 numbers downward. Part of this is very simple. At current and projected gas prices, we have no interest in growing gas volumes.
 Regarding oil, our individual wells are performing as expected. But we underestimated the downtime for patent drilling and delays for frac equipment. As we previously stated, optimizing shale oil or gas recovery requires drilling five or six side-by-side wells, frac-ing them simultaneously and only then turning all wells to production. Therefore, if frac equipment is delayed, it doesn't affect only one well but cascades to five or six wells and the associated production. We believe our updated volume estimates now account for this methodology.
 To give you a little more color on these frac equipment delays, we're currently experiencing delays in almost every one of our divisions and have about 100 wells experiencing delays. Since most of our budget is oil wells, this disproportionately affects oil volumes. These delays won't go away anytime soon. And our new 2011 and 2012 growth forecasts assume the frac delays continue until at least mid-2011.
 Moving to an emerging oil play. We're pleased to report success on additional acreage in our New Mexico Leonard Shale. Last quarter, we told you we'd proven up 31,000 of our 120,000 net acres. And we can now report we've proven up an additional 18,000 acres. Our Elk Wallow 11 #1H and #2H wells are producing at 337 and 505 barrels of oil per day, with 3.1 million and 4.8 million cubic feet of rich natural gas, respectively from an upper and lower Leonard interval, indicating we have two separate targets in this area. We have 100% working interest in these wells.  We expect our Leonard reserves will likely increase from the original 65 million barrels of oil equivalent, in our estimate. Because acreage explorations aren't as critical here, we'll develop this asset at a relatively slow pace in 2011.
 Our Barnett Combo results continue to be consistent, and we're in a steady manufacturing mode. For the second quarter in a row, we've expanded the Core area. This time from 150,000 to 160,000 acres. This play keeps getting bigger. Earlier this year, we highlighted our first very good horizontal well in the Eastern portion of our acreage, where we'd previously recorded only verticals. Since then, we've completed many successful Eastern area wells in horizontals and verticals. Recent successful horizontals are Strickland A #2H, Settle C #3H and the Christian C #3H, with IP rates of 1,118, 731 and 954 barrels of oil per day. It's 1.6 million to 2.1 million cubic feet a day of rich gas. EOG has working interest varying from 90% to 98% in these wells.
 Two successful vertical wells in the East are the Strickland #1 and Slagle #1, which IP-ed at 865 and 539 barrels of oil per day. We have 96% and 100% working interest in these wells, respectively.
 We've also achieved good results in the Western portion of Montague County, with a Posey C#3H testing at 536 barrels of oil per day. We're currently operating 16 rigs in the Combo and plan to run 16 rigs here in 2011.
 One other interesting feature here, although the Combo increased about 1/3 oil, 1/3 NGLs and 1/3 residue gas, the current revenue split is over 90% liquids and less than 10% gas, consistent with our liquids shift. We plan to drill 258 Barnett Combo wells in 2011.
 On our Barnett gas activity, essentially all of our Johnson County acreage is now held by production, till we plan to drill zero Barnett gas wells in 2011.
 Moving to the Bakken. Per well results continue to be as expected, and we continue to prove up acreage outside our Core area. The newest area is Southwest of the Core, where we drilled several 640-acre space wells with good IPs. The Mandaree 4-15, 2-9, 10-5 and 6-20 wells IP-ed at maximum growth rates of 1,490, 1,358, 840 and 1,175 barrels of oil per day, respectively. We have 63% to 90% working interest in these wells.
 Our drilling within the partial Core area has also yielded the expected results, and we've seen no unusual declines here. Overall, we're happy with our North Dakota results. And this asset is currently our single largest oil contributor, although that will change within a year or two as the Eagle Ford ramps up. We plan to run 10 Bakken and Three Forks rigs in 2011. Also about 25% of our 2010 wells were 1,280-acre space laterals, and that 25% will grow to about 70% next year.
 The Manitoba Waskada oil volumes are finally drilling after one of the wettest summers in 60 years, which inhibited our activity. Net production has increased 4,600 barrels of oil a day in January, and we expect a year-end exit rate of 7,700 barrels per day.
 The last oil play I'll mention is the Niobrara in Northeastern Colorado. We're currently running three rigs here. Two recent wells, the Critter Creek #5-10H and #9-15H had IP rates of 690 and 748 barrels of oil per day on restricted chokes. And we have 100% working interest in both of these wells. Even though natural gas isn't currently in vogue, we have some upbeat news from the Marcellus and continued good news from the Haynesville-Bossier, where we're drilling to hold acreage.
 In the Marcellus, we've modified our frac program in our first four wells on the EOG/NSG joint venture acreage with these new style completions are very strong. The Clearfield County counts the 34H, 35H, 37H and 38H wells IP-ed at 9.2, 8.5, 7.1 and 8 million cubic feet a day respectively. EOG has 50% working interest in these wells.
 In our Haynesville-Bossier area, we continue to make good wells such as AC LCO #1, Black Stone 4 #5 and Fremont Farms #1 wells, which IP-ed at 34, 23, and 26 million cubic feet a day, respectively. We have 48%, 75% and 75% working interest in these wells.
 We've refined our mapping of the play's sweet spots. Although we're not known as a major Haynesville player, we believe EOG has a Haynesville-Bossier sweet spot acreage position that's as good or better than any other operator in the play. Current Investor Relations presentation has a chart showing EOG with 67% of our total acreage position in the sweet spots of this play. During 2011, we plan to drill the minimum number of wells here that is necessary to maintain our acreage position.
 In the Horn River Basin, we're in the process of completing several wells. And early results from three wells completed in the EB section show IPs between 16 million and 22 million cubic feet a day. We won't be as active here in 2011, as we've been in 2010.
 Outside North America, our Trinidad asset is currently in the production mode, and we will begin developments early on our Toucan discovery in the fourth quarter. This will provide deliverability to meet our 2011-13 gas contracts in China, we expect to frac another well, the third, by year end.
 Outside of operations, part of our business plan involves selling some assets to partially cover our expected 2010 and 2011 operating cash flow shortfall. At our April analyst meeting, our goal was to sell assets this year and maintain a maximum 25% net-debt-to-capital ratio. Since April, gas prices have obviously collapsed, so we've come up with a new capital plan. We expect to sell between 600 million and 1 billion of acreage and oil-producing assets this year, with almost all of that expected to close in the fourth quarter. I want to stress most of these deals are not yet closed.  For 2011, we plan to sell at least $1 billion of primarily gas acreage or producing properties. And we've raised the conceptual upper limit on our net-debt-to-total-cap ratio from 25% to between 30% and 35%.
 Unlike others, we don't intend to sell or JV any of our horizontal oil plays. We intend to emerge from this transformation retaining 100% of the oil and combo assets that we've captured. And we're willing to liquidate gas assets, gas acreage or assets to achieve that goal. I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financial and capital structure.

For the third quarter 2010, total exploration and development expenditures were $1.5 billion, excluding asset retirement obligations. Total acquisitions for the quarter were $3 million. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $107 million.
 During the third quarter, we accepted bids to sell a portion of our Canadian shallow natural gas assets for net proceeds of $320 million. Additionally, these assets were considered to be held for sale, and we've recorded a pretax impairment of $280 million to write down these assets to fair value.
 At quarter end, total long-term debt was $3.8 billion, and the debt-to-total-cap ratio was 27%. At September 30, we had $28 million of cash, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $3.7 billion and a net-debt-to-total-cap ratio of 27%.
 Yesterday with earnings press release, we included a guidance table for the fourth quarter and the updated full year 2010. For the full year 2010, the effective tax range is 40% to 50%. Note that this is on a GAAP basis. We have also provided an estimated range for the dollar amount of current assets that we expect to record during the fourth quarter and for the full year.

Regarding oil, we're still rationally bullish based on the fact that global oil demand is currently 86 million barrels a day, the same as in 2008. And the demand has rebounded very nicely for last year. It's worth noting that 2010 global oil demand growth is the second greatest in the past 30 years. We've increased our 2011 hedge position slightly and currently have 10,000 barrels of oil a day hedged at $90.39.
 Regarding North America natural gas, the question is, ""Can it get much lower?"" And I guess time will tell. I expect the gas rig count to fall by about 200 rigs by mid-2011. We currently have 150 million cubic feet hedged at 2011 at a $5.44 price and 200 million a day hedged for 2012 at a $5.57 price.
 Now let me summarize. In my opinion, there are three points to take away from this call. First, beginning in 2011, we are now predominantly an oil company based on our anticipated revenue mix. And there is no other company our size that's growing oil and NGL volumes similar to EOG's rate.
 Second, our oil assets are generating consistent and repeatable results. I'm particularly pleased with the results this quarter from the Eagle Ford, Barnett Combo, Leonard and Bakken. Regarding the Eagle Ford, two recent industry transactions for acreage in the oil window have ratified our asset value, particularly when noting that we were the first mover and have a premier oil window acreage.
 And third, although our capital plan has changed a bit since April, we're on track to sell significant natural gas properties in 2010 and have additional sales planned for 2011. Additionally, we've pared our 2011 dry gas CapEx to absolute minimum level to hold our Haynesville, Marcellus and Horn River acreage positions. Our goal is to retain and develop 100% of our oil assets without incurring excessive debt, and if we lighten up on some natural gas assets in the process, so be it.
 Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A.

I think all the elements are in place for it, but we still got a ways to go. So what we've adopted in light of these very dismal North American gas conditions is, we've done enough science wells now in the Horn River to have a pretty good feel for reserves, potential per well, drillability and so on. And we're just going to, for 2011, just take a minimalist approach in terms of our CapEx related to Horn River drilling in that particular area.

And the Niobrara, we have divested a little bit of the 400,000 acres. But we'll definitely be keeping the majority of that 400,000 acres. The best way to explain all of this, Joe, is on the natural gas front, we've got a huge gas inventory clearly in the Haynesville/Bossier and the sweet spot hitting probably between nine and 10 Tcf. We're quite encouraged now with the Marcellus on our combined EOG/NFG acreage. We know we've got a ton of gas in the Horn River and certainly a bunch in the Uinta basin and some in Johnson County in the Barnett. And what we'd be looking at selling over the next 18 months are our properties that perhaps are long-life existing gas properties that may be time to pass down to another operator. We're a company that over the last decade, we haven't sold much. We've been in accumulating mode that whole time, so we've got a pretty good inventory of existing properties to liquidate. And there are buyers out there, even at these kind of gas price conditions. And so we'll be liquidating some of those and also on some acreage that either we have to invest in drilling-wise or the Ford expires or something along those lines. So what we want to do is we want to emerge from this with the horsepower for gas of all those core plays I just mentioned to you. So if it turns out that the gas turns out to be a bullish commodity over the next five or eight years, we've got a kind of horsepower there. And we want to emerge from this with essentially 100% of all of our oil and combo plays.

We all knew that we want to complete these wells in bunches, four, five or six wells together. But what we assumed back in April was, if we called up a service company and say, we need you to frac a well in three weeks, that they'd show up in three weeks and we'd then frac five or six wells simultaneously. Now what we're finding is you have to schedule this four our five months in advance. And instead of three weeks, you're really looking at four to five months to get those things done. And what it does is it sets you back the whole, not one well but six wells. Production comes online many, many months later than what you expected. And then what it does for you is, we assumed we'd have an exit rate in December of this year, we'll say X back in April. Now we know that exit rate is going to be less than that and so that's why the gross volumes that were projected now and for 2012 are going to be less. We're sill going to have pretty dramatic year-over-year production, but we're compounding off a lower base than what we previously expected because we didn't achieve our this goal this year. And then we built into it the fact that miraculously this frac equipment does not become instantly available on January 1 of '11. We don't see any real improvement there. The biggest improvement we're going to see, we believe, in the frac equipment, sort of us outsourcing is, if the gas rig count drops by a couple of hundred rigs. And we believe by mid-next year, my guess is 200 rigs. Gary Thomas is guessing 300 rigs, the drop in gas rig count. When that happens, if that happens, then all of a sudden, whatever frac equipment is tied up there becomes available for oil plays. So we're kind of hoping that happens for multiple reasons, one is a great gas mark and two is just backup free up equipment. Hopefully, I gave you a little more color there, Brian.

So those are the two big components of it, Brian.

If you project that two or three years, when you look at the Bakken, when we started at the Bakken, you're looking at maybe 4,000-foot laterals, and now, we're kind of routinely talking about 5,000 to 10,000-foot laterals. And the industry is doing the same thing up there. And when we started out in Eagle Ford, the data that we had back in April were really based on 2,900-foot laterals. And today, we're talking about 4,000 to 6,000-foot laterals. So if you go out a couple of years for, say, the Eagle Ford, it wouldn't surprise me if we end up talking about routinely 8,000 to 10,000-foot laterals. Because the reserves, one thing we found in pretty much all of these resort plays are the reserves are just a linear function of the lateral length. If you drill oil with twice the lateral length, you're likely to get twice the reserves. And the same thing will hold true for any of the other plays, whether it be the Leonard Shale, the Combo play or some of these things. So in many cases, you've got some limitations there, if you've got a lot of fall patterns. So the more highly focused an area is, you can't can go out and drill a 10,000 or 14,000-foot lateral. But the sense of the industry moving to longer laterals in all the play will very definitely occur.

So we clearly have that, that we'll be working against. But of course, obviously, the margin, profit margin on an oil well is much higher than a gas well. But I can't give you a percentage or a number other than again, to defer to the next earnings call, we'll give some LOE guidance for the full year of 2011, relating to that. So that hopefully will give you a little bit of input there, Brian.
 I'd like to thank everyone for staying with the call. And once again, it's a case where EOG has been one of the most accurate companies on hitting volume targets for 11 years, but we just had a confluence of events here. But even once you get through the sticker stock of the lower volume growth that we're projecting, I don't think there's a company out there who's going to match our liquid volume growth for the next several years. And I also mentioned that the volume growth doesn't stop in 2012. It continues in '13, '14, '15, clearly on liquids side. We just haven't forecasted far out. So thank you very much.
