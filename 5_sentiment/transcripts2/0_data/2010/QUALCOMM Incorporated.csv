In the first quarter, we had continued strong operating performance, with pro forma earnings per share of $0.62, exceeding the high end of our prior guidance. Our results were driven by healthy demand for our chipsets, strong shipments of 3G devices by our licensees and lower operating expenses. Operating cash flow was $1.2 billion for the quarter, and we had approximately $18.9 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter.We continue to execute on our strategic objectives, see healthy growth in 3G and are very encouraged by customer traction with our new products, including our industry-leading Snapdragon chipset, as evidenced by the many recent product launches and announcements made by our partners. Industry analysts and trade groups report that approximately 85% of worldwide operators have now launched 3G networks, underscoring the continued migration of 2G to 3G. According to Wireless Intelligence, there are now approximately 945 million 3G subscribers worldwide, an increase of more than 30% year-over-year. Operators continue to leverage their 3G investments, with improvements in their mobile broadband offerings. With consumer demand for data services on the rise, we continue to see a growing number of innovative and exciting 3G devices. According to Informa Telecom, smartphone shipment as a percentage of total handset shipments are expected to increase from approximately 20% in 2009 to approximately 40% in 2014. The success of smartphones is creating an increased level of competition amongst traditional handset companies, as well as a new set of entrants buying to capture a piece of this fast-growing segment.The convergence of the computing consumer electronics and wireless markets is under way. We are seeing new emerging 3G connected device categories, such as Smartbook devices and eBook readers that provide exciting opportunities for us and our partners. The recent Consumer Electronics Show highlighted a significant increase in the level of innovation and competition for eBook readers, with 3G connectivity becoming a critical must-have feature. We believe that our mirasol display technology will further drive innovation in this space by providing color and video capability, while consuming much lower amount of power than traditional displays. We are ramping up to commercialize these capabilities in order to have mirasol color displays for eBook readers towards the end of calendar year 2010.Mobile data continued to be a key component of revenue growth for 3G operators around the globe. For example, according to the industry research, in the United States, 20% of Americans are accessing the mobile web everyday. And in Asia, Informa Telecom reports the ARPU of a 3G user is generally 25% higher than that of a 2G user. On a global level, according to analysts, service revenues for mobile broadband are expected to double from 2009 to 2013.North America continues to be one of the leading regions for advanced 3G devices in the world. Yesterday, Verizon announced quarterly wireless data revenue growth of greater than 26% over the last year, and those data revenues now account for 31.9% of all wireless service revenues, up from 26 1/2% reported in the fourth quarter of 2008.In addition, AT&T recently announced a significant initiative called apps for all, which aims to expand the universe of mobile applications beyond smartphones to more mobile devices. Included in this plan is a move to our Brew Mobile Platform on AT&T's Quick Messaging Device category, which according to AT&T is one of the company's fastest-growing category. Devices will begin rolling out in the second half of this year. By the end of 2011, AT&T expects the majority of their Quick Messaging Devices to be based on our Brew Mobile Platform. We are also seeing more innovation in data pricing strategies, with several operators recently announcing new pricing plans aimed at spurring data usage.In Europe, 3G growth continues despite continued economic headwinds. According to Wireless Intelligence, the number of European 3G subscribers exceeded 200 million during the fourth quarter of calendar 2009, representing more than a 45% year-over-year growth.Attractive new devices continued to be introduced and carriers remain committed to driving daily usage and connectivity, as evidenced by the relatively strong demand for 3G data modems in the region. The transition from HSPA+ has been a bit slower than forecasted, but download speeds of 21 megabits per second supported in HSPA+ is still expected to be the next data rate baseline according to a recent survey of operators by the Global Mobile Suppliers Association.Emerging regions will continue to be a key growth area for 3G in the years to come. Informa predicts that by 2012, emerging regions will account for more than 50% of 3G handset shipments. We are addressing these regions with products such as the QCT single-chip solution and the Brew Mobile Platform operating system. In China, operators have been focused on the aggressive buildout of their 3G networks. According to China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China's 3G carriers invested more than $20 billion in 3G infrastructure in 2009, including the deployment of 325,000 base stations.China Telecom has been successful with their initial focus on driving subscriber growth by leveraging there 1X network. Operator reports indicate they have added more than 28 million CDMA subscribers over the last 12 months. At the same time, they have been expanding their EV-DO Rev. A network, which now covers 340 cities. China Unicom has also been aggressively rolling out their 3G network and is reported that their network now covers approximately 300 cities with HSDPA download speed of greater than 7.2 megabits per second. With mature networks in place and operators gaining 3G experience, we expect a variety of new devices and services to be introduced in calendar year 2010 that will help to continue to drive growth in China.In India, recent reports indicate that 3G licenses are anticipated by the end of March. But this process has been delayed several times. So we will not attempt to predict exactly when licenses will be granted. In the meantime, operator reports indicate both BSNL and MTNL have launched HSPA services. And as of the end of December 2009, they have reached the subscriber base of just under 1 million. The Indian CDMA service providers have launched EV-DO mobile broadband services, with strong initial traction in USB modems and downloads.Latin America operators now reports 65 3G networks in operation, an increase of 18% as compared to last year. As a result, more than 50% of the population now has access to 3G services. In addition, 3G spectrum auctions are on the horizon in Mexico and Brazil, which will provide operators with additional spectrum to support 3G data services.Turning to the Licensing business. We continue to license and enable additional companies to manufacture and sell products for the growing 3G and future 4G ecosystems. We now have more than 100 CDMA-based licensees worldwide. We continue to make good progress with a single-mode 4G licensing program and have now signed long-term royalty-bearing 4G license agreements, which cover LTE and WiMAX, with the top three handset manufacturers in the world.Looking forward, we are reaffirming our calendar year 2010 3G device forecast, which is an increase of approximately 21% year-over-year based on midpoint estimates. As anticipated, we see a competitive pricing environment in chipsets this year, and we are leveraging the R&D investments we made to offer single-chip integrated solutions to target share gains in this environment. A subdued economic recovery in developed regions, including Europe and Japan, combined with the relative strength at the lower end of the market, is impacting our estimated 3G device average selling price and the chipset mix for this fiscal year. Accordingly, as Bill will cover in more detail, we are modestly reducing our revenue estimates to reflect this near-term market situation, but are maintaining our earnings per share guidance. The fundamentals of our business remained strong, as with the outlook for 2010 and beyond with the continuing migration of 2G to 3G and the introduction of new types of cutting-edge 3G devices. We continue to invest in innovative new products and solutions that will reinforce our leadership position and drive growth. That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf."

QCT continued our track record of strong execution, and I would like to discuss highlights. QCT shipped approximately 92 million chipsets in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. This is at the high end of our most recent guidance and a 46%",803,"Thank you, Steve. QCT continued our track record of strong execution, and I would like to discuss highlights. QCT shipped approximately 92 million chipsets in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. This is at the high end of our most recent guidance and a 46% increase compared to the same quarter a year ago. We generated revenue of approximately $1.6 billion, an increase of 21% year-over-year. Our earnings before tax for the quarter was $425 million, which is more than 150% higher than the year-ago quarter. Consistent with our previous guidance, the average revenue per MSM was approximately 6% lower than the previous quarter. As we anticipated, chipset demand increased for entry-level phones and USB modems, particularly for emerging markets and became a larger percentage of our total unit volume.We expect this trend to continue in the near term, indicating healthy demand for our data device chipsets and relative strength at the lower end of the market in multiple regions. In regions like China and Europe, the pace of transition to new technologies, such as EV-DO Revision A and HSPA+ has been slower than expected. Historically, the migration to new technologies has been one of the more difficult events to forecast. And in these cases, has been further complicated by macroeconomic conditions. These migrations are under way, but as yet, are not showing through in our product mix and average ASPs.We remain positive about the opportunities in 3G. We are confident in our position supporting products across all market segments. QCT has invested in highly-integrated products in recent years to specifically address the current market environment. We are thus able to offer compelling solutions for all device peers while also maximizing cost efficiencies. Our broad chipset roadmap has led to steady market share gains. For example, QCT UMTS shipments this quarter grew 52% year-over-year and our calendar 2009 UMTS shipments grew at a greater rate than overall UMTS device shipments. And we believe the continue to build share this segment.Adding to our confidence in our market position, QCT are seeing growth in designing activity across our entire portfolio products over the last quarter. As seen in the most recent Consumer Electronics Show, our first-generation Snapdragon chipset helped power some of the most compelling devices in the market today, including the Google Nexus One smartphone and the Lenovo Skylight Smartbook device. Other Snapdragon-enabled products introduced to the market includes Lenovo IdeaPad U1 hybrid, Sony Ericsson's XPERIA X10, HTC's HD2 and LG's eXpo. The fact that the new devices are based on a variety of different high-level operating systems, underscores the breadth of our software capabilities. QCT's chipsets power the vast majority of smartphones in the market today running Android and Windows, and we continue to expand our support for other high-level operating systems, such as Symbian and Chrome. As these products begin to ship in volume and additional device is launched over the next three quarters, we expect the industry momentum behind our integrated product offerings will continue to grow.For mass-market device categories beyond smartphones, Qualcomm's Brew Mobile Platform is being adopted by AT&T for their fast-growing quick messaging category as part of the apps for all initiative. Brew Mobile platform will enable carries like AT&T to expand the capabilities offered by their mass-market devices and provide an enhanced data experience. For the most cost-sensitive segments of the market, our QCS single-chip solutions are enabling affordable yet fully featured devices. Huawei recently launched a handset in Indonesia and South America based on our QSC1110 solution that features a QWERTY keyboard and a emphasis on access to social networks. Our cost-effective integrated solutions position us well for the emerging geographies where open markets dominate the distribution channels.We recently announced that we are working on 28-nanometer process geometry with both TSMC and GLOBALFOUNDRIES. QCT's emphasis on integration allows us to take full advantage of this new technology. Our fundamental approach of offering as much functionality as possible in one chip allows us to reap the technology and cost-saving benefits of investing in the 28-nanometer node. Discrete solutions will not gain the same benefit from the smaller geometries.QCT is leading and collaborating with our diverse base of foundry partners to drive the fabless industry towards commercialization of 28-nanometer. As seen over the past several quarters and most recently at CES, the merger of the consumer electronics and wireless industries is taking shape. QCT is well positioned to lead this trend and there's an increasing breadth of customers, many from outside the traditional wireless industry who are relying on us to help them succeed in this converged marketplace. With our technology leadership and broad chipset roadmap, we view the current competitive market environment as an opportunity to further leverage our strengths and to target gain share. Thank you, and I will turn this call over to Bill Keitel."
33493,67259608,47218,"QUALCOMM Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2010",2010-01-27,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with a review of our first quarter results. Revenues of $2.67 billion were up 6% year-over-year, better than the midpoint of our prior guidance. Pro forma operating income was $1.1 billion, up 15%",1021,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with a review of our first quarter results. Revenues of $2.67 billion were up 6% year-over-year, better than the midpoint of our prior guidance. Pro forma operating income was $1.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Pro forma earnings per share were $0.62, exceeding the high end of our prior guidance. Pro forma combined R&D and G&A expenses decreased approximately 5% compared to the prior quarter and were modestly better than our guidance.We shipped 92 million MSM chips during the quarter and average revenue per MSM declined sequentially, consistent with our estimates. We estimate that our licensees shipped approximately 133 million new CDMA devices in the September 2009 quarter, slightly above the midpoint of our prior guidance. We estimate the average selling price of CDMA devices was approximately $184 per unit in the September quarter, below our prior estimate of approximately $198. This reflect greater-than-expected price erosion within certain developed regions, including Europe and Japan, as well as greater overall mix of lower-tier device shipments, including data cards.During the quarter, we finalized the accounting treatment of the Samsung license renewal, including the non-refundable lump sum payments totaling $1.3 billion and an estimated fair value of $136 million in intangible assets for the patents assigned as part of the agreement. Revenue will be recognized over the 15-year life of the agreement on a straight-line basis effective January 2009. And the intangible asset value is being amortized to cost of sales beginning from the date that patents were assigned. As such, our fiscal first quarter results include $71 million in revenue attributable to fiscal 2009.Operating cash flow was approximately $1.2 billion. Cash and marketable securities grew to a total of $18.9 billion at the end of the first quarter, including $8.6 billion onshore and $10.3 billion offshore. During the first fiscal quarter, we paid dividends of $284 million or $0.17 per share. And on January 7, we announced another cash dividend of $0.17 per share payable on March 26.Turning now to our guidance. We estimate that approximately 144 million to 149 million CDMA-based devices shipped in the December quarter. And that calendar 2009, CDMA device shipments were approximately 515 million to 520 million new devices. Based on the midpoint of this new estimate, 2009 CDMA device shipments grew approximately 8% year-over-year. Furthermore, we estimate approximately 210 million CDMA2000 units and 308 million WCDMA units were shipped worldwide in calendar year 2009.We are reaffirming our estimates that calendar 2010 CDMA device shipments will be between 600 million and 650 million devices, an increase of approximately 16% to 25% year-over-year. We estimate that of the 625 million device midpoint, approximately 231 million units will be CDMA2000 and approximately 394 million units will be WCDMA.We anticipate average selling prices for CDMA2000 and WCDMA devices combined will decrease approximately 9 1/2% year-over-year to approximately $181 for fiscal 2010. Expectations for a subdued economic recovery in developed regions such as Europe and Japan, increasing price competition in the smartphone segment and relative strength of the lower end of the market are decreasing our estimated 3G device average selling price for this fiscal year.Our fiscal year guidance continues to include revenue from the potential resolution of the two licensee disputes we disclosed in November. One licensee continues to pay, but we are deferring revenue recognition and preceding with arbitration. The second licensee is underpaying. Accordingly, our fiscal first quarter results and second quarter guidance reflects less licensing revenues than we believe we truly earned because of these disputes.If these disputes are favorably resolved in fiscal 2010, the associated revenue benefit will be in the range of approximately $200 million. There is the potential that one or both of these disputes will not be concluded this fiscal year.We also continue to estimate that the average QTL royalty rate for fiscal 2010, as you calculate it with the information we've provide, and excluding revenue related to the two licensee disputes, to be approximately equal to the rate of our fourth fiscal quarter 2009.As we mentioned in November, QCT is proactively addressing the competitive dynamics in their market. We've made investments in recent years, focused on single-chip products and these chipsets enable us to offer a compelling lower-priced solutions while maintaining gross margin percentages through manufacturing cost reductions. Although we expect our chipset average selling price to decrease more this fiscal year than in prior years, as we ship a greater mix of single-chip products and lower-end products, we are targeting market share gains and leveraging our technology and integration leadership.Based on the current business outlook, we are refining our fiscal 2010 revenue guidance. We now expect fiscal 2010 revenues to be in the range of approximately $10.4 billion to $11 billion as compared to our prior estimate of $10.5 billion to $11.3 billion . We are reaffirming our fiscal 2010 earnings per share guidance. We anticipate pro forma earnings per share to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.30, an increase of 60% to 76% year-over-year.We expect the combination of pro forma R&D and SG&A expenses to increase approximately 3% year-over-year, lower than our prior guidance of approximately 4% growth. We estimate our pro forma annual tax rate to be between 21% to 22%, consistent with our prior expectation. For the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we estimate revenues will be in the range of approximately $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. We estimate pro forma earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter to be approximately $0.49 $0.53. We anticipate shipments of approximately 88 million to 82 million MSM chips during the March quarter and our estimate for CDMA channel inventory is consistent with our prior expectations and remaining at the low end of this historical range.We estimate that new CDMA-based devices shipped in the December quarter had an average selling price of approximately $179 per unit. We anticipate second fiscal quarter pro forma R&D, SG&A expenses combined will increase sequentially, approximately 8%, reflecting normal seasonality, as well as increased investment in select R&D programs and increased patent filings. That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw."

Recall though, although we gave that guidance in November, as of that time, we really essentially had no licensee reports. That was just a pure estimate and then licensee reports came in subsequent to that. We did see some trends that I think we'll use going forward, namely that we see some markets that we think is showing a trend of unloading some phones in this quarter.

And for the coming quarter, you're somewhat below that at 179, having seen a fairly significant decline from 196 in the June period. What's your expectation in terms of what you think is going to happen that will ebb the ASP higher as you move through the year to get to that 181 average? And then, Steve, clearly, the mix in terms of your ASP is lower. Can you just give us some framework for thinking about how you look for it to progress through the year? Should this rate of broad slippage in the ASP be continued through the fiscal year? And it looks as -- well, you've guided the OpEx but are you going to see significant saving, Bill, in the OpEx in the back half of the year, given what you said about sustaining the EPS?"

I'm also very pleased with our financial performance this quarter. Our revenues of $2.66 billion and pro forma earnings per share of $0.59 were very strong and exceeded the high end of our prior guidance.
These results were driven by healthy 3G device shipments and greater than expected demand for our chipsets. We also returned approximately $2 billion in capital to shareholders this past quarter, including $1.7 billion in share repurchases. And we announced a 12% increase in the dividend and an additional Board of Directors authorization of $3 billion for share repurchases.
As I indicated, we had a very strong quarter. Now given our knowledge of how the quarter was developing, we do not think it'd be appropriate until after our earnings report to implement our 10b5-1 plan that we'll use to execute on the new buyback authority. So we anticipate getting that plan finalized in the near future and anticipate the buybacks will commence under it as appropriate.
Device market has developed much as we had expected, with a bit stronger December quarter for CDMA-based devices across most regions. In fact, despite a challenging economic environment in calendar year 2009, we now estimate that 3G device shipments increased by approximately 7% for the year based on midpoint estimate. In addition, in calendar year 2010, we estimate 3G device shipments will grow approximately 23% based on the midpoint of our current estimates.
According to Wireless Intelligence, 3G subscribers have now surpassed 1 billion worldwide, the 3G auction underway in India, the global 3G footprint is a step closer to completion.
As we announced today, we're modifying the information we provide on our Licensing business, including now the addition of total subscriber unit sales as reported to us by our subscriber licensees. Bill is going to be providing more detail on this topic. But with respect ASPs and unit shipments, we believe we have improved our estimating process and will continue to provide quarterly reports on a  historical basis, fiscal year guidance in the case of ASPs and calendar year guidance in the case of unit shipments. With respect to our current guidance for ASPs, we do expect that fiscal 2010 ASPs will be down slightly from previous expectations.
Chip business continued to execute well, and we're pleased with the demand we're seeing across all product tiers in what continues to be a very competitive 3G chipset market. Our Licensing business continues to expand, particularly in China, where we have signed seven new license agreements so far this year, bringing our total over 55 Chinese licensees. And in terms of key industry trends, the Smartphone segment is continuing its strong momentum, driven by increased innovation and competition, and is taking an increasing share of what typically has been the Feature Phone segment.
According to Informa, smartphone sales are projected to increase approximately 33% year-over-year in 2010. That number would be even greater if they had included Brew MP-based smartphones in their numbers. We're also pleased to see more and more operators experimenting with variable pricing plans for 3G data services as we see this as one of the catalysts for ramping 3G adoption going forward.
Across the industry, device manufacturers continue to add 3G connectivity to a growing list of products outside the traditional handset market. While USB dongles and embedded notebooks continue to drive the majority of non-handset 3G unit volumes, new and emerging categories are gaining traction.
Let's move to the region. In North America, we continue to see both significant innovation on the Smartphone front and also an operator focus on the Prepaid segment, driven partially by the macroeconomic environment and also by the level of subscriber penetration that the regions now reach. The region does continue to be a hotbed for launching new, innovative devices. According to a Nielsen survey, sales of smartphones are expected to overtake feature phones by the end of next year, climbing steadily over the next 18 months, just under 50% of the total handset sales. 
We're also pleased with the National Broadband Plan that was released by the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] last month. The plan contains a number of recommendations that we believe will benefit the industry and the public, including the reallocation of 500 megahertz of additional spectrum for mobile broadband over the next decade, and the creation of a new Mobility Fund to provide federal funding to 3G buildout in rural areas, and also other recommendations to foster greater use of mobile broadband to improve education, health care, public safety and for the rollout of Smart Grid.
With respect to Europe, we're encouraged by a recent 3G device trends in Western Europe and the growing adoption of 3G in Eastern Europe. We continue to see strength of 3G data devices, but some continued traction with 2.5G devices in Western Europe. 
Looking forward, we're encouraged by some of the innovative and affordable 3G devices announced to be in Europe this year, which will help drive 3G into additional market segments. 
And in addition, operators continue to upgrade their existing 3G network. According to GSA, globally, 103 operators have committed to HSPA+ network deployment in 51 countries, with 52 networks already in commercial service. And of the commercial networks, greater than 50% of those are in Europe.
In China, the 3G networks are in place, and the ecosystem is developing to meet the market need. Today, most of the growth has been in lower-priced voice-centric devices as operators are focused on achieving subscriber growth target. Going forward, we expect that the breadth and depth of 3G devices available to consumers will increase. China Telecom reported the launch of 68 new 3G device models in the last two quarters, and China Unicom has reported that they plan to launch 200 WCDMA handsets this year.
In India, we're pleased to see the 3G spectrum auctions underway and look forward to additional operators and competition to provide affordable 3G mobile Internet to this market. With India's low penetration of fixed broadband access in PCs, we see the opportunity for 3G wireless to play a key role in providing Internet access to this underserved market. 
And with 65 3G networks launched in Latin America, focus there has turned to optimizing networks to support the consumer data demand. We're pleased to see additional spectrum availability with 3G spectrum auctions planned in Colombia, Mexico and Brazil. The data modems in the region continue to account for roughly half the 3G device demand. We believe that lower 3G handset pricing and availability should drive greater 3G handset volumes in the future.
So looking forward, calendar year 2010 3G device shipments are progressing in line with our expectations. Our Chip business is well positioned for growth, with forecasted MSM shipments of approximately 100 million for the next quarter. 
So based on the positive momentum we're seeing in our Licensing and Chipset business, we're pleased to be raising our fiscal 2010 midpoint earnings guidance. 
And that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf."

Our QCT business continues to execute well, and I'd like to share some highlights from the second fiscal quarter of 2010. 
We shipped approximately 93 million chipsets, which is at the high end of our most recent guidance and constitutes an increase of 35% over the same period last year. We saw a continued strength in our 3G device shipments and believe that we gained share during this period. 
We've also gained new customers, particularly in the emerging markets. Over the past 18 months, we have nearly doubled our already extensive customer base in China. We generated revenue of approximately $1.5 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Our earnings before tax was $344 million, 59% higher compared to the year-ago quarter. Our average revenue per MSM declined in the second quarter. This was in line with our expectations and is typical for the first calendar quarter of the year.
Looking forward, we're forecasting shipments in the range of 97 million to 102 million chipsets in the third fiscal quarter, driven primarily by an increase in UMTS chipsets. Data-centric chipsets and products for emerging markets are expected to become a larger percentage of our total unit volume as new customers, particularly in China, continue to ramp production. 
We expect to continue to feel downward pressure on average revenue per MSM. Our focus on growing 3G shipments in a competitive current environment and investing in cost-competitive products with increased features and functions. As a result, we expect to deliver operating profit margins consistent with the previous guidance for the fiscal year.
Design traction of our highly integrated 7000 and 8000 series chipsets remains robust as is evidenced at both the Consumer Electronics Show in January and Mobile World Congress in February. We are excited to work with new customers such as Sony Ericsson as they ramp Android-based smartphones with our integrated solutions. 
Additionally, we continue to build momentum with leading smartphone software partners. Snapdragon will be the first platform supporting all Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 smartphones scheduled to begin launching later this year.
As mobile computing and consumer electronics converge, QCT is gaining new customers outside of the traditional handset space. This week, HP launched the Compaq AirLife 100 with Telefonica. The Compaq AirLife 100 is a smartbook based on our Snapdragon chipset and running the Android operating system. Additionally, Dell has unveiled their Mini 5 Android Tablet, also based on Snapdragon. We see the market embracing these new converged devices and expect the category to grow.
QCT is also making excellent progress with Brew Mobile Platform, which enables smartphone functionality in mass-market devices. The software ecosystem around Brew MP continues to grow with new network operators adopting Brew MP devices. HTC recently launched its first handset with Brew MP, the HTC Smart, which is now available in multiple markets around the world. We expect additional devices to be announced from multiple manufacturers over the next several quarters. QCT is continuing to work closely with handset and software partners to help bring mass-market smartphone features to all regions around the globe.
As mobile data usage continues to increase, network operators will look to new technologies to help accommodate the demand. We are working with several network operators, infrastructure vendors and device manufacturers to bring dual carrier HSPA+ and LTE to market and expect commercial launches of devices to begin during the second half of 2010 based on our MDM8220 and MDM9600. Additionally, QCT will begin sampling its FSM family of femtocell solutions next quarter. Our FSM products will be the industry's first to utilize the capabilities of HSPA+ and EV-DO Revision A and Revision B.
QCT continues to execute well in our core business and is bringing wireless to new device categories. The combination of our modem technology leadership, strong computing and multimedia capability, market-leading chipset portfolio and deep software and systems capability give us a strong, long-term position as the convergence of wireless computing and consumer electronics continues to drive new opportunity. 
Thank you. And then I'll now turn this call over to Bill Keitel."
33493,67259610,56976,"QUALCOMM Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with a few comments regarding the changes we've made our metrics for QTL.In addition to estimates of ASPs and unit shipments for CDMA-based device sales reported by our licensees, we will now be",1349,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with a few comments regarding the changes we've made our metrics for QTL.
In addition to estimates of ASPs and unit shipments for CDMA-based device sales reported by our licensees, we will now be providing total reported device sales, which is the sum of all subscriber licensee device sales reported to us by our licensees in a given period. We've provided this metric in our earnings release for the four quarters of fiscal 2009 and the first two quarters of fiscal 2010. We've also provided a range of total reported device sales that we estimate our subscriber licensees will report to us in this third quarter of fiscal 2010, and we intend to continue to provide this quarterly guidance going forward.
Utilizing our licensees' reports, as well as other information, including information from licensee audits and public information, we break down total reported device sales into our estimates of its two components: A unit shipment range and average dollars per unit, or ASP, that comprise the total reported device sales amount.
Based on additional information obtained this quarter and our ongoing analysis of CDMA device trends, as well as the assumptions we used to estimate unit shipments and ASPs, we are adjusting some of the underlying assumptions we use to estimate licensee unit shipments and ASPs. 
For comparative purposes, in today's earnings release, we have provided a table showing the impact of applying these adjusted estimation assumptions to the units and ASPs on a quarterly basis back through the beginning of fiscal 2009. As you can see, applying this analysis results in a higher ASP, a range of $2 to $8 per unit over the six quarters based on midpoints which we provided for comparative purposes. And likewise, it results in lower units, a range of 1 million to 5 million units per quarter based on midpoints, which again, are provided for comparative purposes.
To be clear, these updated estimates have no impact to QTL revenues for any of these periods. For quarterly guidance going forward, we intend to provide you with historical total reported device sales and estimates for prior period ASPs and unit shipments, applying our adjusted estimation assumptions. However, we will no longer provide quarter-forward guidance on quarterly ASPs and shipments. We have updated our estimated ranges for fiscal year ASPs and calendar year device shipments, and we intend to continue to provide such annual guidance going forward.
Turning now to our second quarter results, revenues of $2.66 billion and pro forma earnings per share of $0.59 were both above the high end of our prior estimates. QTL licensing revenues were stronger than expected this quarter. Total reported device sales were 13% higher sequentially, with midpoint device shipments higher by 17%, partially offset by a 4% decline in midpoint ASPs.
Total reported device sales were approximately $28 billion, and we estimate that 148 million to 152 million CDMA-based devices shipped in the December quarter, driven by strength in multiple geographies. We estimate that the ASP was approximately $182 to $188, reflecting a greater mix of lower-priced devices, modest price erosion and some foreign exchange impact. This decline was largely in line with our expectations.
QCT shipped 93 million chipsets, driven primarily by broad demand across all tiers of our chipset portfolio. QCT operating margin was 22% and was better than our expectations at the outset of the quarter, driven by favorable volumes. 
The combination of pro forma R&D and SG&A expenses grew approximately 10% sequentially, reflecting normal seasonality, as well as a bit higher than expected expenses for a substantial quantity of patent filing. 
Operating cash flow was $793 million, and our cash and marketable securities balance was $18.2 billion at the end of the quarter, including $7.1 billion onshore and $11.1 billion offshore. Our pro forma tax rate was approximately 21% in the second fiscal quarter, and we estimate our pro forma annual tax rate will be approximately 21% to 22% for fiscal 2010.
Our fiscal second quarter pro forma earnings per share is $0.08 favorable from our initial guidance midpoint of $0.51 at the outset of the quarter. QTL is approximately $0.04 higher, driven by  better than expected shipment volumes by our licensees. And QCT was better by approximately $0.03, driven by favorable demand and product mix. The impact of our share repurchase activity was approximately $0.005, with the remainder of the differential split between investment income, partially offset by increased expenses.
Turning to the CDMA-based devices, for calendar year 2009, we now estimate that 500 million to 516 million CDMA-based devices shipped, an increase of approximately 5% to 8% over our calendar year 2008 unit midpoint estimate. We continue to see healthy growth in global 3G sales and estimate that between 600 million and 650 million CDMA-based devices will be shipped in 2010.
Using the 500 million midpoint of our 2009 estimate, we estimate that in 2010, the number of CDMA-based devices will increase approximately 18% to 28% year-over-year. We estimate that of the midpoint 625 million CDMA-based devices, approximately 236 million units will be CDMA2000 and approximately 389 million units will be WCDMA.
Now turning to our financial guidance, we are reaffirming our revenue guidance and raising our earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2010. We expect fiscal 2010 revenues to be in the range of approximately $10.4 billion to $11 billion, consistent with our prior estimates. We anticipate pro forma earnings per share to be in the range of $2.21 to $2.32. 
We estimate that the average selling price of CDMA-based devices for fiscal 2010 will be approximately $182 to $188, with the $185 midpoint down slightly from our prior guidance midpoint of $187, driven by normal price erosion and an increased mix of lower-end devices. However, this was broadly in line with our prior expectations.
We also continue to estimate that the average QTL royalty rate for fiscal 2010 as you calculated with the information we provide, and excluding revenue related to two licensee disputes, as well as excluding the revenue from fiscal Q1 related to our accounting for Samsung, the catch-up in that quarter. We estimate that royalty rate still to be approximately equal for all of fiscal 2010 as it was to exiting the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009. We expect the combination of pro forma R&D and SG&A expense to grow approximately 4% year-over-year.
Turning to the third quarter of fiscal 2010. We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. We estimate pro forma earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter to be approximately $0.51 to $0.55. We estimate that our subscriber licensees will report total reported device sales of approximately $24 billion to $26 billion in the June quarter for shipments they made in the March quarter, down approximately 6% to 13% sequentially, reflecting largely the post-holiday seasonality.
We anticipate shipments of approximately 97 million to 102 million MSM units during the June quarter. Our estimate for CDMA channel inventory is largely consistent with our prior expectations, as we continue to estimate that it is at the lower end of the historical range. And further, we expect this to continue to be the case in the balance of this fiscal year. 
We anticipate third quarter fiscal pro forma R&D and SG&A expenses combined will increase sequentially approximately 2% to 3%, reflecting select growth in certain R&D programs.
We estimate the fiscal third quarter pro forma earnings per share based on our guidance midpoint of $0.53 per share will be sequentially lower by approximately $0.06. The majority of this decline, approximately $0.05 per share, is driven by our estimates of sequentially lower CDMA-based device shipments in the March quarter, again, coming off the seasonally high December quarter. The remaining $0.01 is primarily attributable to R&D.
In closing, we are pleased with our financial results this quarter. We're pleased to see global CDMA-based device sales growing consistent with our estimates and our businesses executing to their plans. That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw."

I think pricing is really in terms of the pricing that we've had to extend, it's been pretty much what we thought it was going to be the entire year. If you remember, we've been talking about how we thought it was a pretty challenging pricing environment. The issue that I think is another component of our ASP, if you just divide revenue by unit, is really mix. And I think that's the issue that we're seeing is that the percentage of our business that is low end and data-centric devices right now is still fairly high. That being said, we're very happy with the traction of 7k and 8k moving forward. As part of your second question, we feel we're building share. If you look at this quarter that we just reported on, we think we built share there. We also feel moving forward that we're building share, particularly in WCDMA. And I think it's coming from a couple of different places, primarily as people migrate towards smartphones, we're seeing them migrate a bit toward our integrated solutions. And so I think that's probably pretty good for our business. If you look at the sequential move in the Chip business, a lot of that is in WCDMA and that's primarily, we think will pick up our share."

We're also in a little bit of a transition period where we're transitioning over to where emerging market devices or data-centric devices are still a large portion of our shipments. And it hasn't transitioned over to the point where the smartphone-integrated solution ships are the large portion of the business yet. As I said before, we like the way that, that looks, the designing and the traction that we've seen throughout the year is actually consistent and actually maybe a little bit above than what we had originally planned. So we're happy about that. In terms of top line leverage, a lot of it depends on what the mix looks like, let's say, in the quarters that we're not guiding to, so in the second half of the year. Right now, I'll say the biggest part of the business that is difficult to predict is really how much of that is going to move toward data or to 1x.

As we said, it was in part from licensee audits as well as in part from some public data. And that caused us to update our estimation process and so that was the driver there. For the fiscal year, we gave you an estimate here.

The six quarters, the units did come down and the ASPs did come up. Again, we take that total reported subscriber royalty number that gets reported to us by our licensees. And as you know, historically, we've broken that down into two components, how much is ASP and how much is units. 1x the other equals that total. So because we got some new information that caused us to reconsider what we previously had for ASPs, the offset was in units. So ASP is a bit higher, unit's a bit lower, but it all has to triangulate back into that total reported number that comes from our licensees. So frankly, that was some of our discussion why we thought, going forward, investors might appreciate that we're dropping the ASP guidance on a one quarter forward basis, but we're introducing this new metric. So next quarter, when we report against that 24 billion to 26 billion estimate, we're reporting against an actual whereas if we were just giving you the ASPs and units, we'd be providing you an estimate of what our estimate had been.

We see it very much the same way. I'm very hesitant to project or to predict what's going happen beyond the June quarter, just because -- I think a lot of it depends on mix as what we're going to see. More generally, I just want to make sure it's clear. On a pricing environment, we've actually seen pricing throughout the year do things that are completely consistent with what we thought they were going to do in the November time frame again in January and again now. So pricing really has not anything unusual for us. The issue really is the ability to predict mix out beyond one quarter. And I think that's probably the reason why I don't want to say too much about the long-term profitability goals of QCT. But we definitely see, this year, June being the trough."

I'm very happy, as I said, with the way the quarter turned out, our ability to generate strong cash flows, return cash to our shareholders.

I'm also very excited about this growth in just the 3G market overall, particularly with the India 3G auctions just about to close. I think that's going to really give us an opportunity to breakout the ceiling just in the low end of that market and open up open up the high tier to us, which should have a very positive effect on the business. 
And as we talked about the trend towards smartphones. Obviously, the phones with Snapdragon, they're just coming out now. There's a lot more devices in the pipeline. We're seeing these higher-end chips continue to grow, but we expect that as those smartphones with Snapdragon in them gain more traction going to see a lot of opportunity for growth at the higher end of the Chip business, so we look forward to that as well. 
And also I should say the lower end of the Smartphone segment. The Smartphone segment is tearing a little bit as the future Phone segment seems to be either going up to the smartphone or down to the prepaid. And I think this lower end BMP, Brew Mobile Platform, smartphones are going to able to attract more of the high end of that what once was the future Phone segment. 
So we're looking forward to that, we're looking forward to obviously smartbooks and connected devices. And just the continued growth of the wireless industry as it grows to cover other segments of the market moving to other industries. Really, a ton of opportunity out there. So thanks very much.

I'm also very pleased with our financial performance this quarter. Our revenues of $2.66 billion and pro forma earnings per share of $0.59 were very strong and exceeded the high end of our prior guidance.
These results were driven by healthy 3G device shipments and greater than expected demand for our chipsets. We also returned approximately $2 billion in capital to shareholders this past quarter, including $1.7 billion in share repurchases. And we announced a 12% increase in the dividend and an additional Board of Directors authorization of $3 billion for share repurchases.
As I indicated, we had a very strong quarter. Now given our knowledge of how the quarter was developing, we do not think it'd be appropriate until after our earnings report to implement our 10b5-1 plan that we'll use to execute on the new buyback authority. So we anticipate getting that plan finalized in the near future and anticipate the buybacks will commence under it as appropriate.
Device market has developed much as we had expected, with a bit stronger December quarter for CDMA-based devices across most regions. In fact, despite a challenging economic environment in calendar year 2009, we now estimate that 3G device shipments increased by approximately 7% for the year based on midpoint estimate. In addition, in calendar year 2010, we estimate 3G device shipments will grow approximately 23% based on the midpoint of our current estimates.
According to Wireless Intelligence, 3G subscribers have now surpassed 1 billion worldwide, the 3G auction underway in India, the global 3G footprint is a step closer to completion.
As we announced today, we're modifying the information we provide on our Licensing business, including now the addition of total subscriber unit sales as reported to us by our subscriber licensees. Bill is going to be providing more detail on this topic. But with respect ASPs and unit shipments, we believe we have improved our estimating process and will continue to provide quarterly reports on a  historical basis, fiscal year guidance in the case of ASPs and calendar year guidance in the case of unit shipments. With respect to our current guidance for ASPs, we do expect that fiscal 2010 ASPs will be down slightly from previous expectations.
Chip business continued to execute well, and we're pleased with the demand we're seeing across all product tiers in what continues to be a very competitive 3G chipset market. Our Licensing business continues to expand, particularly in China, where we have signed seven new license agreements so far this year, bringing our total over 55 Chinese licensees. And in terms of key industry trends, the Smartphone segment is continuing its strong momentum, driven by increased innovation and competition, and is taking an increasing share of what typically has been the Feature Phone segment.
According to Informa, smartphone sales are projected to increase approximately 33% year-over-year in 2010. That number would be even greater if they had included Brew MP-based smartphones in their numbers. We're also pleased to see more and more operators experimenting with variable pricing plans for 3G data services as we see this as one of the catalysts for ramping 3G adoption going forward.
Across the industry, device manufacturers continue to add 3G connectivity to a growing list of products outside the traditional handset market. While USB dongles and embedded notebooks continue to drive the majority of non-handset 3G unit volumes, new and emerging categories are gaining traction.
Let's move to the region. In North America, we continue to see both significant innovation on the Smartphone front and also an operator focus on the Prepaid segment, driven partially by the macroeconomic environment and also by the level of subscriber penetration that the regions now reach. The region does continue to be a hotbed for launching new, innovative devices. According to a Nielsen survey, sales of smartphones are expected to overtake feature phones by the end of next year, climbing steadily over the next 18 months, just under 50% of the total handset sales. 
We're also pleased with the National Broadband Plan that was released by the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] last month. The plan contains a number of recommendations that we believe will benefit the industry and the public, including the reallocation of 500 megahertz of additional spectrum for mobile broadband over the next decade, and the creation of a new Mobility Fund to provide federal funding to 3G buildout in rural areas, and also other recommendations to foster greater use of mobile broadband to improve education, health care, public safety and for the rollout of Smart Grid.
With respect to Europe, we're encouraged by a recent 3G device trends in Western Europe and the growing adoption of 3G in Eastern Europe. We continue to see strength of 3G data devices, but some continued traction with 2.5G devices in Western Europe. 
Looking forward, we're encouraged by some of the innovative and affordable 3G devices announced to be in Europe this year, which will help drive 3G into additional market segments. 
And in addition, operators continue to upgrade their existing 3G network. According to GSA, globally, 103 operators have committed to HSPA+ network deployment in 51 countries, with 52 networks already in commercial service. And of the commercial networks, greater than 50% of those are in Europe.
In China, the 3G networks are in place, and the ecosystem is developing to meet the market need. Today, most of the growth has been in lower-priced voice-centric devices as operators are focused on achieving subscriber growth target. Going forward, we expect that the breadth and depth of 3G devices available to consumers will increase. China Telecom reported the launch of 68 new 3G device models in the last two quarters, and China Unicom has reported that they plan to launch 200 WCDMA handsets this year.
In India, we're pleased to see the 3G spectrum auctions underway and look forward to additional operators and competition to provide affordable 3G mobile Internet to this market. With India's low penetration of fixed broadband access in PCs, we see the opportunity for 3G wireless to play a key role in providing Internet access to this underserved market. 
And with 65 3G networks launched in Latin America, focus there has turned to optimizing networks to support the consumer data demand. We're pleased to see additional spectrum availability with 3G spectrum auctions planned in Colombia, Mexico and Brazil. The data modems in the region continue to account for roughly half the 3G device demand. We believe that lower 3G handset pricing and availability should drive greater 3G handset volumes in the future.
So looking forward, calendar year 2010 3G device shipments are progressing in line with our expectations. Our Chip business is well positioned for growth, with forecasted MSM shipments of approximately 100 million for the next quarter. 
So based on the positive momentum we're seeing in our Licensing and Chipset business, we're pleased to be raising our fiscal 2010 midpoint earnings guidance. 
And that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf."

Our QCT business continues to execute well, and I'd like to share some highlights from the second fiscal quarter of 2010. 
We shipped approximately 93 million chipsets, which is at the high end of our most recent guidance and constitutes an increase of 35% over the same period last year. We saw a continued strength in our 3G device shipments and believe that we gained share during this period. 
We've also gained new customers, particularly in the emerging markets. Over the past 18 months, we have nearly doubled our already extensive customer base in China. We generated revenue of approximately $1.5 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Our earnings before tax was $344 million, 59% higher compared to the year-ago quarter. Our average revenue per MSM declined in the second quarter. This was in line with our expectations and is typical for the first calendar quarter of the year.
Looking forward, we're forecasting shipments in the range of 97 million to 102 million chipsets in the third fiscal quarter, driven primarily by an increase in UMTS chipsets. Data-centric chipsets and products for emerging markets are expected to become a larger percentage of our total unit volume as new customers, particularly in China, continue to ramp production. 
We expect to continue to feel downward pressure on average revenue per MSM. Our focus on growing 3G shipments in a competitive current environment and investing in cost-competitive products with increased features and functions. As a result, we expect to deliver operating profit margins consistent with the previous guidance for the fiscal year.
Design traction of our highly integrated 7000 and 8000 series chipsets remains robust as is evidenced at both the Consumer Electronics Show in January and Mobile World Congress in February. We are excited to work with new customers such as Sony Ericsson as they ramp Android-based smartphones with our integrated solutions. 
Additionally, we continue to build momentum with leading smartphone software partners. Snapdragon will be the first platform supporting all Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 smartphones scheduled to begin launching later this year.
As mobile computing and consumer electronics converge, QCT is gaining new customers outside of the traditional handset space. This week, HP launched the Compaq AirLife 100 with Telefonica. The Compaq AirLife 100 is a smartbook based on our Snapdragon chipset and running the Android operating system. Additionally, Dell has unveiled their Mini 5 Android Tablet, also based on Snapdragon. We see the market embracing these new converged devices and expect the category to grow.
QCT is also making excellent progress with Brew Mobile Platform, which enables smartphone functionality in mass-market devices. The software ecosystem around Brew MP continues to grow with new network operators adopting Brew MP devices. HTC recently launched its first handset with Brew MP, the HTC Smart, which is now available in multiple markets around the world. We expect additional devices to be announced from multiple manufacturers over the next several quarters. QCT is continuing to work closely with handset and software partners to help bring mass-market smartphone features to all regions around the globe.
As mobile data usage continues to increase, network operators will look to new technologies to help accommodate the demand. We are working with several network operators, infrastructure vendors and device manufacturers to bring dual carrier HSPA+ and LTE to market and expect commercial launches of devices to begin during the second half of 2010 based on our MDM8220 and MDM9600. Additionally, QCT will begin sampling its FSM family of femtocell solutions next quarter. Our FSM products will be the industry's first to utilize the capabilities of HSPA+ and EV-DO Revision A and Revision B.
QCT continues to execute well in our core business and is bringing wireless to new device categories.

33493,67259610,56977,"QUALCOMM Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with a few comments regarding the changes we've made our metrics for QTL.In addition to estimates of ASPs and unit shipments for CDMA-based device sales reported by our licensees, we will now be",1349,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with a few comments regarding the changes we've made our metrics for QTL.
In addition to estimates of ASPs and unit shipments for CDMA-based device sales reported by our licensees, we will now be providing total reported device sales, which is the sum of all subscriber licensee device sales reported to us by our licensees in a given period. We've provided this metric in our earnings release for the four quarters of fiscal 2009 and the first two quarters of fiscal 2010. We've also provided a range of total reported device sales that we estimate our subscriber licensees will report to us in this third quarter of fiscal 2010, and we intend to continue to provide this quarterly guidance going forward.
Utilizing our licensees' reports, as well as other information, including information from licensee audits and public information, we break down total reported device sales into our estimates of its two components: A unit shipment range and average dollars per unit, or ASP, that comprise the total reported device sales amount.
Based on additional information obtained this quarter and our ongoing analysis of CDMA device trends, as well as the assumptions we used to estimate unit shipments and ASPs, we are adjusting some of the underlying assumptions we use to estimate licensee unit shipments and ASPs. 
For comparative purposes, in today's earnings release, we have provided a table showing the impact of applying these adjusted estimation assumptions to the units and ASPs on a quarterly basis back through the beginning of fiscal 2009. As you can see, applying this analysis results in a higher ASP, a range of $2 to $8 per unit over the six quarters based on midpoints which we provided for comparative purposes. And likewise, it results in lower units, a range of 1 million to 5 million units per quarter based on midpoints, which again, are provided for comparative purposes.
To be clear, these updated estimates have no impact to QTL revenues for any of these periods. For quarterly guidance going forward, we intend to provide you with historical total reported device sales and estimates for prior period ASPs and unit shipments, applying our adjusted estimation assumptions. However, we will no longer provide quarter-forward guidance on quarterly ASPs and shipments. We have updated our estimated ranges for fiscal year ASPs and calendar year device shipments, and we intend to continue to provide such annual guidance going forward.
Turning now to our second quarter results, revenues of $2.66 billion and pro forma earnings per share of $0.59 were both above the high end of our prior estimates. QTL licensing revenues were stronger than expected this quarter. Total reported device sales were 13% higher sequentially, with midpoint device shipments higher by 17%, partially offset by a 4% decline in midpoint ASPs.
Total reported device sales were approximately $28 billion, and we estimate that 148 million to 152 million CDMA-based devices shipped in the December quarter, driven by strength in multiple geographies. We estimate that the ASP was approximately $182 to $188, reflecting a greater mix of lower-priced devices, modest price erosion and some foreign exchange impact. This decline was largely in line with our expectations.
QCT shipped 93 million chipsets, driven primarily by broad demand across all tiers of our chipset portfolio. QCT operating margin was 22% and was better than our expectations at the outset of the quarter, driven by favorable volumes. 
The combination of pro forma R&D and SG&A expenses grew approximately 10% sequentially, reflecting normal seasonality, as well as a bit higher than expected expenses for a substantial quantity of patent filing. 
Operating cash flow was $793 million, and our cash and marketable securities balance was $18.2 billion at the end of the quarter, including $7.1 billion onshore and $11.1 billion offshore. Our pro forma tax rate was approximately 21% in the second fiscal quarter, and we estimate our pro forma annual tax rate will be approximately 21% to 22% for fiscal 2010.
Our fiscal second quarter pro forma earnings per share is $0.08 favorable from our initial guidance midpoint of $0.51 at the outset of the quarter. QTL is approximately $0.04 higher, driven by  better than expected shipment volumes by our licensees. And QCT was better by approximately $0.03, driven by favorable demand and product mix. The impact of our share repurchase activity was approximately $0.005, with the remainder of the differential split between investment income, partially offset by increased expenses.
Turning to the CDMA-based devices, for calendar year 2009, we now estimate that 500 million to 516 million CDMA-based devices shipped, an increase of approximately 5% to 8% over our calendar year 2008 unit midpoint estimate. We continue to see healthy growth in global 3G sales and estimate that between 600 million and 650 million CDMA-based devices will be shipped in 2010.
Using the 500 million midpoint of our 2009 estimate, we estimate that in 2010, the number of CDMA-based devices will increase approximately 18% to 28% year-over-year. We estimate that of the midpoint 625 million CDMA-based devices, approximately 236 million units will be CDMA2000 and approximately 389 million units will be WCDMA.
Now turning to our financial guidance, we are reaffirming our revenue guidance and raising our earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2010. We expect fiscal 2010 revenues to be in the range of approximately $10.4 billion to $11 billion, consistent with our prior estimates. We anticipate pro forma earnings per share to be in the range of $2.21 to $2.32. 
We estimate that the average selling price of CDMA-based devices for fiscal 2010 will be approximately $182 to $188, with the $185 midpoint down slightly from our prior guidance midpoint of $187, driven by normal price erosion and an increased mix of lower-end devices. However, this was broadly in line with our prior expectations.
We also continue to estimate that the average QTL royalty rate for fiscal 2010 as you calculated with the information we provide, and excluding revenue related to two licensee disputes, as well as excluding the revenue from fiscal Q1 related to our accounting for Samsung, the catch-up in that quarter. We estimate that royalty rate still to be approximately equal for all of fiscal 2010 as it was to exiting the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009. We expect the combination of pro forma R&D and SG&A expense to grow approximately 4% year-over-year.
Turning to the third quarter of fiscal 2010. We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. We estimate pro forma earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter to be approximately $0.51 to $0.55. We estimate that our subscriber licensees will report total reported device sales of approximately $24 billion to $26 billion in the June quarter for shipments they made in the March quarter, down approximately 6% to 13% sequentially, reflecting largely the post-holiday seasonality.
We anticipate shipments of approximately 97 million to 102 million MSM units during the June quarter. Our estimate for CDMA channel inventory is largely consistent with our prior expectations, as we continue to estimate that it is at the lower end of the historical range. And further, we expect this to continue to be the case in the balance of this fiscal year. 
We anticipate third quarter fiscal pro forma R&D and SG&A expenses combined will increase sequentially approximately 2% to 3%, reflecting select growth in certain R&D programs.
We estimate the fiscal third quarter pro forma earnings per share based on our guidance midpoint of $0.53 per share will be sequentially lower by approximately $0.06. The majority of this decline, approximately $0.05 per share, is driven by our estimates of sequentially lower CDMA-based device shipments in the March quarter, again, coming off the seasonally high December quarter. The remaining $0.01 is primarily attributable to R&D.
In closing, we are pleased with our financial results this quarter. We're pleased to see global CDMA-based device sales growing consistent with our estimates and our businesses executing to their plans. That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw."

That being said, we're very happy with the traction of 7k and 8k moving forward. As part of your second question, we feel we're building share. If you look at this quarter that we just reported on, we think we built share there. We also feel moving forward that we're building share, particularly in WCDMA. And I think it's coming from a couple of different places, primarily as people migrate towards smartphones, we're seeing them migrate a bit toward our integrated solutions. And so I think that's probably pretty good for our business.

And as you know, the investment cycle, we really invest upstream of the revenues. So we continue to invest heavily in producing system solutions, primarily in the area of mobile computing and software. So that's existing in the business today. We're also in a little bit of a transition period where we're transitioning over to where emerging market devices or data-centric devices are still a large portion of our shipments. And it hasn't transitioned over to the point where the smartphone-integrated solution ships are the large portion of the business yet. As I said before, we like the way that, that looks, the designing and the traction that we've seen throughout the year is actually consistent and actually maybe a little bit above than what we had originally planned. So we're happy about that. In terms of top line leverage, a lot of it depends on what the mix looks like, let's say, in the quarters that we're not guiding to, so in the second half of the year. Right now, I'll say the biggest part of the business that is difficult to predict is really how much of that is going to move toward data or to 1x. And I think that's the part, that's probably the hardest part to model in our business right now."

So because we got some new information that caused us to reconsider what we previously had for ASPs, the offset was in units. So ASP is a bit higher, unit's a bit lower, but it all has to triangulate back into that total reported number that comes from our licensees. So frankly, that was some of our discussion why we thought, going forward, investors might appreciate that we're dropping the ASP guidance on a one quarter forward basis, but we're introducing this new metric.

So you get that seasonal phenomena, which we had expected and as within our estimates. The operating expenses just came in a bit higher than what we had originally expected, and that was due to our expenses around patent filings and we're seeing a greater amount of patents that we are preparing and filing, preparing to file and filed in this quarter. So that explains the operating expenses. In the case of QCT, we're largely in line here with what -- there's not a material difference on what we are seeing last quarter.

I'm also very excited about this growth in just the 3G market overall, particularly with the India 3G auctions just about to close. I think that's going to really give us an opportunity to breakout the ceiling just in the low end of that market and open up open up the high tier to us, which should have a very positive effect on the business. 
And as we talked about the trend towards smartphones. Obviously, the phones with Snapdragon, they're just coming out now. There's a lot more devices in the pipeline. We're seeing these higher-end chips continue to grow, but we expect that as those smartphones with Snapdragon in them gain more traction going to see a lot of opportunity for growth at the higher end of the Chip business, so we look forward to that as well. 
And also I should say the lower end of the Smartphone segment. The Smartphone segment is tearing a little bit as the future Phone segment seems to be either going up to the smartphone or down to the prepaid. And I think this lower end BMP, Brew Mobile Platform, smartphones are going to able to attract more of the high end of that what once was the future Phone segment.

I'm also very pleased with our financial performance this quarter. Our revenues of $2.66 billion and pro forma earnings per share of $0.59 were very strong and exceeded the high end of our prior guidance.
These results were driven by healthy 3G device shipments and greater than expected demand for our chipsets. We also returned approximately $2 billion in capital to shareholders this past quarter, including $1.7 billion in share repurchases. And we announced a 12% increase in the dividend and an additional Board of Directors authorization of $3 billion for share repurchases.
As I indicated, we had a very strong quarter. Now given our knowledge of how the quarter was developing, we do not think it'd be appropriate until after our earnings report to implement our 10b5-1 plan that we'll use to execute on the new buyback authority. So we anticipate getting that plan finalized in the near future and anticipate the buybacks will commence under it as appropriate.
Device market has developed much as we had expected, with a bit stronger December quarter for CDMA-based devices across most regions. In fact, despite a challenging economic environment in calendar year 2009, we now estimate that 3G device shipments increased by approximately 7% for the year based on midpoint estimate. In addition, in calendar year 2010, we estimate 3G device shipments will grow approximately 23% based on the midpoint of our current estimates.
According to Wireless Intelligence, 3G subscribers have now surpassed 1 billion worldwide, the 3G auction underway in India, the global 3G footprint is a step closer to completion.
As we announced today, we're modifying the information we provide on our Licensing business, including now the addition of total subscriber unit sales as reported to us by our subscriber licensees. Bill is going to be providing more detail on this topic. But with respect ASPs and unit shipments, we believe we've improved our estimating process and will continue to provide quarterly reports on a historical basis, fiscal year guidance in the case of ASPs and calendar year guidance in the case of unit shipments. With respect to our current guidance for ASPs, we do expect that fiscal 2010 ASPs will be down slightly from previous expectations.
Chip business continued to execute well, and we're pleased with the demand we're seeing across all product tiers in what continues to be a very competitive 3G chipset market. Our Licensing business continues to expand, particularly in China, where we have signed seven new license agreements so far this year, bringing our total over 55 Chinese licensees. And in terms of key industry trends, the Smart phone segment is continuing its strong momentum, driven by increased innovation and competition, and is taking an increasing share of what typically has been the feature phone segment.
According to Informa, Smart phone sales are projected to increase approximately 33% year-over-year in 2010. And that number would be even greater if they had included Brew MP-based Smart phones in their numbers. We're also pleased to see more and more operators experimenting with variable pricing plans for 3G data services as we see this as one of the catalysts for ramping 3G adoption going forward.
Across the industry, device manufacturers continue to add 3G connectivity to a growing list of products outside the traditional handset market. While USB dongles and embedded notebooks continue to drive the majority of non-handset 3G unit volumes, new and emerging categories are gaining traction.
Let's move to the regions. In North America, we continue to see both significant innovation on the Smart phone front and also an operator focus on the Prepaid segment, driven partially by the macroeconomic environment and also by the level of subscriber penetration that the regions now reach. The region does continue to be a hotbed for launching new, innovative devices. And according to a Nielsen survey, sales of Smart phones are expected to overtake feature phones by the end of next year, climbing steadily over the next 18 months, just under 50% of the total handset sales. 
We're also pleased with the National Broadband Plan that was released by the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] last month. The plan contains a number of recommendations that we believe will benefit the industry and the public, including the reallocation of 500 megahertz of additional spectrum for mobile broadband over the next decade, and the creation of a new Mobility Fund to provide federal funding for 3G build-out in rural areas, and also other recommendations to foster greater use of mobile broadband to improve education, health care, public safety and for the rollout of Smart Grid.
With respect to Europe, we're encouraged by recent 3G device trends in Western Europe and the growing adoption of 3G in Eastern Europe. We continue to see strength of 3G data devices, but some continued traction with 2.5G devices in Western Europe. 
Looking forward, we're encouraged by some of the innovative and affordable 3G devices announced to be in Europe this year, which will help drive 3G into additional market segments. 
And in addition, operators continue to upgrade their existing 3G networks. According to the GSA, globally, 103 operators have committed to HSPA+ network deployments in 51 countries, with 52 networks already in commercial service. And of the commercial networks, greater than 50% of those are in Europe.
In China, the 3G networks are in place, and the ecosystem is developing to meet the market need. To-date, most of the growth has been in lower-priced voice-centric devices as operators have focused on achieving subscriber growth targets. Going forward, we expect that the breadth and depth of 3G devices available to consumers will increase. China Telecom reported the launch of 68 new 3G device models in the last two quarters, and China Unicom has reported that they plan to launch 200 WCDMA handsets this year.
In India, we're pleased to see the 3G spectrum auctions underway and look forward to additional operators and competition to provide affordable 3G mobile Internet to this market. With India's low penetration of fixed broadband access in PCs, we see the opportunity for 3G wireless to play a key role in providing Internet access to this underserved market. 
And with 65 3G networks launched in Latin America, focus there has turned to optimizing networks to support the consumer data demand. We're pleased to see additional spectrum availability with 3G spectrum auctions planned in Colombia, Mexico and Brazil. The data modems in the region continue to account for roughly half the 3G device demand. But we believe that lower 3G handset pricing and availability should drive greater 3G handset volumes in the future.
So looking forward, calendar year 2010 3G device shipments are progressing in line with our expectations. And our Chip business is well positioned for growth, with forecasted MSM shipments of approximately 100 million for the next quarter. 
So based on the positive momentum we're seeing in our Licensing and Chipset business, we're pleased to be raising our fiscal 2010 midpoint earnings guidance. 
And that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf."

Our QCT business continues to execute well, and I'd like to share some highlights from the second fiscal quarter of 2010. 
We shipped approximately 93 million chipsets, which is at the high end of our most recent guidance and constitutes an increase of 35% over the same period last year. We saw a continued strength in our 3G device shipments and believe that we gained share during this period. 
We've also gained new customers, particularly in the emerging markets. Over the past 18 months, we have nearly doubled our already extensive customer base in China. We generated revenue of approximately $1.5 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Our earnings before tax was $344 million, 59% higher compared to the year-ago quarter. Our average revenue per MSM declined in the second quarter. This was in line with our expectations and is typical for the first calendar quarter of the year.
Looking forward, we're forecasting shipments in the range of 97 million to 102 million chipsets in the third fiscal quarter, driven primarily by an increase in UMTS chipsets. Data-centric chipsets and products for emerging markets are expected to become a larger percentage of our total unit volume as new customers, particularly in China, continue to ramp production. 
We expect to continue to feel downward pressure on average revenue per MSM. Our focus on growing 3G shipments in a competitive current environment and investing in cost-competitive products with increased features and functions. As a result, we expect to deliver operating profit margins consistent with the previous guidance for the fiscal year.
Design traction of our highly integrated 7000 and 8000 series chipsets remains robust as is evidenced at both the Consumer Electronics Show in January and Mobile World Congress in February. We are excited to work with new customers such as Sony Ericsson as they ramp Android-based Smart phones with our integrated solutions. 
Additionally, we continue to build momentum with leading Smart phone software partners. Snapdragon will be the first platform supporting all Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 Smart phones scheduled to begin launching later this year.
As mobile computing and consumer electronics converge, QCT is gaining new customers outside of the traditional handset space. This week, HP launched the Compaq AirLife 100 with Telefonica. The Compaq AirLife 100 is a smartbook based on our Snapdragon chipset and running the Android operating system. Additionally, Dell has unveiled their Mini 5 Android Tablet, also based on Snapdragon. We see the market embracing these new converged devices and expect the category to grow.
QCT is also making excellent progress with Brew Mobile Platform, which enables Smart phone functionality in mass-market devices. The software ecosystem around Brew MP continues to grow with new network operators adopting Brew MP devices. HTC recently launched its first handset with Brew MP, the HTC Smart, which is now available in multiple markets around the world. We expect additional devices to be announced from multiple manufacturers over the next several quarters. QCT is continuing to work closely with handset and software partners to help bring mass-market Smart phone features to all regions around the globe.
As mobile data usage continues to increase, network operators will look to new technologies to help accommodate the demand. We are working with several network operators, infrastructure vendors and device manufacturers to bring dual carrier HSPA+ and LTE to market and expect commercial launches of devices to begin during the second half of 2010 based on our MDM8220 and MDM9600. Additionally, QCT will begin sampling its FSM family of femtocell solutions next quarter. Our FSM products will be the industry's first to utilize the capabilities of HSPA+ and EV-DO Revision A and Revision B.
QCT continues to execute well in our core business and is bringing wireless to new device categories. The combination of our modem technology leadership, strong computing and multimedia capability, market-leading chipset portfolio and deep software and systems capability give us a strong, long-term position as the convergence of wireless, computing and consumer electronics continues to drive new opportunity. 
Thank you. And I now turn this call over to Bill Keitel."
33493,67259610,58097,"QUALCOMM Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with a few comments regarding the changes we've made to our metrics for QTL.In addition to estimates of ASPs and unit shipments for CDMA-based device sales reported by our licensees, we will now",1350,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with a few comments regarding the changes we've made to our metrics for QTL.
In addition to estimates of ASPs and unit shipments for CDMA-based device sales reported by our licensees, we will now be providing total reported device sales, which is the sum of all subscriber licensee device sales reported to us by our licensees in a given period. We've provided this metric in our earnings release for the four quarters of fiscal 2009 and the first two quarters of fiscal 2010. We've also provided a range of total reported device sales that we estimate our subscriber licensees will report to us in this third quarter of fiscal 2010, and we intend to continue to provide this quarterly guidance going forward.
Utilizing our licensees' reports, as well as other information, including information from licensee audits and public information, we break down total reported device sales into our estimates of its two components: A unit shipment range and average dollars per unit, or ASP, that comprise the total reported device sales amount.
Based on additional information obtained this quarter and our ongoing analysis of CDMA device trends, as well as the assumptions we use to estimate unit shipments and ASPs, we are adjusting some of the underlying assumptions we use to estimate licensee unit shipments and ASPs. 
For comparative purposes, in today's earnings release, we have provided a table showing the impact of applying these adjusted estimation assumptions to the units and ASPs on a quarterly basis back through the beginning of fiscal 2009. As you can see, applying this analysis results in a higher ASP, a range of $2 to $8 per unit over the six quarters based on midpoints which we provided for comparative purposes. And likewise, it results in lower units, a range of 1 million to 5 million units per quarter based on midpoints, which again, are provided for comparative purposes.
To be clear, these updated estimates have no impact to QTL revenues for any of these periods. For quarterly guidance going forward, we intend to provide you with historical total reported device sales and estimates for prior period ASPs and unit shipments, applying our adjusted estimation assumptions. However, we will no longer provide quarter-forward guidance on quarterly ASPs and shipments. We have updated our estimated ranges for fiscal year ASPs and calendar year device shipments, and we intend to continue to provide such annual guidance going forward.
Turning now to our second quarter results, revenues of $2.66 billion and pro forma earnings per share of $0.59 were both above the high end of our prior estimates. QTL licensing revenues were stronger than expected this quarter. Total reported device sales were 13% higher sequentially, with midpoint device shipments higher by 17%, partially offset by a 4% decline in midpoint ASPs.
Total reported device sales were approximately $28 billion, and we estimate that 148 million to 152 million CDMA-based devices shipped in the December quarter, driven by strength in multiple geographies. We estimate that the ASP was approximately $182 to $188, reflecting a greater mix of lower-priced devices, modest price erosion and some foreign exchange impact. This decline was largely in line with our expectations.
QCT shipped 93 million chipsets, driven primarily by broad demand across all tiers of our chipset portfolio. QCT operating margin was 22% and was better than our expectations at the outset of the quarter, driven by favorable volumes. 
The combination of pro forma R&D and SG&A expenses grew approximately 10% sequentially, reflecting normal seasonality, as well as a bit higher than expected expenses for a substantial quantity of patent filing. 
Operating cash flow was $793 million, and our cash and marketable securities balance was $18.2 billion at the end of the quarter, including $7.1 billion onshore and $11.1 billion offshore. Our pro forma tax rate was approximately 21% in the second fiscal quarter, and we estimate our pro forma annual tax rate will be approximately 21% to 22% for fiscal 2010.
Our fiscal second quarter pro forma earnings per share is $0.08 favorable from our initial guidance midpoint of $0.51 at the outset of the quarter. QTL was approximately $0.04 higher, driven by  better than expected shipment volumes by our licensees. And QCT was better by approximately $0.03, driven by favorable demand and product mix. The impact of our share repurchase activity was approximately $0.005, with the remainder of the differential split between investment income, partially offset by increased expenses.
Turning to the CDMA-based devices, for calendar year 2009, we now estimate that 500 million to 516 million CDMA-based devices shipped, an increase of approximately 5% to 8% over our calendar year 2008 unit midpoint estimate. We continue to see healthy growth in global 3G sales and estimate that between 600 million and 650 million CDMA-based devices will be shipped in 2010.
Using the 500 million midpoint of our 2009 estimate, we estimate that in 2010, the number of CDMA-based devices will increase approximately 18% to 28% year-over-year. We estimate that of the midpoint 625 million CDMA-based devices, approximately 236 million units will be CDMA2000 and approximately 389 million units will be WCDMA.
Now turning to our financial guidance, we are reaffirming our revenue guidance and raising our earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2010. We expect fiscal 2010 revenues to be in the range of approximately $10.4 billion to $11 billion, consistent with our prior estimates. We anticipate pro forma earnings per share to be in the range of $2.21 to $2.32. 
We estimate that the average selling price of CDMA-based devices for fiscal 2010 will be approximately $182 to $188, with the $185 midpoint down slightly from our prior guidance midpoint of $187, driven by normal price erosion and an increased mix of low-end devices. However, this was broadly in line with our prior expectations.
We also continue to estimate that the average QTL royalty rate for fiscal 2010 as you calculated with the information we provide, and excluding revenue related to two licensee disputes, as well as excluding the revenue from fiscal Q1 related to our accounting for Samsung, the catch-up in that quarter, we estimate that royalty rate still to be approximately equal for all of fiscal 2010 as it was to exiting the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009. We expect the combination of pro forma R&D and SG&A expense to grow approximately 4% year-over-year.
Turning to the third quarter of fiscal 2010. We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. We estimate pro forma earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter to be approximately $0.51 to $0.55. We estimate that our subscriber licensees will report total reported device sales of approximately $24 billion to $26 billion in the June quarter for shipments they made in the March quarter, down approximately 6% to 13% sequentially, reflecting largely the post-holiday seasonality.
We anticipate shipments of approximately 97 million to 102 million MSM units during the June quarter. Our estimate for CDMA channel inventory is largely consistent with our prior expectations, as we continue to estimate that it is at the lower end of the historical range. And further, we expect this to continue to be the case through the balance of this fiscal year. 
We anticipate third quarter fiscal pro forma R&D and SG&A expenses combined will increase sequentially approximately 2% to 3%, reflecting select growth in certain R&D programs.
We estimate that fiscal third quarter pro forma earnings per share based on our guidance midpoint of $0.53 per share will be sequentially lower by approximately $0.06. The majority of this decline, approximately $0.05 per share, is driven by our estimates of sequentially lower CDMA-based device shipments in the March quarter, again, coming off the seasonally high December quarter. The remaining $0.01 is primarily attributable to R&D.
In closing, we are pleased with our financial results this quarter. We're pleased to see global CDMA-based device sales growing consistent with our estimates and our businesses executing to their plans. That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw."

That being said, we're very happy with the traction of 7k and 8k moving forward. As part of your second question, we feel we're building share. If you look at the quarter that we just reported on, we think we built share there. We also feel moving forward that we're building share, particularly in WCDMA. And I think it's coming from a couple of different places. Primarily as people migrate towards Smart phones, we're seeing them migrate a bit toward our integrated solutions. And so I think that's probably pretty good for our business. If you look at the sequential move in the Chip business, a lot of that is in WCDMA and that's primarily, we think a pick-up of share."

And as you know, with the investment cycle, we really invest upstream of the revenue. So we continue to invest heavily in producing system solutions, primarily in the area of mobile computing and software. So that's existing in the business today. We're also in a little bit of a transition period where we're transitioning over to where emerging market devices or data-centric devices are still a large portion of our shipments. And it hasn't transitioned over to the point where the Smart phone-integrated solution chips are the large portion of the business yet. As I said before, we like the way that, that looks, the design-in and the traction that we've seen throughout the year is actually consistent and actually maybe a little bit above what we had originally planned. So we're happy about that. In terms of top line leverage, a lot of it depends on what the mix looks like, let's say, in the quarters that we're not guiding to, so in the second half of the year. Right now, I'll say the biggest part of the business that is difficult to predict is really how much of that is going to move toward data or to 1x.

And then, Steve, when you look at QCT margin, you'd guided before, actually, Bill guided the QCT margin for the year 22% to 24%. And Steve, you or Bill made a comment last quarter that margin would dip in QCT in the June quarter, and then September, we'd see it bounce back to levels. I think the word you used was something like levels that we've been more accustomed to seeing. And finally sort of a V [ph] in margin in the June quarter and that comes back in September, I didn't see commentary to either of those effects. Are we still at the net 22% to 24% for the year? And should we still be kind of looking for a bottoming in the margin for QCT in June, and then bouncing back to more reasonable levels in September, or is that kind of changed with what you're seeing in dongles and data cards?"

One is paying but we're not recording that revenue. This quarter, obviously, we're three months further into the year. We still think there's an approximate $200 million of revenue upside that we're owed. But given that we're three months into the year and six months left, we probability adjusted that number.

Again, we take that total reported subscriber royalty number that gets reported to us by our licensees. And as you know, historically, we've broken that down into two components, how much is ASP and how much is units. 1x the other equals that total. So because we got some new information that caused us to reconsider what we previously had for ASPs, the offset was in units. So ASPs a bit higher, units a bit lower, but it all has to triangulate back into that total reported number that comes from our licensees. So frankly, that was some of our discussion why we thought, going forward, investors might appreciate that we're dropping the ASP guidance on a one quarter forward basis, but we're introducing this new metric. So next quarter, when we report against that $24 billion to $26 billion estimate, we'll be reporting against an actual. Whereas if we were just giving you the ASPs and units, we'd be providing you an estimate of what our estimate had been.

I'm very happy, as I said, with the way the quarter turned out, our ability to generate strong cash flows, return cash to our shareholders. But still really invest quite strongly in our strategic initiatives, new technologies, new products, 3G and 4G. 
I'm also very excited about this growth in just the 3G market overall, particularly with the India 3G auctions just about to close. I think that's going to really give us an opportunity to breakout the ceiling just in the low end of that market and open up open up the high tier to us, which should have a very positive effect on the business. 
And as we talked about the trend towards Smart phones. Obviously, the phones with Snapdragon, they're just coming out now. There's a lot more devices in the pipeline. We're seeing these higher-end chips continue to grow, but we expect that as those Smart phones with Snapdragon in them gain more traction going to see a lot of opportunity for growth at the higher end of the Chip business, so we look forward to that as well. 
And also I should say the lower end of the Smart phone segment. The Smart phone segment is tearing a little bit as the future Phone segment seems to be either going up to the Smart phone or down to the prepaid. And I think this lower end BMP, Brew Mobile Platform, Smart phones are going to able to attract more of the high end of that what once was the future Phone segment. 
So we're looking forward to that, we're looking forward to obviously smartbooks and connected devices. And just the continued growth of the wireless industry as it grows to cover other segments of the market moving to other industries. Really, a ton of opportunity out there. So thanks very much. We look forward to sharing our future plans and future results with you as we go forward. Thanks. Bye."

I'm also very pleased with our financial performance this quarter. Our revenues of $2.66 billion and pro forma earnings per share of $0.59 were very strong and exceeded the high end of our prior guidance.
These results were driven by healthy 3G device shipments and greater than expected demand for our chipsets. We also returned approximately $2 billion in capital to shareholders this past quarter, including $1.7 billion in share repurchases. And we announced a 12% increase in the dividend and an additional Board of Directors authorization of $3 billion for share repurchases.
As I indicated, we had a very strong quarter. Now given our knowledge of how the quarter was developing, we do not think it'd be appropriate until after our earnings report to implement our 10b5-1 plan that we'll use to execute on the new buyback authority. So we anticipate getting that plan finalized in the near future and anticipate the buybacks will commence under it as appropriate.
Device market has developed much as we had expected, with a bit stronger December quarter for CDMA-based devices across most regions. In fact, despite a challenging economic environment in calendar year 2009, we now estimate that 3G device shipments increased by approximately 7% for the year based on midpoint estimate. In addition, in calendar year 2010, we estimate 3G device shipments will grow approximately 23% based on the midpoint of our current estimates.
According to Wireless Intelligence, 3G subscribers have now surpassed 1 billion worldwide, the 3G auction underway in India, the global 3G footprint is a step closer to completion.
As we announced today, we're modifying the information we provide on our Licensing business, including now the addition of total subscriber unit sales as reported to us by our subscriber licensees. Bill is going to be providing more detail on this topic. But with respect ASPs and unit shipments, we believe we've improved our estimating process and will continue to provide quarterly reports on a historical basis, fiscal year guidance in the case of ASPs and calendar year guidance in the case of unit shipments. With respect to our current guidance for ASPs, we do expect that fiscal 2010 ASPs will be down slightly from previous expectations.
Chip business continued to execute well, and we're pleased with the demand we're seeing across all product tiers in what continues to be a very competitive 3G chipset market. Our Licensing business continues to expand, particularly in China, where we have signed seven new license agreements so far this year, bringing our total over 55 Chinese licensees. And in terms of key industry trends, the Smartphone segment is continuing its strong momentum, driven by increased innovation and competition, and is taking an increasing share of what typically has been the feature phone segment.
According to Informa, Smartphone sales are projected to increase approximately 33% year-over-year in 2010. And that number would be even greater if they had included Brew MP-based smartphones in their numbers. We're also pleased to see more and more operators experimenting with variable pricing plans for 3G data services as we see this as one of the catalysts for ramping 3G adoption going forward.
Across the industry, device manufacturers continue to add 3G connectivity to a growing list of products outside the traditional handset market. While USB dongles and embedded notebooks continue to drive the majority of non-handset 3G unit volumes, new and emerging categories are gaining traction.
Let's move to the regions. In North America, we continue to see both significant innovation on the Smartphone front and also an operator focus on the Prepaid segment, driven partially by the macroeconomic environment and also by the level of subscriber penetration that the regions now reach. The region does continue to be a hotbed for launching new, innovative devices. And according to a Nielsen survey, sales of smartphones are expected to overtake feature phones by the end of next year, climbing steadily over the next 18 months, just under 50% of the total handset sales.
We're also pleased with the National Broadband Plan that was released by the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] last month. The plan contains a number of recommendations that we believe will benefit the industry and the public, including the reallocation of 500 megahertz of additional spectrum for mobile broadband over the next decade, and the creation of a new Mobility Fund to provide federal funding for 3G build-out in rural areas, and also other recommendations to foster greater use of mobile broadband to improve education, health care, public safety and for the rollout of Smart Grid.
With respect to Europe, we're encouraged by recent 3G device trends in Western Europe and the growing adoption of 3G in Eastern Europe. We continue to see strength of 3G data devices, but some continued traction with 2.5G devices in Western Europe.
Looking forward, we're encouraged by some of the innovative and affordable 3G devices announced to be in Europe this year, which will help drive 3G into additional market segments.
And in addition, operators continue to upgrade their existing 3G networks. According to the GSA, globally, 103 operators have committed to HSPA+ network deployments in 51 countries, with 52 networks already in commercial service. And of the commercial networks, greater than 50% of those are in Europe.
In China, the 3G networks are in place, and the ecosystem is developing to meet the market need. To-date, most of the growth has been in lower-priced voice-centric devices as operators have focused on achieving subscriber growth targets. Going forward, we expect that the breadth and depth of 3G devices available to consumers will increase. China Telecom reported the launch of 68 new 3G device models in the last two quarters, and China Unicom has reported that they plan to launch 200 WCDMA handsets this year.
In India, we're pleased to see the 3G spectrum auctions underway and look forward to additional operators and competition to provide affordable 3G mobile Internet to this market. With India's low penetration of fixed broadband access in PCs, we see the opportunity for 3G wireless to play a key role in providing Internet access to this underserved market.
And with 65 3G networks launched in Latin America, focus there has turned to optimizing networks to support the consumer data demand. We're pleased to see additional spectrum availability with 3G spectrum auctions planned in Colombia, Mexico and Brazil. The data modems in the region continue to account for roughly half the 3G device demand. But we believe that lower 3G handset pricing and availability should drive greater 3G handset volumes in the future.
So looking forward, calendar year 2010 3G device shipments are progressing in line with our expectations. And our Chip business is well positioned for growth, with forecasted MSM shipments of approximately 100 million for the next quarter.
So based on the positive momentum we're seeing in our Licensing and Chipset business, we're pleased to be raising our fiscal 2010 midpoint earnings guidance.
And that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf."

Our QCT business continues to execute well, and I'd like to share some highlights from the second fiscal quarter of 2010.
We shipped approximately 93 million chipsets, which is at the high end of our most recent guidance and constitutes an increase of 35% over the same period last year. We saw a continued strength in our 3G device shipments and believe that we gained share during this period.
We've also gained new customers, particularly in the emerging markets. Over the past 18 months, we have nearly doubled our already extensive customer base in China. We generated revenue of approximately $1.5 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Our earnings before tax was $344 million, 59% higher compared to the year-ago quarter. Our average revenue per MSM declined in the second quarter. This was in line with our expectations and is typical for the first calendar quarter of the year.
Looking forward, we're forecasting shipments in the range of 97 million to 102 million chipsets in the third fiscal quarter, driven primarily by an increase in UMTS chipsets. Data-centric chipsets and products for emerging markets are expected to become a larger percentage of our total unit volume as new customers, particularly in China, continue to ramp production.
We expect to continue to feel downward pressure on average revenue per MSM. Our focus on growing 3G shipments in a competitive current environment and investing in cost-competitive products with increased features and functions. As a result, we expect to deliver operating profit margins consistent with the previous guidance for the fiscal year.
Design traction of our highly integrated 7000 and 8000 series chipsets remains robust as is evidenced at both the Consumer Electronics Show in January and Mobile World Congress in February. We are excited to work with new customers such as Sony Ericsson as they ramp Android-based smartphones with our integrated solutions.
Additionally, we continue to build momentum with leading smartphone software partners. Snapdragon will be the first platform supporting all Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 smartphones scheduled to begin launching later this year.
As mobile computing and consumer electronics converge, QCT is gaining new customers outside of the traditional handset space. This week, HP launched the Compaq AirLife 100 with Telefonica. The Compaq AirLife 100 is a smartbook based on our Snapdragon chipset and running the Android operating system. Additionally, Dell has unveiled their Mini 5 Android Tablet, also based on Snapdragon. We see the market embracing these new converged devices and expect the category to grow.
QCT is also making excellent progress with Brew Mobile Platform, which enables smartphone functionality in mass-market devices. The software ecosystem around Brew MP continues to grow with new network operators adopting Brew MP devices. HTC recently launched its first handset with Brew MP, the HTC Smart, which is now available in multiple markets around the world. We expect additional devices to be announced from multiple manufacturers over the next several quarters. QCT is continuing to work closely with handset and software partners to help bring mass-market smartphone features to all regions around the globe.
As mobile data usage continues to increase, network operators will look to new technologies to help accommodate the demand. We are working with several network operators, infrastructure vendors and device manufacturers to bring dual carrier HSPA+ and LTE to market and expect commercial launches of devices to begin during the second half of 2010 based on our MDM8220 and MDM9600. Additionally, QCT will begin sampling its FSM family of femtocell solutions next quarter. Our FSM products will be the industry's first to utilize the capabilities of HSPA+ and EV-DO Revision A and Revision B.
QCT continues to execute well in our core business and is bringing wireless to new device categories. The combination of our modem technology leadership, strong computing and multimedia capability, market-leading chipset portfolio and deep software and systems capability give us a strong, long-term position as the convergence of wireless, computing and consumer electronics continues to drive new opportunity.
Thank you. And I now turn this call over to Bill Keitel."
33493,67259610,65733,"QUALCOMM Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with a few comments regarding the changes we've made to our metrics for QTL.In addition to estimates of ASPs and unit shipments for CDMA-based device sales reported by our licensees, we will now",1350,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with a few comments regarding the changes we've made to our metrics for QTL.
In addition to estimates of ASPs and unit shipments for CDMA-based device sales reported by our licensees, we will now be providing total reported device sales, which is the sum of all subscriber licensee device sales reported to us by our licensees in a given period. We've provided this metric in our earnings release for the four quarters of fiscal 2009 and the first two quarters of fiscal 2010. We've also provided a range of total reported device sales that we estimate our subscriber licensees will report to us in this third quarter of fiscal 2010, and we intend to continue to provide this quarterly guidance going forward.
Utilizing our licensees' reports, as well as other information, including information from licensee audits and public information, we break down total reported device sales into our estimates of its two components: A unit shipment range and average dollars per unit, or ASP, that comprise the total reported device sales amount.
Based on additional information obtained this quarter and our ongoing analysis of CDMA device trends, as well as the assumptions we use to estimate unit shipments and ASPs, we are adjusting some of the underlying assumptions we use to estimate licensee unit shipments and ASPs.
For comparative purposes, in today's earnings release, we have provided a table showing the impact of applying these adjusted estimation assumptions to the units and ASPs on a quarterly basis back through the beginning of fiscal 2009. As you can see, applying this analysis results in a higher ASP, a range of $2 to $8 per unit over the six quarters based on midpoints which we provided for comparative purposes. And likewise, it results in lower units, a range of 1 million to 5 million units per quarter based on midpoints, which again, are provided for comparative purposes.
To be clear, these updated estimates have no impact to QTL revenues for any of these periods. For quarterly guidance going forward, we intend to provide you with historical total reported device sales and estimates for prior period ASPs and unit shipments, applying our adjusted estimation assumptions. However, we will no longer provide quarter-forward guidance on quarterly ASPs and shipments. We have updated our estimated ranges for fiscal year ASPs and calendar year device shipments, and we intend to continue to provide such annual guidance going forward.
Turning now to our second quarter results, revenues of $2.66 billion and pro forma earnings per share of $0.59 were both above the high end of our prior estimates. QTL licensing revenues were stronger than expected this quarter. Total reported device sales were 13% higher sequentially, with midpoint device shipments higher by 17%, partially offset by a 4% decline in midpoint ASPs.
Total reported device sales were approximately $28 billion, and we estimate that 148 million to 152 million CDMA-based devices shipped in the December quarter, driven by strength in multiple geographies. We estimate that the ASP was approximately $182 to $188, reflecting a greater mix of lower-priced devices, modest price erosion and some foreign exchange impact. This decline was largely in line with our expectations.
QCT shipped 93 million chipsets, driven primarily by broad demand across all tiers of our chipset portfolio. QCT operating margin was 22% and was better than our expectations at the outset of the quarter, driven by favorable volumes.
The combination of pro forma R&D and SG&A expenses grew approximately 10% sequentially, reflecting normal seasonality, as well as a bit higher than expected expenses for a substantial quantity of patent filing.
Operating cash flow was $793 million, and our cash and marketable securities balance was $18.2 billion at the end of the quarter, including $7.1 billion onshore and $11.1 billion offshore. Our pro forma tax rate was approximately 21% in the second fiscal quarter, and we estimate our pro forma annual tax rate will be approximately 21% to 22% for fiscal 2010.
Our fiscal second quarter pro forma earnings per share is $0.08 favorable from our initial guidance midpoint of $0.51 at the outset of the quarter. QTL was approximately $0.04 higher, driven by  better than expected shipment volumes by our licensees. And QCT was better by approximately $0.03, driven by favorable demand and product mix. The impact of our share repurchase activity was approximately $0.005, with the remainder of the differential split between investment income, partially offset by increased expenses.
Turning to the CDMA-based devices, for calendar year 2009, we now estimate that 500 million to 516 million CDMA-based devices shipped, an increase of approximately 5% to 8% over our calendar year 2008 unit midpoint estimate. We continue to see healthy growth in global 3G sales and estimate that between 600 million and 650 million CDMA-based devices will be shipped in 2010.
Using the 500 million midpoint of our 2009 estimate, we estimate that in 2010, the number of CDMA-based devices will increase approximately 18% to 28% year-over-year. We estimate that of the midpoint 625 million CDMA-based devices, approximately 236 million units will be CDMA2000 and approximately 389 million units will be WCDMA.
Now turning to our financial guidance, we are reaffirming our revenue guidance and raising our earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2010. We expect fiscal 2010 revenues to be in the range of approximately $10.4 billion to $11 billion, consistent with our prior estimates. We anticipate pro forma earnings per share to be in the range of $2.21 to $2.32.
We estimate that the average selling price of CDMA-based devices for fiscal 2010 will be approximately $182 to $188, with the $185 midpoint down slightly from our prior guidance midpoint of $187, driven by normal price erosion and an increased mix of low-end devices. However, this was broadly in line with our prior expectations.
We also continue to estimate that the average QTL royalty rate for fiscal 2010 as you calculated with the information we provide, and excluding revenue related to two licensee disputes, as well as excluding the revenue from fiscal Q1 related to our accounting for Samsung, the catch-up in that quarter, we estimate that royalty rate still to be approximately equal for all of fiscal 2010 as it was to exiting the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009. We expect the combination of pro forma R&D and SG&A expense to grow approximately 4% year-over-year.
Turning to the third quarter of fiscal 2010. We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. We estimate pro forma earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter to be approximately $0.51 to $0.55. We estimate that our subscriber licensees will report total reported device sales of approximately $24 billion to $26 billion in the June quarter for shipments they made in the March quarter, down approximately 6% to 13% sequentially, reflecting largely the post-holiday seasonality.
We anticipate shipments of approximately 97 million to 102 million MSM units during the June quarter. Our estimate for CDMA channel inventory is largely consistent with our prior expectations, as we continue to estimate that it is at the lower end of the historical range. And further, we expect this to continue to be the case through the balance of this fiscal year.
We anticipate third quarter fiscal pro forma R&D and SG&A expenses combined will increase sequentially approximately 2% to 3%, reflecting select growth in certain R&D programs.
We estimate that fiscal third quarter pro forma earnings per share based on our guidance midpoint of $0.53 per share will be sequentially lower by approximately $0.06. The majority of this decline, approximately $0.05 per share, is driven by our estimates of sequentially lower CDMA-based device shipments in the March quarter, again, coming off the seasonally high December quarter. The remaining $0.01 is primarily attributable to R&D.
In closing, we are pleased with our financial results this quarter. We're pleased to see global CDMA-based device sales growing consistent with our estimates and our businesses executing to their plans. That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw."

And as you know, with the investment cycle, we really invest upstream of the revenue. So we continue to invest heavily in producing system solutions, primarily in the area of mobile computing and software. So that's existing in the business today. We're also in a little bit of a transition period where we're transitioning over to where emerging market devices or data-centric devices are still a large portion of our shipments. And it hasn't transitioned over to the point where the smartphone-integrated solution chips are the large portion of the business yet. As I said before, we like the way that, that looks, the design-in and the traction that we've seen throughout the year is actually consistent and actually maybe a little bit above what we had originally planned. So we're happy about that. In terms of top line leverage, a lot of it depends on what the mix looks like, let's say, in the quarters that we're not guiding to, so in the second half of the year. Right now, I'll say the biggest part of the business that is difficult to predict is really how much of that is going to move toward data or to 1x. And I think that's the part that's probably the hardest part to model in our business right now."

As we've said, it was in part from licensee audits, as well as in part from some public data. And that caused us to update our estimation process, and so that was the driver there. For the fiscal year, we gave you an estimate here.

And as you know, historically, we've broken that down into two components, how much is ASP and how much is units. 1x the other equals that total. So because we got some new information that caused us to reconsider what we previously had for ASPs, the offset was in units. So ASPs a bit higher, units a bit lower, but it all has to triangulate back into that total reported number that comes from our licensees. So frankly, that was some of our discussion why we thought, going forward, investors might appreciate that we're dropping the ASP guidance on a one quarter forward basis, but we're introducing this new metric. So next quarter, when we report against that $24 billion to $26 billion estimate, we'll be reporting against an actual.

I think, I would say, first, I mean, we see that the phone market continuing to segment broadly. Feature phones are getting pressured by smartphones, but yet it's still a robust market in a number of areas where OEMs and carriers are doing extremely well with them. I think it's still much the same for us, though. We have a broad range of chipsets that we sell. And somewhere the key to us is, what's our gross margin dollars, gross margin percentage of those products. And as we've said, gross margin percentage this year, we expect to be largely in line with our gross margin percentage that we earned last year. So as you move down into the lower end of the market, it takes more devices to equal the dollars you earned off the high end, but thus far, low end to mid-tier to high tier, we think it's all a good business for us."

I'm very happy, as I said, with the way the quarter turned out, our ability to generate strong cash flows, return cash to our shareholders, but still really invest quite strongly in our strategic initiatives, new technologies, new products, 3G and 4G. I'm also very excited about this growth in just the 3G market overall, particularly with the India 3G auctions just about close. I think that's going to really give us an opportunity to break out the selling just in the low end of that market and open up the high tier to us, which should have a very positive effect on the business.
And as we talked about the trend towards smartphones, obviously, the phones with Snapdragon, they are just coming out now. There's a lot more devices in the pipeline. We're seeing these higher-end chips continue to grow, but we expect that as those smartphones with Snapdragon in them gain more traction, you're going to see a lot of opportunity for growth at the higher end of the Chip business, so we look forward to that as well.
And also I should say, the lower end of the Smartphone segment. The Smartphone segment is tearing a little bit as the Feature Phone segment seems to be either going up to the Smartphone or down to the Prepaid. And I think this lower end BMP, Brew Mobile Platform-based smartphones are going to able to attract more of the high end of that what once was the Feature Phone segment.
So we're looking forward to that, we're looking forward to, obviously, smartbooks and connected devices, and just the continued growth of the wireless industry as it grows to cover other segments of the market moving to other industries. Really, a ton of opportunity out there. So thanks very much. We look forward to sharing our future plans and future results with you as we go forward. Thanks. Bye."

Our financial performance this quarter was ahead of our expectations, and was driven by record MSM chipset shipments, favorable product mix, and continued strong demand for 3G devices around the world.
Looking forward, we continue to see healthy CDMA based device growth or approximately 23% in calendar year 2010, and are pleased to be raising our revenue and earnings guidance for the fiscal year. I’d also like to highlight that during the third quarter and the first few weeks of our current quarter, we repurchased an additional $1.3 billion of our common stock, bringing our cumulative repurchases to $3 billion in this fiscal year.
This is an exciting time in the wireless industry, although some global economic uncertainty remains, our business is extremely well positioned to capitalize on some very positive industry trends. Specifically, mobile wireless data usage continues to expand rapidly. We’re at a transformative stage in the industry as people increasingly use their 3G devices to stay connected.
New network technologies are coming online to meet the demand for more capacity. With the recent issuance of licenses in India, the 3G footprint is now global. Finally, we’re seeing the emergence of new 3G connected device types come to market.
Qualcomm’s scale and breadth of technologies position us to uniquely capitalize on these opportunities. Our broad licensing program and our semiconductor expertise in managing the complex performance and power management demand of the market really set us apart.
So, moving into some specifics, global wireless subscribers recently surpassed the 5 billion milestones according to Wireless Intelligence, just over 1 billion of these being 3G. According to the GSA and CDG, approximately 85% of the world’s networks now support 3G.
With networks in place and a healthy demand for data services, we expect the global migration from 2G to 3G to continue.
Smartphones remained one of the fastest growing segments in wireless, as evidenced by the focus major OEMs are placing on this device category. According to Informa, one in every five phones sold globally in 2010 will be a smartphone. By 2012, approximately one in every three is projected to be a smartphone.
Additionally, we’re seeing carriers continue to experiment with variable data pricing plans which will help to spur data growth and drive demand for data capable devices.
In our broad family of chipsets, including the costs effective QSC single chips designed for emerging market as well our industry-leading Snapdragon products which support a wide range of operating systems and multimedia capabilities vision us well to assist our partners in creating devices across all tiers in the market.
We recently held our first Annual Uplinq Conference in San Diego, which provided a forum for developers and partners to learn about new initiatives within Qualcomm and to create new business opportunities. The event was a success and brought together more than 2,100 attendees from around the world.
We focused on our support for multiple operating systems and how developers can better optimize their applications to work with our solutions, as well as how Brew MP will help bring the smartphone experience to the masses.
Brew MP is gaining traction with operators such as AT&T, America Movil, Korea Telecom, and China Telecom, in addition to the traditional Brew operators.
To meet the growing demand for wireless data more license spectrum needs to be made available for mobile broadband around the world. Operators are making significant spectrum in capital investments to keep pace with consumer demand. We’re very encouraged that in just past few months India, Germany, France, Denmark, The Netherlands along with Mexico and Columbia, have all conducted major spectrum auctions.
On the technology front, operators continue to invest in network enhancements. The GSA reported that almost all operators who have launched WCDMA have upgraded to HSPA. Approximately one-third of these operators are committed to deploying the higher data rates with HSPA+. In addition, 80 operators have committed to deploy LTE, up from 64 just a few months back.
Moving to the region, China represents a significant 3G opportunity with only 12% of the approximately 800 million subscribers using 3G according to wireless intelligence and operator reports. The breadth of 3G devices being made available to consumers across China continues to grow fueling demands with 3G adoption.
China Telecom has been adding more than 3 million CDMA2000 subscribers per month this year, this further energizing and leading the global CDMA ecosystem. At the end of June, they hosted the China Telecom CDMA2000 Ecosystem Conference, an event that attracted several thousand attendees and served as a venue for ecosystem players to develop business opportunities relating to new devices and technologies.
At the event, China Telecom encouraged device manufactures to use Brew MP as an operating system for low- and mid-tier smart phones and shared their expectation that smart will make up to 50% of 2011 new handset model. Other topics of discussion included QChat, 1x Advanced and EV-DO including Rev. B. Although there are over 71 million CDMA subscribers on their network, China Telecom is on a path to becoming the largest CDMA2000 operator in the world.
In North America, we continue to see a bifurcation of demand, which grows at both the high and low end. Smartphones continue to find innovation in this highly competitive region with some of the hottest devices incorporating our Snapdragon fruition, including HTC’s Incredible and EVO.
As well, prepaid continues to show of signs of strength as several operators reported strong prepaid numbers in calendar Q1. We’re also seeing some encouraging signs with replacement rates as consumers upgrade to new devices. Verizon reported that 8.6% of their postpaid base upgraded in the first quarter, representing an increase of almost 15% from a year ago.
In Europe, we do remain cautious on short-term growth prospects, but within this backdrop, we are confident in the continued 3G growth encouraged by several favorable trends.
Leading operators are pushing smartphone growth and are actively deploying HSPA+ as an evolution for 3G networks. According to the GSA, the number of commercial HSPA+ networks in Europe, jumped from 8 to 34 in the past year.
On their last earnings call, Vodafone Group reported that their current smartphone sales were 30% of their total mix, but they intend to grow smartphone mix to 70% or more by their fiscal 2012.
We’re also continuing to see strength in 3G USB dongles. A competition is helping to drive 3G price points lower and into prepaid as evidenced by the launch of T-Mobile’s Android-based Pulse Mini, and Samsung’s Pocket 3G.
Lastly, according to Wireless Intelligence, 3G penetration in Eastern Europe is approximately 10%, leaving strong growth opportunities ahead.
Turning to India, the 3G auction process was completed with seven carriers being awarded spectrum. Consumers will benefit as these carriers compete to provide compelling 3G services and product offerings.
Based on operator commentary, new 3G networks could be in service as soon as the end of this year. The expanded 3G footprint in India will provide us an opportunity to address the higher tier that was previously served by 2G devices.
In June, we won a 20 MHz slot of spectrums in the four telecom circles in the Indian broadband wireless access auction. Our strategy with this spectrum is to facilitate the deployment of TD-LTE technology in combination with 3G to provide a clear technology roadmap for Indian operators and help foster a worldwide 3G/LTE ecosystem.
With respect to our FLO TV business, we’re engaged in discussions with a number of partners regarding the future direction of the business. We are considering a number of alternatives and we will update you as appropriate.
So in conclusion, our fiscal year revenues are broadly in line with our original expectations at the outset of the year with earnings per share trending ahead. While revenue growth this year is below what we expect of our business longer term, we’re confident that the investments we’re making in new products and technologies as well as the strategic pricing initiatives we’re taking this year to maintain and grow our business will allow us to achieve our long-term growth objective.
That concludes my comments and I will now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf.

Our QCT business continues to execute well and I’m pleased to be able to share some highlights from third fiscal quarter of 2010.
We had a record quarter shipping approximately 103 million MSM, which represents an increase of 11% over the previous quarter. This increase was driven by our leadership in smartphones, particularly UMTS as customers embraced our integrated roadmap, including our 7,000 and 8,000 series chipsets and by continued strong demand for our data-centric products.
In total, QCT revenues were up 10% sequentially, reflecting these strong unit volumes and relatively stable pricing.
The investments we’ve made in our smartphone portfolio have put us in a leadership position across all tiers and geographies. This was evidenced by our growth of our 7K and 8K series chipsets shipments of nearly 50% sequentially.
We believe we’ve gained significant share in mobile application processors in the past two years with our internal data showing that our share at application processors has more than doubled in this period. Our flagship Snapdragon brand has become the industry benchmark with over 15 new designs launching this past quarter.
In the rapidly growing Android segment, we are continuing our leadership position in both modems and application processors. Since launching the world’s first Android device almost three years ago, we now have over 40 commercially launched designs spanning multiple price tiers and form factors, ranging from smartphones to smartbook devices.
Qualcomm chipsets brings some of the most popular devices this quarter including the HTC Incredible, HTC EVO, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10, and Lenovo’s Lephone. We expect our success with Android devices to continue as we expand our support for Android across all tiers of our MSM.
Today, our partners have more than 50 device designs in progress based on our platform. Our current generation of Snapdragon chips are shipping in volume and we continue to expand our industry-leading portfolio. This quarter we sampled our Snapdragon dual core 1.2 gigahertz chipset with advanced GPU and multimedia capabilities.
The industry is going through multiple modem technology transitions from 2G to 3G in some countries and 3G to 4G in others. We believe these technology transitions are opportunities for us to continue to demonstrate our strengths in both modem development and systems integration.
Our MDM9000 series, 3G/LTE multimode chips are available now. We expect to see data devices based on these chipsets offered commercially before the end of the year, followed by smartphones and other smart connected devices starting next year.
We have incorporated TD-LTE into all of our 3G/LTE chipsets to align with and leverage our recent win of BWA spectrum in the 2.3 gigahertz band in India, and our worldwide carrier relationships.
We continue to focus on advanced wireless WAN technologies, deliver backwards compatibility in our chipsets, with all air interfaces and global multi-mode capabilities, which is an important and growing strategic advantage for us versus the competition.
Looking ahead, demand for our chipset products remained strong. For our fourth fiscal quarter, we estimate MSM shipments will increase to approximately 106 million to 111 million units, driven primarily by greater demand for smartphones and strength in China and North America.
The chipset market continues to be very competitive, and the pricing environment is mostly consistent with our expectations at the onset of the year. As always, the demand profile across our broad product portfolio is a key driver of our results.
Based on our latest estimates of this demand mix, we expect QCT operating profit for fiscal 2010 to be closer to the high end of our prior guidance of 22% to 24%. We are pleased with the execution across the teams in QCT, and we look forward to the opportunities ahead.
Our chipset portfolio aligns with device trends today and in the future with industry-leading chipsets for HSPA+, multi-mode 3G/LTE, integrated Snapdragon solutions for tiered smartbooks, smartphones and tablets, as well as low cost solutions for the unique needs in emerging markets.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel.

I’ll begin with the highlights of our third quarter results. Revenues were $2.7 billion, at the high end of our prior guidance, and pro forma earnings per share were $0.57 exceeding our prior guidance on the strength of record MSM shipments.
In our QTL segment, revenues were $847 million. Total reported device sales by our licensees was $25.2 billion for activity in the March quarter, up approximately 19% year-over-year and consistent with our expectations at the outset of the quarter.
We estimate that approximately 134 million to 138 million subscriber units were shipped by our licensees at an average selling price of approximately $183 to $189. We believe the average selling price increased sequentially driven by higher end devices, notably smartphones.
QCT shipped a record 103 million chipsets this quarter. QCT’s operating margin was 24% better than our expectation at the outset of the quarter driven by greater phone volume and favorable product mix related to smartphone demand trends, as well as relative strengths in North America.
Operating cash flow was $951 million, and our cash and marketable securities balance was $17.6 billion at the end of the quarter with $5.9 billion onshore and $11.7 billion offshore.
During the third fiscal quarter and the first few weeks of this current quarter, we returned $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders, including dividends paid of the $309 million and $1.3 billion of shares repurchased. Our remaining stock purchase authority is now $1.7 billion.
Our pro forma tax rate was approximately 19% in the third fiscal quarter and we estimate our pro forma annual tax rate will be approximately 20% to 21% for fiscal 2010.
As Paul mentioned, we won spectrum in the recent India BWA Auction for a total cost of approximately $1.1 billion. Due to local regulatory restrictions, we’ve financed the payment for the spectrum on a short term basis with a Rupee bank loan.
We expect to form a partnership and finalize the partnership capital structure, including news of our offshore cash by the end of the calendar year, and we plan to ultimately exit the venture.
Now turning to our guidance, for CDMA-based device shipments, we continue to see strong growth in global 3G device sales and we are reaffirming our 2010 forecast.
We estimate that between 600 million and 650 million CDMA-based devices will be shipped in 2010, reflecting approximately 18% to 28% growth year-over-year, based on the 508 million mid-point of our 2009 estimate.
Our estimates for CDMA channel inventory is consistent with our prior expectations as we continue to estimate that is at the lower end of the historical range and will remain so the rest of this year.
We are raising our revenue guidance and now expect fiscal 2010 revenues to be in the range of approximately $10.7 billion to $11 billion. We are raising our earnings per share guidance and now expect pro forma earnings per share to be in the range of approximately $2.33 to $2.37.
We estimate that the average selling price of CDMA-based devices for fiscal 2010 would be approximately $184 to $188, a slight increase above our prior guidance.
We continue to estimate the average to QTL royalty rate for fiscal 2010 as you calculated with the information we provide and excluding the one-time Samsung catch-up in the fiscal quarter to be approximately equal to the rate of our fourth fiscal quarter 2009. The rate continues to be understated due to two licensee disputes.
We are reaffirming our estimate for pro forma combined R&D and SG&A expense to grow approximately 4% year-over-year.
Looking ahead to the fourth fiscal quarter, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $2.67 billion to $2.93 billion. We estimate pro-forma earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter to be approximately $0.55 to $0.59.
We estimate that June quarter total reported device sales, which will be reported later this quarter by our licensees, will be approximately $26.5 billion to $28.5 billion, up approximately 5% to 13% sequentially and 6% to 14% year-over-year.
Our current estimates for QTL fourth fiscal quarter revenue and gross margins are contributing to Qualcomm’s raised guidance. Although, we now see some foreign exchange impact, notably the euro, it is more than offset by higher than expected ASPs.
We anticipate that QCT will ship a new record of approximately 106 million to 111 million MSM units during the September quarter. We anticipate fourth fiscal quarter pro forma combined R&D and SG&A expenses will increase sequentially from 1% or 2%.
In closing, we are pleased with the progress we’re seeing in the second half of this fiscal year. That includes my comments. I’ll now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw.

I’d also just be grateful, Bill, if you might be able to clarify, it separately look liked the gross margin for the licensing business was slightly lower in the quarter. Could you clarify what might have contributed to that? Thank you so much.

In particular, we saw as I said in my script, we saw that our integrated solution really jumped up 50% actually on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
We also saw pretty strong growth in UMTS, which I think was beneficial as well. Looking forward into the fourth quarter, we expect to see again double-digit percentage growth on a sequential basis on our integrated smartphone chipsets. So, we think we’re benefiting from a positive mix shift.

On the other hand, we hear from your customers, public announcements from Samsung that they launched now Android phones based on their Hummingbird, and LG endorsing OMAP.

I mentioned in the script about launching 15 different Snapdragon designs over the last quarter alone. There is a fair bit of customer diversity there, which I think helps us. I think it’s somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 to 11 different customers actually launching those products. We also had a significant increase from a new customer, who is ramping, a European customer, which I think helps us in terms of diversifying the business.
The other trend that we’re seeing both strategically as well as in our numbers is the move to more mass markets smartphones. As they move that direction, we think it actually advantages us in terms of our integrated solutions, just because the only way that you can get to that cost point is by integrating. I know there’s differences of opinion on this, but as you get to a lower price phone, the phone that actually replaces a feature phone, which is where a lot of the volume comes from, they tend to go integrated. We see that in our order flow as well. As I mentioned, we had almost 50% sequential growth from Q2 to Q3, and we expect that to continue at double-digit percentage rate from Q3 to Q4.

But I think in terms of how the open market hits that, probably not as big an impact as you might think. I think there was a question too about an update on Snapdragon designs. We stopped tracking them probably as closely as we did in the early days. So it’s just a fair, broad sort of design flow across most of our OEMs. I think we’ve talked about 40 different customers and over 100 different designs. It’s very strong design-in flow right now.

We also had some positive mix shift due the strength in smartphones, even inside of what we thought at the time we gave the outlook.
As we’ve talked about a number of times, the market is actually very difficult to measure and to predict in terms of mix. We are seeing customer demand pull in and ask for products inside of lead time. We are able to meet that demand. In this quarter, that’s been something that really positively impacted our numbers. It probably would have even been better had the rest of the supply chain been able to meet those demands as well, but I think it is well documented.

So I would say it will get done in the next year, but I don’t think I can be much more specific than that. The process going forward includes a number of alternatives, so I wouldn’t necessarily jump to the conclusion that it will be done one way or another. There are different things that we’re trying to do in that process to see whether we can retain some ability to give advantages to our chipsets, for example, going forward.

We think there are designs and when we look at the competitive data, it has advanced both in terms of timing and performance on a core by core basis. If you look at the performance metrics even on browsers and things like that, we feel that it actually even showed itself for the system level.
So, if you look at the performance even clock rate to clock rate, we think we have an advantage with the current design. We are working on speed enhancing those designs which you’ll see come out in the dual core designs. We also have a 1.5 and above gigahertz solutions also sampling that we can use. We’re coming out with the next generation micro-architecture which we think bumps it up substantially as well.
So, we feel that we have a leadership position into the future with regards to micro-architecture and microprocessors. I will say that the industry is filled with a lot of folks, either speed binning parts or doing things and comparing probably less apples to apples. But we feel very comfortable in terms of where we stand competitively with a commercial solution. So, hopefully that’s the answer to the one.
The second one was LTE ASPs. We do see uplift in terms of LTE ASP. The way that we positioned our product is that it comes out in standalone form and then it will be integrated in with our high-end smartphone solution. We think that LTE eventually will become a table stakes feature at the high end of flagships smartphones, and we’re positioning ourselves for that.

I mentioned about the diversity of customers earlier on. I think that is something that actually helps us to a certain extent.
In terms of pricing, it’s still a very competitive environment as semiconductors always are. Relative to where we were a year ago, I think a year ago we had a number of people who were probably entering into the market and were probably a bit more aggressive than what we see today. A lot of them have already entered, have already played their hand to some extent.
There’s always continual pressure as products get upgraded, but I think it’s probably a little bit less aggressive relative to where it was let’s say three quarters ago. You can see that I think in our ASP trends as well if you look at sort of a sequential change in our ASP. But it continues to be something that we have to manage and have to work our way and innovate our way out of.

Things like eventually the India spectrum, mirasol investments as well, clearly, we also invest that money offshore. The returns off of that are onshore and we use that for things like dividends and share buyback.
But in addition, we’ve been having a number of discussions lately with the government about the opportunities for repatriation, because we feel very strongly that with the amount of offshore cash that a lot of U.S. companies have that really could be almost a private sector stimulus if there was a way to bring that money back and incentivize companies to bring that money back and put it to use in the United States.
So we’ve had discussions around whether that could be used for CapEx and things like building factories in the United States, whether we could use it for improving or increasing R&D in the United States. We have also had discussions about whether it could be brought back for doing things like providing dividends to shareholders, and you do get some push back.
There is a perception in Washington that previous repatriation that happened did not result in job growth and so forth. In fact, I guess, some companies that had repatriated money had layoffs after that and so that left a bad taste in the mouth of many politicians and regulators. But I think, that there are arguments to be made there and we will continue to make those kinds of arguments, but in as well as doing that obviously we’ll continue to use it for investments and for business purposes.

I am just trying to get a handle on the mix.

But the way, if you look at our product portfolio, we essentially have high-end smartphone solutions, we have kind of mass market smartphone solutions and feature phone, and then we have modems. The modem tier really depending on whether you’re taking sort of last year’s modem or this year’s modem or next year’s modem, there’s a pretty big difference in terms of pricing. We do get paid we think for our leadership of modems.
Depending on how particular OEM that’s using a standalone modem, which modem tier they select, that influences the ASP quite a bit. Probably the modem tier that we use in sort of mass market USB tends to be a little bit below what we see in the handset tier. So, short answer to your question, it really depends on what the OEM picks in terms of how it will affect our ASP.

So, revenues were low in QTL just from a seasonality standpoint, so that affected the margins, one. Two, was that, more of our legal expenses and patent filing expenses were impacting licensing business this quarter.
On your second question, the royalty rate, yes, we have been saying that we expect the royalty rate as you calculated based on the information we provide for this year to about equal the rate that we reported going out of fiscal ‘09. It ebbs and flows a bit from quarter-to-quarter for things like infrastructure payments or the mix of product, but on balance we think it’s going to be about equal for the full year. And then, of course, remember too that that rate is understated because of two licensee disputes that we remain confident in it and it really just a matter of time before we are able to report those revenues.

And then in terms of the revenue, in the past we’ve said that it’s in the range of approximately $200 million, we think as of the end of this fiscal year that revenue that’s due to us that we expect to ultimately collect. The number has not changed substantially, but the probability at which we are including revenues for fiscal ‘10 has been reducing as times gone by.

33493,67259612,68318,"QUALCOMM Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-21-2010",2010-07-21,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. Our financial performance this quarter was ahead of our expectations. It was driven by record MSM chipset shipments, favorable product mix and continued strong demand for 3G devices around the world. Looking f",1360,"Thanks, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. Our financial performance this quarter was ahead of our expectations. It was driven by record MSM chipset shipments, favorable product mix and continued strong demand for 3G devices around the world. Looking forward, we continue to see healthy CDMA-based device growth approximately 23% in calendar year 2010, and are pleased to be raising our revenue and earnings guidance for the fiscal year. I'd also like to highlight that during the third quarter and the first few weeks of our current quarter, we repurchased an additional $1.3 billion of our common stock, bringing our cumulative repurchases to $3 billion in this fiscal year.
This is an exciting time in the wireless industry. Although some global economic uncertainty remains, our business is extremely well-positioned to capitalize on some very positive industry trends. Specifically, mobile wireless data usage continues to expand rapidly, a rather transformative stage in the industry as people increasingly use their 3G devices to stay connected. New network technologies are coming online to meet the demand for more capacity. With the recent issuance of licenses in India, the 3G footprint is now global. 
Finally, we're seeing the emergence of new 3G-connected device types come to market. And QUALCOMM's scale and breadth of technologies position us to uniquely capitalize on these opportunities. A broad licensing program and our semiconductor expertise in managing the complex performance in power management demands of the market really set us apart.
Moving into some specific. Global wireless subscribers recently surpassed the 5 billion milestone according to Wireless Intelligence, just over 1 billion of these being 3G. According to the GSA and CDG, approximately 85% of the world's networks now support 3G. With networks in place and a healthy demand for data services, we expect the global migration from 2G to 3G to continue.
Smartphones remain one of the fastest-growing segments in wireless as evidenced by the focus major OEMs are placing on this device category. According to Informa, one in every five phones sold globally in 2010 will be a smartphone. By 2012, approximately one in every three is projected to be a smartphone. Additionally, we're seeing carriers continue to experiment with variable data pricing plans, which will help spur data growth and drive demand for data-capable devices. Our broad family chipsets, including the cost-effective QSC single chips designed for emerging markets, as well as our industry-leading Snapdragon products, which support a wide range of operating systems and multimedia capabilities, position us well to assist our partners in creating devices across all tiers in the market.
We recently held our first annual uplink conference in San Diego, which provided a forum for developers and partners to learn about new initiatives within QUALCOMM and to create new business opportunities. The event was a success and brought together more than 2,100 attendees from around the world. We focused on our support for multiple operating systems and how developers can better optimize their applications to work with our solutions, as well as how Brew MP will help bring the smartphone experience to the masses.
Brew MP is gaining traction with operators such as AT&T, America Movil, Korea Telecom and China Telecom, in addition to the traditional Brew operators. To meet the growing demand for wireless data, more license spectrum needs to be made available for mobile broadband around the world. Operators are making significant spectrum and capital investments to keep pace with consumer demand. And we're very encouraged that in just the past few months, India, Germany, France, Denmark, the Netherlands along with Mexico and Colombia have all conducted major spectrum auctions. 
On the technology front, operators continue to invest in network enhancements, the GSA reported that almost all operators have launched WCDMA have upgraded to HSPA, and approximately 1/3 of these operators are committed to deploying the higher data rates with HSPA+. In addition, 80 operators have  committed to deploy LTE, up from 64 just a few months back.
Moving to the region, China represents a significant 3G opportunity with only 12% of the approximately 800 million subscribers using 3G according to Wireless Intelligence and operator reports. The breath of 3G devices being made available to consumers across China continue to grow, fueling demand for 3G adoption. China Telecom has been adding more than 3 million CDMA2000 subscribers per month this year, thus further energizing and leading the global CDMA2000 ecosystem. At the end of June, they hosted the China Telecom CDMA2000 Ecosystem Conference, an event that attracted several thousand attendees and served as a venue for ecosystem players to develop business opportunities relating to new devices and technologies.
At the event, China Telecom encouraged device manufacturers to use Brew MP as an operating system for low and mid-tier smartphones and shared expectation that smartphones will make up to 50% of 2011 new handset models. 
Other topics of discussion included QChat, 1x Advanced and EV-DO, including Rev B. With over 71 million CDMA subscribers on their network, China Telecom is on a path to becoming the largest CDMA2000 operator in the world.
In North America, we continue to see a bifurcation of demand with growth at both the high-end and low-end. Smartphones continue to define innovation in this highly competitive region with some of the hottest devices incorporating our Snapdragon solution, including HTC's Incredible and Evo. As well, prepaid continues to show signs of strength and several operators reported strong prepaid numbers in calendar Q1.
We're also seeing some encouraging signs with replacement rates as consumers upgrade to new devices. Verizon reported that 8.6% of their postpaid base upgraded in the first quarter representing an increase of almost 15% from a year ago. In Europe, we do remain cautious on short term growth prospects, but within this backdrop, we are confident in the continued 3G growth and are encouraged by several favorable trends. Leading operators are pushing smartphone growth and are actively deploying HSPA+ as an evolution for 3G networks. According to the GSA, the number of commercial HSPA+ networks in Europe jumped from eight to 34 in the past year. On their last earnings call, Vodaphone Group reported that their current smartphone sales were 30% of their total mix and they intend to grow the smartphone mix to 70% or more by their fiscal 2012.
We're also continuing to see strength in 3G USB dongles. A competition is going to drive 3G price points lower and into prepaid as evidenced by the launch of T-Mobile's Android-based  Pulse Mini and Samsung's Pocket 3G. And lastly, according to Wireless Intelligence, 3G penetration in Eastern Europe is approximately 10% leaving strong growth opportunities ahead.
Turning to India, the 3G auction process was completed with seven carriers being awarded spectrum. Consumers will benefit as these carriers compete to provide compelling 3G services and product offerings. Based on operator commentary, new 3G networks could be in service as soon as the end of this year. The expanded 3G footprint in India will provide us an opportunity to address the higher tier that was previously served by 2G devices. 
In June, we won a 20 megahertz slot of spectrum in the four telecom circles in the Indian Broadband Wireless Access auction. Our strategy with this spectrum is to facilitate the deployment of TD-LTE technology in combination with 3G, provide a clear technology roadmap for Indian operators and help foster a worldwide 3G/LTE ecosystem.
With respect to our FLO TV business, we are engaged in discussions with a number of partners regarding the future direction of the business. We are considering a number of alternatives and we will update you as appropriate. 
So in conclusion, our fiscal year revenues are broadly in line with our original expectations at the outset of the year with earnings per share trending ahead. While revenue growth this year is below what we expect of our business longer-term, we're confident that the investments we are making in new products and technologies, as well as the strategic pricing initiatives we have taken this year to maintain and grow our business, will allow us to achieve our long-term growth objective.
That concludes my comments and I will now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf."

Our QCT business continues to execute well and I'm pleased to be able to share some highlights from the third fiscal quarter of 2010. We had a record quarter shipping approximately 103 million MSMs, which represents an increase of 11% over the previous quarter. This increase was driven by our leadership in smartphones, particularly UMTS, as customers embraced our integrated roadmap, including our 7000 and 8000 series chipsets, and by continued strong demand for our data-centric products.
In total, QCT revenues were up 10% sequentially, reflecting these strong unit volumes and relatively stable prices. The investments we have made in our smartphone portfolio have put us in a leadership position across all tiers and geographies. This was evidenced by our growth of our 7k and 8k series chipset shipments of nearly 50% sequentially. We believe we have gained significant share in mobile application processors in the past two years with our internal data showing that our share at application processors has more than doubled in this period. Our flagship Snapdragon brand has become the industry benchmark with over 15 new designs launching this past quarter.
In the rapidly growing Android segment, we are continuing our leadership position in both modems and application processors. Since launching the world's first Android device almost three years ago, we now have over 40 commercially launched designs spanning multiple price tiers and form factors, ranging from smartphones to smartbook devices. QUALCOMM's chipsets are in some of the most popular devices this quarter, including the HTC Incredible, the HTC Evo, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 and Lenovo's LePhone. We expect our success with Android devices to continue as we expand our support for Android across all tiers of our MSM. Today, our partners have more than 50 device designs in progress based on our platform. Our current generation of Snapdragon chips are shipping in volume and we continue to expand our industry-leading portfolio. This quarter, we sampled our Snapdragon dual core 1.2 gigahertz chipset with advanced GPU and multimedia capabilities.
The industry is going through multiple modem technology transitions from 2G to 3G in some countries and 3G to 4G in others. We believe these technology transitions are opportunities for us to continue to demonstrate our strength in both modem development and systems integration. Our MDM9000 series, 3G LTE multimode chips are available now. We expect to see data devices based on these chipsets offered commercially before the end of the year, followed by smartphones and other smart-connected devices starting next year.
We had incorporated TD-LTE into all of our 3G LTE chipsets to align with and leverage our recent win of BWA spectrum in the 2.3 gigahertz band in India, and our worldwide carrier relationships. We continue to focus on advanced wireless WAN technologies, deliver backwards compatibility on our chipsets with all air interfaces and global multimode capabilities, which is an important and growing strategic advantage for us versus the competition. 
Looking ahead, demand for our chipset products remains strong. For our fourth fiscal quarter, we estimate MSM shipments will increase to approximately 106 to 111 million units driven primarily by greater demand for smartphones and strength in China and North America. The chipset market continues to be very competitive and the pricing environment is mostly consistent with our expectations at the onset of the year. As always, the demand profile across our broad product portfolio is a key driver of our results. Based on our latest estimates of this demand mix, we expect QCT operating profit for fiscal 2010 to be close to the high end of our prior guidance of 22% to 24%.
We are pleased with the execution across teams in QCT and we look forward to the opportunities ahead. Our chipset portfolio aligns with device trends today and in the future, with industry-leading chipsets for HSPA+; multimode 3G LTE; integrated Snapdragon solutions for tiered smartbooks, smartphones and tablets; as well as low-cost solutions for the unique needs in emerging markets. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel."

Revenues were $2.7 billion with the high-end of our prior guidance. The pro forma earnings per share were $0.57 exceeding our prior guidance on the strength of record MSM shipments. In our QTL segment, revenues were $847 million. Total reported device sales by our licensees was $25.2 billion for activity in the March quarter, up approximately 19% year-over-year and consistent with our expectations at the outset of the quarter.
We estimate that approximately 134 to 138 million subscriber units were shipped by our licensees at an average selling price of approximately $183  to $189. We believe the average selling price increased sequentially driven by higher end devices, notably smartphones.
QCT shipped a record 103 million chipsets this quarter. QCT's operating margin was 24%, better than our expectation at the outset of the quarter, driven by greater phone volume and favorable product mix related to smartphone demand trends, as well as relative strength in North America. Operating cash flow was $951 million and our cash and marketable securities balance was $17.6 billion at the end of the quarter, with $5.9 billion onshore and $11.7 billion offshore.
During the third fiscal quarter and the first few weeks of this current quarter, we returned $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders, including dividends paid at $309 million and $1.3 billion of shares repurchased. Our remaining stock purchase authority is now $1.7 billion. Our pro forma tax rate was approximately 19% in the third fiscal quarter, and we estimate our pro forma annual tax rate will be approximately 20% to 21% for fiscal 2010.
As Paul mentioned, we won spectrum in the recent India BWA auction for a total cost of approximately $1.1 billion. Due to local regulatory restrictions, we financed the payment for the spectrum on a short-term basis with a rupee bank loan. We expect to form a partnership and finalize the partnership capital structure, including use of our offshore cash by the end of the calendar year. And we plan to ultimately exit the venture.
Now turning to our guidance. For CDMA-based device shipments, we continue to see strong growth in global 3G device sales and we are reaffirming our 2010 forecast. We estimate that between 600 million and 650 million CDMA devices will be shipped in 2010, reflecting approximately 18% to 28% growth year-over-year based on the 508 million midpoint of our 2009 estimate. Our estimate for CDMA channel inventory is consistent with our prior expectations as we continue to estimate that it's at the lower end of the historical range and will remain so the rest of this year.
We are raising our revenue guidance and now expect fiscal 2010 revenues to be in the range of approximately $10.7 billion to $11 billion. We are raising our earnings per share guidance and now expect pro forma earnings per share to be in the range of approximately $2.33 to $2.37. We estimate that the average selling price of CDMA-based devices for fiscal 2010 will be approximately $184 to $188, a slight increase above our prior guidance. We continue to estimate that the average QTL royalty rate fiscal 2010 as you calculate it with the information we provide, and excluding the one-time Samsung catch-up in the first fiscal quarter, to be approximately equal to the rate of our fourth fiscal quarter 2009. The rate continues to be understated due to two licensee disputes.  We are reaffirming our estimate or pro forma combined R&D and SG&A expense to grow approximately 4% year-over-year. 
Looking ahead to the fourth fiscal quarter, we estimate revenues be in the range of approximately $2.67 billion to $2.93 billion. We estimate pro forma earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter to be approximately $0.55 to $0.59. We estimate that June quarter total reported device sales, which will be reported later this quarter by our licensees, will be approximately $26.5 billion to $28.5 billion, up approximately 5% to 13% sequentially and 6% to 14% year-over-year. Our current estimates for QTL fourth fiscal quarter revenue and gross margin are contributing to QUALCOMM's raised guidance. Although we now see some foreign exchange impact, notably the Euro, it is more than offset by higher than expected ASPs.
We anticipate that QCT will ship a new record of approximately 106 million to 111 million MSM units during the September quarter. We anticipate fourth fiscal quarter pro forma combined R&D and SG&A expenses will increase sequentially, approximately 1% to 2%. 
In closing, we're pleased with the progress we're seeing in the second half of this fiscal year. That does concludes my comments. I'll now turn the call back to Dr. Warren Kneeshaw."

We also had some positive mix shift due to the strength in smartphones, even inside of what we thought at the time we gave the outlook. As we mentioned, there's a fair bit of -- or as we talked about a number of times, the market is actually very difficult to measure and to predict in terms of mix. We are seeing customer demand pull in and ask for products inside of lead time. We're able to meet that demand. In this quarter, that's been something -- it really positively impacted our numbers. It probably would have even been better had the rest of the supply chain been able to meet those demands as well.

So if you look at the performance even clock rate to clock rate, we think we have an advantage with the current design. We are working on speed-enhancing those designs, which you'll see come out of the dual-core designs. We also have a 1.5 and above gigahertz solutions, also sampling that we can use. We're coming out with the next-generation micro-architecture, which we think bumps it up substantially as well. So we feel we have a leadership position into the future with regards to micro-architecture and microprocessors. I will say that the industry is filled with a lot of folks either speed bending parts, or doing things and comparing probably less apples to apples. But we feel very comfortable in terms with where we stand competitively with the commercial solutions. So hopefully, that answers the first one. The second one was LTE ASPs. We do see an uplift in terms of LTE ASP. The way that we positioned our products is that it comes out in stand-alone form and then will be integrated in with our high-end smartphone solution. We think that LTE eventually will become a table stakes feature at the high end of flagship smartphones, and we're positioning ourselves for that."

Clearly, we also invest that money offshore. The returns off of that are onshore, and we use that for things like dividends and share buybacks. But in addition, we've been having a number of discussions lately with the government about the opportunities for repatriation because we feel very strongly that with the amount of offshore cash that a lot of U.S. companies have, that really could be almost a private sector stimulus, if there was a way to bring that money back and to incentivize companies to bring that money back and put it to use in the United States. So we've had discussions around whether that could be used for CapEx, things like building factories in the United States, whether we could use it for improving or increasing R&D in the United States. And we've also had discussions about whether it could be brought back for doing things like providing dividends to shareholders. And you do get some pushback. There is a perception in Washington that previous repatriation that happened did not result in job growth and so forth.

So first of all, we saw QTL operating margins that look to me like they came down about 500 basis points. And we have the royalty rate, as you mentioned, compressed a bit, then I think you said it was due to infrastructure. I was wondering if you could give me a little bit of color on what drove such a large decline in the QTL operating margin. And also, for your guidance at the full year, royalty rate would be about where Q4 '09 was last year. By my recollection, that was about 3.4% I think. Will that imply further compression of royalty rates in Q4?"

One is that we're recording revenues now for our products that licensees shipped in the March quarter. March quarter tend to be the low quarter coming off of the holiday season. So revenues were low in QTL just from a seasonality standpoint. So that affected the margins, one. Two was that more of our legal expenses and patent filing expenses were impacting Licensing business this quarter. On your second question, the royalty rate, yes, we have been saying that we expect the royalty rate, as you calculate it based on the information we provide, to about equal, for this year, the rate we reported going out of fiscal '09. It ebbs and flows a bit from quarter to quarter for things like infrastructure payments or the mix of product. But on balance, we think it's going to be about equal through a the full year. And then, of course, remember too that, that rate is understated because of two licensee disputes that we remain confident in, and it's just a matter of time before we are able to report those revenues."

Overall, those fees are down substantially if you look back a year or two. But right now, the Licensing business, couple matters we're dealing with are focused on licensing. And then, in terms of the revenue, in the past, we've said that it's in the range of approximately $200 million. We think, as of the end of this fiscal year, that revenue that's due to us, that we expect to ultimately collect, the number's not changed substantially. But the probability at which we're including revenues for fiscal '10 has been reducing as time's gone by. Again, we're very confident that we'll ultimately be able to record these revenues.

Let me begin by saying how pleased I am with our performance this year as we delivered record earnings per share and record MSM chipset volumes. Looking forward, our outlook reflect strong revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2011. In the coming year, we expect continued healthy growth in CDMA-based device shipments including smartphones and other data-centric devices driven by the global adoption of 3G and accelerating consumer demand for wireless data.
There's been a number of highlights this year. First, QCT continued to execute. Our Snapdragon platforms set the competitive benchmark for smartphone silicon, and we've taken a leadership position in offering our chipsets for key operating systems such as Android and Windows Phone 7. We offer the industry's broadest 3G product roadmap, and we continued to grow share in WCDMA chipsets.
Our Licensing business continues to be well positioned in 3G and multimode 3G LTE and now has over 185 licensees. Of note, we added another 14 new Chinese licensees in fiscal 2010, bringing the total number of Chinese licensees to 65. Our licensing program continues to foster innovation and supports the 3G ecosystem that benefits wireless consumers worldwide.
In terms of our Display business, we believe mirasol is a disruptive technology for the mobile display industry. The combined benefits of extremely low power consumption with sunlight viewability and support for color, video and touch sets us apart from the competition. We've made strong progress in the development of this display technology as we brought our first batch online and are targeting limited volume commercial 5.7-inch display devices in the first half of 2011. We're very excited about that prospects for this technology, and we'll be providing more details at our upcoming Analyst Day.
In FLO TV, we have decided to change directions, stepping back from the direct to consumer business and commencing a restructuring plan, under which we expect to exit the current FLO TV Service business. We're in discussions with a variety of interested parties and are continuing to evaluate other options for this business. Possibilities range from a new wholesale model, sale or joint venture with the third-party and/or sale of the spectrum licenses and discontinuance of the operation of the network.
Overall, we had strong earnings and cash flow performance in fiscal 2010. We returned more than $4 billion to shareholders in the form of a $3 billion buyback and over $1 billion in cash dividend. We ended the year well positioned with a strong balance sheet, including $18.4 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to calendar 2011. We expect CDMA and multimode 3G 4G-based device shipments to grow to approximately 765 million units, up 20% year-over-year based on the midpoint of our projections. This growth will be driven by the global adoption of 3G, the continued demand for wireless data, strength in consumer demand for smartphones, growth in new connected device categories as well as 3G momentum in emerging regions.
Operators around the world continue to benefit from the growth in wireless data. Japan is approaching a tipping point where data ARPU will exceed that of voice. In the United States, AT&T recently reported a 30% year-over-year growth in data revenues, and Verizon Wireless stated that data comprised over 35% of its revenues this quarter.
We expect this trend of data growth to continue as operators increasingly experiment with variable pricing plans that provide more choice and lower total cost of ownership alternatives to consumers. To meet the network needs, resulting from this rapid growth in wireless data use, operators continue to make investments in the latest air interface technologies. TDDI recently announced its fourth quarter device lineup, and seven of the new devices included support for multi-carrier EV-DO also known as EV-DO Rev. B.
According to the GSA, to date, there are a total of 81 operators who have launched HSPA+ Networks, of which nine support dual carrier HSPA+ with data rates of 42 megabits per second. The rate of HSPA+ Network launches is faster today than when HSUPA was first introduced. We're also seeing strong momentum behind LTE led by Verizon's expected launch this quarter. Our multimode capabilities are essential for device on these networks, and we're very well positioned to capitalize on these dynamics by leveraging our time-to-market advantages and industry-leading modem solutions.
Smartphones remain the strongest area of growth within the Wireless segment, driven by continued innovation and competition. According to analysts, the global smartphone shipments exceeded 80 million units this quarter, representing a 30% increase quarter-over-quarter and a 95% increase from the year prior.
Looking forward, according to Gartner, smartphones as a percentage of the total handset market is expected to grow from approximately 16% in 2009 to greater than 45% in 2014. These numbers would be even greater if they had included blue mobile platform based phones in their numbers.
And our emergence of new connected device category is also a favorable trend for our business. As volumes in new categories like 3G connected e-readers and tablets continue to grow, they represent incremental growth opportunities for our businesses, driving adoption of multiple 3G devices for consumer.
The growth of 3G and emerging regions is another catalyst for our business. China represents a significant opportunity with a low CDMA penetration rate of 13%. With 3G networks now maturing, operators have turned to increasing the number of devices available on their networks. For example, China Telecom reported more than 100 EV-DO handset models in supply by the first half of 2010. In China, Unicom had over 90 3G models available as of June.
In India, 3G licenses had been issued, and the majority of newly licensed operators plan to launch 3G services before the end of calendar year 2010. Tata DOCOMO became the first private Indian operator to launch 3G. 3G services will be available across all nine of their circles this week.
On the legal front, as we noted in our 10-K, in September, the company was notified by the SEC of a formal investigation that arose from a whistleblower's allegations made in December 2009 to the audit committee of the Board of Directors and to the SEC. The audit committee has conducted a review into the allegations and related accounting practice with the assistance of independent counsel and independent forensic accountants. This recently concluded review did not identify any errors in the company's financial statements. The company continued to cooperate with the SEC's ongoing investigation and look forward to resolving this matter.
And separately, I'm pleased to report that the arbitrator in the Panasonic arbitration issued an interim order in the first day of the process denying Panasonic's claims that we've breached our license agreement with them. We're pleased with this initial finding as it supports our belief that Panasonic's claims are without merit.
So to wrap up, we've completed another record year at Qualcomm, and I'd like to thank all of our employees and partners for their tremendous efforts. With our broad licensing program and industry-leading chipset roadmap, we're extremely well positioned to take advantage of key 3G growth opportunities in both developed and emerging regions around the world. 
In looking forward, I am pleased with our outlook for improved revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2011 and strong growth in CDMA-based device shipments, driven by the global migration in the 3G and the increasing consumer appetite for data-centric devices, particularly smartphones. 
That concludes my comments, and I'll now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf."

Our QCT business delivered strong results this year in a dynamic environment, reflecting growing demand across our product portfolio. We had another record quarter, shipping 111 billion MSMs, which was a great follow-on to our record results in the June quarter.
We also had a record year shipping just under 400 million MSMs. We are extremely pleased to deliver stronger-than-expected revenues and operating profit for the quarter and for the fiscal year with operating margins exceeding the top end of our guidance. As we anticipated in July, demand for smartphones continued to grow in the September quarter. This is clearly a favorable trend for our business. Shipments of integrated 7,000 and 8,000-series chipsets increased more than 30% quarter-over-quarter and nearly 100% year-over-year. We also saw continued strong demand for our QSC and data-centric products. Our broad, industry-leading chipset roadmap help us grow share in both WCDMA handsets and in mobile application processors this year.
As forecasted a year ago, we experienced a greater-than-normal decline in our average revenue per MSM during fiscal year 2010. In the first half, this was driven by competitive pricing pressure and an increase in sales of chips for entry level and lower-tier feature phones. In the second half, we saw even stronger-than-anticipated demand for our higher-tier integrated chipsets, evidenced by the fact that we shipped 4x the number of Snapdragon chipsets in the second half of fiscal 2010 than we did in the first half.
This favorable mix trend is likely to continue into fiscal Q1, resulting in a sequential increase in average revenue per MSM. Growth in demand for smartphone chipsets continues to be an important driver for our business, and we expect to see an increase in the variety and tiering of smartphones in the future. We continue to see upside in the high-end of the market as well as the new wave of opportunity coming in the form of lower cost, high volume 3G phones in both developed and developing geographies. The cost advantages of our integrated approach and platform compatibility among our products positions us to grow as these trends play out in the market place.
We have a significant and growing number of design wins based on our integrated solutions, encompassing multiple-priced tiers and form factors. On the high end, devices based on the newest members of our Snapdragon family, the 8X55 and 7X30 chipsets are expected to be available this holiday season and devices based on our dual core products are expected to be available in the first half of calendar 2011.
New, lower-cost smartphones based on our integrated 7X27 and 7X25 chipsets are also growing, including offerings from LG, Motorola, Sony Ericsson and Huawei. In China alone, we have seen a nearly 30% growth in our customer base, with over 40 new designs in this tier. The majority of these are based on the Android operating system.
Our investments to support multiple operating systems positions as well to gain share from smartphone growth. We now have seven different integrated chipsets that support the Android operating system. We are also Microsoft's lead chipset partner for the Windows Phone 7 launch. Our Snapdragon chipset powers all nine of the new Windows Phone 7 handsets, which are expected to be in stores in Europe, the U.S. and Southeast Asia this holiday season.
On the modem side, our innovation, products quality and ability to execute continue to set us apart. In emerging markets like India and China, our single chip QSC product family positions us to benefit from the 2G to 3G transition. A number of customers including Lenovo, Yu Long and Long Xer [ph] have already launched devices based on our 6240 and 6270 chipsets, and we have more than 25 designs in progress at multiple customers in China.
In mature markets, the 3G to 4G transition has started, driven by the increasing demand of smartphones and tablet. Our MDM9600 chipset is the first and only multimode LTE solution designed to help our customers seamlessly bridge this complex technology transition. We have sampled this product and expect to see the first commercial products based off of it this quarter.
We are very pleased that we finished the 2010 fiscal year at such a strong note and above targets, driven by an increase in demand for smartphone chipsets. We expect this trend to continue into the first quarter along with initial demand for LTE chipsets. In the second half, we expect the change in mix as the demand shifts to more mass-market smartphone products and emerging market chipsets driven by the transition from 2G to 3G. We will continue to price in order to gain share in this environment as we did in fiscal 2010. You will also see a major product transition in our portfolio as we sample our first 28-nanometer parts and increase the focus on cost-optimized smartphone solutions.
In closing, we believe the QCT team executed well in fiscal 2010 and continued to drive our technology and integration leadership position in the industry. We believe we are in a strong competitive position to continue to grow share and to lead the transition to smartphones and the growth of mobility in the market.  That concludes my remarks. And I now turn the call over to Bill Keitel."

QCT had record MSM shipments and favorable product mix including HSUPA and EV-DO integrated chipsets. QCT's operating margin increased to 28%, reflecting strong volume and increased mix of higher-tiered chipsets.
QTL revenues were $921 million, and total report device sales by our licensees were approximately $28 billion for activity in the June quarter, towards the high end of our prior guidance and up 12% sequentially, reflecting strength in Europe and North America.
We estimate that approximately 153 to 157 million subscriber units were shipped by our licensees in the June quarter at an average selling price of approximately $179 to $185.
As Paul mentioned, we are excited to see the introduction and growing sales of the increasing number of new 3G-enabled products including tablets. It will drive incremental growth for QTL and QCT. As we have explained in the past, our Licensee business for sometime has had a voluntary royalty capping program for certain kinds of the devices, including 3G-enabled laptop computers. 
In order to help drive the broadest possible adoption of 3G connectivity in these new incremental product categories, we have decided for now to extend our voluntary royalty capping program to cover some additional types of connected devices such as tablets that meet certain requirements. Depending on selling prices of these devices, the royalty caps may results in a royalty payable on something less than the full ceiling price of the device. 
QTL's implied royalty rate decreased slightly quarter-over-quarter, and it's one of the key drivers in the growth of these new connected device sales, notably tablets.
Operating cash flow was $1.1 billion, and our cash and marketable securities balance was $18.4 billion at the end of the quarter, with $6.3 billion onshore and $12.1 billion offshore. Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 19% in the fiscal fourth quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter were up $0.11 over the third quarter. QCT contributed $0.07 on higher MSM shipments and a favorable product mix, while QTL was better by $0.04, driven by higher shipments of CDMA-based devices. The improvements in investment income and our tax rate offset the sequential growth in operating expenses, including two non-recurring operating expense items. 
Turning to our results for fiscal 2010, revenues were approximately $11 billion, up 6% year-over-year and in line with the midpoint of our original guidance at the outset of the fiscal year. GAAP earnings for fiscal 2010 were $1.96 per share. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 37% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings were $2.46 per share, up 88% year-over-year. Our business continued to generate strong cash flow. Operating cash flow for fiscal 2010 was more than $4 billion and approximately 37% of revenue.
QCT's fiscal 2010 operating margin was 25% above our original guidance at the outset of the fiscal year, driven by strong volumes and favorable product mix in the second half of the year, including healthy demand for our integrated smartphone chipsets. 
QTL's operating margins was 83% for fiscal 2010, and we estimate that the fiscal 2010 device ASP, as reported by our licensees, was approximately $183 to $189. Our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rates were approximately 20% of fiscal 2010. We are updating our estimate for calendar 2010 CDMA device shipments. We now expect approximately 625 million to 650 million devices to be shipped. Based on the 638 million midpoint of our estimates, we expect worldwide CDMA device shipments to grow approximately 26% year-over-year. Our prior estimate had been 23% midpoint growth.
Turning to next year. We estimate calendar 2011 CDMA device shipments will increase approximately 16% to 24% over our 2010 midpoint estimate, with unit shipments of approximately 740 million to 790 million units. Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate fiscal 2011 non-GAAP revenues to be in the range of approximately $12.4 billion to $13 billion, a double-digit increase of 13% to 18% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.3 billion in fiscal 2011, an increase of 11% to 23% year-over-year. We expect fiscal 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.77, an increase of 7% to 13% year-over-year.
We are encouraged by the progress we are making in resolving the two licensing disputes. While the outcomes remain uncertain and the disputes may not be resolved in 2011, we have included some benefit in the high-end of our 2011 guidance relating to resolution of the disputes. Our total amount expected by the licensees is significantly greater than what's in our guidance when prior years and total fiscal 2011 disputed royalties are included. We are trying to be prudent pending resolution of the matters. Once the disputes are resolved, we will adjust our guidance and provide you with an appropriate explanation so that you can understand the impact.
In the QCT segment, we expect a modest decline in revenue per MSM in fiscal 2011, more consistent with historical norms prior to fiscal 2010. We anticipate that non-GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses will grow approximately 7% year-over-year and driven primarily by growth in R&D expense. 
We have begun a restructuring plan to exit the current FLO TV Service business and expect to incur restructuring charges in fiscal 2011 to reduce ongoing expenses. This in turn better positions us for the strategic alternatives we are considering.
We expect our non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal 2011 to be approximately 21% and our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 19%.
Turning to the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we estimate non-GAAP revenues to be approximately $3 billion to $3.4 billion, an increase of 14% to 26% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $0.70 to $0.74, an increase of 13% to 19% year-over-year. This estimate includes shipments of approximately 115 to 119 million chipsets during the December quarter due to continued strong demand for smartphones in developed markets.
We expect total reported device sales of approximately $31.5 billion to $33.5 billion by our licensees for shipments in the September quarter, and we expect a favorable foreign exchange benefit of several dollars, mostly due to the euro.
We believe that the channel inventory level is going through a seasonal build for the holiday season, although early indications are that the build may be a bit larger than what we've seen in recent years. We expect non-GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses to be approximately flat sequentially. The Qualcomm Investor Relations website includes an extensive slide presentation on the many data points included on this conference call, and we look forward to seeing you in New York for our Analyst Day meeting on November 17, where we will share additional data points regarding our fiscal 2011 guidance, including regional device shipment estimates, average selling prices and channel inventory. The Analyst Day event will be webcast for those of you unable to attend. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back over to Warren."

On your smartphone mix question, I think what you're saying is in the first quarter, certainly in the quarter that we gave guidance on, we continued to see very strong shipments of smartphones and probably, as I mentioned in my script, a little bit more than we even thought a couple of quarters ago. In the second half of the year, what we anticipate happening is that this shift will be probably a little bit more to the developing market, which would kind of pull that down a little bit in terms of the type of device that we ship. It's more of a statement I think about how I think strong it is at the moment versus kind of what's happening in the second half. Although in the second half, as Bill said, it kind of goes back and fourth between developed markets versus emerging markets. We saw that happen this year as well. In terms of dual core, dual core, we have today over 10 different companies designing tablets on our dual core solutions. So we feel very good about where they're going. And then also in the handset space, you'll see that as well. That mix will start to happen through the year. The tablets space at this point, it's difficult to say how big that space is going to be. I've seen a lot of different estimates on that, and it will be interesting to see what happens. As we've probably talked before, we see that developed world being one type of market. In the developing world, I think you'll tend to see a number of different types of devices go in there, mainly because there is no laptop market for them to have to displace, and we've already seen that with some of our product today. You've seen products going into India based off of smartphone chips. So there'll be a little bit of a mix there. In all cases, I think we're still trying to figure out how big that market is and how it will develop throughout the year."

On the constitution from tablets, what we said was that on our presentation as it stands right now, in New York, but we are considering and we're having a good discussion on whether we would include a breakout estimate of connected devices. So it's under consideration, but we haven't decided that yet. It's a new developing market, a little harder to forecast because of that reason, but we are considering that. On the licensing dispute, I'll just recount I think what I think are the key points we made here. If you recall, we had said it was approximately $200 million as of the end of fiscal '10. That was due to loss and of course some licensee is paying. But we haven't recognized it. So revenues and earnings that we haven't recognized. And that number for fiscal '11 is substantially greater. And so the decision was rather than put forth it was a pretty large number. We thought it was better to just put in a very prudent estimate into our guidance of what we think will be ultimately recognizable in fiscal '11, and we did not include in that any prior year. So it would only be a prudent estimate of what is earned and what we think we will report to recognize in fiscal '11. From a timing standpoint, we'll put that in the second half of the year, but that's what we've got right now. On the mirasol side, the 2010 operating loss was approximately $180 million. We do have on a percentage basis I would say it's a fairly substantial increase year-over-year. Operating loss I think, as you know, we're pretty optimistic about the potential here we've got, and we'll get into some more specifics on that on what's in the guidance and where we stand on that business in a couple of weeks when we see in New York."

And then can you also talk about how you're basing that cap? In other words, should we assume that the absolute U.S. dollar royalty payment on these devices is going to be based off of what you're already receiving as an average on existing smartphone royalties?

I've been a pretty strong proponent that dividends would be a good use of that money, because of it create a velocity of money in the economy. I would not say that I've gotten great traction with that at this point, but we're continuing to do that. we're doing an economic study about repatriation and when that is completed, we'll be going around Washington.

Let me begin by saying how pleased I am with our performance this year as we delivered record earnings per share and record MSM chipset volumes. Looking forward, our outlook reflect strong revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2011. In the coming year, we expect continued healthy growth in CDMA-based device shipments including smartphones and other data-centric devices driven by the global adoption of 3G and accelerating consumer demand for wireless data.
There's been a number of highlights this year. First, QCT continued to execute. Our Snapdragon platforms set the competitive benchmark for smartphone silicon, and we've taken a leadership position in offering our chipsets for key operating systems such as Android and Windows Phone 7. We offer the industry's broadest 3G product roadmap, and we continued to grow share in WCDMA chipsets.
Our Licensing business continues to be well positioned in 3G and multimode 3G LTE and now has over 185 licensees. Of note, we added another 14 new Chinese licensees in fiscal 2010, bringing the total number of Chinese licensees to 65. Our licensing program continues to foster innovation and supports the 3G ecosystem that benefits wireless consumers worldwide.
In terms of our Display business, we believe mirasol is a disruptive technology for the mobile display industry. The combined benefits of extremely low power consumption with sunlight viewability and support for color, video and touch sets us apart from the competition. We've made strong progress in the development of this display technology as we brought our first batch online and are targeting limited volume commercial 5.7-inch display devices in the first half of 2011. We're very excited about that prospects for this technology, and we'll be providing more details at our upcoming Analyst Day.
In FLO TV, we have decided to change directions, stepping back from the direct to consumer business and commencing a restructuring plan, under which we expect to exit the current FLO TV Service business. We're in discussions with a variety of interested parties and are continuing to evaluate other options for this business. Possibilities range from a new wholesale model, sale or joint venture with the third-party and/or sale of the spectrum licenses and discontinuance of the operation of the network.
Overall, we had strong earnings and cash flow performance in fiscal 2010. We returned more than $4 billion to shareholders in the form of a $3 billion buyback and over $1 billion in cash dividend. We ended the year well positioned with a strong balance sheet, including $18.4 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to calendar 2011. We expect CDMA and multimode 3G 4G-based device shipments to grow to approximately 765 million units, up 20% year-over-year based on the midpoint of our projections. This growth will be driven by the global adoption of 3G, the continued demand for wireless data, strength in consumer demand for smartphones, growth in new connected device categories as well as 3G momentum in emerging regions.
Operators around the world continue to benefit from the growth in wireless data. Japan is approaching a tipping point where data ARPU will exceed that of voice. In the United States, AT&T recently reported a 30% year-over-year growth in data revenues, and Verizon Wireless stated that data comprised over 35% of its revenues this quarter.
We expect this trend of data growth to continue as operators increasingly experiment with variable pricing plans that provide more choice and lower total cost of ownership alternatives to consumers. To meet the network needs, resulting from this rapid growth in wireless data use, operators continue to make investments in the latest air interface technologies. TDDI recently announced its fourth quarter device lineup, and seven of the new devices included support for multi-carrier EV-DO also known as EV-DO Rev. B.
According to the GSA, to date, there are a total of 81 operators who have launched HSPA+ Networks, of which nine support dual carrier HSPA+ with data rates of 42 megabits per second. The rate of HSPA+ Network launches is faster today than when HSUPA was first introduced. We're also seeing strong momentum behind LTE led by Verizon's expected launch this quarter. Our multimode capabilities are essential for device on these networks, and we're very well positioned to capitalize on these dynamics by leveraging our time-to-market advantages and industry-leading modem solutions.
Smartphones remain the strongest area of growth within the Wireless segment, driven by continued innovation and competition. According to analysts, the global smartphone shipments exceeded 80 million units this quarter, representing a 30% increase quarter-over-quarter and a 95% increase from the year prior.
Looking forward, according to Gartner, smartphones as a percentage of the total handset market is expected to grow from approximately 16% in 2009 to greater than 45% in 2014. These numbers would be even greater if they had included blue mobile platform based phones in their numbers.
And our emergence of new connected device category is also a favorable trend for our business. As volumes in new categories like 3G connected e-readers and tablets continue to grow, they represent incremental growth opportunities for our businesses, driving adoption of multiple 3G devices for consumer.
The growth of 3G and emerging regions is another catalyst for our business. China represents a significant opportunity with a low CDMA penetration rate of 13%. With 3G networks now maturing, operators have turned to increasing the number of devices available on their networks. For example, China Telecom reported more than 100 EV-DO handset models in supply by the first half of 2010. In China, Unicom had over 90 3G models available as of June.
In India, 3G licenses had been issued, and the majority of newly licensed operators plan to launch 3G services before the end of calendar year 2010. Tata DOCOMO became the first private Indian operator to launch 3G. 3G services will be available across all nine of their circles this week.
On the legal front, as we noted in our 10-K, in September, the company was notified by the SEC of a formal investigation that arose from a whistleblower's allegations made in December 2009 to the audit committee of the Board of Directors and to the SEC. The audit committee has conducted a review into the allegations and related accounting practice with the assistance of independent counsel and independent forensic accountants. This recently concluded review did not identify any errors in the company's financial statements. The company continued to cooperate with the SEC's ongoing investigation and look forward to resolving this matter.
And separately, I'm pleased to report that the arbitrator in the Panasonic arbitration issued an interim order in the first day of the process denying Panasonic's claims that we've breached our license agreement with them. We're pleased with this initial finding as it supports our belief that Panasonic's claims are without merit.
So to wrap up, we've completed another record year at Qualcomm, and I'd like to thank all of our employees and partners for their tremendous efforts. With our broad licensing program and industry-leading chipset roadmap, we're extremely well positioned to take advantage of key 3G growth opportunities in both developed and emerging regions around the world. 
In looking forward, I am pleased with our outlook for improved revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2011 and strong growth in CDMA-based device shipments, driven by the global migration in the 3G and the increasing consumer appetite for data-centric devices, particularly smartphones. 
That concludes my comments, and I'll now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf.

Our QCT business delivered strong results this year in a dynamic environment, reflecting growing demand across our product portfolio. We had another record quarter, shipping 111 billion MSMs, which was a great follow-on to our record results in the June quarter.
We also had a record year shipping just under 400 million MSMs. We are extremely pleased to deliver stronger-than-expected revenues and operating profit for the quarter and for the fiscal year with operating margins exceeding the top end of our guidance. As we anticipated in July, demand for smartphones continued to grow in the September quarter. This is clearly a favorable trend for our business. Shipments of integrated 7,000 and 8,000-series chipsets increased more than 30% quarter-over-quarter and nearly 100% year-over-year. We also saw continued strong demand for our QSC and data-centric products. Our broad, industry-leading chipset roadmap help us grow share in both WCDMA handsets and in mobile application processors this year.
As forecasted a year ago, we experienced a greater-than-normal decline in our average revenue per MSM during fiscal year 2010. In the first half, this was driven by competitive pricing pressure and an increase in sales of chips for entry level and lower-tier feature phones. In the second half, we saw even stronger-than-anticipated demand for our higher-tier integrated chipsets, evidenced by the fact that we shipped 4x the number of Snapdragon chipsets in the second half of fiscal 2010 than we did in the first half.
This favorable mix trend is likely to continue into fiscal Q1, resulting in a sequential increase in average revenue per MSM. Growth in demand for smartphone chipsets continues to be an important driver for our business, and we expect to see an increase in the variety and tiering of smartphones in the future. We continue to see upside in the high-end of the market as well as the new wave of opportunity coming in the form of lower cost, high volume 3G phones in both developed and developing geographies. The cost advantages of our integrated approach and platform compatibility among our products positions us to grow as these trends play out in the market place.
We have a significant and growing number of design wins based on our integrated solutions, encompassing multiple-priced tiers and form factors. On the high end, devices based on the newest members of our Snapdragon family, the 8X55 and 7X30 chipsets are expected to be available this holiday season and devices based on our dual core products are expected to be available in the first half of calendar 2011.
New, lower-cost smartphones based on our integrated 7X27 and 7X25 chipsets are also growing, including offerings from LG, Motorola, Sony Ericsson and Huawei. In China alone, we have seen a nearly 30% growth in our customer base, with over 40 new designs in this tier. The majority of these are based on the Android operating system.
Our investments to support multiple operating systems positions as well to gain share from smartphone growth. We now have seven different integrated chipsets that support the Android operating system. We are also Microsoft's lead chipset partner for the Windows Phone 7 launch. Our Snapdragon chipset powers all nine of the new Windows Phone 7 handsets, which are expected to be in stores in Europe, the U.S. and Southeast Asia this holiday season.
On the modem side, our innovation, products quality and ability to execute continue to set us apart. In emerging markets like India and China, our single chip QSC product family positions us to benefit from the 2G to 3G transition. A number of customers including Lenovo, Yu Long and Long Xer [ph] have already launched devices based on our 6240 and 6270 chipsets, and we have more than 25 designs in progress at multiple customers in China.
In mature markets, the 3G to 4G transition has started, driven by the increasing demand of smartphones and tablet. Our MDM9600 chipset is the first and only multimode LTE solution designed to help our customers seamlessly bridge this complex technology transition. We have sampled this product and expect to see the first commercial products based off of it this quarter.
We are very pleased that we finished the 2010 fiscal year at such a strong note and above targets, driven by an increase in demand for smartphone chipsets. We expect this trend to continue into the first quarter along with initial demand for LTE chipsets. In the second half, we expect the change in mix as the demand shifts to more mass-market smartphone products and emerging market chipsets driven by the transition from 2G to 3G. We will continue to price in order to gain share in this environment as we did in fiscal 2010. You will also see a major product transition in our portfolio as we sample our first 28-nanometer parts and increase the focus on cost-optimized smartphone solutions.
In closing, we believe the QCT team executed well in fiscal 2010 and continued to drive our technology and integration leadership position in the industry. We believe we are in a strong competitive position to continue to grow share and to lead the transition to smartphones and the growth of mobility in the market.  That concludes my remarks. And I now turn the call over to Bill Keitel.

We have good results to report to you today. Our fiscal fourth quarter revenues were $2.95 billion, up 10% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.68, up 42% year-over-year, both exceeding our",1201,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We have good results to report to you today. Our fiscal fourth quarter revenues were $2.95 billion, up 10% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.68, up 42% year-over-year, both exceeding our prior guidance.
QCT had record MSM shipments and favorable product mix including HSUPA and EV-DO integrated chipsets. QCT's operating margin increased to 28%, reflecting strong volume and increased mix of higher-tiered chipsets.
QTL revenues were $921 million, and total report device sales by our licensees were approximately $28 billion for activity in the June quarter, towards the high end of our prior guidance and up 12% sequentially, reflecting strength in Europe and North America.
We estimate that approximately 153 to 157 million subscriber units were shipped by our licensees in the June quarter at an average selling price of approximately $179 to $185.
As Paul mentioned, we are excited to see the introduction and growing sales of the increasing number of new 3G-enabled products including tablets. It will drive incremental growth for QTL and QCT. As we have explained in the past, our Licensee business for sometime has had a voluntary royalty capping program for certain kinds of the devices, including 3G-enabled laptop computers. 
In order to help drive the broadest possible adoption of 3G connectivity in these new incremental product categories, we have decided for now to extend our voluntary royalty capping program to cover some additional types of connected devices such as tablets that meet certain requirements. Depending on selling prices of these devices, the royalty caps may results in a royalty payable on something less than the full ceiling price of the device. 
QTL's implied royalty rate decreased slightly quarter-over-quarter, and it's one of the key drivers in the growth of these new connected device sales, notably tablets.
Operating cash flow was $1.1 billion, and our cash and marketable securities balance was $18.4 billion at the end of the quarter, with $6.3 billion onshore and $12.1 billion offshore. Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 19% in the fiscal fourth quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter were up $0.11 over the third quarter. QCT contributed $0.07 on higher MSM shipments and a favorable product mix, while QTL was better by $0.04, driven by higher shipments of CDMA-based devices. The improvements in investment income and our tax rate offset the sequential growth in operating expenses, including two non-recurring operating expense items. 
Turning to our results for fiscal 2010, revenues were approximately $11 billion, up 6% year-over-year and in line with the midpoint of our original guidance at the outset of the fiscal year. GAAP earnings for fiscal 2010 were $1.96 per share. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 37% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings were $2.46 per share, up 88% year-over-year. Our business continued to generate strong cash flow. Operating cash flow for fiscal 2010 was more than $4 billion and approximately 37% of revenue.
QCT's fiscal 2010 operating margin was 25% above our original guidance at the outset of the fiscal year, driven by strong volumes and favorable product mix in the second half of the year, including healthy demand for our integrated smartphone chipsets. 
QTL's operating margins was 83% for fiscal 2010, and we estimate that the fiscal 2010 device ASP, as reported by our licensees, was approximately $183 to $189. Our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rates were approximately 20% of fiscal 2010. We are updating our estimate for calendar 2010 CDMA device shipments. We now expect approximately 625 million to 650 million devices to be shipped. Based on the 638 million midpoint of our estimates, we expect worldwide CDMA device shipments to grow approximately 26% year-over-year. Our prior estimate had been 23% midpoint growth.
Turning to next year. We estimate calendar 2011 CDMA device shipments will increase approximately 16% to 24% over our 2010 midpoint estimate, with unit shipments of approximately 740 million to 790 million units. Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate fiscal 2011 non-GAAP revenues to be in the range of approximately $12.4 billion to $13 billion, a double-digit increase of 13% to 18% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.3 billion in fiscal 2011, an increase of 11% to 23% year-over-year. We expect fiscal 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.77, an increase of 7% to 13% year-over-year.
We are encouraged by the progress we are making in resolving the two licensing disputes. While the outcomes remain uncertain and the disputes may not be resolved in 2011, we have included some benefit in the high-end of our 2011 guidance relating to resolution of the disputes. Our total amount expected by the licensees is significantly greater than what's in our guidance when prior years and total fiscal 2011 disputed royalties are included. We are trying to be prudent pending resolution of the matters. Once the disputes are resolved, we will adjust our guidance and provide you with an appropriate explanation so that you can understand the impact.
In the QCT segment, we expect a modest decline in revenue per MSM in fiscal 2011, more consistent with historical norms prior to fiscal 2010. We anticipate that non-GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses will grow approximately 7% year-over-year and driven primarily by growth in R&D expense. 
We have begun a restructuring plan to exit the current FLO TV Service business and expect to incur restructuring charges in fiscal 2011 to reduce ongoing expenses. This in turn better positions us for the strategic alternatives we are considering.
We expect our non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal 2011 to be approximately 21% and our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 19%.
Turning to the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we estimate non-GAAP revenues to be approximately $3 billion to $3.4 billion, an increase of 14% to 26% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $0.70 to $0.74, an increase of 13% to 19% year-over-year. This estimate includes shipments of approximately 115 to 119 million chipsets during the December quarter due to continued strong demand for smartphones in developed markets.
We expect total reported device sales of approximately $31.5 billion to $33.5 billion by our licensees for shipments in the September quarter, and we expect a favorable foreign exchange benefit of several dollars, mostly due to the euro.
We believe that the channel inventory level is going through a seasonal build for the holiday season, although early indications are that the build may be a bit larger than what we've seen in recent years. We expect non-GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses to be approximately flat sequentially. The Qualcomm Investor Relations website includes an extensive slide presentation on the many data points included on this conference call, and we look forward to seeing you in New York for our Analyst Day meeting on November 17, where we will share additional data points regarding our fiscal 2011 guidance, including regional device shipment estimates, average selling prices and channel inventory. The Analyst Day event will be webcast for those of you unable to attend. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back over to Warren.

As Steve mentioned, we are looking at a channel inventory build here in the December quarter. Typically, that begins to run off into the March and June quarters, number one. And number two, Steve talked about some product transitions that we foresee here in the second half of the year. So we are expecting operating margins to decline a bit in the QCT business.

In the second half of the year, what we anticipate happening is that this shift will be probably a little bit more to the developing market, which would kind of pull that down a little bit in terms of the type of device that we ship. It's more of a statement I think about how I think strong it is at the moment versus kind of what's happening in the second half. Although in the second half, as Bill said, it kind of goes back and fourth between developed markets versus emerging markets. We saw that happen this year as well. In terms of dual core, dual core, we have today over 10 different companies designing tablets on our dual core solutions. So we feel very good about where they're going. And then also in the handset space, you'll see that as well. That mix will start to happen through the year. The tablets space at this point, it's difficult to say how big that space is going to be. I've seen a lot of different estimates on that, and it will be interesting to see what happens. As we've probably talked before, we see that developed world being one type of market. In the developing world, I think you'll tend to see a number of different types of devices go in there, mainly because there is no laptop market for them to have to displace, and we've already seen that with some of our product today. You've seen products going into India based off of smartphone chips. So there'll be a little bit of a mix there. In all cases, I think we're still trying to figure out how big that market is and how it will develop throughout the year.

But our current plan assumes that shift tends to be more toward the mass market smartphone, which is a different type of product than I think we're selling right now in a lot of the developed market. It's I think a good trend for the business because that also tends to pull 2G subscribers over to 3G. And I mentioned how in the China market, for example, we're getting a lot of design traction on what I would consider to be mass-market smartphones.

On the channel inventory question, as you know, we are aware typically see a little more channel inventory building in this December quarter for the holiday season. And then you look back in past years, the work-off of that extra inventory is typically in the March quarter, but sometimes, it extends into the June quarter. We're trying to monitor this very closely this year. We are, as we said, a little suspect that there's a bit more inventory build than what we've seen in prior years, and it's just around new devices, new OEMs and a lot of excitement around the whole smartphone market. So we're going to continue to monitor this here over the next couple of weeks, and when we're in New York, we'll share with you our best view of it, as of that point in time as to just how much of an increase is it, and do we think it's a March unwind or a March and June quarter unwind.

Bill, I think you said that the implied royalty rate decreased quarter-on-quarter partly because of the capping program in tablets. And I would imagine that the capping program impacts ASPs but not the royalty rate, if you can just clarify that. And then the second question on QTL was it looks like ASP has actually declined a little bit sequentially and I understand that they're one quarter in arrears, but Q2 is really strong quarter for smartphone. So I'm just curious why ASPs were down. And then just lastly, in QTL, the 82% level for operating margins, is that now a normalized level for that business? Or are there still any excess legal costs or any thing that's unusual there that's depressing that margin?

As Bill mentioned, the devices that are coming through a total reported device sales are coming throughout at a full ASP. And to the extent that as a royalty cap in place, that means the royalty will actually get paid on something less than that complete selling price, so that does have a downward effect on the implied rate that you would calculate based on the information that we provide. And as typical, some of the revenue outside of the subscriber base tend to be a bit lumpy. Audit recovers were a bit down this quarter as well. That was contributed to the quarter-over-quarter change.

It was a modest decline from the prior quarter, and as we had mentioned last time, that was primarily the euro. There was a few dollars of euro FX impact that reduced the average selling price. But on that same point, as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing the opposite impact here in this coming December quarter. We're looking for several dollars of positive impact, again primarily due to the euro. On the operating margin side for our Licensing business. Last quarter, we reported approximately 80%. This quarter, we reported 83%. So we did indicate that last quarter was an abnormal quarter. And then in terms of the full year, obviously, we're looking for good earnings growth and part of that is we are looking to grow revenues and operating income at a faster rate than our operating expenses. So we are looking to leverage that pace of operating expense that we already have in place. So on balance, operating margins, I think, are on a positive trend here.

As we've talked about before, a number of -- I think there are two things that differentiate us on the 4G side. One is our multimode capability, that ability to seamlessly handle or provide simultaneous services across the 3G and the 4G networks. And then also I think just our ability to execute what we saw through the quarter was a build in terms of demand for LTE chipsets, and I think that's probably a good data point for how we're able to deliver. In terms of connectivity, GPS is a big component of our solution today. It has been for a long time. It's something that has a very high attach rate with our solution across the feature phones as well as smartphones. We're now shipping Bluetooth in the tens of millions a year-type of quantity, and that has started to move into being an integrated solution in our smartphone roadmap. That will be followed by our Wireless LAN solution, and then we will integrate that as well. So if you look at our product portfolio, we started sampling stand-alone Bluetooth devices several years ago, and now we've migrated that into the MSM. We're a little bit delayed relative to the Bluetooth schedule, but same strategy is playing out on wireless LAN. So it's a standalone product today will be integrated here in the future and you'll hear more announcements about that in the future.

On the licensing dispute, I'll just recount I think what I think are the key points we made here. If you recall, we had said it was approximately $200 million as of the end of fiscal '10. That was due to loss and of course some licensee is paying. But we haven't recognized it. So revenues and earnings that we haven't recognized. And that number for fiscal '11 is substantially greater. And so the decision was rather than put forth it was a pretty large number. We thought it was better to just put in a very prudent estimate into our guidance of what we think will be ultimately recognizable in fiscal '11, and we did not include in that any prior year. So it would only be a prudent estimate of what is earned and what we think we will report to recognize in fiscal '11. From a timing standpoint, we'll put that in the second half of the year, but that's what we've got right now. On the mirasol side, the 2010 operating loss was approximately $180 million. We do have on a percentage basis I would say it's a fairly substantial increase year-over-year. Operating loss I think, as you know, we're pretty optimistic about the potential here we've got, and we'll get into some more specifics on that on what's in the guidance and where we stand on that business in a couple of weeks when we see in New York.

You've got operating profit of about the same amount 17%, with OpEx up only 7% or 8%, so I can see where the margin compression is coming from here. But you got EPS up only about 10%. So it sounds like there's quite a bit of cost or some other kind of compression below the line thus affecting the difference between the operating profit increase and the EPS increase. Can you give me some feeling for what that actually is?

The Snapdragon sales really highlight our strength in smartphones. Smartphones and also these new device types are driving a lot of opportunities for the Licensing business. And so I was very excited by what we see as a potential going forward. The reason is because the wireless industry really continues to innovate in an extremely rapid pace, and it's doing that because it's responding to consumer traction and excitement, and the amount of focus on this space I think is almost higher than it's ever been. And so I feel like Qualcomm is extremely well positioned there. We are going to continue to drive that dynamic as hard as we can with new products and new technologies in 2011 and beyond. So we thank you very much for your support and thanks for being on the call today, and we look forward to seeing you in New York.

Let me begin by saying how pleased I am with our performance this year as we delivered record earnings per share and record MSM chipset volumes. Looking forward, our outlook reflects strong revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2011. In the coming year, we expect continued healthy growth in CDMA-based device shipments including smartphones and other data-centric devices driven by the global adoption of 3G and accelerating consumer demand for wireless data.
And a number of highlights this year. First, QCT continued to execute. Our Snapdragon platforms set the competitive benchmark for smartphone silicon, and we've taken a leadership position in offering our chipsets for key operating systems such as Android and Windows Phone 7. We offer the industry's broadest 3G product roadmap, and we continued to grow share in WCDMA chipsets.
Our Licensing business continues to be well positioned in 3G and multimode 3G LTE and now has over 185 licensees. Of note, we added another 14 new Chinese licensees in fiscal 2010, bringing the total number of Chinese licensees to 65. Our licensing program continues to foster innovation and supports the 3G ecosystem that benefits wireless consumers worldwide.
In terms of our Display business, we believe mirasol is a disruptive technology for the mobile display industry. The combined benefits of extremely low power consumption with sunlight viewability and support for color, video and touch sets it apart from the competition. We've made strong progress in the development of this display technology as we brought our first fab online and are targeting limited volume commercial 5.7-inch display devices in the first half of 2011. We're very excited about the prospects for this technology, and we'll be providing more details at our upcoming Analyst Day.
In FLO TV, we have decided to change directions, stepping back from the direct to consumer business and commencing a restructuring plan, under which we expect to exit the current FLO TV Service business. We're in discussions with a variety of interested parties and are continuing to evaluate other options for this business. Possibilities range from a new wholesale model, sale or joint venture with a third-party and/or sale of the spectrum licenses and discontinuance of the operation of the network.
Overall, we had strong earnings and cash flow performance in fiscal 2010. We returned more than $4 billion to shareholders in the form of a $3 billion buyback and over $1 billion in cash dividend. We ended the year well positioned with a strong balance sheet, including $18.4 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to calendar 2011, we expect CDMA and multimode 3G 4G-based device shipments to grow to approximately 765 million units, up 20% year-over-year based on the midpoint of our projections. This growth will be driven by the global adoption of 3G, the continued demand for wireless data, strength in consumer demand for smartphones, growth in new connected device categories as well as 3G momentum in emerging regions.
Operators around the world continue to benefit from the growth in wireless data. Japan is approaching a tipping point where data ARPU will exceed that of voice. In the United States, AT&T recently reported a 30% year-over-year growth in data revenues, and Verizon Wireless stated that data comprised over 35% of its revenues this quarter.
We expect this trend in data growth to continue as operators increasingly experiment with variable pricing plans that provide more choice and lower total cost of ownership alternatives to consumers. To meet the network needs, resulting from this rapid growth in wireless data use, operators continue to make investments in the latest air interface technologies. TDDI recently announced its fourth quarter device lineup, and seven of the new devices included support for multi-carrier EV-DO also known as EV-DO Rev. B.
According to the GSA, to date, there are a total of 81 operators who have launched HSPA+ Networks, of which nine support dual carrier HSPA+ with data rates of 42 megabits per second. The rate of HSPA+ Network launches is faster today than when HSUPA was first introduced. We're also seeing strong momentum behind LTE led by Verizon's expected launch this quarter. Our multimode capabilities are essential for device on these networks, and we're very well positioned to capitalize on these dynamics by leveraging our time-to-market advantages and industry-leading modem solutions.
Smartphones remain the strongest area of growth within the Wireless segment, driven by continued innovation and competition. According to analysts [ph] (0:10:15), a global smartphone shipment exceeded 80 million units this quarter, representing a 30% increase quarter-over-quarter and a 95% increase from the year prior.
Looking forward, according to Gartner, smartphones as a percentage of the total handset market is expected to grow from approximately 16% in 2009 to greater than 45% in 2014. These numbers would be even greater if they had included Brew Mobile Platform based phones in their numbers.
And our emergence of new connected device category is also a favorable trend for our business. As volumes in new categories like 3G connected e-readers and tablets continue to grow, they represent incremental growth opportunities for our businesses, driving adoption of multiple 3G devices for consumer.
The growth of 3G in emerging regions is another catalyst for our business. China represents a significant opportunity with a low CDMA penetration rate of 13%. With 3G networks now maturing, operators have turned to increasing the number of devices available on their networks. For example, China Telecom reported more than 100 EV-DO handset models in supply by the first half of 2010. In China, Unicom had over 90 3G models available as of June.
In India, 3G licenses have been issued, and the majority of newly licensed operators plan to launch 3G services before the end of calendar year 2010. Tata DOCOMO became the first private Indian operator to launch 3G. 3G services will be available across all nine of their circles this week.
On the legal front, as we noted in our 10-K, in September, the company was notified by the SEC of a formal investigation that arose from a whistleblower's allegations made in December 2009 to the audit committee of the company’s Board of Directors and to the SEC. The audit committee has conducted a review into the allegations and related accounting practice with the assistance of independent counsel and independent forensic accountants. This recently concluded review did not identify any errors in the company's financial statements. The company continues to cooperate with the SEC's ongoing investigation and looks forward to resolving this matter.
And separately, I'm pleased to report that the arbitrator in the Panasonic arbitration issued an interim order in the first day of the process denying Panasonic's claims that we breached our license agreement with them. We're pleased with this initial finding as it supports our belief that Panasonic's claims are without merit.
So to wrap up, we've completed another record year at Qualcomm, and I'd like to thank all of our employees and partners for their tremendous efforts. With our broad licensing program and industry-leading chipset roadmap, we're extremely well positioned to take advantage of key 3G growth opportunities in both developed and emerging regions around the world. 
In looking forward, I am pleased with our outlook for improved revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2011 and strong growth in CDMA-based device shipments, driven by the global migration to 3G and the increasing consumer appetite for data-centric devices, particularly smartphones. 
That concludes my comments, and I'll now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf."

Our QCT business delivered strong results this year in a dynamic environment, reflecting growing demand across our product portfolio. We had another record quarter, shipping 111 billion MSMs, which was a great follow-on to our record results in the June quarter.
We also had a record year shipping just under 400 million MSMs. We are extremely pleased to deliver stronger-than-expected revenues and operating profit for the quarter and for the fiscal year with operating margins exceeding the top end of our guidance. As we anticipated in July, demand for smartphones continued to grow in the September quarter. This is clearly a favorable trend for our business. Shipments of integrated 7,000 and 8,000-series chipsets increased more than 30% quarter-over-quarter and nearly 100% year-over-year. We also saw continued strong demand for our QSC and data-centric products. Our broad, industry-leading chipset roadmap helped us grow share in both WCDMA handsets and in mobile application processors this year.
As forecasted a year ago, we experienced a greater-than-normal decline in our average revenue per MSM during fiscal year 2010. In the first half, this was driven by competitive pricing pressure and an increase in sales of chips for entry level and lower-tier feature phones. In the second half, we saw even stronger-than-anticipated demand for our higher-tier integrated chipsets, evidenced by the fact that we shipped 4x the number of Snapdragon chipsets in the second half of fiscal 2010 than we did in the first half.
This favorable mix trend is likely to continue into fiscal Q1, resulting in a sequential increase in average revenue per MSM. Growth in demand for smartphone chipsets continues to be an important driver for our business, and we expect to see an increase in the variety and tiering of smartphones in the future. We continue to see upside in the high-end of the market as well as the new wave of opportunity coming in the form of lower cost, high volume 3G phones in both developed and developing geographies. The cost advantages of our integrated approach and platform compatibility among our products positions us to grow as these trends play out in the market place.
We have a significant and growing number of design wins based on our integrated solutions, encompassing multiple-priced tiers and form factors. On the high end, devices based on the newest members of our Snapdragon family, the 8X55 and 7X30 chipsets are expected to be available this holiday season and devices based on our dual core products are expected to be available in the first half of calendar 2011.
New, lower-cost smartphones based on our integrated 7X27 and 7X25 chipsets are also growing, including offerings from LG, Motorola, Sony Ericsson and Huawei. In China alone, we have seen a nearly 30% growth in our customer base, with over 40 new designs in this tier. The majority of these are based on the Android operating system.
Our investments to support multiple operating systems positions us as well to gain share from smartphone growth. We now have seven different integrated chipsets that support the Android operating system. We are also Microsoft's lead chipset partner for the Windows Phone 7 launch. Our Snapdragon chipset powers all nine of the new Windows Phone 7 handsets, which are expected to be in stores in Europe, the U.S. and Southeast Asia this holiday season.
On the modem side, our innovation, products quality and ability to execute continue to set us apart. In emerging markets like India and China, our single chip QSC product family positions us to benefit from the 2G to 3G transition. A number of customers including Lenovo, Yulong and Long Cheer have already launched devices based on our 6240 and 6270 chipsets, and we have more than 25 designs in progress at multiple customers in China.
In mature markets, the 3G to 4G transition has started, driven by the increasing demand of smartphones and tablets. Our MDM9600 chipset is the first and only multimode LTE solution designed to help our customers seamlessly bridge this complex technology transition. We have sampled this product and expect to see the first commercial products based off of it this quarter.
We are very pleased that we finished the 2010 fiscal year at such a strong note and above targets, driven by an increase in demand for smartphone chipsets. We expect this trend to continue into the first quarter along with initial demand for LTE chipsets. In the second half, we expect a change in mix as the demand shifts to more mass-market smartphone products and emerging market chipsets driven by the transition from 2G to 3G. We will continue to price in order to gain share in this environment as we did in fiscal 2010. You will also see a major product transition in our portfolio as we sample our first 28-nanometer parts and increase the focus on cost-optimized smartphone solutions.
In closing, we believe the QCT team executed well in fiscal 2010 and continued to drive our technology and integration leadership position in the industry. We believe we are in a strong competitive position to continue to grow share and to lead the transition to smartphones and the growth of mobility in the market.  That concludes my remarks. And I now turn the call over to Bill Keitel."

We have good results to report to you today. Our fiscal fourth quarter revenues were $2.95 billion, up 10% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.68, up 42% year-over-year, both exceeding our prior guidance.
QCT had record MSM shipments and favorable product mix including HSUPA and EV-DO integrated chipsets. QCT's operating margin increased to 28%, reflecting strong volume and increased mix of higher-tiered chipsets.
QTL revenues were $921 million, and total reported device sales by our licensees were approximately $28 billion for activity in the June quarter, towards the high end of our prior guidance and up 12% sequentially, reflecting strength in Europe and North America.
We estimate that approximately 153 to 157 million subscriber units were shipped by our licensees in the June quarter at an average selling price of approximately $179 to $185.
As Paul mentioned, we are excited to see the introduction and growing sales of an increasing number of new 3G-enabled products including tablets that will drive incremental growth for QTL and QCT. As we have explained in the past, our Licensee business for sometime has had a voluntary royalty capping program for certain kinds of the devices, including 3G-enabled laptop computers. 
In order to help drive the broadest possible adoption of 3G connectivity in these new incremental product categories, we have decided for now to extend our voluntary royalty capping program to cover some additional types of connected devices such as tablets that meet certain requirements. Depending on the selling prices of these devices, the royalty caps may results in a royalty payable on something less than the full selling price of the device. 
QTL's implied royalty rate decreased slightly quarter-over-quarter, with one of the key drivers being the growth of these new connected device sales, notably tablets.
Operating cash flow was $1.1 billion, and our cash and marketable securities balance was $18.4 billion at the end of the quarter, with $6.3 billion onshore and $12.1 billion offshore. Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 19% in the fiscal fourth quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter were up $0.11 over the third quarter. QCT contributed $0.07 on higher MSM shipments and favorable product mix, while QTL was better by $0.04, driven by higher shipments of CDMA-based devices. The improvements in investment income and our tax rate offset the sequential growth in operating expenses, including two non-recurring operating expense items. 
Turning to our results for fiscal 2010, revenues were approximately $11 billion, up 6% year-over-year and in line with the midpoint of our original guidance at the outset of the fiscal year. GAAP earnings for fiscal 2010 were $1.96 per share. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 37% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings were $2.46 per share, up 88% year-over-year. Our business continued to generate strong cash flow. Operating cash flow for fiscal 2010 was more than $4 billion and approximately 37% of revenue.
QCT's fiscal 2010 operating margin was 25%, above our original guidance at the outset of the fiscal year, driven by strong volumes and favorable product mix in the second half of the year, including healthy demand for our integrated smartphone chipsets. 
QTL's operating margins was 83% for fiscal 2010, and we estimate that the fiscal 2010 device ASP, as it reported by our licensees, was approximately $183 to $189. Our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rates were approximately 20% in fiscal 2010. We are updating our estimate for calendar 2010 CDMA device shipments. We now expect approximately 625 million to 650 million devices to be shipped. Based on the 638 million midpoint of our estimates, we expect worldwide CDMA device shipments to grow approximately 26% year-over-year. Our prior estimate had been 23% midpoint growth.
Turning to next year. We estimate calendar 2011 CDMA device shipments will increase approximately 16% to 24% over our 2010 midpoint estimate, with unit shipments of approximately 740 million to 790 million units. Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate fiscal 2011 non-GAAP revenues to be in the range of approximately $12.4 billion to $13 billion, a double-digit increase of 13% to 18% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.3 billion in fiscal 2011, an increase of 11% to 23% year-over-year. We expect fiscal 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.77, an increase of 7% to 13% year-over-year.
We are encouraged by the progress we are making in resolving the two licensing disputes. While the outcomes remain uncertain and the disputes may not be resolved in 2011, we have included some benefit in the high-end of our 2011 guidance relating to resolution of the disputes. Our total amount expected to be owed by the licensees is significantly greater than what's in our guidance when prior years and total fiscal 2011 disputed royalties are included. We are trying to be prudent pending resolution of the matters. Once the disputes are resolved, we will adjust our guidance and provide you with an appropriate explanation so that you can understand the impact.
In the QCT segment, we expect a modest decline in revenue per MSM in fiscal 2011, more consistent with historical norms prior to fiscal 2010. We anticipate that non-GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses will grow approximately 7% year-over-year and driven primarily by growth in R&D expense. 
We have begun a restructuring plan to exit the current FLO TV Service business and expect to incur restructuring charges in fiscal 2011 to reduce ongoing expenses. This in turn better positions us for the strategic alternatives we are considering.
We expect our non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal 2011 to be approximately 21% and our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 19%.
Turning to the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we estimate non-GAAP revenues to be approximately $3 billion to $3.4 billion, an increase of 14% to 26% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $0.70 to $0.74, an increase of 13% to 19% year-over-year. This estimate includes shipments of approximately 115 to 119 million MSM chipsets during the December quarter due to continued strong demand for smartphones in developed markets.
We expect total reported device sales of approximately $31.5 billion to $33.5 billion by our licensees for shipments in the September quarter, and we expect a favorable foreign exchange benefit of several dollars, mostly due to the euro.
We believe that the channel inventory level is going through a seasonal build for the holiday season, although early indications are that the build may be a bit larger than what we've seen in recent years. We expect non-GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses to be approximately flat sequentially. The Qualcomm Investor Relations website includes an extensive slide presentation on the many data points included on this conference call, and we look forward to seeing you in New York for our Analyst Day meeting on November 17, where we will share additional data points regarding our fiscal 2011 guidance, including regional device shipment estimates, average selling prices and channel inventory. The Analyst Day event will be webcast for those of you unable to attend. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back over to Warren."

We had said at the outset of this year that we expected about $190 million operating loss in that business, and we did do a little bit better than that, $10 million or $15 million or so better this year. The operating loss within this guidance is, we're projecting a higher loss for fiscal 2011, and we'll give some specifics on that in a couple of weeks. On the average ASP within QCT, yes, as the year unfolds right now, we think we're in an ebb -- developed market versus developing one kind of ebbs and the other one flows a bit as you progress. Right now, we think we are very much in an ebb on the developed market. Latter part of this year, we are expecting emerging market to do a bit better.

On your smartphone mix question, I think what you're saying is in the first quarter, certainly in the quarter that we gave guidance on, we continued to see very strong shipments of smartphones and probably, as I mentioned in my script, a little bit more than we even thought a couple of quarters ago. In the second half of the year, what we anticipate happening is that this shift will be probably a little bit more to the developing market, which would kind of pull that down a little bit in terms of the type of device that we ship. It's more a statement I think about how I think strong it is at the moment versus kind of what's happening in the second half. Although in the second half, as Bill said, it kind of goes back and forth between developed markets versus emerging markets. We saw that happen this year as well. In terms of dual core, dual core, we have today over 10 different companies designing tablets on our dual core solutions. So we feel very good about where they're going. And then also in the handset space, you'll see that as well. That mix will start to happen through the year. The tablet space at this point, it's difficult to say how big that space is going to be. I've seen a lot of different estimates on that, and it will be interesting to see what happens. As we've probably talked before, we see that in developed world being one type of market. In the developing world, I think you'll tend to see a number of different types of devices go in there, mainly because there is no laptop market for them to have to displace, and we've already seen that with some of our product today. You've seen products going into India based off of smartphone chips. So it'll be a little bit of a mix there. In all cases, I think we're still trying to figure out how big that market is and how it will develop throughout the year."

We're looking for several dollars of positive impact, again primarily due to the euro. On the operating margin side for the Licensing business, last quarter, we reported approximately 80%. This quarter, we reported 83%. So we did indicate that last quarter was an abnormal quarter.

One is our multimode capability, so the ability to seamlessly handover or provide simultaneous services across the 3G and the 4G networks. And then also I think just our ability to execute. What we saw through the quarter was a build in terms of demand for LTE chipsets, and I think that's probably a good data point for how we're able to deliver. In terms of connectivity, GPS is a big component of our solution today. It has been for a long time. It's something that has a very high attach rate with our solution cross feature phones as well as smartphones. We're now shipping Bluetooth in the tens of millions a year-type of quantity, and that has started to move into being an integrated solution in our smartphone roadmap. That will be followed by our Wireless LAN solution, and then we will integrate that as well. So if you look at our product portfolio, we started sampling standalone Bluetooth devices several years ago, and now we've migrated that into the MSM. We're a little bit delayed relative to the Bluetooth schedule, but same strategy is playing out on wireless LAN.

On the constitution from tablets, what we said was that it’s not on our presentation as it stands right now that we are working on for New York, but we are considering and we're having a good discussion on whether we would include a breakout estimate of connected devices. So it's under consideration, but we haven't decided that yet. It's a new developing market, a little harder to forecast because of that reason, but we are considering that. On the licensing dispute, I'll just recount I think what I think are the key points we made here. If you recall, we had said it was approximately $200 million as of the end of fiscal '10 that was due to us and of course some, one licensee has paid. But we haven't recognized it. So revenues and earnings that we haven't recognized. And that number for fiscal '11 is substantially greater. And so the decision was rather than put forth it was a pretty large number. We thought it was better to just put in a very prudent estimate into our guidance of what we think will be ultimately recognizable in fiscal '11, and we did not include in that any prior year. So it would only be a prudent estimate of what is earned in and what we think we will report and recognize in fiscal '11. From a timing standpoint, we put that in the second half of the year, but that's what we've got right now. On the mirasol side, the 2010 operating loss was approximately $180 million. We do have on a percentage basis I would say it's a fairly substantial increase year-over-year operating loss I think, as you know, we're pretty optimistic about the potential there we've got, and we'll get into some more specifics on that on what's in the guidance and where we stand on that business in a couple of weeks when we see you in New York."

And then another one, it's just I know it's been asked several times, but I want to clarify again, on the royalty caps, can you just confirm that you're using an absolute U.S. dollar amount for the cap? And then can you also talk about how you're basing that cap? In other words, should we assume that the absolute U.S. dollar royalty payment on these devices is kind of being based off of what you're already receiving as an average on existing smartphone royalties? Or is it something completely different?"

The discussions have really focused around what the use of that money would be, whether it’d be used for things like building factories in the United States or other forms of CapEx, creating more R&D jobs so funding innovation or dividends. I've been a pretty strong proponent that dividends would be a good use of that money, because of it’d create velocity of money in the economy. I would not say that I've gotten great traction with that at this point, but we're continuing to do that. We're doing an economic study about repatriation and when that is completed, we'll be going around Washington, hopefully, demonstrating to people the value of repatriation.

Let me begin by saying how pleased I am with our performance this year as we delivered record earnings per share and record MSM chipset volumes. Looking forward, our outlook reflects strong revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2011. In the coming year, we expect continued healthy growth in CDMA-based device shipments including smartphones and other data-centric devices driven by the global adoption of 3G and accelerating consumer demand for wireless data.
And a number of highlights this year. First, QCT continued to execute. Our Snapdragon platforms set the competitive benchmark for smartphone silicon, and we've taken a leadership position in offering our chipsets for key operating systems such as Android and Windows Phone 7. We offer the industry's broadest 3G product roadmap, and we continued to grow share in WCDMA chipsets.
Our Licensing business continues to be well positioned in 3G and multimode 3G LTE and now has over 185 licensees. Of note, we added another 14 new Chinese licensees in fiscal 2010, bringing the total number of Chinese licensees to 65. Our licensing program continues to foster innovation and supports the 3G ecosystem that benefits wireless consumers worldwide.
In terms of our Display business, we believe mirasol is a disruptive technology for the mobile display industry. The combined benefits of extremely low power consumption with sunlight viewability and support for color, video and touch sets it apart from the competition. We've made strong progress in the development of this display technology as we brought our first fab online and are targeting limited volume commercial 5.7-inch display devices in the first half of 2011. We're very excited about the prospects for this technology, and we'll be providing more details at our upcoming Analyst Day.
In FLO TV, we have decided to change directions, stepping back from the direct to consumer business and commencing a restructuring plan, under which we expect to exit the current FLO TV Service business. We're in discussions with a variety of interested parties and are continuing to evaluate other options for this business. Possibilities range from a new wholesale model, sale or joint venture with a third-party and/or sale of the spectrum licenses and discontinuance of the operation of the network.
Overall, we had strong earnings and cash flow performance in fiscal 2010. We returned more than $4 billion to shareholders in the form of a $3 billion buyback and over $1 billion in cash dividend. We ended the year well positioned with a strong balance sheet, including $18.4 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to calendar 2011, we expect CDMA and multimode 3G 4G-based device shipments to grow to approximately 765 million units, up 20% year-over-year based on the midpoint of our projections. This growth will be driven by the global adoption of 3G, the continued demand for wireless data, strength in consumer demand for smartphones, growth in new connected device categories as well as 3G momentum in emerging regions.
Operators around the world continue to benefit from the growth in wireless data. Japan is approaching a tipping point where data ARPU will exceed that of voice. In the United States, AT&T recently reported a 30% year-over-year growth in data revenues, and Verizon Wireless stated that data comprised over 35% of its revenues this quarter.
We expect this trend in data growth to continue as operators increasingly experiment with variable pricing plans that provide more choice and lower total cost of ownership alternatives to consumers. To meet the network needs, resulting from this rapid growth in wireless data use, operators continue to make investments in the latest air interface technologies. TDDI recently announced its fourth quarter device lineup, and seven of the new devices included support for multi-carrier EV-DO also known as EV-DO Rev. B.
According to the GSA, to date, there are a total of 81 operators who have launched HSPA+ Networks, of which nine support dual carrier HSPA+ with data rates of 42 megabits per second. The rate of HSPA+ Network launches is faster today than when HSUPA was first introduced. We're also seeing strong momentum behind LTE led by Verizon's expected launch this quarter. Our multimode capabilities are essential for device on these networks, and we're very well positioned to capitalize on these dynamics by leveraging our time-to-market advantages and industry-leading modem solutions.
Smartphones remain the strongest area of growth within the Wireless segment, driven by continued innovation and competition. According to analysts [ph] (0:10:15), a global smartphone shipment exceeded 80 million units this quarter, representing a 30% increase quarter-over-quarter and a 95% increase from the year prior.
Looking forward, according to Gartner, smartphones as a percentage of the total handset market is expected to grow from approximately 16% in 2009 to greater than 45% in 2014. These numbers would be even greater if they had included Brew Mobile Platform based phones in their numbers.
And our emergence of new connected device category is also a favorable trend for our business. As volumes in new categories like 3G connected e-readers and tablets continue to grow, they represent incremental growth opportunities for our businesses, driving adoption of multiple 3G devices for consumer.
The growth of 3G in emerging regions is another catalyst for our business. China represents a significant opportunity with a low CDMA penetration rate of 13%. With 3G networks now maturing, operators have turned to increasing the number of devices available on their networks. For example, China Telecom reported more than 100 EV-DO handset models in supply by the first half of 2010. In China, Unicom had over 90 3G models available as of June.
In India, 3G licenses have been issued, and the majority of newly licensed operators plan to launch 3G services before the end of calendar year 2010. Tata DOCOMO became the first private Indian operator to launch 3G. 3G services will be available across all nine of their circles this week.
On the legal front, as we noted in our 10-K, in September, the company was notified by the SEC of a formal investigation that arose from a whistleblower's allegations made in December 2009 to the audit committee of the company’s Board of Directors and to the SEC. The audit committee has conducted a review into the allegations and related accounting practice with the assistance of independent counsel and independent forensic accountants. This recently concluded review did not identify any errors in the company's financial statements. The company continues to cooperate with the SEC's ongoing investigation and looks forward to resolving this matter.
And separately, I'm pleased to report that the arbitrator in the Panasonic arbitration issued an interim order in the first day of the process denying Panasonic's claims that we breached our license agreement with them. We're pleased with this initial finding as it supports our belief that Panasonic's claims are without merit.
So to wrap up, we've completed another record year at Qualcomm, and I'd like to thank all of our employees and partners for their tremendous efforts. With our broad licensing program and industry-leading chipset roadmap, we're extremely well positioned to take advantage of key 3G growth opportunities in both developed and emerging regions around the world. 
In looking forward, I am pleased with our outlook for improved revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2011 and strong growth in CDMA-based device shipments, driven by the global migration to 3G and the increasing consumer appetite for data-centric devices, particularly smartphones. 
That concludes my comments, and I'll now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf."

Our QCT business delivered strong results this year in a dynamic environment, reflecting growing demand across our product portfolio. We had another record quarter, shipping 111 billion MSMs, which was a great follow-on to our record results in the June quarter.
We also had a record year shipping just under 400 million MSMs. We are extremely pleased to deliver stronger-than-expected revenues and operating profit for the quarter and for the fiscal year with operating margins exceeding the top end of our guidance. As we anticipated in July, demand for smartphones continued to grow in the September quarter. This is clearly a favorable trend for our business. Shipments of integrated 7,000 and 8,000-series chipsets increased more than 30% quarter-over-quarter and nearly 100% year-over-year. We also saw continued strong demand for our QSC and data-centric products. Our broad, industry-leading chipset roadmap helped us grow share in both WCDMA handsets and in mobile application processors this year.
As forecasted a year ago, we experienced a greater-than-normal decline in our average revenue per MSM during fiscal year 2010. In the first half, this was driven by competitive pricing pressure and an increase in sales of chips for entry level and lower-tier feature phones. In the second half, we saw even stronger-than-anticipated demand for our higher-tier integrated chipsets, evidenced by the fact that we shipped 4x the number of Snapdragon chipsets in the second half of fiscal 2010 than we did in the first half.
This favorable mix trend is likely to continue into fiscal Q1, resulting in a sequential increase in average revenue per MSM. Growth in demand for smartphone chipsets continues to be an important driver for our business, and we expect to see an increase in the variety and tiering of smartphones in the future. We continue to see upside in the high-end of the market as well as the new wave of opportunity coming in the form of lower cost, high volume 3G phones in both developed and developing geographies. The cost advantages of our integrated approach and platform compatibility among our products positions us to grow as these trends play out in the market place.
We have a significant and growing number of design wins based on our integrated solutions, encompassing multiple-priced tiers and form factors. On the high end, devices based on the newest members of our Snapdragon family, the 8X55 and 7X30 chipsets are expected to be available this holiday season and devices based on our dual core products are expected to be available in the first half of calendar 2011.
New, lower-cost smartphones based on our integrated 7X27 and 7X25 chipsets are also growing, including offerings from LG, Motorola, Sony Ericsson and Huawei. In China alone, we have seen a nearly 30% growth in our customer base, with over 40 new designs in this tier. The majority of these are based on the Android operating system.
Our investments to support multiple operating systems positions us as well to gain share from smartphone growth. We now have seven different integrated chipsets that support the Android operating system. We are also Microsoft's lead chipset partner for the Windows Phone 7 launch. Our Snapdragon chipset powers all nine of the new Windows Phone 7 handsets, which are expected to be in stores in Europe, the U.S. and Southeast Asia this holiday season.
On the modem side, our innovation, products quality and ability to execute continue to set us apart. In emerging markets like India and China, our single chip QSC product family positions us to benefit from the 2G to 3G transition. A number of customers including Lenovo, Yulong and Long Cheer have already launched devices based on our 6240 and 6270 chipsets, and we have more than 25 designs in progress at multiple customers in China.
In mature markets, the 3G to 4G transition has started, driven by the increasing demand of smartphones and tablets. Our MDM9600 chipset is the first and only multimode LTE solution designed to help our customers seamlessly bridge this complex technology transition. We have sampled this product and expect to see the first commercial products based off of it this quarter.
We are very pleased that we finished the 2010 fiscal year at such a strong note and above targets, driven by an increase in demand for smartphone chipsets. We expect this trend to continue into the first quarter along with initial demand for LTE chipsets. In the second half, we expect a change in mix as the demand shifts to more mass-market smartphone products and emerging market chipsets driven by the transition from 2G to 3G. We will continue to price in order to gain share in this environment as we did in fiscal 2010. You will also see a major product transition in our portfolio as we sample our first 28-nanometer parts and increase the focus on cost-optimized smartphone solutions.
In closing, we believe the QCT team executed well in fiscal 2010 and continued to drive our technology and integration leadership position in the industry. We believe we are in a strong competitive position to continue to grow share and to lead the transition to smartphones and the growth of mobility in the market.  That concludes my remarks. And I now turn the call over to Bill Keitel."

We have good results to report to you today. Our fiscal fourth quarter revenues were $2.95 billion, up 10% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.68, up 42% year-over-year, both exceeding our prior guidance.
QCT had record MSM shipments and favorable product mix including HSUPA and EV-DO integrated chipsets. QCT's operating margin increased to 28%, reflecting strong volume and increased mix of higher-tiered chipsets.
QTL revenues were $921 million, and total reported device sales by our licensees were approximately $28 billion for activity in the June quarter, towards the high end of our prior guidance and up 12% sequentially, reflecting strength in Europe and North America.
We estimate that approximately 153 to 157 million subscriber units were shipped by our licensees in the June quarter at an average selling price of approximately $179 to $185.
As Paul mentioned, we are excited to see the introduction and growing sales of an increasing number of new 3G-enabled products including tablets that will drive incremental growth for QTL and QCT. As we have explained in the past, our Licensee business for sometime has had a voluntary royalty capping program for certain kinds of the devices, including 3G-enabled laptop computers. 
In order to help drive the broadest possible adoption of 3G connectivity in these new incremental product categories, we have decided for now to extend our voluntary royalty capping program to cover some additional types of connected devices such as tablets that meet certain requirements. Depending on the selling prices of these devices, the royalty caps may results in a royalty payable on something less than the full selling price of the device. 
QTL's implied royalty rate decreased slightly quarter-over-quarter, with one of the key drivers being the growth of these new connected device sales, notably tablets.
Operating cash flow was $1.1 billion, and our cash and marketable securities balance was $18.4 billion at the end of the quarter, with $6.3 billion onshore and $12.1 billion offshore. Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 19% in the fiscal fourth quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter were up $0.11 over the third quarter. QCT contributed $0.07 on higher MSM shipments and favorable product mix, while QTL was better by $0.04, driven by higher shipments of CDMA-based devices. The improvements in investment income and our tax rate offset the sequential growth in operating expenses, including two non-recurring operating expense items. 
Turning to our results for fiscal 2010, revenues were approximately $11 billion, up 6% year-over-year and in line with the midpoint of our original guidance at the outset of the fiscal year. GAAP earnings for fiscal 2010 were $1.96 per share. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 37% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings were $2.46 per share, up 88% year-over-year. Our business continued to generate strong cash flow. Operating cash flow for fiscal 2010 was more than $4 billion and approximately 37% of revenue.
QCT's fiscal 2010 operating margin was 25%, above our original guidance at the outset of the fiscal year, driven by strong volumes and favorable product mix in the second half of the year, including healthy demand for our integrated smartphone chipsets. 
QTL's operating margins was 83% for fiscal 2010, and we estimate that the fiscal 2010 device ASP, as it reported by our licensees, was approximately $183 to $189. Our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rates were approximately 20% in fiscal 2010. We are updating our estimate for calendar 2010 CDMA device shipments. We now expect approximately 625 million to 650 million devices to be shipped. Based on the 638 million midpoint of our estimates, we expect worldwide CDMA device shipments to grow approximately 26% year-over-year. Our prior estimate had been 23% midpoint growth.
Turning to next year. We estimate calendar 2011 CDMA device shipments will increase approximately 16% to 24% over our 2010 midpoint estimate, with unit shipments of approximately 740 million to 790 million units. Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate fiscal 2011 non-GAAP revenues to be in the range of approximately $12.4 billion to $13 billion, a double-digit increase of 13% to 18% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.3 billion in fiscal 2011, an increase of 11% to 23% year-over-year. We expect fiscal 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.77, an increase of 7% to 13% year-over-year.
We are encouraged by the progress we are making in resolving the two licensing disputes. While the outcomes remain uncertain and the disputes may not be resolved in 2011, we have included some benefit in the high-end of our 2011 guidance relating to resolution of the disputes. Our total amount expected to be owed by the licensees is significantly greater than what's in our guidance when prior years and total fiscal 2011 disputed royalties are included. We are trying to be prudent pending resolution of the matters. Once the disputes are resolved, we will adjust our guidance and provide you with an appropriate explanation so that you can understand the impact.
In the QCT segment, we expect a modest decline in revenue per MSM in fiscal 2011, more consistent with historical norms prior to fiscal 2010. We anticipate that non-GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses will grow approximately 7% year-over-year and driven primarily by growth in R&D expense. 
We have begun a restructuring plan to exit the current FLO TV Service business and expect to incur restructuring charges in fiscal 2011 to reduce ongoing expenses. This in turn better positions us for the strategic alternatives we are considering.
We expect our non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal 2011 to be approximately 21% and our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 19%.
Turning to the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we estimate non-GAAP revenues to be approximately $3 billion to $3.4 billion, an increase of 14% to 26% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $0.70 to $0.74, an increase of 13% to 19% year-over-year. This estimate includes shipments of approximately 115 to 119 million MSM chipsets during the December quarter due to continued strong demand for smartphones in developed markets.
We expect total reported device sales of approximately $31.5 billion to $33.5 billion by our licensees for shipments in the September quarter, and we expect a favorable foreign exchange benefit of several dollars, mostly due to the euro.
We believe that the channel inventory level is going through a seasonal build for the holiday season, although early indications are that the build may be a bit larger than what we've seen in recent years. We expect non-GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses to be approximately flat sequentially. The Qualcomm Investor Relations website includes an extensive slide presentation on the many data points included on this conference call, and we look forward to seeing you in New York for our Analyst Day meeting on November 17, where we will share additional data points regarding our fiscal 2011 guidance, including regional device shipment estimates, average selling prices and channel inventory. The Analyst Day event will be webcast for those of you unable to attend. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back over to Warren."

And number two, Steve talked about some product transitions that we foresee here in the second half of the year. So we are expecting operating margins to decline a bit in the QCT business."

It's more a statement I think about how I think strong it is at the moment versus kind of what's happening in the second half.

In terms of dual core, dual core, we have today over 10 different companies designing tablets on our dual core solutions. So we feel very good about where they're going. And then also in the handset space, you'll see that as well. That mix will start to happen through the year. The tablet space at this point, it's difficult to say how big that space is going to be. I've seen a lot of different estimates on that, and it will be interesting to see what happens. As we've probably talked before, we see that in developed world being one type of market. In the developing world, I think you'll tend to see a number of different types of devices go in there, mainly because there is no laptop market for them to have to displace, and we've already seen that with some of our product today. You've seen products going into India based off of smartphone chips. So it'll be a little bit of a mix there. In all cases, I think we're still trying to figure out how big that market is and how it will develop throughout the year."

This quarter, we reported 83%. So we did indicate that last quarter was an abnormal quarter.

One is our multimode capability, so the ability to seamlessly handover or provide simultaneous services across the 3G and the 4G networks. And then also I think just our ability to execute. What we saw through the quarter was a build in terms of demand for LTE chipsets, and I think that's probably a good data point for how we're able to deliver. In terms of connectivity, GPS is a big component of our solution today. It has been for a long time. It's something that has a very high attach rate with our solution cross feature phones as well as smartphones. We're now shipping Bluetooth in the tens of millions a year-type of quantity, and that has started to move into being an integrated solution in our smartphone roadmap. That will be followed by our Wireless LAN solution, and then we will integrate that as well. So if you look at our product portfolio, we started sampling standalone Bluetooth devices several years ago, and now we've migrated that into the MSM. We're a little bit delayed relative to the Bluetooth schedule, but same strategy is playing out on wireless LAN. So it's a standalone product today will be integrated here in the future and you'll hear more announcements about that in the future."

On the licensing dispute, I'll just recount I think what I think are the key points we made here. If you recall, we had said it was approximately $200 million as of the end of fiscal '10 that was due to us and of course some, one licensee has paid. But we haven't recognized it. So revenues and earnings that we haven't recognized. And that number for fiscal '11 is substantially greater. And so the decision was rather than put forth it was a pretty large number. We thought it was better to just put in a very prudent estimate into our guidance of what we think will be ultimately recognizable in fiscal '11, and we did not include in that any prior year. So it would only be a prudent estimate of what is earned in and what we think we will report and recognize in fiscal '11. From a timing standpoint, we put that in the second half of the year, but that's what we've got right now. On the mirasol side, the 2010 operating loss was approximately $180 million. We do have on a percentage basis I would say it's a fairly substantial increase year-over-year operating loss I think, as you know, we're pretty optimistic about the potential there we've got, and we'll get into some more specifics on that on what's in the guidance and where we stand on that business in a couple of weeks when we see you in New York."

I've been a pretty strong proponent that dividends would be a good use of that money, because of it’d create velocity of money in the economy. I would not say that I've gotten great traction with that at this point, but we're continuing to do that. We're doing an economic study about repatriation and when that is completed, we'll be going around Washington, hopefully, demonstrating to people the value of repatriation.

Let me begin by saying how pleased I am with our performance this year as we delivered record earnings per share and record MSM chipset volumes. Looking forward, our outlook reflect strong revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2011. In the coming year, we expect continued healthy growth in CDMA-based device shipments including smartphones and other data-centric devices driven by the global adoption of 3G and accelerating consumer demand for wireless data.
 There's been a number of highlights this year. First, QCT continued to execute. Our Snapdragon platforms set the competitive benchmark for smartphone silicon, and we've taken a leadership position in offering our chipsets for key operating systems such as Android and Windows Phone 7. We offer the industry's broadest 3G product roadmap, and we continued to grow share in WCDMA chipsets.
 Our Licensing business continues to be well positioned in 3G and multimode 3G LTE and now has over 185 licensees. Of note, we added another 14 new Chinese licensees in fiscal 2010, bringing the total number of Chinese licensees to 65. Our licensing program continues to foster innovation and supports the 3G ecosystem that benefits wireless consumers worldwide.
 In terms of our Display business, we believe mirasol is a disruptive technology for the mobile display industry. The combined benefits of extremely low power consumption with sunlight viewability and support for color, video and touch sets us apart from the competition. We've made strong progress in the development of this display technology as we brought our first batch online and are targeting limited volume commercial 5.7-inch display devices in the first half of 2011. We're very excited about that prospects for this technology, and we'll be providing more details at our upcoming Analyst Day.
 In FLO TV, we have decided to change directions, stepping back from the direct to consumer business and commencing a restructuring plan, under which we expect to exit the current FLO TV Service business. We're in discussions with a variety of interested parties and are continuing to evaluate other options for this business. Possibilities range from a new wholesale model, sale or joint venture with the third-party and/or sale of the spectrum licenses and discontinuance of the operation of the network.
 Overall, we had strong earnings and cash flow performance in fiscal 2010. We returned more than $4 billion to shareholders in the form of a $3 billion buyback and over $1 billion in cash dividend. We ended the year well positioned with a strong balance sheet, including $18.4 billion in cash and marketable securities.
 Turning to calendar 2011. We expect CDMA and multimode 3G 4G-based device shipments to grow to approximately 765 million units, up 20% year-over-year based on the midpoint of our projections. This growth will be driven by the global adoption of 3G, the continued demand for wireless data, strength in consumer demand for smartphones, growth in new connected device categories as well as 3G momentum in emerging regions.
 Operators around the world continue to benefit from the growth in wireless data. Japan is approaching a tipping point where data ARPU will exceed that of voice. In the United States, AT&T recently reported a 30% year-over-year growth in data revenues, and Verizon Wireless stated that data comprised over 35% of its revenues this quarter.
 We expect this trend of data growth to continue as operators increasingly experiment with variable pricing plans that provide more choice and lower total cost of ownership alternatives to consumers. To meet the network needs, resulting from this rapid growth in wireless data use, operators continue to make investments in the latest air interface technologies. TDDI recently announced its fourth quarter device lineup, and seven of the new devices included support for multi-carrier EV-DO also known as EV-DO Rev. B.
 According to the GSA, to date, there are a total of 81 operators who have launched HSPA+ Networks, of which nine support dual carrier HSPA+ with data rates of 42 megabits per second. The rate of HSPA+ Network launches is faster today than when HSUPA was first introduced. We're also seeing strong momentum behind LTE led by Verizon's expected launch this quarter. Our multimode capabilities are essential for device on these networks, and we're very well positioned to capitalize on these dynamics by leveraging our time-to-market advantages and industry-leading modem solutions.
 Smartphones remain the strongest area of growth within the Wireless segment, driven by continued innovation and competition. According to analysts, the global smartphone shipments exceeded 80 million units this quarter, representing a 30% increase quarter-over-quarter and a 95% increase from the year prior.
 Looking forward, according to Gartner, smartphones as a percentage of the total handset market is expected to grow from approximately 16% in 2009 to greater than 45% in 2014. These numbers would be even greater if they had included blue mobile platform based phones in their numbers.
 And our emergence of new connected device category is also a favorable trend for our business. As volumes in new categories like 3G connected e-readers and tablets continue to grow, they represent incremental growth opportunities for our businesses, driving adoption of multiple 3G devices for consumer.
 The growth of 3G and emerging regions is another catalyst for our business. China represents a significant opportunity with a low CDMA penetration rate of 13%. With 3G networks now maturing, operators have turned to increasing the number of devices available on their networks. For example, China Telecom reported more than 100 EV-DO handset models in supply by the first half of 2010. In China, Unicom had over 90 3G models available as of June.
 In India, 3G licenses had been issued, and the majority of newly licensed operators plan to launch 3G services before the end of calendar year 2010. Tata DOCOMO became the first private Indian operator to launch 3G. 3G services will be available across all nine of their circles this week.
 On the legal front, as we noted in our 10-K, in September, the company was notified by the SEC of a formal investigation that arose from a whistleblower's allegations made in December 2009 to the audit committee of the Board of Directors and to the SEC. The audit committee has conducted a review into the allegations and related accounting practice with the assistance of independent counsel and independent forensic accountants. This recently concluded review did not identify any errors in the company's financial statements. The company continued to cooperate with the SEC's ongoing investigation and look forward to resolving this matter.
 And separately, I'm pleased to report that the arbitrator in the Panasonic arbitration issued an interim order in the first day of the process denying Panasonic's claims that we've breached our license agreement with them. We're pleased with this initial finding as it supports our belief that Panasonic's claims are without merit.
 So to wrap up, we've completed another record year at Qualcomm, and I'd like to thank all of our employees and partners for their tremendous efforts. With our broad licensing program and industry-leading chipset roadmap, we're extremely well positioned to take advantage of key 3G growth opportunities in both developed and emerging regions around the world.
 In looking forward, I am pleased with our outlook for improved revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2011 and strong growth in CDMA-based device shipments, driven by the global migration in the 3G and the increasing consumer appetite for data-centric devices, particularly smartphones.
 That concludes my comments, and I'll now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf.

Our QCT business delivered strong results this year in a dynamic environment, reflecting growing demand across our product portfolio. We had another record quarter, shipping 111 billion MSMs, which was a great follow-on to our record results in the June quarter.
 We also had a record year shipping just under 400 million MSMs. We are extremely pleased to deliver stronger-than-expected revenues and operating profit for the quarter and for the fiscal year with operating margins exceeding the top end of our guidance. As we anticipated in July, demand for smartphones continued to grow in the September quarter. This is clearly a favorable trend for our business. Shipments of integrated 7,000 and 8,000-series chipsets increased more than 30% quarter-over-quarter and nearly 100% year-over-year. We also saw continued strong demand for our QSC and data-centric products. Our broad, industry-leading chipset roadmap help us grow share in both WCDMA handsets and in mobile application processors this year.
 As forecasted a year ago, we experienced a greater-than-normal decline in our average revenue per MSM during fiscal year 2010. In the first half, this was driven by competitive pricing pressure and an increase in sales of chips for entry level and lower-tier feature phones. In the second half, we saw even stronger-than-anticipated demand for our higher-tier integrated chipsets, evidenced by the fact that we shipped 4x the number of Snapdragon chipsets in the second half of fiscal 2010 than we did in the first half.
 This favorable mix trend is likely to continue into fiscal Q1, resulting in a sequential increase in average revenue per MSM. Growth in demand for smartphone chipsets continues to be an important driver for our business, and we expect to see an increase in the variety and tiering of smartphones in the future. We continue to see upside in the high-end of the market as well as the new wave of opportunity coming in the form of lower cost, high volume 3G phones in both developed and developing geographies. The cost advantages of our integrated approach and platform compatibility among our products positions us to grow as these trends play out in the market place.
 We have a significant and growing number of design wins based on our integrated solutions, encompassing multiple-priced tiers and form factors. On the high end, devices based on the newest members of our Snapdragon family, the 8X55 and 7X30 chipsets are expected to be available this holiday season and devices based on our dual core products are expected to be available in the first half of calendar 2011.
 New, lower-cost smartphones based on our integrated 7X27 and 7X25 chipsets are also growing, including offerings from LG, Motorola, Sony Ericsson and Huawei. In China alone, we have seen a nearly 30% growth in our customer base, with over 40 new designs in this tier. The majority of these are based on the Android operating system.
 Our investments to support multiple operating systems positions as well to gain share from smartphone growth. We now have seven different integrated chipsets that support the Android operating system. We are also Microsoft's lead chipset partner for the Windows Phone 7 launch. Our Snapdragon chipset powers all nine of the new Windows Phone 7 handsets, which are expected to be in stores in Europe, the U.S. and Southeast Asia this holiday season.
 On the modem side, our innovation, products quality and ability to execute continue to set us apart. In emerging markets like India and China, our single chip QSC product family positions us to benefit from the 2G to 3G transition. A number of customers including Lenovo, Yu Long and Long Xer [ph] have already launched devices based on our 6240 and 6270 chipsets, and we have more than 25 designs in progress at multiple customers in China.
 In mature markets, the 3G to 4G transition has started, driven by the increasing demand of smartphones and tablet. Our MDM9600 chipset is the first and only multimode LTE solution designed to help our customers seamlessly bridge this complex technology transition. We have sampled this product and expect to see the first commercial products based off of it this quarter.
 We are very pleased that we finished the 2010 fiscal year at such a strong note and above targets, driven by an increase in demand for smartphone chipsets. We expect this trend to continue into the first quarter along with initial demand for LTE chipsets. In the second half, we expect the change in mix as the demand shifts to more mass-market smartphone products and emerging market chipsets driven by the transition from 2G to 3G. We will continue to price in order to gain share in this environment as we did in fiscal 2010. You will also see a major product transition in our portfolio as we sample our first 28-nanometer parts and increase the focus on cost-optimized smartphone solutions.
 In closing, we believe the QCT team executed well in fiscal 2010 and continued to drive our technology and integration leadership position in the industry. We believe we are in a strong competitive position to continue to grow share and to lead the transition to smartphones and the growth of mobility in the market.  That concludes my remarks. And I now turn the call over to Bill Keitel.

We have good results to report to you today. Our fiscal fourth quarter revenues were $2.95 billion, up 10% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.68, up 42% year-over-year, both exceeding ou",1201," Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We have good results to report to you today. Our fiscal fourth quarter revenues were $2.95 billion, up 10% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.68, up 42% year-over-year, both exceeding our prior guidance.
 QCT had record MSM shipments and favorable product mix including HSUPA and EV-DO integrated chipsets. QCT's operating margin increased to 28%, reflecting strong volume and increased mix of higher-tiered chipsets.
 QTL revenues were $921 million, and total report device sales by our licensees were approximately $28 billion for activity in the June quarter, towards the high end of our prior guidance and up 12% sequentially, reflecting strength in Europe and North America.
 We estimate that approximately 153 to 157 million subscriber units were shipped by our licensees in the June quarter at an average selling price of approximately $179 to $185.
 As Paul mentioned, we are excited to see the introduction and growing sales of the increasing number of new 3G-enabled products including tablets. It will drive incremental growth for QTL and QCT. As we have explained in the past, our Licensee business for sometime has had a voluntary royalty capping program for certain kinds of the devices, including 3G-enabled laptop computers.
 In order to help drive the broadest possible adoption of 3G connectivity in these new incremental product categories, we have decided for now to extend our voluntary royalty capping program to cover some additional types of connected devices such as tablets that meet certain requirements. Depending on selling prices of these devices, the royalty caps may results in a royalty payable on something less than the full ceiling price of the device.
 QTL's implied royalty rate decreased slightly quarter-over-quarter, and it's one of the key drivers in the growth of these new connected device sales, notably tablets.
 Operating cash flow was $1.1 billion, and our cash and marketable securities balance was $18.4 billion at the end of the quarter, with $6.3 billion onshore and $12.1 billion offshore. Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 19% in the fiscal fourth quarter.
 Non-GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter were up $0.11 over the third quarter. QCT contributed $0.07 on higher MSM shipments and a favorable product mix, while QTL was better by $0.04, driven by higher shipments of CDMA-based devices. The improvements in investment income and our tax rate offset the sequential growth in operating expenses, including two non-recurring operating expense items.
 Turning to our results for fiscal 2010, revenues were approximately $11 billion, up 6% year-over-year and in line with the midpoint of our original guidance at the outset of the fiscal year. GAAP earnings for fiscal 2010 were $1.96 per share. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 37% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings were $2.46 per share, up 88% year-over-year. Our business continued to generate strong cash flow. Operating cash flow for fiscal 2010 was more than $4 billion and approximately 37% of revenue.
 QCT's fiscal 2010 operating margin was 25% above our original guidance at the outset of the fiscal year, driven by strong volumes and favorable product mix in the second half of the year, including healthy demand for our integrated smartphone chipsets.
 QTL's operating margins was 83% for fiscal 2010, and we estimate that the fiscal 2010 device ASP, as reported by our licensees, was approximately $183 to $189. Our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rates were approximately 20% of fiscal 2010. We are updating our estimate for calendar 2010 CDMA device shipments. We now expect approximately 625 million to 650 million devices to be shipped. Based on the 638 million midpoint of our estimates, we expect worldwide CDMA device shipments to grow approximately 26% year-over-year. Our prior estimate had been 23% midpoint growth.
 Turning to next year. We estimate calendar 2011 CDMA device shipments will increase approximately 16% to 24% over our 2010 midpoint estimate, with unit shipments of approximately 740 million to 790 million units. Based on the current business outlook, we anticipate fiscal 2011 non-GAAP revenues to be in the range of approximately $12.4 billion to $13 billion, a double-digit increase of 13% to 18% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.3 billion in fiscal 2011, an increase of 11% to 23% year-over-year. We expect fiscal 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.77, an increase of 7% to 13% year-over-year.
 We are encouraged by the progress we are making in resolving the two licensing disputes. While the outcomes remain uncertain and the disputes may not be resolved in 2011, we have included some benefit in the high-end of our 2011 guidance relating to resolution of the disputes. Our total amount expected by the licensees is significantly greater than what's in our guidance when prior years and total fiscal 2011 disputed royalties are included. We are trying to be prudent pending resolution of the matters. Once the disputes are resolved, we will adjust our guidance and provide you with an appropriate explanation so that you can understand the impact.
 In the QCT segment, we expect a modest decline in revenue per MSM in fiscal 2011, more consistent with historical norms prior to fiscal 2010. We anticipate that non-GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses will grow approximately 7% year-over-year and driven primarily by growth in R&D expense.
 We have begun a restructuring plan to exit the current FLO TV Service business and expect to incur restructuring charges in fiscal 2011 to reduce ongoing expenses. This in turn better positions us for the strategic alternatives we are considering.
 We expect our non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal 2011 to be approximately 21% and our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 19%.
 Turning to the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we estimate non-GAAP revenues to be approximately $3 billion to $3.4 billion, an increase of 14% to 26% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $0.70 to $0.74, an increase of 13% to 19% year-over-year. This estimate includes shipments of approximately 115 to 119 million chipsets during the December quarter due to continued strong demand for smartphones in developed markets.
 We expect total reported device sales of approximately $31.5 billion to $33.5 billion by our licensees for shipments in the September quarter, and we expect a favorable foreign exchange benefit of several dollars, mostly due to the euro.
 We believe that the channel inventory level is going through a seasonal build for the holiday season, although early indications are that the build may be a bit larger than what we've seen in recent years. We expect non-GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses to be approximately flat sequentially. The Qualcomm Investor Relations website includes an extensive slide presentation on the many data points included on this conference call, and we look forward to seeing you in New York for our Analyst Day meeting on November 17, where we will share additional data points regarding our fiscal 2011 guidance, including regional device shipment estimates, average selling prices and channel inventory. The Analyst Day event will be webcast for those of you unable to attend.
 That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back over to Warren.

If you  can emphasize that market in terms of how much is embedded into your guidance currently? And then secondly if I just look at your fiscal year guidance, the math seems to imply that your operating margins in either your QCT or QTL or both will actually decline pretty significantly going into the last three quarters of the year, by my math, maybe below 25% on chipsets if I'm holding 80% margins on my QTL business. Can you just walk through kind of the puts and takes of the margin linearity through the rest of the year?

On the tablet question, we are considering whether we share more data on the market estimate and connected devices, specifically for a couple of weeks in New York. It's not currently in the presentation, but it is under consideration for inclusion. On the fiscal year operating margin, you are correct. We are expecting some decline after the first quarter. As Steve mentioned, we are looking at a channel inventory build here in the December quarter. Typically, that begins to run off into the March and June quarters, number one. And number two, Steve talked about some product transitions that we foresee here in the second half of the year. So we are expecting operating margins to decline a bit in the QCT business.

On your smartphone mix question, I think what you're saying is in the first quarter, certainly in the quarter that we gave guidance on, we continued to see very strong shipments of smartphones and probably, as I mentioned in my script, a little bit more than we even thought a couple of quarters ago. In the second half of the year, what we anticipate happening is that this shift will be probably a little bit more to the developing market, which would kind of pull that down a little bit in terms of the type of device that we ship. It's more of a statement I think about how I think strong it is at the moment versus kind of what's happening in the second half. Although in the second half, as Bill said, it kind of goes back and fourth between developed markets versus emerging markets. We saw that happen this year as well. In terms of dual core, dual core, we have today over 10 different companies designing tablets on our dual core solutions. So we feel very good about where they're going. And then also in the handset space, you'll see that as well. That mix will start to happen through the year. The tablets space at this point, it's difficult to say how big that space is going to be. I've seen a lot of different estimates on that, and it will be interesting to see what happens. As we've probably talked before, we see that developed world being one type of market. In the developing world, I think you'll tend to see a number of different types of devices go in there, mainly because there is no laptop market for them to have to displace, and we've already seen that with some of our product today. You've seen products going into India based off of smartphone chips. So there'll be a little bit of a mix there. In all cases, I think we're still trying to figure out how big that market is and how it will develop throughout the year.

So we're going to continue to monitor this here over the next couple of weeks, and when we're in New York, we'll share with you our best view of it, as of that point in time as to just how much of an increase is it, and do we think it's a March unwind or a March and June quarter unwind.

Bill, I think you said that the implied royalty rate decreased quarter-on-quarter partly because of the capping program in tablets. And I would imagine that the capping program impacts ASPs but not the royalty rate, if you can just clarify that. And then the second question on QTL was it looks like ASP has actually declined a little bit sequentially and I understand that they're one quarter in arrears, but Q2 is really strong quarter for smartphone. So I'm just curious why ASPs were down. And then just lastly, in QTL, the 82% level for operating margins, is that now a normalized level for that business? Or are there still any excess legal costs or any thing that's unusual there that's depressing that margin?

As Bill mentioned, the devices that are coming through a total reported device sales are coming throughout at a full ASP. And to the extent that as a royalty cap in place, that means the royalty will actually get paid on something less than that complete selling price, so that does have a downward effect on the implied rate that you would calculate based on the information that we provide. And as typical, some of the revenue outside of the subscriber base tend to be a bit lumpy. Audit recovers were a bit down this quarter as well. That was contributed to the quarter-over-quarter change.

But on that same point, as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing the opposite impact here in this coming December quarter. We're looking for several dollars of positive impact, again primarily due to the euro. On the operating margin side for our Licensing business. Last quarter, we reported approximately 80%. This quarter, we reported 83%. So we did indicate that last quarter was an abnormal quarter. And then in terms of the full year, obviously, we're looking for good earnings growth and part of that is we are looking to grow revenues and operating income at a faster rate than our operating expenses. So we are looking to leverage that pace of operating expense that we already have in place. So on balance, operating margins, I think, are on a positive trend here.

As we've talked about before, a number of -- I think there are two things that differentiate us on the 4G side. One is our multimode capability, that ability to seamlessly handle or provide simultaneous services across the 3G and the 4G networks. And then also I think just our ability to execute what we saw through the quarter was a build in terms of demand for LTE chipsets, and I think that's probably a good data point for how we're able to deliver. In terms of connectivity, GPS is a big component of our solution today. It has been for a long time. It's something that has a very high attach rate with our solution across the feature phones as well as smartphones. We're now shipping Bluetooth in the tens of millions a year-type of quantity, and that has started to move into being an integrated solution in our smartphone roadmap. That will be followed by our Wireless LAN solution, and then we will integrate that as well. So if you look at our product portfolio, we started sampling stand-alone Bluetooth devices several years ago, and now we've migrated that into the MSM. We're a little bit delayed relative to the Bluetooth schedule, but same strategy is playing out on wireless LAN. So it's a standalone product today will be integrated here in the future and you'll hear more announcements about that in the future.

On the constitution from tablets, what we said was that on our presentation as it stands right now, in New York, but we are considering and we're having a good discussion on whether we would include a breakout estimate of connected devices. So it's under consideration, but we haven't decided that yet. It's a new developing market, a little harder to forecast because of that reason, but we are considering that. On the licensing dispute, I'll just recount I think what I think are the key points we made here. If you recall, we had said it was approximately $200 million as of the end of fiscal '10. That was due to loss and of course some licensee is paying. But we haven't recognized it. So revenues and earnings that we haven't recognized. And that number for fiscal '11 is substantially greater. And so the decision was rather than put forth it was a pretty large number. We thought it was better to just put in a very prudent estimate into our guidance of what we think will be ultimately recognizable in fiscal '11, and we did not include in that any prior year. So it would only be a prudent estimate of what is earned and what we think we will report to recognize in fiscal '11. From a timing standpoint, we'll put that in the second half of the year, but that's what we've got right now. On the mirasol side, the 2010 operating loss was approximately $180 million. We do have on a percentage basis I would say it's a fairly substantial increase year-over-year. Operating loss I think, as you know, we're pretty optimistic about the potential here we've got, and we'll get into some more specifics on that on what's in the guidance and where we stand on that business in a couple of weeks when we see in New York.

The Snapdragon sales really highlight our strength in smartphones. Smartphones and also these new device types are driving a lot of opportunities for the Licensing business. And so I was very excited by what we see as a potential going forward. The reason is because the wireless industry really continues to innovate in an extremely rapid pace, and it's doing that because it's responding to consumer traction and excitement, and the amount of focus on this space I think is almost higher than it's ever been. And so I feel like Qualcomm is extremely well positioned there. We are going to continue to drive that dynamic as hard as we can with new products and new technologies in 2011 and beyond. So we thank you very much for your support and thanks for being on the call today, and we look forward to seeing you in New York.
