Today, I'll talk about our results from both the Q4 and full year perspective. And I'll then outline our key priorities for 2010 before turning it over to Bob for more details on the quarter and our 2010 Q1 and full year guidance. Let us start by taking a quick look at our Q4 results. Revenue growth was up 16% to $2.4 billion, non-GAAP EPS was up 9% to $0.44 and we generated free cash flow of almost $600 million. In addition, we successfully completed the sale of 70% of Skype for approximately $1.9 billion. This move allows us to focus our energies on our two core businesses, Payments and Marketplaces. All in all, we had a strong Q4 with both of these core businesses accelerating sharply from the third quarter. Let's take a look at what we'd accomplished in each business unit in Q4 and for the year. PayPal posted terrific results, significantly expanding its global presence. For the first time, PayPal's total payment volume passed $20 billion in a single quarter. PayPal is truly a global business, now supporting 24 currencies and 190 markets with 81 million active accounts.  In 2009, for the first time, annual revenue and TPV from PayPal's Merchant Services business exceeded PayPal's volume on eBay. And PayPal's volume is predicated on our core fundamental strength. Merchants realize higher conversion rates when PayPal's available for payment option. By almost every measure, PayPal strengthened its competitive position in Q4. Total revenue and TPV both grew significantly year-over-year, penetration on eBay increased three points year-over-year and PayPal's Merchant Services business once again delivered very strong performance with TPV growth of 50% in Q4. And this growth is global. In the U.S., PayPal Merchant Services TPV grew at 10x the market growth rate for e-commerce, international Merchant Services TPV grew 80% year-over-year and volume from outside the U.S. now accounts for 40% of PayPal's total TPV. PayPal continues to leverage this unique global footprint by making it easy to send and receive payments across borders. In fact, cross-border trade now accounts for almost 25% of PayPal's total payment volume. And PayPal continues to drive further penetration in major markets. For example, in Japan, PayPal has signed agreements with five of the country's leading gateways representing over $14 billion in new addressable TPV.We also became the first major payment platform to open up to third-party developers, a move which will accelerate PayPal adoption and innovation. Since opening the PayPal platform in early November, more than 12,000 developers have signed up and the first payments applications have already launched. Simply put, PayPal is leveraging its advantages for merchants and consumers and rapidly expanding our global presence. PayPal is well on its way to becoming the preferred online payment provider around the world.Turning to eBay, our Q4 results demonstrate continued progress as we improve value, selection in trust and turnaround this business. Marketplace revenue grew 15% in Q4 but more important, our progress is evidenced across the three underlying metrics we're using to measure our success. Net promoter scores for both buyers and sellers are up significantly in our major markets. Sold items accelerated for the third consecutive quarter, up 11% globally year-over-year. And core GMV growth also accelerated for the third consecutive quarter. In fact, in most of our major markets, we were able to grow at or above e-commerce growth rates during Q4. Let's take a quick look at what's behind this momentum. Asia Pacific remains our fastest growing region, where GMV grew almost 50% over last year and that's before adding Gmarket, an acquisition that extends our leadership position in Korea and enhances our momentum in the region. And eBay's ability to conveniently connect buyers and sellers across borders continues to be a competitive strength. For example, exports from Chinese sellers doubled in Q4, delivering over 15 million great deals to consumers all over the world during this holiday season. In Europe, we have successfully transformed our seller value proposition and business model over the past 18 months. By offering lower insertion fees to our sellers, we have almost doubled the number of live listings, a significant increase in selection. We plan to adopt similar best practices in the U.S. in early 2010 and we are improving the fundamentals of our business, which positions us to win in the secondary market. And in fact, we are increasingly moving new types of merchandise at high velocity. In North America, we experienced early success with our fashion vault pilots with brands such as Cole Haan, DKNY, Hugo Boss and Max Mara. Popular items sold out in hours and drove strong incremental sales for our sellers. EBay is absolutely becoming a more trusted marketplace. Buyers are responding and our bestsellers are winning and we're continuing to raise the bar for our sellers. As you know, we have introduced a top-rated seller status that all buyers can see. In Q4, our top-rated sellers in the U.S. grew same-store sales by over 10% and accounted for approximately 30% of total core GMV. In Germany, our top-rated sellers grew same-store sales by 25%. And in the U.K., they grew same-store sales by 35%. Bottom line, sellers who deliver the very best experience are succeeding on eBay and buyers are benefiting.These turnaround efforts are paying off. Market share gains are evident internationally, where we are further along in our turnarounds. In the U.K., for example, we posted 17% growth during the second half of 2009, significantly outperforming the market. We're also increasing innovation across eBay and becoming a more technology-driven company. One example of this is our efforts in mobile commerce, where eBay made tremendous progress over the past year. Our eBay mobile application has been downloaded almost 7 million times, making it consistently one of the top app on the iPhone. And even more important, consumers are using our mobile application changing the way they shop and generating over $600 million in GMV on eBay during 2009, more than a 200% increase over the previous year. We'll continue to innovate mobile in 2010 and provide consumers other convenient ways to buy, sell, find and pay for the best deals on eBay with their smartphones.Turning to our adjacent e-commerce formats, StubHub had a strong quarter with Q4 ticket sales up 54% over last year. High-profile concerts and sporting events such as the World Series drove strong ticket demand and market share gains. People are increasingly shopping on StubHub for sought-after tickets at great value in a marketplace they can trust. Our Classifieds business was up 20% in 2009 as we strengthened our global footprint. We saw promising early results from initiatives in Spain, France, Germany and Italy that integrate our local classifieds offerings with the core eBay business and eBay brand. We expect these initiatives to continue to drive innovation in other markets in 2010. So overall, this was both a strong quarter and a strong year for our Marketplaces business and we feel good about our progress.Before I close, let me remind you of the three-year growth targets we laid out for our company in March of 2009. First, we said that PayPal will be the leader in online global payments and we intend to almost double PayPal to revenues of between $4 billion and $5 billion by the end of 2011. PayPal made significant progress toward this goal during 2009. And second, in our Marketplaces business, we said we will focus and win in the secondary market and grow adjacent formats such as Classifieds. Again, we made progress towards this goal in 2009, improving our growth rates relative to the market. We plan to grow GMV with e-commerce in 2010 and grow our business faster than e-commerce in 2011. So 2009 represented an important first step toward our three-year goal and we're entering 2010 with strong momentum. And now with the sale of Skype, we're fully focused on our two core businesses, Payments and Marketplaces. We have clear priorities for both businesses in 2010. At PayPal, we will strengthen and expand our leadership position in online payments and we'll do this by continuing to maximize PayPal's potential on eBay and rapidly growing Merchant Services through merchant acquisition and increased consumer preference as we expand our consumer footprint. And we'll continue to launch new products and accelerate innovation off of our platform in this exciting business.In our core eBay Marketplaces business, we're positioned in 2010 to make even more progress in trust value and selection and further penetrate the secondary market. And we'll do this by offering buyers great experience as they can trust with innovative shopping experiences that deliver great value and selection, and by providing tools and pricing that align our success with our sellers. We'll continue to make eBay the most attractive opportunity available for entrepreneurial sellers, casual consumer sellers and larger sellers.So today, we're a more customer-focused and technology-driven company. We're driving significant operational efficiencies that enable us to reallocate and reinvest significant resources into our growth initiatives that directly benefit our customers. I continue to be pleased with our pace, our progress and our performance. We're committed to consistently delivering on our financial commitments, while doing what's necessary to position our business for long-term growth and leadership. And now I'll turn it over to Bob for more details on the quarter and our financial outlook."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. All growth rates mentioned in my prepared remarks represent year-over-year comparisons unless I clarify otherwise. Also, I'd like to remind you that we sold the majority of Skype on November 19, so financial results for Skype are only included up to that date.Overall, we delivered strong fourth quarter results. We outperformed on both the top and bottom lines and we increased the financial strength and flexibility of the company. We executed against our strategic priorities during the quarter. PayPal continued to gain market share as transactions in TPV growth accelerated sharply. And we completed the first phase of BML integration into the PayPal wallet. As John highlighted, Marketplaces achieved improvement in all three of the key metrics, Net Promoter Score, velocity and market share. Finally, we completed the sale of Skype, focusing our portfolio on our strategic mission of connecting buyers and sellers online. So we're pleased with the results we achieved this past quarter, particularly given the backdrop of the difficult consumer environment, both here in the U.S. and abroad, and we head into 2010 cautiously optimistic.Our combined businesses generated net revenues of $2.4 billion in the quarter, a 16% increase or 19% excluding Skype from Q4 2008 and Q4 2009. Organic revenue was up 12%, a sharp acceleration versus the third quarter. A weaker U.S. dollar increased our revenue growth by four points, and acquisitions increased revenue growth by one point. Fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.44, a 9% increase. Excluding Skype, non-GAAP EPS grew at 11%. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher volume, productivity gains and FX, partially offset by a lower take rate. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.3%, down 350 basis points driven by business mix, acquisitions and a favorable one-time item in the fourth quarter of 2008.We generated $598 million of free cash flow in the quarter or 25% of revenues. CapEx as a percentage of revenues was 7% for the quarter and 6.5% for the year. Return on invested capital was 22.2% on a trailing 12-month basis, marking the first sequential improvement since the third quarter of 2008.Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. Starting with our Payments business, PayPal had an exceptional quarter. Total revenue increased 28% to $796 million, a sharp acceleration from Q3. Total payment volume increased 34% to $21.4 billion. Geographically, TPV growth was 22% in the U.S. and 54% internationally.PayPal's Merchant Services business posted another great quarter with the number of payment transactions growing 53%. This, coupled with a slight decrease in average transaction size, resulted in $12.1 billion of global TPV, representing 50% growth over last year. Merchant Services accounted for 57% of total TPV in the quarter compared to 50% in the fourth quarter last year. PayPal transaction margin was strong improving to 62.1% in the quarter. Although global take rate was down, we were able to offset this decline with modestly lower transaction expense and a more significant improvement to transaction losses due to better fraud detection and prevention.PayPal's segment margin came in at 17.8% in the quarter, up 300 bps from Q3 and down 100 bps year-over-year. The 100 basis point drop from last year was primarily the result of an economic currency hedge and dilution from Bill Me Later, partially offset by higher transaction margins and volume-related leverage.Let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later. Bill Me Later's gross receivable balance at quarter end was $673 million. The quality of Bill Me Later receivables has improved, which reduced growth but we continue to believe this is the right trade-off in the current economic environment. The net charge-off rate decreased slightly to 11.1% in the quarter and risk adjusted margin remains better than industry average.Now let's move to our Marketplaces business. Overall, Marketplaces achieved net revenues of $1.5 billion, a 15% increase from last year and sharp sequential improvement. Growth was driven by the acquisition of Gmarket, strength in our StubHub in Classifieds businesses and improvement on the core eBay sites. International accounted for 60% of Marketplaces revenue this quarter, up from 55% in the year ago period. We continue to be pleased with the double-digit growth we're seeing in our fixed price format. Auction format GMV declined slightly, which represented an improvement over the prior quarter. Vehicles also improved from prior quarters.Let's turn to marketing services and other, which we view as alternative formats for bringing buyers and sellers together. Our Classifieds business continued its strong trajectory with 20% revenue growth or 9% on an FX-neutral basis. Total global advertising revenue increased by 3%. Advertising revenue was negatively impacted by the placement of advertise on our eBay sites as we continued to optimize the user experience. Shopping.com, Rent [Rent.com] and other revenue was up 7% in the quarter. Just a couple of quick highlights on Marketplaces operational metrics. Velocity, our sold items grew at 11% in the quarter, excluding Gmarket, driven by geographic strength in China cross border, the U.K. and Germany. Marketplaces segment margin was 40.4% in the quarter, down 480 basis points. The main drivers include dilutions from acquisitions and increased litigation expense reserves in the fourth quarter of 2009, as well as a tough comp due to the reversal of accrued bonuses in the fourth quarter of 2008.Global take rate was 7.5% in the quarter, down 20 basis points from last year. Excluding the impact from vehicles, StubHub, currencies and Gmarket, take rate was down 40 basis points year-over-year. The decline in take rate is primarily due to a reduction in feature fees and larger discounts given to our highest-rated sellers. In the fourth quarter, sales and marketing, as a percent of revenue, was up 140 basis points due to increased investment in Merchant Services, a shift in type of spend from contract to expense and the inclusion of Gmarket. Our core Marketplaces marketing program spend for 2009 was down modestly from 2008 levels as we continue to use data and technology to improve the efficiency of our marketing.Product development was 30 basis points higher than last year, driven by continued investment in the user experience and our technology platform. G&A costs increased 160 basis points from last year, predominantly due to a tough comp from the reversal of accrued bonuses in Q4 2008 and the inclusion of Gmarket. Our provision for transaction loan losses was up 40 basis points, primarily due to our new eBay dispute resolution program and higher BML credit losses.Last March at our Analyst Day, we discussed the need for us to operate smarter and more efficiently. At that time, we laid out plans to reduce our cost structure by a cumulative $2 billion over three years. We remain on track to achieve this goal, generating more than $600 million in savings since the fourth quarter of 2008. And we've reinvested these savings into areas of customer experience, trust, marketing and technology to improve our competitive position.From a cash perspective, we generated strong free cash flow of approximately $600 million during the quarter. We received $1.9 billion in cash for the sale of 70% of Skype, and we paid off the remaining $200 million balance on our line of credit. Cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments was $5.2 billion at quarter end.We brought back $1.1 billion from overseas as a result of a business restructuring during the quarter and ended the quarter with $1 billion cash in the U.S. While the tax impact is $200 million to $225 million from the business restructuring will occur in the first quarter, it will give us additional flexibility with our U.S. cash balance.While the first half of 2009 was an extremely difficult environment to operate in, we've built momentum throughout the year. Revenue accelerated in the second half, EPS improved in the fourth quarter and we generated excellent free cash flow throughout the year. And we exited 2009 stronger than we entered it.Given that, let me turn to guidance. A year ago, in light of the cloudy economic environment, we suspended issuing full year guidance. While there's still some uncertainty in the economic outlook, we are reinstating full year guidance for 2010 due to better visibility on the economy and progress we've made in our core Marketplaces business. Our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2010 no longer consolidates Skype, as we will incorporate Skype into our financials using the equity method of accounting.For Q1 2010, we anticipate revenue of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. This represents growth of 12% to 18% excluding Skype. We anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $0.39 to $0.41, which represents growth at 8% to 13% excluding Skype. For the full year of 2010, we anticipate revenue of $8.8 billion to $9.1 billion. This represents growth of 9% to 12% excluding Skype. And we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $1.63 to $1.68, representing growth of 11% to 14%, again also excluding Skype.In summary, we're pleased with the progress we've made in 2009. We continue to focus on our key priorities. In Payments, we'll strengthen and expand our leadership position in online payments, while accelerating innovation off our platform. In Marketplaces, we'll continue to make progress in trust, value and selection, while further penetrating the secondary market. And we'll continue to become a more customer-focused and technology-driven company. We remain cautiously optimistic as we head into the new year. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions.

What we do see, however, goes back to what I said at the Analyst Day last March, which is e-commerce continues to gain share versus offline retail. And we saw that in the fourth quarter, where I think when all is said and done, e-commerce growth rates will be higher than offline retail. And I continue to believe we participate in a large and growing market, where there's going to be a lot of opportunity for multiple winners.

On the International business, one of the, I suppose, benefits we have, and particularly in Germany and to some extent the U.K., is we can clearly differentiate business sellers from consumer sellers. And so when we put in place the pricing changes we did at the end of '08, we differentiated business pricing from consumer pricing across fixed price and auctions more aggressively in Europe. And in particular, we particularly lowered insertion fees on fixed price. And as I said, what that did is that allowed a huge inflow of fixed-price items from business sellers, and it allowed consumer sellers to add their items but more on an auction format which is, I think, increasingly the better way for consumer sellers to sell on eBay. In the U.S., we don't have the luxury, if you will, of being able to mechanically differentiate consumer sellers from business sellers. And so we didn't go to quite the same extremes in our pricing here. We also have such big collection in the U.S. So I think what we'll do in 2010 is take some of the learnings that we generated outside the U.S. and apply them as appropriate and as tailored to the U.S. market. And I think we feel we've proven out some of these things outside the U.S. and they'll apply inside the U.S."

And the restructuring we did in the fourth quarter allowed us to do that to bring more of our total cash position here domestically. I would say our priority is we'll continue to maintain a conservative balance sheet. But to get us the flexibility to first be able to finance the growth of our expanding BML portfolio here domestically. And also, the capacity or the flexibility to pursue acquisitions on both internationally and domestically as they arise and materialize. So our priorities haven't really changed.

First, our program that we term as operational excellence, which essentially is finding better ways to do more things efficiently, enabled us to generate great productivity in the Marketplaces business during the course of the year, including the fourth quarter. We've taken out that productivity, and we've reinvested it in lower take rates and higher product-related expenses, so those two good productivity selling in the lower take rates and higher product-related expenses. The margin decline is really due to the acquisition of Gmarket, number one. Number two, in the fourth quarter, two things that you highlighted. One was a good guy last year, reversal of bonuses in the fourth quarter. And the other was a bad guy in 2009, which was higher litigation reserves and expenses, so a little bit of both. The sequential decline, Q3 to Q4, was primarily due to a lower take rate and the impact of higher litigation expenses. If I roll the clock forward in terms of implied margins in our 2010 guidance, we have essentially implied, as I indicated to Mark, that margins overall will go up modestly from 2009 to 2010. And we are not a Marketplaces business that'd be relatively stable. We'll continue to absorb the impact of lower take rate changes that we did in Q4 which will impact the full year of 2010, but we'll fund those by continuing to operate smarter in all the different components of our costs in the core business."

First, on Gmarket. As you know Scott, we closed the transaction in June. The objective of the combination was to consolidate our leading position in Korea to continue to operate two different platforms by generating significant synergies from the integration, the back office functions. I'd say our team in Korea, both the Gmarket team and the IAC [Internet Auction Co.] team have made tremendous progress on essentially all fronts in a relatively short period of time. So we feel very good about the back office integration, the inherent synergies; secondly, the combined business gaining market share in Korea, while continuing to operate two different front offices, if you will, or platforms. On Bill Me Later, we're just over a year into the combination. Just to refresh your memory, the intention was to take the, number one, PayPal; and the number two, alternative online Payments businesses with very complementary skills and put them together, leveraging the complements: Bill Me Later, with a very strong large merchant presence; PayPal with a very strong, small, sole proprietor, SMB kind of presence; and with a combination of the product, the platform and the sales force that we would be able to increase our presence with large and small merchants to offer our consumers more choices at relatively low-cost transaction expense, as we monetize both merchants and consumers. One year in, we feel very good about the continued presence with merchants here domestically, and you saw those reflected really in the accelerating TPV for PayPal during the course of the second half of the year. We just launched the product integration or Bill Me Later and the PayPal wallet in the fourth quarter, and we feel good about kind of the trajectory. We got another product launch early in 2010 and we feel pretty good about the combinations of two platforms. So all in all, we've invested quite a bit and strengthened our Asian presence with Gmarket on expanding our reach of the PayPal business with Bill Me Later and six and 12 months and respectively, we feel really good about our positioning."

On take rate, I appreciate the way you asked the question because people kind of focus quarter to quarter, and the way we really think about take rate is stepping back. And I'll remind you that it was only 24 months ago when I first took over in this role. We had one take rate applied to all categories and all geographies across all sellers around the world. And the structure of that take rate really hadn't changed since the beginning of eBay. And so we set out on what we knew was going to be a three- to four-year process to make changes in our take rate that would better align ourselves with our sellers and make a robust marketplace. And so we have really focused on three things during that time. One, we've gone to category-based pricing which makes sense. Two, we've made significant changes in rebalancing front-end versus back-end fees which is to say we were probably 70/30 front-end to back-end at the beginning of '08. And today going into 2010, we're more 30/70, 30% front-end and 70% back-end. And what that means is we have aligned our incentives with that of our sellers. If they don't succeed in selling, we don't succeed in collecting fees. And then the last thing we've done is we have incented our sellers, such as the sellers that give the best service to buyers get the lowest rates on eBay. And so I'd say we're kind of 2/3 of the way through. We put some things in, in Q4, which took a further step in that direction, and we'll make a few more changes in '09 that I think have to do with taking the learnings from Europe and applying them in the U.S. about rebalancing. But I feel good that coming out of 2010, we will have the structure and alignment of our pricing in the marketplace that's aligned with sellers and optimized for marketplace success."

Obviously, our intention would be integration of Bill Me Later into the PayPal wallet in the future and view item [ph] products lows. The intention is to give consumer choice. And with that choice, we believe that with the unique Bill Me Later offering that they will increasingly choose Bill Me Later as their way to settle their online payments, and Bill Me Later will grow as a percentage of PayPal volume. That being said, in the near to medium term, it will still be a relatively small piece of overall PayPal volume. And secondly, in terms of our credit decisioning or underwriting, we don't expect in the medium term to really change how we think about credit decisioning in this current economic environment, i.e. we'll continue to be fairly disciplined on keeping net charge-offs relatively low and expanding risk-adjusted margins for the portfolio until we see better -- just consumer sentiment and economic environments going forward. There'll be a bigger piece, it'll be relatively small in this short to medium term, and we'll continue to be very disciplined in how we underwrite."

And so one, we're not driving one versus the other. That said, what's clearly happening is fixed price is growing more rapidly than auction as the marketplace rebalances because that format, that many business sellers choose to sell in and many consumers choose to buy in. So we don't know where it will land. Again, I think Bob said at Analyst Day, we started 30/70. That is 30% fixed, 70% auctions, and my guess is we could end up somewhere around 70/30. That varies a lot, by the way, by category. There are certain categories like collectibles, where auctions is a natural way to set a market price. And others like consumer electronics, where there's more clear pricing, an efficient market and fixed price makes sense. So the important point is we are indifferent in terms of margin, in terms of our marketplace. And then on items sold and GMV, I think it's important to just note, I think the economy is impacting ASPs. We see that on both eBay and PayPal. PayPal ASPs have been coming down off of eBay, as well as on eBay. And two, one of the things that eBay offers, I think, has been a source of -- its advantage for us is in a tough economy, where consumers are trying to get more out of what they spend, we see them trading down on eBay, which is to say instead of buying the latest model Blackberry, they're buying a brand new Blackberry that was last year's model for less. Or instead of buying a brand new bicycle, they're buying a used bicycle. And so we see actually within categories, people getting what they want but just trading down in terms of what they're buying and what they're getting for their dollars. And that way, eBay is a fairly unique marketplace in offering the ability to do that."

As I've said, it's kind of stunning, but the Merchant Services business grew 50% in Q4 in terms of TPV. And that's 10 times faster over the market in the U.S. and comparable outside the U.S., so that business is still in. I believe that's early days of the global rollout of what's a very attractive and differentiated product for merchants and for consumers. So we envision that business continuing to gain share. The core eBay business, including the ePayPal [ph] on eBay, that's the one that we've said was going to grow more slowly than the market in '09 at market growth rates in '10 and faster than in '11. And there's no silver bullet in what's driving it. That said, I'm pleased with where we are coming into 2010 and I don't know, I. love all my children, not just one. So I'll lift three things that I'm looking forward to in 2010 in the Marketplaces business. One, we're going to further extend trust by offering enhanced buyer protection, so buyers can buy absolutely, confidently and safely on eBay. Two, value and selection will continue to extend with both pricing and the continued improvement in search. You'll recall Mark Carges talking about our approach to technology and search at our Analyst Day. We are absolutely becoming a more technology-driven company and our search team is increasingly a top notch. And then lastly, I think what's going to be fun about 2010 is you're going to see some real differences in the eBay user experience. You'll see this most notably in clothing, shoes and accessories about mid-year, where the eBay experience, as you know it, will look very different. And you'll see us taking advantage of how we bring the unique inventory we have to buyers in some new and creative ways. And so again, that's on top of a technology platform we've been building under the eBay business that I think will really hit a stride in 2010 and '11. So I'm looking forward to this year, and I think it will continue to build on the momentum that we're building up."

And then, the thing that's most important for that volume growth for us is the transaction margins that we generate as a result of three related variables: One, the global take rate; secondly, the transaction expenses; third, the fraud losses. So the interaction of those three variables that drives transaction margins that we said back in March, 60% or higher over the next three years, and what we just said today that we improved Q3 to Q4 to 62%. That dynamic, what we expect to transpire over that timeframe is there's so many variables that go into global take rate that can influence it to the positive side or at just take rate alone, the negative side. For example, continued progress of expanding PayPal on eBay in Germany has a relatively low take rate. It has very low transaction expenses and very attractive transaction margins. So those variables in the portfolio, where global take rate may come down, but it's on fundamentally lower transaction expense and still generate 60% plus kind of margins. So overall, we'll continue to manage any more presence with merchants, more preference from consumers at transaction margins to take the combination of global take rate, transaction expense and fraud losses that enable us to generate 60% plus transaction margin and drive leverage from an operating expense standpoint to expand overall operating margins for the PayPal business."

And there's no doubt that the iPhone and smartphones, in general, have just illustrated to consumers all over the world the power of what a mobile device can provide. And we have been quite fortunate in both eBay and PayPal lend themselves to the mobile format well, that the engaging nature of eBay auction is something that can be really brought to a mobile device. And our best sense is our mobile commerce offering at $600 million could be half the volume in the mobile goods market thus far, so we intend to be all over it. We've released another app, the eBay deals app, and we will continue to find new and interesting, creative ways to bring our inventory to the mobile device in ways that are engaging for our consumers. How much of that will be incremental volume versus just a device shift? We don't know and, to some extent, we don't care. We view mobile as simply one more device as a way to connect buyers and sellers. And what's interesting is you don't see people necessarily starting, finishing or starting dealing and then concluding the whole shopping experience on one device or another. They may do a search at home and put it in My eBay. They may finish the transaction while standing in line in Starbucks and pay right there with PayPal or the reverse. So mobile will be an important trend. We feel we are out on our toes innovating both with eBay and PayPal on mobile. In terms of exclusive inventory, our Marketplaces seller team is out, talking with several brands and several people that have inventory. I think 2009 was the year of proving we could move high-volume SKUs in very short periods of time, and I think we've done that. And probably there certainly are growing number of people who want to talk about distributing on eBay. And in some cases, that will be exclusive, in others it won't. But we feel pleased to take advantage of this. I'll call it a private sales trend where retailers are looking to get rid of high-quality branded goods in quick and efficient ways online.

Joining me today on the call are John Donahoe, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Swan, our Chief Financial Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany Bob's commentary during the call. This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of the eBay website at investor.ebayinc.com.Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. In addition, management may make forward-looking statements relating to our future performance that are based on our current expectations, forecasts, assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected financial results for the first quarter and full year of 2010, the focus of the Payments and Marketplaces business units going forward and future growth in the Marketplaces and Payments businesses. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, the continuation or worsening of the global economic downturn; changes in political, business and economic conditions; foreign exchange rate fluctuations; the impact and integration of recent and future acquisitions; our increasing need to grow revenues from existing users and established markets; an increasingly competitive environment for our businesses; the complexity of managing an increasingly large enterprise with a broad range of businesses; our need to manage regulatory tax, IP and litigation risks, including risks specific to PayPal, Bill Me Later and the financial industry; and our need to upgrade our technology and customer service infrastructure at reasonable costs, while adding new features and maintaining site stability. You can find more information about factors that could affect our operating results in our most recent annual report on our Form 10-K and our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q also available at investor.ebayinc.com. You should not unduly rely on any forward-looking statements and we assume no obligation to update them. All information in the presentation is as of January 20, 2010 and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update this presentation. With that said, let me turn the call over to John."

Today, I'll talk about our results from both the Q4 and full year perspective. And I'll then outline our key priorities for 2010 before turning it over to Bob for more details on the quarter and our 2010 Q1 and full year guidance. Let us start by taking a quick look at our Q4 results. Revenue growth was up 16% to $2.4 billion, non-GAAP EPS was up 9% to $0.44 and we generated free cash flow of almost $600 million. In addition, we successfully completed the sale of 70% of Skype for approximately $1.9 billion. This move allows us to focus our energies on our two core businesses, Payments and Marketplaces. All in all, we had a strong Q4 with both of these core businesses accelerating sharply from the third quarter. Let's take a look at what we'd accomplished in each business unit in Q4 and for the year. PayPal posted terrific results, significantly expanding its global presence. For the first time, PayPal's total payment volume passed $20 billion in a single quarter. PayPal is truly a global business, now supporting 24 currencies and 190 markets with 81 million active accounts.  In 2009, for the first time, annual revenue and TPV from PayPal's Merchant Services business exceeded PayPal's volume on eBay. And PayPal's volume is predicated on our core fundamental strength. Merchants realize higher conversion rates when PayPal's available for payment option. By almost every measure, PayPal strengthened its competitive position in Q4. Total revenue and TPV both grew significantly year-over-year, penetration on eBay increased three points year-over-year and PayPal's Merchant Services business once again delivered very strong performance with TPV growth of 50% in Q4. And this growth is global. In the U.S., PayPal Merchant Services TPV grew at 10x the market growth rate for e-commerce, international Merchant Services TPV grew 80% year-over-year and volume from outside the U.S. now accounts for 40% of PayPal's total TPV. PayPal continues to leverage this unique global footprint by making it easy to send and receive payments across borders. In fact, cross-border trade now accounts for almost 25% of PayPal's total payment volume. And PayPal continues to drive further penetration in major markets. For example, in Japan, PayPal has signed agreements with five of the country's leading gateways representing over $14 billion in new addressable TPV.We also became the first major payment platform to open up to third-party developers, a move which will accelerate PayPal adoption and innovation. Since opening the PayPal platform in early November, more than 12,000 developers have signed up and the first payments applications have already launched. Simply put, PayPal is leveraging its advantages for merchants and consumers and rapidly expanding our global presence. PayPal is well on its way to becoming the preferred online payment provider around the world.Turning to eBay, our Q4 results demonstrate continued progress as we improve value, selection in trust and turnaround this business. Marketplace revenue grew 15% in Q4 but more important, our progress is evidenced across the three underlying metrics we're using to measure our success. Net promoter scores for both buyers and sellers are up significantly in our major markets. Sold items accelerated for the third consecutive quarter, up 11% globally year-over-year. And core GMV growth also accelerated for the third consecutive quarter. In fact, in most of our major markets, we were able to grow at or above e-commerce growth rates during Q4. Let's take a quick look at what's behind this momentum. Asia Pacific remains our fastest growing region, where GMV grew almost 50% over last year and that's before adding Gmarket, an acquisition that extends our leadership position in Korea and enhances our momentum in the region. And eBay's ability to conveniently connect buyers and sellers across borders continues to be a competitive strength. For example, exports from Chinese sellers doubled in Q4, delivering over 15 million great deals to consumers all over the world during this holiday season. In Europe, we have successfully transformed our seller value proposition and business model over the past 18 months. By offering lower insertion fees to our sellers, we have almost doubled the number of live listings, a significant increase in selection. We plan to adopt similar best practices in the U.S. in early 2010 and we are improving the fundamentals of our business, which positions us to win in the secondary market. And in fact, we are increasingly moving new types of merchandise at high velocity. In North America, we experienced early success with our fashion vault pilots with brands such as Cole Haan, DKNY, Hugo Boss and Max Mara. Popular items sold out in hours and drove strong incremental sales for our sellers. EBay is absolutely becoming a more trusted marketplace. Buyers are responding and our bestsellers are winning and we're continuing to raise the bar for our sellers. As you know, we have introduced a top-rated seller status that all buyers can see. In Q4, our top-rated sellers in the U.S. grew same-store sales by over 10% and accounted for approximately 30% of total core GMV. In Germany, our top-rated sellers grew same-store sales by 25%. And in the U.K., they grew same-store sales by 35%. Bottom line, sellers who deliver the very best experience are succeeding on eBay and buyers are benefiting. These turnaround efforts are paying off. Market share gains are evident internationally where we are further along in our turnarounds. In the U.K. for example, we posted 17% growth during the second half of 2009, significantly outperforming the market. We're also increasing innovation across eBay and becoming a more technology-driven company. One example of this is our efforts in mobile commerce, where eBay made tremendous progress over the past year. Our eBay mobile application has been downloaded almost 7 million times, making it consistently one of the top app on the iPhone. And even more important, consumers are using our mobile application, changing the way they shop and generating over $600 million in GMV on eBay during 2009, more than a 200% increase over the previous year. We'll continue to innovate mobile in 2010 and provide consumers other convenient ways to buy, sell, find and pay for the best deals on eBay with their smartphones.Turning to our adjacent e-commerce formats, StubHub had a strong quarter with Q4 ticket sales up 54% over last year. High-profile concerts and sporting events such as the World Series drove strong ticket demand and market share gains. People are increasingly shopping on StubHub for sought-after tickets at great value in a marketplace they can trust. Our Classifieds business was up 20% in 2009 as we strengthened our global footprint. We saw promising early results from initiatives in Spain, France, Germany and Italy that integrate our local classifieds offerings with the core eBay business and eBay brand. We expect these initiatives to continue to drive innovation in other markets in 2010. So overall, this was both a strong quarter and a strong year for our Marketplaces business and we feel good about our progress.Before I close, let me remind you of the three-year growth targets we laid out for our company in March of 2009. First, we said that PayPal will be the leader in online global payments, and we intend to almost double PayPal to revenues of between $4 billion and $5 billion by the end of 2011. PayPal made significant progress toward this goal during 2009. And second, in our Marketplaces business, we said we will focus and win in the secondary market and grow adjacent formats such as Classifieds. Again, we made progress towards this goal in 2009, improving our growth rates relative to the market. We plan to grow GMV with e-commerce in 2010 and grow our business faster than e-commerce in 2011. So 2009 represented an important first step toward our three-year goal and we're entering 2010 with strong momentum. And now with the sale of Skype, we're fully focused on our two core businesses, Payments and Marketplaces. We have clear priorities for both businesses in 2010. At PayPal, we will strengthen and expand our leadership position in online payments, and we'll do this by continuing to maximize PayPal's potential on eBay and rapidly growing Merchant Services through merchant acquisition and increased consumer preference as we expand our consumer footprint. And we'll continue to launch new products and accelerate innovation off of our platform in this exciting business.In our core eBay Marketplaces business, we're positioned in 2010 to make even more progress in trust, value and selection and further penetrate the secondary market. And we'll do this by offering buyers great experience as they can trust with innovative shopping experiences that deliver great value and selection, and by providing tools and pricing that align our success with our sellers. We'll continue to make eBay the most attractive opportunity available for entrepreneurial sellers, casual consumer sellers and larger sellers.So today, we're a more customer-focused and technology-driven company. We're driving significant operational efficiencies that enable us to reallocate and reinvest significant resources into our growth initiatives that directly benefit our customers. I continue to be pleased with our pace, our progress and our performance. We're committed to consistently delivering on our financial commitments, while doing what's necessary to position our business for long-term growth and leadership. And now I'll turn it over to Bob for more details on the quarter and our financial outlook."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. All growth rates mentioned in my prepared remarks represent year-over-year comparisons unless I clarify otherwise. Also, I'd like to remind you that we sold the majority of Skype on November 19, so financial results for Skype are only included up to that date.Overall, we delivered strong fourth quarter results. We outperformed on both the top and bottom lines and we increased the financial strength and flexibility of the company. We executed against our strategic priorities during the quarter. PayPal continued to gain market share as transactions in TPV growth accelerated sharply. And we completed the first phase of BML integration into the PayPal wallet. As John highlighted, Marketplaces achieved improvement in all three of the key metrics, Net Promoter Score, velocity and market share. Finally, we completed the sale of Skype, focusing our portfolio on our strategic mission of connecting buyers and sellers online. So we're pleased with the results we achieved this past quarter, particularly given the backdrop of a difficult consumer environment, both here in the U.S. and abroad, and we head into 2010 cautiously optimistic.Our combined businesses generated net revenues of $2.4 billion in the quarter, a 16% increase or 19% excluding Skype from Q4 2008 and Q4 2009. Organic revenue was up 12%, a sharp acceleration versus the third quarter. A weaker U.S. dollar increased our revenue growth by four points, and acquisitions increased revenue growth by one point. Fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.44, a 9% increase. Excluding Skype, non-GAAP EPS grew at 11%. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher volume, productivity gains and FX, partially offset by a lower take rate. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.3%, down 350 basis points driven by business mix, acquisitions and a favorable one-time item in the fourth quarter of 2008.We generated $598 million of free cash flow in the quarter or 25% of revenues. CapEx as a percentage of revenues was 7% for the quarter and 6.5% for the year. Return on invested capital was 22.2% on a trailing 12-month basis, marking the first sequential improvement since the third quarter of 2008.Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. Starting with our Payments business, PayPal had an exceptional quarter. Total revenue increased 28% to $796 million, a sharp acceleration from Q3. Total payment volume increased 34% to $21.4 billion. Geographically, TPV growth was 22% in the U.S. and 54% internationally.PayPal's Merchant Services business posted another great quarter with the number of payment transactions growing 53%. This, coupled with a slight decrease in average transaction size resulted in $12.1 billion of global TPV, representing 50% growth over last year. Merchant Services accounted for 57% of total TPV in the quarter compared to 50% in the fourth quarter last year. PayPal's transaction margin was strong improving to 62.1% in the quarter. Although global take rate was down, we were able to offset this decline with modestly lower transaction expense and a more significant improvement to transaction losses due to better fraud detection and prevention.PayPal's segment margin came in at 17.8% in the quarter, up 300 bps from Q3 and down 100 bps year-over-year. The 100 basis point drop from last year was primarily the result of an economic currency hedge and dilution from Bill Me Later, partially offset by higher transaction margin and volume-related leverage.Let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later. Bill Me Later's gross receivable balance at quarter end was $673 million. The quality of Bill Me Later receivables has improved, which reduced growth, but we continue to believe this is the right trade-off in the current economic environment. The net charge-off rate decreased slightly to 11.1% in the quarter and risk adjusted margin remains better than industry average.Now let's move to our Marketplaces business. Overall, Marketplaces achieved net revenues of $1.5 billion, a 15% increase from last year and sharp sequential improvement. Growth was driven by the acquisition of Gmarket, strength in our StubHub in Classifieds businesses and improvement on the core eBay sites. International accounted for 60% of Marketplaces revenue this quarter, up from 55% in the year ago period. We continue to be pleased with the double-digit growth we're seeing in our fixed price format. Auction format GMV declined slightly, which represented an improvement over the prior quarter. Vehicles also improved from prior quarters.Let's turn to marketing services and other, which we view as alternative formats for bringing buyers and sellers together. Our Classifieds business continued its strong trajectory with 20% revenue growth or 9% on an FX-neutral basis. Total global advertising revenue increased by 3%. Advertising revenue was negatively impacted by the placement of advertise on our eBay sites as we continued to optimize the user experience. Shopping.com, Rent [Rent.com] and other revenue was up 7% in the quarter. Just a couple of quick highlights on Marketplaces operational metrics. Velocity, our sold items grew at 11% in the quarter, excluding Gmarket, driven by geographic strength in China cross border, the U.K. and Germany. Marketplaces segment margin was 40.4% in the quarter, down 480 basis points. The main drivers include dilutions from acquisitions and increased litigation expense reserves in the fourth quarter of 2009, as well as a tough comp due to the reversal of accrued bonuses in the fourth quarter of 2008.Global take rate was 7.5% in the quarter, down 20 basis points from last year. Excluding the impact from vehicles, StubHub, currencies and Gmarket, take rate was down 40 basis points year-over-year. The decline in take rate is primarily due to a reduction in feature fees and larger discounts given to our highest-rated sellers. In the fourth quarter, sales and marketing, as a percent of revenue, was up 140 basis points due to increased investment in Merchant Services, a shift in type of spend from contract to expense and the inclusion of Gmarket. Our core Marketplaces marketing program spend for 2009 was down modestly from 2008 levels as we continue to use data and technology to improve the efficiency of our marketing.Product development was 30 basis points higher than last year, driven by continued investment in the user experience and our technology platform. G&A costs increased 160 basis points from last year, predominantly due to a tough comp from the reversal of accrued bonuses in Q4 2008 and the inclusion of Gmarket. Our provision for transaction loan losses was up 40 basis points, primarily due to our new eBay dispute resolution program and higher BML credit losses.Last March at our Analyst Day, we discussed the need for us to operate smarter and more efficiently. At that time, we laid out plans to reduce our cost structure by a cumulative $2 billion over three years. We remain on track to achieve this goal, generating more than $600 million in savings since the fourth quarter of 2008. And we've reinvested these savings into areas of customer experience, trust, marketing and technology to improve our competitive position.From a cash perspective, we generated strong free cash flow of approximately $600 million during the quarter. We received $1.9 billion in cash for the sale of 70% of Skype, and we paid off the remaining $200 million balance on our line of credit. Cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments was $5.2 billion at quarter end.We brought back $1.1 billion from overseas as a result of a business restructuring during the quarter and ended the quarter with $1 billion cash in the U.S. While the tax impact is $200 million to $225 million from the business restructuring will occur in the first quarter, it will give us additional flexibility with our U.S. cash balance.While the first half of 2009 was an extremely difficult environment to operate in, we've built momentum throughout the year. Revenue accelerated in the second half, EPS improved in the fourth quarter and we generated excellent free cash flow throughout the year. And we exited 2009 stronger than we entered it.Given that, let me turn to guidance. A year ago, in light of the cloudy economic environment, we suspended issuing full year guidance. While there's still some uncertainty in the economic outlook, we are reinstating full year guidance for 2010 due to better visibility on the economy and progress we've made in our core Marketplaces business. Our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2010 no longer consolidates Skype, as we will incorporate Skype into our financials using the equity method of accounting.For Q1 2010, we anticipate revenue of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. This represents growth of 12% to 18% excluding Skype. We anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $0.39 to $0.41, which represents growth at 8% to 13% excluding Skype. For the full year of 2010, we anticipate revenue of $8.8 billion to $9.1 billion. This represents growth of 9% to 12% excluding Skype. And we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $1.63 to $1.68, representing growth of 11% to 14%, again also excluding Skype.In summary, we're pleased with the progress we've made in 2009. We continue to focus on our key priorities. In Payments, we'll strengthen and expand our leadership position in online payments, while accelerating innovation off our platform. In Marketplaces, we'll continue to make progress in trust, value and selection, while further penetrating the secondary market. And we'll continue to become a more customer-focused and technology-driven company. We remain cautiously optimistic as we head into the new year. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions.

What we do see, however, goes back to what I said at the Analyst Day last March, which is e-commerce continues to gain share versus offline retail. And we saw that in the fourth quarter, where I think when all is said and done, e-commerce growth rates will be higher than offline retail. And I continue to believe we participate in a large and growing market, where there's going to be a lot of opportunity for multiple winners. And so I think we feel good about the market we're competing in and cautious about the economic outlook."

On the International business, one of the, I suppose, benefits we have, and particularly in Germany and to some extent the U.K., is we can clearly differentiate business sellers from consumer sellers. And so when we put in place the pricing changes we did at the end of '08, we differentiated business pricing from consumer pricing across fixed price and auctions more aggressively in Europe. And in particular, we particularly lowered insertion fees on fixed price. And as I said, what that did is that allowed a huge inflow of fixed-price items from business sellers, and it allowed consumer sellers to add their items but more on an auction format which is, I think, increasingly the better way for consumer sellers to sell on eBay. In the U.S., we don't have the luxury, if you will, of being able to mechanically differentiate consumer sellers from business sellers. And so we didn't go to quite the same extremes in our pricing here. We also have such big collection in the U.S. So I think what we'll do in 2010 is take some of the learnings that we generated outside the U.S. and apply them as appropriate and as tailored to the U.S. market. And I think we feel we've proven out some of these things outside the U.S. and they'll apply inside the U.S."

That being said, we've continued to pursue ways to get a more equal distribution of our cash geographically, provided we can do a tax efficiently. And the restructuring we did in the fourth quarter allowed us to do that to bring more of our total cash position here domestically. I would say our priority is we'll continue to maintain a conservative balance sheet. But to get us the flexibility to first be able to finance the growth of our expanding BML portfolio here domestically. And also, the capacity or the flexibility to pursue acquisitions on both internationally and domestically as they arise and materialize. So our priorities haven't really changed. I think our fourth quarter allowed us to get a more equal distribution of where our cash fits and gave us a good chunk of cash here domestically."

The sequential decline Q3 to Q4 was primarily due to a lower take rate and the impact of higher litigation expenses. If I roll the clock forward in terms of implied margins in our 2010 guidance, we have essentially implied, as I indicated to Mark, that margins overall will go up modestly from 2009 to 2010 and within our Marketplaces business that'd be relatively stable. We'll continue to absorb the impact of lower take rate changes that we did in Q4, which will impact the full year of 2010, but we'll fund those by continuing to operate smarter in all the different components of our costs in the core business."

First, on Gmarket. As you know, Scott, we closed the transaction in June. The objective of the combination was to consolidate our leading position in Korea to continue to operate two different platforms by generating significant synergies from the integration, the back office functions. I'd say our team in Korea, both the Gmarket team and the ISC team have made tremendous progress on essentially all fronts in a relatively short period of time. So we feel very good about the back office integration, the inherent synergies. Secondly, the combined business gaining market share in Korea while continuing to operate two different front offices, if you will, or platforms. On Bill Me Later, we're just over a year into the combination. Just to refresh your memory, the intention was to take the, number one, PayPal and the number two, alternative online Payments businesses with very complementary skills and put them together, leveraging the complements. Bill Me Later, with a very strong large merchant presence; PayPal with a very strong, small sole proprietor SMB kind of presence. And with a combination of the product, the platform and the sales force that we would be able to increase our presence with large and small merchants to offer our consumers more choices at relatively low-cost transaction expense as we monetize both merchants and consumers. One year in, we feel very good about the continued presence with merchants here domestically and you saw those reflected really in the accelerating TPV for PayPal during the course of the second half of the year. We just launched the product integration or Bill Me Later and the PayPal wallet in the fourth quarter and we feel good about kind of the trajectory. We got another product launch early in 2010 and we feel pretty good about the combination of the two platforms. So all in all, we've invested quite a bit and strengthened our Asian presence with Gmarket in expanding our reach of the PayPal business with Bill Me Later and six and 12 months in respectively, we feel really good about our positioning."

On take rate, I appreciate the way you asked the question because people tend to focus quarter-to-quarter, and the way we really think about take rate is stepping back. And I'll remind you that it was only 24 months ago when I first took over in this role. We had one take rate applied to all categories in all geographies across all sellers around the world. And the structure of that take rate really hadn't changed since the beginning of eBay. And so we set out on what we knew was going to be a three- to four-year process to make changes in our take rate that would better align ourselves with our sellers and make a robust marketplace. And so we have really focused on three things during that time. One, we've gone to category-based pricing which makes sense. Two, we've made significant changes in rebalancing front-end versus back-end fees which is to say we were probably 70-30 front end to back end at the beginning of '08. And today going into 2010, we're more 30-70, 30% front end and 70% back end. And what that really means is we have aligned our incentives with that of our sellers. If they don't succeed in selling, we don't succeed in collecting fees. And then the last thing we've done is we have incented our sellers such as the sellers that give the best service to buyers get the lowest rates on eBay. And so I'd say we're kind of two-thirds of the way through. We put some things in Q4 which took a further step in that direction, and we'll make a few more changes in '09 that I think have to do with taking the learnings from Europe and applying them in the U.S. about rebalancing. But I feel good that coming out of 2010, we will have the structure and alignment of our pricing in the marketplace that's aligned with sellers and optimized for marketplace success."

Obviously, our intention with the integration of Bill Me Later into the PayPal wallet in the future and view item products flows. The intention is to give consumer choice. And with that choice, we believe that with the unique Bill Me Later offering that they will increasingly choose Bill Me Later as a way to settle their online payments and Bill Me Later will grow as a percentage of PayPal volume. That being said, in the near to medium term it will still be a relatively small piece of overall PayPal volume. And secondly, in terms of our credit decisioning or underwriting, we don't expect in the medium term to really change how we think about credit decisioning in this current economic environment, i.e. we'll continue to be fairly disciplined on keeping net charge-offs relatively low and expanding risk-adjusted margins for the portfolio until we see better -- just consumer sentiment and economic environments going forward. It'll be a bigger piece, it'll be relatively small in this short to medium term and we'll continue to be very disciplined in how we underwrite."

And so one, we're not driving one versus the other. That said, what's clearly happening is fixed price is growing more rapidly than auction as the marketplace rebalances because that format, that many business sellers choose to sell in and many consumers choose to buy in. So we don't know where it will land. Again, I think Bob said at Analyst Day, we started 30-70. That is 30% fixed, 70% auctions, and my guess is we could end up somewhere around 70-30. That varies a lot, by the way, by category. There are certain categories like collectibles, where auctions is a natural way to set a market price. And others like consumer electronics, where there's more clear pricing, an efficient market and fixed price makes sense. So the important point is we are indifferent in terms of margin, in terms of our marketplace. And then on items sold and GMV, I think it's important to just note, I think the economy is impacting ASPs. We see that on both eBay and PayPal. PayPal ASPs have been coming down off of eBay, as well as on eBay. And two, one of the things that eBay offers, I think, has been a source of -- its advantage for us is in a tough economy, where consumers are trying to get more out of what they spend, we see them trading down on eBay, which is to say instead of buying the latest model Blackberry, they're buying a brand new Blackberry that was last year's model for less. Or instead of buying a brand new bicycle, they're buying a used bicycle. And so we see actually within categories, people getting what they want but just trading down in terms of what they're buying and what they're getting for their dollars. And that way, eBay is a fairly unique marketplace in offering the ability to do that."

As I've said, it's kind of stunning, but the Merchant Services business grew 50% in Q4 in terms of TPV. And that's 10 times faster over the market in the U.S. and comparable outside the U.S., so that business is still in. I believe that's early days of the global rollout of what's a very attractive and differentiated product for merchants and for consumers. So we envision that business continuing to gain share. The core eBay business, including the ePayPal [ph] on eBay, that's the one that we've said was going to grow more slowly than the market in '09 at market growth rates in '10 and faster than in '11. And there's no silver bullet in what's driving it. That said, I'm pleased with where we are coming into 2010 and I don't know, I. love all my children, not just one. So I'll lift three things that I'm looking forward to in 2010 in the Marketplaces business. One, we're going to further extend trust by offering enhanced buyer protection, so buyers can buy absolutely, confidently and safely on eBay. Two, value and selection will continue to extend with both pricing and the continued improvement in search. You'll recall Mark Carges talking about our approach to technology and search at our Analyst Day. We are absolutely becoming a more technology-driven company and our search team is increasingly a top notch. And then lastly, I think what's going to be fun about 2010 is you're going to see some real differences in the eBay user experience. You'll see this most notably in clothing, shoes and accessories about mid-year, where the eBay experience, as you know it, will look very different. And you'll see us taking advantage of how we bring the unique inventory we have to buyers in some new and creative ways. And so again, that's on top of a technology platform we've been building under the eBay business that I think will really hit a stride in 2010 and '11. So I'm looking forward to this year, and I think it will continue to build on the momentum that we're building up."

And then, the thing that's most important for that volume growth for us is the transaction margins that we generate as a result of three related variables: One, the global take rate; secondly, the transaction expenses; third, the fraud losses. So the interaction of those three variables that drives transaction margins that we said back in March, 60% or higher over the next three years, and what we just said today that we improved Q3 to Q4 to 62%. That dynamic, what we expect to transpire over that timeframe is there's so many variables that go into global take rate that can influence it to the positive side or at just take rate alone, the negative side. For example, continued progress of expanding PayPal on eBay in Germany has a relatively low take rate. It has very low transaction expenses and very attractive transaction margins. So those variables in the portfolio, where global take rate may come down, but it's on fundamentally lower transaction expense and still generate 60% plus kind of margins. So overall, we'll continue to manage any more presence with merchants, more preference from consumers at transaction margins to take the combination of global take rate, transaction expense and fraud losses that enable us to generate 60% plus transaction margin and drive leverage from an operating expense standpoint to expand overall operating margins for the PayPal business."

And there's no doubt that the iPhone and smartphones, in general, have just illustrated to consumers all over the world the power of what a mobile device can provide. And we have been quite fortunate in both eBay and PayPal lend themselves to the mobile format well, that the engaging nature of eBay auction is something that can be really brought to a mobile device. And our best sense is our mobile commerce offering at $600 million could be half the volume in the mobile goods market thus far, so we intend to be all over it. We've released another app, the eBay deals app, and we will continue to find new and interesting, creative ways to bring our inventory to the mobile device in ways that are engaging for our consumers. How much of that will be incremental volume versus just a device shift? We don't know and, to some extent, we don't care. We view mobile as simply one more device as a way to connect buyers and sellers. And what's interesting is you don't see people necessarily starting, finishing or starting dealing and then concluding the whole shopping experience on one device or another. They may do a search at home and put it in My eBay. They may finish the transaction while standing in line in Starbucks and pay right there with PayPal or the reverse. So mobile will be an important trend. We feel we are out on our toes innovating both with eBay and PayPal on mobile. In terms of exclusive inventory, our Marketplaces seller team is out, talking with several brands and several people that have inventory. I think 2009 was the year of proving we could move high-volume SKUs in very short periods of time, and I think we've done that. And probably there certainly are growing number of people who want to talk about distributing on eBay. And in some cases, that will be exclusive, in others it won't. But we feel pleased to take advantage of this. I'll call it a private sales trend where retailers are looking to get rid of high-quality branded goods in quick and efficient ways online.

Today, I'll talk about our results and our continued progress toward achieving our three-year growth objectives. Bob will then provide more details on the quarter and our guidance before we take questions. 
I'll start by providing context. Last year, we set out clear three-year growth and profitability goals for 2009 to 2011, goals to strengthen our position in our two core businesses, eBay and PayPal, and to achieve strong financial performance. We're achieving these goals by focusing our company on three themes. First, we're becoming a more customer-focused company. We're driving improvements to our user experience, and we're measuring our success with three customer-oriented metrics: Net promoter score, velocity and market share. And I’ve tied a portion of our leadership compensation to customer satisfaction. 
Second, we're becoming a more technology-driven company, and we're increasing our commitment to innovation. This is evident with the opening of the PayPal platform, which is driving payments innovation, and it’s demonstrated in mobile, which is experiencing widespread adoption in driving significant e-commerce and payment volume. We've made good strides with our technology innovation, and we're just getting started.
And third, we're committed to operating more efficiently, by taking $2 billion out of our cost structure over the three-year period and reinvesting it in our highest-growth priorities. 
Our first quarter results reflect another strong step toward our goals. Revenue was up 18% and non-GAAP EPS was up 15% on an apples-to-apples basis, taking Skype out. We are off to a good start in 2010. 
Now let's take a brief look about what we accomplished in each business unit. With PayPal, we're well on our way to turning PayPal into the leader in online global payments. Approximately 8 million merchants worldwide accept PayPal, benefiting from the higher conversion rates that PayPal delivers, with more than 84 million active registered accounts using 24 currencies across 190 countries. 
And PayPal had another exceptional quarter, posting record Q1 results and strengthening our global competitive position. PayPal's deepened penetration on eBay, gained global market share, signed a significant deal with China UnionPay and drove mobile payments innovation. Thousands of developers are using PayPal's open platform, which has already generated $30 million in TPV. 
And PayPal is now a convenient and easy-to-use payments choice for Facebook users and advertisers. Across e-commerce, PayPal is gaining share. Merchant Services payment volume grew 49% in Q1, and total payment volume exceeded $21 billion. Nearly 60% of PayPal's total TPV now comes from Merchant Services. 
PayPal signed a number of deals in Q1 that expand its global footprint and help merchants reach more customers. For example, 1.3 billion Chinese consumers will soon be able to use PayPal to shop worldwide, funding payments from their China UnionPay cards. As part of our strategy to more closely partner with banks around the world, PayPal also announced agreements with Singapore's largest bank, DBS, and with First National Bank in South Africa. Both agreements give consumers in those markets a fast and easy way to use PayPal online. 
PayPal is also leading in mobile payments, generating in Q1 almost the same payment volume that was created through our mobile applications in all of 2009. PayPal's newest mobile app for iPhone, launched in March, was downloaded more than 1 million times in less than three weeks. And with PayPal Mobile, iPhone users can quickly bump payments to each other, easily split checks at restaurants and send and receive money from their friends and family while on the go. 
In addition, our business continues to benefit from the combination of Bill Me Later and PayPal. We've been testing a new accrual process that uses PayPal's extensive data in addition to credit bureau data. This new process allows us to extend BML to a wider set of customers, giving consumers increased purchasing power and driving incremental sales to our merchants. We're already seeing promising results from the integration of BML in the PayPal wallet, and we plan to integrate BML more seamlessly into the eBay marketplace in the coming months. 
Now turning to eBay, we’re in the midst of a multi-year turnaround, positioning eBay to win in the secondary market. We believe we're uniquely positioned to capture growth opportunities for sellers in the secondary market and provide tremendous value and selection for buyers on new, used and vintage goods. The launch of our new fashion category, as well as eBay buyer protection and our innovative eBay mobile apps for the iPhone and iPad, reflect our efforts in Q1 and demonstrate eBay's potential as the e-commerce landscape continues to evolve. 
Our Q1 results show the steady progress we're making against our turnaround priorities. Marketplace revenue grew 13%, and the key underlying metrics continued to improve with our focus on trust, value and selection. Net promoter scores were up for key segments, such as Top in Active Buyers and Top in Hobby Sellers. Sold items in the U.S. and U.K. and core GMV in the U.S. accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. And our Korean business also performed well as we successfully integrate key market in IAC. 
Our most-trusted sellers continue to win on eBay. Top-rated sellers generated about 31% of core GMV in the U.S., and same-store sales for top-rated sellers accelerated three points to 13% in the U.S., outpacing e-commerce. We also announced a number of changes in Q1 to make eBay pricing more competitive for sellers and improve the eBay experience for buyers. It's too early to assess the impact of these changes since most just went live in the past couple of weeks, but we continue to align our success with that of eBay sellers by dramatically lowering and even eliminating the upfront costs of selling on eBay, and we believe these changes in the U.S. will have the same positive impact that we've seen in Europe. 
For buyers, we've implemented eBay Buyer Protection in the U.S. and UK, a big step in making sure buyers can shop eBay with confidence. EBay Buyer Protection adds a new level of customer support and trust to the world's largest online marketplace. Through eBay Buyer Protection, buyers have access to customer support specialists seven days a week and will cover the buyer's purchase price and original shipping for most purchases should a problem arise and the seller be unable to resolve the issue. EBay Buyer Protection, along with our Vehicle and Business Equipment Protection programs, covers almost every item purchased on eBay. 
EBay's newly launched fashion category illustrates how we're delivering better experiences for buyers and servicing in more compelling ways the deep inventory that eBay sellers offer. The fashion tab and category on eBay delivers a dramatically different eBay shopping experience, offering the convenience of visual search and features that’ll help buyers more easily find items they want. We introduced Fashion Outlet in the U.K. and Germany and launched Fashion Vault in the U.S., which was successfully piloted in the fourth quarter. And we're pleased with the progress we’re making in positioning eBay as the fashion destination offering great value and selection from top brands, retailers, designers and other sellers. So we're starting from a strong position as the number-one clothing site, based on sales and traffic, and we begin to expect traction from these initiatives in Q2 and beyond. In fact, we expect to generate more than $5 billion in GMV [gross merchandise volume] from clothing, shoes and accessories. 
Mobile continues to be a focus of innovation for eBay, and our mobile apps are driving strong demand. Our main eBay shopping app has been downloaded more than 8.5 million times and we expect our mobile apps to generate $1.5 billion in gross merchandise volume in 2010. That's 2.5x our volume last year. And in the first quarter, we offered and introduced more apps, offering more ways to buy and sell on eBay. Our new eBay selling app lets sellers conveniently list an item from their iPhone in less than 60 seconds. And we launched a new eBay app for the iPad that delivers a more visual and easy-to-shop mobile experience in what the New York Times called the best shopping experience on the Web. 
Turning to our adjacent e-commerce formats, our Classifieds business was up 14% in Q1, with strong growth in Canada, the U.K. and Denmark. At the end of Q1, we also announced eBay Classifieds in the U.S., re-launching our Kijiji platform with major enhancements that create industry-leading standards in trust, safety, consumer service and user experience. We also introduced the eBay Classifieds mobile app for the iPhone, making it easy to photograph and list items in less than a minute and search for items in your local community. StubHub also had a solid quarter, as ticket demand for professional and college sporting events, such as the Super Bowl and March Madness, was strong. StubHub continues to gain momentum as the tickets marketplace that offers the most choice and availability. 
So in summary, 2010 is off to a strong start, as we continue to strengthen our core e-commerce business and aggressively grow payments. We accomplished a great deal in the first quarter, building on our 2009 momentum. And we're performing well against our three-year goals. I am pleased with how we're strengthening the fundamentals of our business, enhancing our competitive advantages and focusing on our customers and driving innovation. Now I'll turn it over to Bob for more details on the quarter and our financial outlook."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. All growth rates mentioned in my prepared remarks represent year-over-year comparisons, unless I clarify otherwise. 
Overall, we delivered strong first quarter results. We came in at the high end of expectations on the top line and above expectations on the bottom line, while we increased the financial strength of the company. We continued to execute against our strategic priorities during the quarter. PayPal gained market share off of eBay and increased penetration on eBay, as total TPV growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. And the Marketplaces turnaround remains on track, as growth and velocity for the number of sold items accelerated for the fourth quarter in a row.
We're pleased with the results we achieved this past quarter, which gives us a good head start on our full-year objectives. We're maintaining full-year guidance, as the strong trends at PayPal and the improvement from the turnaround at eBay Marketplaces will be offset by headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar. 
Our combined businesses generated net revenues of $2.2 billion in the first quarter, a 9% increase, or 18% excluding Skype, from Q1 '09. FX increased growth by three points and our acquisition of Gmarket increased growth by four points, resulting in organic revenue growth of 11%. First quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.42, an 8% increase, or 15% excluding Skype. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to productivity gains, which we reinvested in a lower take rate, and this in turn helped achieve higher sales volume. 
We also recognized a one-time benefit of approximately $0.01 in the quarter related to the early repayment of Skype notes to us. Also worth noting, relative to guidance, the strength of the U.S. dollar cost us $0.01 of EPS in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 30.6%, roughly flat with the year-ago period. We generated $266 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Cash flow was reduced by a one-time tax payment of approximately $200 million related to a fourth quarter 2009 business restructuring, which allowed us to move $1.1 billion in cash to the U.S. from overseas. It was also reduced by a higher employee bonus payment versus the historical norm of approximately $50 million related to a change in the timing of bonus payments. CapEx as a percentage of revenues was 7% for the quarter. Return on invested capital was 22.5% on a trailing 12-month basis, the second consecutive quarter of improvement. Earnings growth, coupled with lower invested capital as a result of the sale of 70% of Skype, drove the improvement. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. Starting with our Payments business, PayPal posted another great quarter. Total revenue increased 26% to $809 million. Total payment volume increased 35% to $21.3 billion. Geographically, TPV growth was 25% in the U.S. and 52% internationally. Today, as John indicated, we operate in 190 countries and 24 currencies as we continue to expand PayPal's global footprint. In the first quarter, we generated 40% of our TPV outside the U.S., compared to 35% in the first quarter of 2009. 
PayPal's Merchant Services business had another stellar quarter, driven by an increase in the number of merchants who accept PayPal, the number of active accounts and an increase in our share of checkout. Merchant Services TPV grew 49% in the quarter and now accounts for 3/5 of PayPal's total TPV. On the eBay platform, PayPal's TPV growth accelerated to 18%, the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement, driven by strong GMV growth and 68% penetration from addressable GMV, a 420 basis-point increase. 
PayPal transaction margin was also strong, increasing to 63.5% in the quarter. Although global take rate was down modestly, we were able to offset this decline with lower transaction expense and a significant improvement in transaction losses, which was primarily a function of better fraud detection and prevention. PayPal segment margins came in at 22.6% in Q1, up 480 basis points from Q4 and 520 basis points year-over-year. The increase from last year was primarily the result of higher transaction margins, helped by some one-time benefits, operating leverage on volume, transferring much of the cost of the eBay buyer protection program to Marketplaces and improvement at Bill Me Later. 
Let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later. Bill Me Later's gross receivable balance at quarter end was $641 million. The quality of BML receivables has continued to improve, which has resulted in reduced growth, but we believe this is the right trade-off for the current economic environment. We’ve begun using eBay Inc. data to help reduce the customer decline rate without taking on additional risks. BML's net charge-off rate decreased to 9.5% in the quarter from 11.1% in Q4, resulting in a risk-adjusted margin of 11.5%, a 120 basis-point sequential improvement. 
Now let's move to our Marketplaces business. Overall, Marketplaces achieved net revenues of $1.4 billion, a 13% increase. Marketplaces generated 60% of its revenue internationally this quarter, up from 54% in Q1 2009. We continue to be pleased with the strong double-digit growth we're seeing in our fixed-price format, with fixed price now accounting for more than 60% of GMV, excluding Vehicles. On an FX neutral basis, GMV in our fixed-price format grew at 33%, while the auction format declined 3% and vehicles was down 7%. 
Beyond transaction revenue, we connect buyers and sellers through alternative formats, which are becoming increasingly important to the marketplaces. Marketing services now represents 15% of Marketplaces revenue and grew 12% in the quarter. Our Classifieds business continued its strong trajectory, with 14% growth due to strength in Canada, U.K. and Denmark. Total global advertising revenue increased by 12%, driven by strong growth in ad commerce, our internally developed CPC-based advertising solution for sellers, as well as higher revenue per click on our search advertising. 
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces operational metrics. Active users accelerated in our three largest markets. However, globally, this was offset by weakness in some of our smaller European markets. Sold items, excluding Gmarket, accelerated for the fourth straight quarter to 13%, geographically driven by strength in the U.K., cross-border trade out of China and the U.S. Marketplaces segment margin was 42% in the quarter, down 310 bps from a year ago but in line with our full-year guidance. The main drivers of the year-over-year change include savings from operational excellence initiatives, which we then reinvested into a lower take rate, and new buyer protection programs, as well as the inclusion of Gmarket, which we acquired in June of last year. 
Global take rate was 7.6% in the quarter, down 41 bps from last year or down 49 bps excluding vehicles, StubHub and Gmarket. The decline is primarily due to a reduction in feature fees, an increase in buyer incentives and discounts given to our highest-rated sellers. 
Turning to operating expenses, in Q1, sales and marketing was 19% of revenue, up 70 bps from last year, primarily due to the acquisition of Gmarket and the divestiture of Skype. Product development was 8.3%, down 20 bps, as productivity gains and acquisitions more than offset the negative impact of the Skype divestiture. G&A cost was 10.7%, a decrease of 70 bps, predominantly due to operating leverage. And our provision for transaction and loan losses was 4.8%, up 80 bps, primarily due to our new eBay Buyer Protection program and PayPal's newly enhanced off-eBay protection program. 
From a cash perspective, we generated free cash flow of $266 million during the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, cash flow was reduced by a one-time tax payment of approximately $200 million and changes in bonus payment, compared to last year’s. Cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments totaled $5.4 billion at quarter end. Of this, we held approximately $1.1 billion in the U.S. 
Now let me turn to guidance. For Q2, we anticipate revenue of $2.15 billion to $2.2 billion. This represents growth from 11% to 14%, excluding Skype. We anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $0.37 to $0.39, which represents growth of 9% to 15%, excluding Skype. As I mentioned earlier, we're maintaining full-year guidance. Despite strength from PayPal and improvements from the Marketplaces turnaround, these positives will essentially be offset by a stronger U.S. dollar compared to where we were three months ago. For the full-year 2010, we continue to project revenues of $8.8 billion to $9.1 billion, representing growth of 9% to 12%, excluding Skype, and we continue to anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $1.63 to $1.68, representing growth of 11% to 14%, also excluding Skype. 
In summary, as John mentioned, we commuted our three-year growth and profitability goals in early 2009. Since that time, first, we have a stronger and more focused portfolio. We divested the majority of Skype, and we acquired Gmarket. We completed the integration of Bill Me Later and the PayPal wallet. And we have a stronger balance sheet. Secondly, we exceeded our expectations in 2009, and growth accelerated in the second half of the year. And last, we’re off to a good start in 2010. Despite headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar, we’re well-positioned to deliver on our full-year guidance. And now, we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

I think we do expect take rate to come down more during the course of the year, but to put it into context, the way we try to think about the business is more looking at transaction margins, which were a function of, obviously, take rate, secondly, transaction expenses and third, fraud losses. And the reason we do it that way is simply in some geographies, take rates may be lower, but transaction expenses may be lower as well. And particularly as we grow outside of the U.S., we do have lower take rates outside of the U.S., and as you know from our results, the growth rates internationally have been very strong. So we do expect global take rate to come down, but we also expect transaction margins to stay above 60%. In terms of one-timers in the quarter in PayPal's variable cost, yes, there was probably about 1.5 to 2 points of margin benefit from PayPal, due to some one-timers flowing through transaction expense and fraud losses. So while margins accelerated 500 bps year-over-year, it's probably -- 3 bps is more sustainable improvement on a year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter basis."

Usually, those issues get resolved with sellers but if not, we give them their money back plus shipping, and we’ve gotten very good feedback on that. Similarly, you see the clothing, shoes and accessories launch of a couple of weeks ago, and that's really the first tailored vertical shopping experience that's built on our platform. And I think you see it's a way that really brings eBay's inventory to life in a very different way for buyers and allows them to access eBay's inventory in easier and more engaging ways. So these are just the first two of what I think will be a series of buyer-related improvements you'll see over this coming year. And as I’ve said all the way along, I want to make sure that our experience gets to the point where buyers can confidently know and see they are experiencing something differently, and we will at that stage really amp up our marketing. To be clear, we're spending the same amount of marketing this year thus far as we did last year, and we'll continue to do that. But I want to keep making the steady progress we are. Our buyer metrics are improving, our customer retention’s improving, and one quarter at a time toward this three-year goal."

And then for the smaller business seller, the people that sell a lot of volume on eBay, we are incenting them to sell in the fixed-price format, making that in essence free or quite low-priced to list in the fixed-price format. Again, they only pay if it sells. And as you know, auctions are sorted by time ending soonest. Fixed price is sorted or searched by in essence, relevance, and best match. And what we found in Europe is that allowed both groups of sellers to list in their most natural format and allow the richness of inventory to come up more clear, pop better for buyers. And we saw an improvement in sold items, an improvement in GMV. And so we anticipate the same reaction in the United States as this plays out over the remainder of the year. The other thing that happens as part of that is we no longer have the store inventory format, and so that the fixed-price items are now all in sort of core search, and what we've proven in Europe is that our search engine can take that. So these are things that we're proving out in Europe, and it’ll take time to sort of work their way into initially our listings and then into the demand.

On the Marketplace changes, what we've done is we've bunched those into two releases, which makes it easier for sellers. Our sellers like the advance warning and like to know that they can really make two sets of changes a year. We intended to make those in March and in September and announce them 60 to 90 days ahead of time. So we'll have a second wave of changes this year. And again, this is a year where you’re going see a lot of the foundational work that we did in 2008 and 2009 begin to flow through to things that buyers can touch and feel, things like the vertical shopping experience in clothing, shoes and accessories; things like equipment and auto parts, which is in essence -- significantly simplifies selling in that category for eBay; and things like eBay Buyer Protection. So more things like that you’ll see in the next release. And then with respect to Asia, Bob and I were in Asia last week, in fact, visiting with the PayPal team and, man, there is just really, really impressive growth, frankly in both the eBay and PayPal businesses in Asia, as cross-border continues to be quite strong in that market. And then what PayPal has done, that I mentioned earlier in my remarks, is signed some deals with financial services, entities that give us access to local Asian customers that may not be on eBay. So the China UnionPay deal allows us access to 1.3 billion Chinese consumers, China UnionPay, by the way, has a total of 2.1 billion overall cardholders. So now, it's easier for them to open a PayPal account and fund it with that. We signed deals in Singapore and in South Africa, which again allow local consumers in those markets to access PayPal more readily. And we're doing some interesting things in the mobile front. On guidance, I'm going to let Bob -- in Japan, we’ve signed deals with several of the largest payments gateways, which give us access to both Japanese merchants, and then we're talking with a couple of Japanese financial services concerns about doing the same thing to access Japanese consumers. So I think a lot of growth opportunity. And your question on guidance, I'm going to give Bob a chance to come in on guidance, which I know some people are curious about."

And as John indicated, we have a fantastic cross-border business there and a great domestic business in Australia, but the moves that we've been making since really early last year have been about building domestic presence over there. So we have a reasonable-size business today, it's been growing extensively, and it will continue to grow this year and all the costs to go along with it are reflected in the guidance that we've given. Relative to the more macro question on guidance that maybe you didn't ask, but I'll comment anyways, because I gave some words in the script, and maybe I want to put some numbers to it to make sure you have the context for how we're thinking about the full year. And I'll give you maybe this simple version. We came into the year with earnings projected to be $1.63 to $1.68, and I gave some words about how we're thinking about the rest of the year and how we get back to our full-year guidance. So maybe I could put some numbers to them. First, the negatives. As you know, we are a global business, with more than half of our revenues from offshore, a couple billion dollars in revenue exposed to the euro, $1 billion of revenue exposed to the pound, and the implications of how currencies have changed, in particular the strengthening of the dollar in the last 90 days, will cost us approximately $125 million in revenue and $0.05 in EPS, relative to where we were 90 days ago. Secondly, our tax rate is going to be a little bit higher this year than what we thought, and the reason is because our U.S. business is going to be stronger. And that higher tax rate will likely cost us a couple cents relative to where we were 90 days ago. So that's $0.07 down. We maintained our guidance for the full year, and it's because of two things. One, PayPal will grow faster than we expected a few months ago, and its margins will be higher. And we're increasingly confident 90 days later about the changes that we're making in the Marketplace business. So as we think about our full-year guidance for eBay Inc., not maybe the cost in the Asian business and PayPal, we will be down $0.07 because the currency and tax rate will be up $0.07 because of good operational performance in the PayPal business and continued progress in the core eBay business as well."

And that's simply because payments is a large and competitive space, and there are lots of people who participate in one form or another. And rather than comment on any specific announcement or competitor, let me just say this. We continuously closely monitor the competitive landscape and feel confident about our position and our competitive advantages and feel more confident about those as the days go on. We've got this combination of scale and fee. And we primarily look at what customers want, actually we look at it more from a customer perspective than a competitor landscape, and what you see from the PayPal numbers is our customers like what we’re doing. And the specific things I think we have that are unique are we have direct relationships with both consumers and merchants. We don't have to work through issuing banks or acquiring banks. And so we’ve got 80 million active consumers and 8 million merchants, and so as you said, I think there are additional opportunities to add merchants following this acquisition, and we'll certainly get very aggressive to be adding those. But it’s that kind of direct relationship that gives us the data that allows us to do the risk detection and fraud prevention that we do, and that combined with our technology platform, allows us to innovate more rapidly. What we've done with our platform, opening of our platform, which no other payments platform in the world has done; what we're doing in mobile, where there are a lot of people talking about it, we've already launched two apps and really did more volume in Q1 than we did all last year in mobile payments. In digital goods, we're pushing forward. So I think you're going to see lots of different movements in the broader e-commerce competitive space. We're staying very focused on our consumers and feel very good about the combination of scale and speed that we bring to being the leader in online global payments."

There continues to be strong synergies between eBay and PayPal. You saw that in the increased penetration PayPal’s had on eBay. It’s up, I think, from a 300 or 400 basis points year-over-year. eBay continues to provide a significant number of new users for PayPal, in essence for free, and eBay Inc.'s balance sheet allows us to invest in PayPal's business and make investments like Bill Me Later that further its position. So as long as those synergies are there, we're going to try to fully capitalize on them and believe it's the best thing to do for our customers and investors. And then on eBay Buyer Protection, this is a nice capstone of stuff we’ve been working on for the last 12 to 18 months, where we've materially reduced bad buyer experiences. We've increased trust on the site. We’ve put in place from a -- we were at standing start. We had no phone coverage for buyers 12 months ago and we now have in essence full phone coverage for buyers in both the U.S. and the U.K. And what this allows us to do with confidence is to say, “Buy in eBay, and you're covered.” Almost no questions asked. And what our research says is even though buyers are seeing better experiences, this kind of guarantee is going to give them that real sense of confidence they can buy with confidence. And the early feedback we're getting from consumers in the U.S. and U.K. mentioned that. It does result in a shifting a little bit of costs from payout from eBay, payout of losses from, I’m sorry, from PayPal to eBay, but overall, net-net, we don't see that as a major reason. It raises one margin slightly, lowers another. We’re confident enough that we don't have -- seeing it having a material impact on the company overall, financially, that is. But we do hope it has a material impact on our consumers."

This is where the testing and learning and how we approach many of these changes make sense. So we started off a year ago by saying -- we were certain people just wanted their money back instantly. And so when we first piloted this Buyer Protection, we did it just for the top buyers in the U.S. And they’d call, and we’d give them their money back instantly. And what we found was that's not what they wanted. They said, “You know what? I just want the item.” So we started intermediating with the sellers more aggressively and helping connect the buyer with the seller in the after- transaction, and we found that in 70% to 80% of the cases, they got it resolved within 24 to 48 hours, and the buyer was happy. They preferred that from getting their money back. So what that has enabled us to do is to scale this in a way that’s far more aggressive, because what it’s in essence doing is connecting the buyer and seller in a post-transaction to make sure that they resolve the transaction in a satisfactory manner. And then at any time that the buyer would just rather get their money back, we provide it. But it was fascinating learning to find that in most cases, they just want to get their item, and they want to get their item in a timely and accurate basis. And in 80% of the submissions, or the claim filings, that's was in essence happening. And that's why that number, Bob’s number of $8 million, which sounds small, it’s because for every 10 calls that come, eight of them are getting resolved between buyer and seller."

Today, I'll talk about our results and our continued progress toward achieving our three-year growth objectives.

Today, I'll talk about our results and our continued progress toward achieving our three-year growth objectives. Bob will then provide more details on the quarter and our guidance before we take questions. 
I'll start by providing context. Last year, we set out clear three-year growth and profitability goals for 2009 to 2011, goals to strengthen our position in our two core businesses, eBay and PayPal, and to achieve strong financial performance. We're achieving these goals by focusing our company on three themes. First, we're becoming a more customer-focused company. We're driving improvements to our user experience, and we're measuring our success with three customer-oriented metrics: Net Promoter Score, velocity and market share. And I’ve tied a portion of our leadership compensation to customer satisfaction. 
Second, we're becoming a more technology-driven company, and we're increasing our commitment to innovation. This is evident with the opening of the PayPal platform, which is driving payments innovation, and it’s demonstrated in mobile, which is experiencing widespread adoption in driving significant e-commerce and payment volume. We've made good strides with our technology innovation, and we're just getting started. And third, we're committed to operating more efficiently by taking $2 billion out of our cost structure over the three-year period and reinvesting it in our highest-growth priorities. 
Our first quarter results reflect another strong step toward our goals. Revenue was up 18% and non-GAAP EPS was up 15% on an apples-to-apples basis, taking Skype out. We're off to a good start in 2010. 
Now let's take a brief look about what we accomplished in each business unit. With PayPal, we're well on our way to turning PayPal into the leader in online global payments. Approximately 8 million merchants worldwide accept PayPal, benefiting from the higher conversion rates that PayPal delivers, with more than 84 million active registered accounts using 24 currencies across 190 countries. 
And PayPal had another exceptional quarter, posting record Q1 results and strengthening our global competitive position. PayPal's deepened penetration on eBay, gained global market share, signed a significant deal with China UnionPay and drove mobile payments innovation. Thousands of developers are using PayPal's open platform, which has already generated $30 million in TPV. And PayPal is now a convenient and easy-to-use payments choice for Facebook users and advertisers. Across e-commerce, PayPal is gaining share. Merchant Services payment volume grew 49% in Q1 and total payment volume exceeded $21 billion. Nearly 60% of PayPal's total TPV now comes from Merchant Services. 
PayPal signed a number of deals in Q1 that expand its global footprint and help merchants reach more customers. For example, 1.3 billion Chinese consumers will soon be able to use PayPal to shop worldwide, funding payments from their China UnionPay cards. As part of our strategy to more closely partner with banks around the world, PayPal also announced agreements with Singapore's largest bank, DBS, and with First National Bank in South Africa. Both agreements give consumers in those markets a fast and easy way to use PayPal online. 
PayPal is also leading in mobile payments, generating in Q1 almost the same payment volume that was created through our mobile applications in all of 2009. PayPal's newest mobile app for iPhone, launched in March, was downloaded more than 1 million times in less than three weeks. And with PayPal Mobile, iPhone users can quickly bump payments to each other, easily split checks at restaurants and send and receive money from their friends and family while on the go. 
In addition, our business continues to benefit from the combination of Bill Me Later and PayPal. We've been testing a new approval process that uses PayPal's extensive data in addition to credit bureau data. This new process allows us to extend BML to a wider set of customers, giving consumers increased purchasing power and driving incremental sales to our merchants. We're already seeing promising results from the integration of BML in the PayPal wallet, and we plan to integrate BML more seamlessly into the eBay marketplace in the coming months. 
Now turning to eBay, we’re in the midst of a multi-year turnaround, positioning eBay to win in the secondary market. We believe we're uniquely positioned to capture growth opportunities for sellers in the secondary market and provide tremendous value and selection for buyers on new, used and vintage goods. The launch of our new fashion category, as well as eBay buyer protection and our innovative eBay mobile apps for the iPhone and iPad, reflect our efforts in Q1 and demonstrate eBay's potential as the e-commerce landscape continues to evolve. 
Our Q1 results show the steady progress we're making against our turnaround priorities. Marketplace revenue grew 13%, and the key underlying metrics continued to improve with our focus on trust, value and selection. Net promoter scores were up for key segments, such as Top in Active Buyers and Top in Hobby Sellers. Sold items in the U.S. and U.K. and core GMV in the U.S. accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. And our Korean business also performed well as we successfully integrate key market in IAC. 
Our most-trusted sellers continue to win on eBay. Top-rated sellers generated about 31% of core GMV in the U.S., and same-store sales for top-rated sellers accelerated three points to 13% in the U.S., outpacing e-commerce. We also announced a number of changes in Q1 to make eBay pricing more competitive for sellers and improve the eBay experience for buyers. It's too early to assess the impact of these changes since most just went live in the past couple of weeks, but we continue to align our success with that of eBay sellers by dramatically lowering and even eliminating the upfront costs of selling on eBay, and we believe these changes in the U.S. will have the same positive impact that we've seen in Europe. 
For buyers, we've implemented eBay Buyer Protection in the U.S. and UK, a big step in making sure buyers can shop eBay with confidence. EBay Buyer Protection adds a new level of customer support and trust to the world's largest online marketplace. Through eBay Buyer Protection, buyers have access to customer support specialists seven days a week and will cover the buyer's purchase price and original shipping for most purchases should a problem arise and the seller be unable to resolve the issue. EBay Buyer Protection, along with our Vehicle and Business Equipment Protection programs, covers almost every item purchased on eBay. 
EBay's newly launched fashion category illustrates how we're delivering better experiences for buyers and servicing in more compelling ways the deep inventory that eBay sellers offer. The fashion tab and category on eBay delivers a dramatically different eBay shopping experience, offering the convenience of visual search and features that’ll help buyers more easily find items they want. We introduced Fashion Outlet in the U.K. and Germany and launched Fashion Vault in the U.S., which was successfully piloted in the fourth quarter. And we're pleased with the progress we’re making in positioning eBay as the fashion destination offering great value and selection from top brands, retailers, designers and other sellers. So we're starting from a strong position as the number-one clothing site, based on sales and traffic, and we begin to expect traction from these initiatives in Q2 and beyond. In fact, we expect to generate more than $5 billion in GMV [gross merchandise volume] from clothing, shoes and accessories. 
Mobile continues to be a focus of innovation for eBay, and our mobile apps are driving strong demand. Our main eBay shopping app has been downloaded more than 8.5 million times and we expect our mobile apps to generate $1.5 billion in gross merchandise volume in 2010. That's 2.5x our volume last year. And in the first quarter, we offered and introduced more apps, offering more ways to buy and sell on eBay. Our new eBay selling app lets sellers conveniently list an item from their iPhone in less than 60 seconds. And we launched a new eBay app for the iPad that delivers a more visual and easy-to-shop mobile experience in what the New York Times called the best shopping experience on the Web. 
Turning to our adjacent e-commerce formats, our Classifieds business was up 14% in Q1, with strong growth in Canada, the U.K. and Denmark. At the end of Q1, we also announced eBay Classifieds in the U.S., re-launching our Kijiji platform with major enhancements that create industry-leading standards in trust, safety, consumer service and user experience. We also introduced the eBay Classifieds mobile app for the iPhone, making it easy to photograph and list items in less than a minute and search for items in your local community. StubHub also had a solid quarter, as ticket demand for professional and college sporting events, such as the Super Bowl and March Madness, was strong. StubHub continues to gain momentum as the tickets marketplace that offers the most choice and availability. 
So in summary, 2010 is off to a strong start, as we continue to strengthen our core e-commerce business and aggressively grow payments. We accomplished a great deal in the first quarter, building on our 2009 momentum. And we're performing well against our three-year goals. I am pleased with how we're strengthening the fundamentals of our business, enhancing our competitive advantages and focusing on our customers and driving innovation. Now I'll turn it over to Bob for more details on the quarter and our financial outlook."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. All growth rates mentioned in my prepared remarks represent year-over-year comparisons, unless I clarify otherwise. 
Overall, we delivered strong first quarter results. We came in at the high end of expectations on the top line and above expectations on the bottom line, while we increased the financial strength of the company. We continued to execute against our strategic priorities during the quarter. PayPal gained market share off of eBay and increased penetration on eBay, as total TPV growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. And the Marketplaces turnaround remains on track as growth and velocity for the number of sold items accelerated for the fourth quarter in a row.
We're pleased with the results we achieved this past quarter, which gives us a good head start on our full year objectives. We're maintaining full year guidance, as the strong trends at PayPal and the improvement from the turnaround at eBay Marketplaces will be offset by headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar. 
Our combined businesses generated net revenues of $2.2 billion in the first quarter, a 9% increase or 18% excluding Skype, from Q1 '09. FX increased growth by three points and our acquisition of Gmarket increased growth by four points, resulting in organic revenue growth of 11%. First quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.42, an 8% increase or 15% excluding Skype. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to productivity gains, which we reinvested in a lower take rate, and this in turn helped achieve higher sales volume. 
We also recognized a one-time benefit of approximately $0.01 during the quarter related to the early repayment of Skype notes to us. Also worth noting, relative to guidance, the strength of the U.S. dollar cost us $0.01 of EPS in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 30.6%, roughly flat with the year-ago period. 
We generated $266 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Cash flow was reduced by a onetime tax payment of approximately $200 million related to a fourth quarter 2009 business restructuring, which allowed us to move $1.1 billion in cash to the U.S. from overseas. It was also reduced by a higher employee bonus payment versus the historical norm of approximately $50 million related to a change in the timing of bonus payments. CapEx as a percentage of revenues was 7% for the quarter. Return on invested capital was 22.5% on a trailing 12-month basis, the second consecutive quarter of improvement. Earnings growth, coupled with lower invested capital as a result of the sale of 70% of Skype, drove the improvement. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. Starting with our Payments business, PayPal posted another great quarter. Total revenue increased 26% to $809 million. Total payment volume increased 35% to $21.3 billion. Geographically, TPV growth was 25% in the U.S. and 52% internationally. Today, as John indicated, we operate in 190 countries and 24 currencies as we continue to expand PayPal's global footprint. In the first quarter, we generated 40% of our TPV outside the U.S. compared to 35% in the first quarter of 2009. 
PayPal's Merchant Services business had another stellar quarter, driven by an increase in the number of merchants who accept PayPal, the number of active accounts and an increase in our share of checkout. Merchant Services TPV grew 49% in the quarter and now accounts for 3/5 of PayPal's total TPV. On the eBay platform, PayPal's TPV growth accelerated to 18%, the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement driven by strong GMV growth and 68% penetration from addressable GMV, a 420 basis point increase. 
PayPal transaction margin was also strong, increasing to 63.5% in the quarter. Although global take rate was down modestly, we were able to offset this decline with lower transaction expense and a significant improvement in transaction losses, which was primarily a function of better fraud detection and prevention. PayPal segment margins came in at 22.6% in Q1, up 480 basis points from Q4 and 520 basis points year-over-year. The increase from last year was primarily the result of higher transaction margins, helped by some one-time benefits, operating leverage on volume, transferring much of the cost of the eBay buyer protection program to Marketplaces and improvement at Bill Me Later. 
Let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later. Bill Me Later's gross receivable balance at quarter end was $641 million. The quality of BML receivables has continued to improve, which has resulted in reduced growth, but we believe this is the right trade-off for the current economic environment. We’ve begun using eBay Inc. data to help reduce the customer decline rate without taking on additional risks. BML's net charge-off rate decreased to 9.5% in the quarter from 11.1% in Q4, resulting in a risk-adjusted margin of 11.5%, a 120 basis-point sequential improvement. 
Now let's move to our Marketplaces business. Overall, Marketplaces achieved net revenues of $1.4 billion, a 13% increase. Marketplaces generated 60% of its revenue internationally this quarter, up from 54% in Q1 2009. We continue to be pleased with the strong double-digit growth we're seeing in our fixed-price format, with fixed price now accounting for more than 60% of GMV, excluding Vehicles. On an FX neutral basis, GMV in our fixed-price format grew at 33%, while the auction format declined 3% and vehicles was down 7%. 
Beyond transaction revenue, we connect buyers and sellers through alternative formats, which are becoming increasingly important to the marketplaces. Marketing services now represents 15% of Marketplaces revenue and grew 12% in the quarter. Our Classifieds business continued its strong trajectory, with 14% growth due to strength in Canada, U.K. and Denmark. Total global advertising revenue increased by 12%, driven by strong growth in ad commerce, our internally developed CPC-based advertising solution for sellers, as well as higher revenue per click on our search advertising. 
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces operational metrics. Active users accelerated in our three largest markets. However, globally, this was offset by weakness in some of our smaller European markets. Sold items, excluding Gmarket, accelerated for the fourth straight quarter to 13%, geographically driven by strength in the U.K., cross-border trade out of China and the U.S. Marketplaces segment margin was 42% in the quarter, down 310 bps from a year ago but in line with our full-year guidance. The main drivers of the year-over-year change include savings from operational excellence initiatives, which we then reinvested into a lower take rate, and new buyer protection programs, as well as the inclusion of Gmarket, which we acquired in June of last year. 
Global take rate was 7.6% in the quarter, down 41 bps from last year or down 49 bps excluding vehicles, StubHub and Gmarket. The decline is primarily due to a reduction in feature fees, an increase in buyer incentives and discounts given to our highest-rated sellers. 
Turning to operating expenses, in Q1, sales and marketing was 19% of revenue, up 70 bps from last year, primarily due to the acquisition of Gmarket and the divestiture of Skype. Product development was 8.3%, down 20 bps, as productivity gains and acquisitions more than offset the negative impact of the Skype divestiture. G&A cost was 10.7%, a decrease of 70 bps, predominantly due to operating leverage. And our provision for transaction and loan losses was 4.8%, up 80 bps, primarily due to our new eBay Buyer Protection program and PayPal's newly enhanced off-eBay protection program. 
From a cash perspective, we generated free cash flow of $266 million during the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, cash flow was reduced by a one-time tax payment of approximately $200 million and changes in bonus payment, compared to last year’s. Cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments totaled $5.4 billion at quarter end. Of this, we held approximately $1.1 billion in the U.S. 
Now let me turn to guidance. For Q2, we anticipate revenue of $2.15 billion to $2.2 billion. This represents growth from 11% to 14%, excluding Skype. We anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $0.37 to $0.39, which represents growth of 9% to 15%, excluding Skype. As I mentioned earlier, we're maintaining full-year guidance. Despite strength from PayPal and improvements from the Marketplaces turnaround, these positives will essentially be offset by a stronger U.S. dollar compared to where we were three months ago. For the full-year 2010, we continue to project revenues of $8.8 billion to $9.1 billion, representing growth of 9% to 12%, excluding Skype, and we continue to anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $1.63 to $1.68, representing growth of 11% to 14%, also excluding Skype. 
In summary, as John mentioned, we commuted our three-year growth and profitability goals in early 2009. Since that time, first, we have a stronger and more focused portfolio. We divested the majority of Skype, and we acquired Gmarket. We completed the integration of Bill Me Later and the PayPal wallet. And we have a stronger balance sheet. Secondly, we exceeded our expectations in 2009, and growth accelerated in the second half of the year. And last, we’re off to a good start in 2010. Despite headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar, we’re well-positioned to deliver on our full-year guidance. And now, we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

I think we do expect take rate to come down more during the course of the year, but to put it into context, the way we try to think about the business is more looking at transaction margins, which were a function of, obviously, take rate, secondly, transaction expenses and third, fraud losses. And the reason we do it that way is simply in some geographies, take rates may be lower but transaction expenses may be lower as well. And particularly as we grow outside the U.S., we do have lower take rates outside of the U.S., and as you know from our results, the growth rates internationally have been very strong. So we do expect global take rate to come down, but we also expect transaction margins to stay above 60%. In terms of one-timers in the quarter in PayPal's variable cost, yes, there was probably about 1.5 to 2 points of margin benefit from PayPal, due to some one-timers flowing through transaction expense and fraud losses. So while margins accelerated 500 bps year-over-year, so probably 3 bps is more sustainable improvement on a year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter basis."

Usually, those issues get resolved with sellers but if not, we give them their money back plus shipping, and we’ve gotten very good feedback on that. Similarly, you see the clothing, shoes and accessories launch of a couple of weeks ago, and that's really the first tailored vertical shopping experience that's built on our platform. And I think you see it's a way that really brings eBay's inventory to life in a very different way for buyers and allows them to access eBay's inventory in easier and more engaging ways. So these are just the first two of what I think will be a series of buyer-related improvements you'll see over this coming year. And as I’ve said all the way along, I want to make sure that our experience gets to the point where buyers can confidently know and see they are experiencing something differently, and we will at that stage really amp up our marketing. To be clear, we're spending the same amount of marketing this year thus far as we did last year, and we'll continue to do that. But I want to keep making the steady progress we are. Our buyer metrics are improving, our customer retention’s improving, and one quarter at a time toward this three-year goal."

And then for the smaller business seller, the people that sell a lot of volume on eBay, we are incenting them to sell in the fixed-price format, making that in essence free or quite low-priced to list in the fixed-price format. Again, they only pay if it sells. And as you know, auctions are sorted by time ending soonest. Fixed price is sorted or searched by in essence, relevance, and best match. And what we found in Europe is that allowed both groups of sellers to list in their most natural format and allow the richness of inventory to come up more clear, pop better for buyers. And we saw an improvement in sold items, an improvement in GMV. And so we anticipate the same reaction in the United States as this plays out over the remainder of the year. The other thing that happens as part of that is we no longer have the store inventory format, and so that the fixed-price items are now all in sort of core search, and what we've proven in Europe is that our search engine can take that. So these are things that we're proving out in Europe, and it’ll take time to sort of work their way into initially our listings and then into the demand.

On the Marketplace changes, what we've done is we've bunched those into two releases, which makes it easier for sellers. Our sellers like the advance warning and like to know that they can really make two sets of changes a year. We intended to make those in March and in September and announce them 60 to 90 days ahead of time. So we'll have a second wave of changes this year. And again, this is a year where you’re going see a lot of the foundational work that we did in 2008 and 2009 begin to flow through to things that buyers can touch and feel, things like the vertical shopping experience in clothing, shoes and accessories; things like equipment and auto parts, which is in essence -- significantly simplifies selling in that category for eBay; and things like eBay Buyer Protection. So more things like that you’ll see in the next release. And then with respect to Asia, Bob and I were in Asia last week, in fact, visiting with the PayPal team and, man, there is just really, really impressive growth, frankly in both the eBay and PayPal businesses in Asia, as cross-border continues to be quite strong in that market. And then what PayPal has done, that I mentioned earlier in my remarks, is signed some deals with financial services, entities that give us access to local Asian customers that may not be on eBay. So the China UnionPay deal allows us access to 1.3 billion Chinese consumers, China UnionPay, by the way, has a total of 2.1 billion overall cardholders. So now, it's easier for them to open a PayPal account and fund it with that. We signed deals in Singapore and in South Africa, which again allow local consumers in those markets to access PayPal more readily. And we're doing some interesting things in the mobile front. On guidance, I'm going to let Bob -- in Japan, we’ve signed deals with several of the largest payments gateways, which give us access to both Japanese merchants, and then we're talking with a couple of Japanese financial services concerns about doing the same thing to access Japanese consumers. So I think a lot of growth opportunity. And your question on guidance, I'm going to give Bob a chance to come in on guidance, which I know some people are curious about."

As you know, we are a global business, with more than half of our revenues from offshore, a couple billion dollars in revenue exposed to the euro, $1 billion of revenue exposed to the pound, and the implications of how currencies have changed, in particular the strengthening of the dollar in the last 90 days, will cost us approximately $125 million in revenue and $0.05 in EPS, relative to where we were 90 days ago. Secondly, our tax rate is going to be a little bit higher this year than what we thought, and the reason is because our U.S. business is going to be stronger. And that higher tax rate will likely cost us a couple cents relative to where we were 90 days ago. So that's $0.07 down. We maintained our guidance for the full year, and it's because of two things. One, PayPal will grow faster than we expected a few months ago, and its margins will be higher. And we're increasingly confident 90 days later about the changes that we're making in the Marketplace business. So as we think about our full-year guidance for eBay Inc., not maybe the cost in the Asian business and PayPal, we will be down $0.07 because the currency and tax rate will be up $0.07 because of good operational performance in the PayPal business and continued progress in the core eBay business as well."

And that's simply because payments is a large and competitive space, and there are lots of people who participate in one form or another. And rather than comment on any specific announcement or competitor, let me just say this. We continuously closely monitor the competitive landscape and feel confident about our position and our competitive advantages and feel more confident about those as the days go on. We've got this combination of scale and fee. And we primarily look at what customers want, actually we look at it more from a customer perspective than a competitor landscape, and what you see from the PayPal numbers is our customers like what we’re doing. And the specific things I think we have that are unique are we have direct relationships with both consumers and merchants. We don't have to work through issuing banks or acquiring banks. And so we’ve got 80 million active consumers and 8 million merchants, and so as you said, I think there are additional opportunities to add merchants following this acquisition, and we'll certainly get very aggressive to be adding those. But it’s that kind of direct relationship that gives us the data that allows us to do the risk detection and fraud prevention that we do, and that combined with our technology platform, allows us to innovate more rapidly. What we've done with our platform, opening of our platform, which no other payments platform in the world has done; what we're doing in mobile, where there are a lot of people talking about it, we've already launched two apps and really did more volume in Q1 than we did all last year in mobile payments. In digital goods, we're pushing forward. So I think you're going to see lots of different movements in the broader e-commerce competitive space. We're staying very focused on our consumers and feel very good about the combination of scale and speed that we bring to being the leader in online global payments."

There continues to be strong synergies between eBay and PayPal. You saw that in the increased penetration PayPal’s had on eBay. It’s up, I think, from a 300 or 400 basis points year-over-year. eBay continues to provide a significant number of new users for PayPal, in essence for free, and eBay Inc.'s balance sheet allows us to invest in PayPal's business and make investments like Bill Me Later that further its position. So as long as those synergies are there, we're going to try to fully capitalize on them and believe it's the best thing to do for our customers and investors. And then on eBay Buyer Protection, this is a nice capstone of stuff we’ve been working on for the last 12 to 18 months, where we've materially reduced bad buyer experiences. We've increased trust on the site. We’ve put in place from a -- we were at standing start. We had no phone coverage for buyers 12 months ago and we now have in essence full phone coverage for buyers in both the U.S. and the U.K. And what this allows us to do with confidence is to say, “Buy in eBay, and you're covered.” Almost no questions asked. And what our research says is even though buyers are seeing better experiences, this kind of guarantee is going to give them that real sense of confidence they can buy with confidence. And the early feedback we're getting from consumers in the U.S. and U.K. mentioned that. It does result in a shifting a little bit of costs from payout from eBay, payout of losses from, I’m sorry, from PayPal to eBay, but overall, net-net, we don't see that as a major reason. It raises one margin slightly, lowers another. We’re confident enough that we don't have -- seeing it having a material impact on the company overall, financially, that is. But we do hope it has a material impact on our consumers."

This is where the testing and learning and how we approach many of these changes make sense. So we started off a year ago by saying -- we were certain people just wanted their money back instantly. And so when we first piloted this Buyer Protection, we did it just for the top buyers in the U.S. And they’d call, and we’d give them their money back instantly. And what we found was that's not what they wanted. They said, “You know what? I just want the item.” So we started intermediating with the sellers more aggressively and helping connect the buyer with the seller in the after- transaction, and we found that in 70% to 80% of the cases, they got it resolved within 24 to 48 hours, and the buyer was happy. They preferred that from getting their money back. So what that has enabled us to do is to scale this in a way that’s far more aggressive, because what it’s in essence doing is connecting the buyer and seller in a post-transaction to make sure that they resolve the transaction in a satisfactory manner. And then at any time that the buyer would just rather get their money back, we provide it. But it was fascinating learning to find that in most cases, they just want to get their item, and they want to get their item in a timely and accurate basis. And in 80% of the submissions, or the claim filings, that's was in essence happening. And that's why that number, Bob’s number of $8 million, which sounds small, it’s because for every 10 calls that come, eight of them are getting resolved between buyer and seller."

Today, I’ll talk about our results for the quarter and our progress toward achieving our growth objectives. Bob will then give more details on the numbers and our guidance and we’ll take questions.
I want to begin by reminding you of our strategic goals. We’re positioning PayPal to be the leader in global online payments and we’re positioning eBay to continue as a leader in e-commerce with competitive strength as the world’s largest online marketplace for secondary or off-price new and pre-owned merchandise.
And we’re working toward achieving these goals in three ways. First, we’re becoming a more customer-driven organization. We have three clear customer metrics, net promoter score, velocity and market share, and we’ve tied a portion of management’s compensation to customer satisfaction.
Second, we’re becoming a more technology-driven company with an increasing commitment to innovation. Our efforts in mobile, platform and the launch of products such as our fashion vertical illustrate our commitment and increasing pace of innovation.
And third, we’re operating more efficiently. We’re taking $2 billion out of our cost structure over a three-year period and reinvesting in our growth priorities.
Now our Q2 results, both revenue and earnings exceeded our guidance. Excluding Skype, revenue increased 15% and non-GAAP EPS was up 18% year-over-year. PayPal continued its strong revenue and total payment volume growth and eBay’s turnaround continued with progress in key metrics.
We continue to focus on delivering strong financial results, managing a healthy balance sheet and making the necessary investments to satisfy our customers and compete and win.
Our Q2 results also demonstrate the global strength and increasing diversity of our company. Almost 60% of the eBay marketplace revenue was generated outside the U.S. and more than 60% of PayPal’s total payment volume comes from our Merchant Services business off of eBay. The diverse nature of our portfolio gives us the ability to balance opportunities and challenges across our businesses and geographies.
Now let’s take a look at the results from each business unit. PayPal had another great quarter. We added 1 million new accounts each month during Q2 and PayPal now has 87 million active accounts. Penetration on eBay continued to increase and our merchant services business grew over 40% for the third quarter in a row. Overall, PayPal continues to grow significantly faster than global e-commerce and gain share as the leading online payment method.
As we continue to execute our plan to grow merchants and consumers, we’re also taking steps to accelerate PayPal’s competitive position globally and drive payments innovation. I want to touch on three brief examples in today’s call.
First, we’re aggressively expanding PayPal’s presence across Asia through pursuit of strategic relationships. For example, our previously announced partnership with China UnionPay is on track to launch in Q3, giving millions of Chinese consumers the ability to shop online and pay with PayPal.
And in Q2 PayPal launched on the Alibaba.com’s Ali Express platform, giving small merchants worldwide a faster, safer way to pay for wholesale merchandise from China.
In Japan PayPal went live with SoftBank payment services and we are now on the top five gateways in that country, providing access to a market with more than $25 billion in addressable spend.
We’ve also announced significant mobile deals in Singapore and Malaysia to help make the MobileWallet a reality for millions of new consumers in Asia. For example, PayPal’s mobile platform was chosen by the Singapore government to power its M-commerce Infrastructure and in Malaysia PayPal signed a deal with Maxis, the country’s largest telco operator, to provide PayPal to Maxis’ 12 million subscribers on its mobile, online and Internet TV platforms. These are just a few of the examples illustrating PayPal’s significant opportunities in Asia.
We’re also driving significant product innovation with Bill Me Later, both within the PayPal wallet and as a separate payment option. Merchants are recognizing the potential for Bill Me Later to help drive sales and higher order value. And consumers like the benefits of online credit as an easy payment option.
As a result, Bill Me Later’s growth in Q2 is accelerating and in Q2 we also began testing Bill Me Later as a checkout option on eBay. Early results show that when buyers use BML on eBay, their purchases are generally two times larger than the average order value on eBay, more to come on that in future quarters.
My third example of how PayPal is driving growth and innovation is in mobile payments. More than 2.5 million people have downloaded PayPal’s mobile apps and in the first six months of this year, PayPal generated nearly twice the mobile payment volume that it did for all of 2009.
In the U.S. in Q2, PayPal introduced Mobile Express Checkout, which is designed to vastly improve the mobile shopping experience for consumers and PayPal merchants. Mobile Express Checkout offers consumers the same frictionless payment experience on the mobile phone that PayPal customers enjoy online and Mobile Express Checkout offers PayPal merchants an easy way to extend their business to the mobile phone. All in all, PayPal continues to make progress toward achieving its enormous potential to be the clear leader in online and mobile payments.
Now let’s turn to eBay. We continue to make progress in our multi-year turnaround with ongoing improvements in the buying and selling and experience, and growing innovation in areas such as mobile and fashion.
For the quarter, marketplace revenue was up 11% year-over-year with solid performance on the underlying customer metrics. Net promoter scores were up for top and active buyers in the U.S., U.K. and Germany, and buyers are buying with greater frequency. Sold item growth continued to be strong at 11% globally.
And when we look at GMV in our three largest markets, we gained share in the U.K., driving mid teens growth in Q2. We performed well in Germany with GMV and sold items accelerating from Q1. However, in the U.S. we grew more slowly than the market.
We are not satisfied with our U.S. results, while clearly we saw consumer spending soften during the quarter and the strengthening dollar hurt GMV exports from the U.S. However, we aim to do better in this market.
Now, we believe the changes we implemented in the U.S. at the end of Q1 to offer more competitive pricing for sellers and better experiences for buyers ultimately will have the same positive impact we’ve seen in Europe. However, we’re in the midst of making a series of format and search adjustments following that price change, just as we had to do last year in Europe. But overall, we’re not satisfied and we’re on top of it.
That said, overall buyer satisfaction on eBay is continuing to improve. As I mentioned a minute ago, buyer net promoter scores are up in each of our major markets. This is driven by increased trust on our marketplace.
Bad buyer experiences are decreasing and sellers across the site are improving their service. And eBay Buyer Protection is improving buyer satisfaction. Buyer Protection allows buyers to shop on eBay with confidence.
We’ve also launched a couple of innovative shopping experiences. Our new fashion vertical offers a more compelling and visual shopping experience, better servicing our deep inventory in this $5 billion plus eBay category.
We’re making strong progress in working with the top fashion brands in Europe and the U.S., and we are getting great feedback from buyers and sellers on the fashion experience, and our teams are rapidly building suggestions into site improvements.
And mobile innovation is another way we’re creating better shopping experience on eBay. We’re well on our way to delivering $1.5 billion of mobile GMV this year, more than 2.5 times our volume in 2009. Our main eBay iPhone app has been downloaded almost 11 million times and eBay is consistently a top three lifestyle app on the iPad.
Our eBay selling app, which we just launched in the U.K., has quickly become a top 10 app there and it’s already generating an average of more than 2,000 listings per day. So we’re continuing to expand the availability of our applications across all platforms, iPhone, BlackBerry and Android, so that we are reaching millions of potential new users worldwide.
In addition in Q2, we acquired the popular RedLaser iPhone app. We’ll be integrating this barcode scanning technology into our eBay apps, providing users with fast and easy selling and comparison shopping information. We’ll also be enhancing selection on the free standalone RedLaser app by adding eBay’s more than 200 million listings, as well as, inventory from 7000 merchants on shopping.com.
Turning briefly to our adjacent e-commerce formats, our classifieds business was up 7% in Q2, with strong growth in Canada and Germany. And StubHub had another great quarter, continuing to reinforce its position as the tickets marketplace that offers the most choice and availability.
Q2 ticket demand was strong for sporting events, including the NBA and NHL playoffs, and Major League Baseball. StubHub also expanded into mobile commerce with the launch of its iPhone application.
So in summary, with the first half of 2010 behind us, we continue to make progress against our three-year growth objectives and deliver on our financial commitments. PayPal is strong and has great potential and momentum. And eBay continues to make progress in key metrics with strength in Asia and the U.K. and solid performance in Germany.
We still have work to do in the U.S., our toughest, most competitive market and we are not satisfied. However, we remain confident that our turnaround is on track and we continue to target having our aggregate marketplaces businesses grow at e-commerce global rates for the year.
We are a strong company with great competitive assets in e-commerce and payments, and across our two businesses we will continue to focus on our customers, innovate and drive operating efficiencies to invest in growth.
Now, I’ll turn it over to Bob for more details on the quarter and our financial outlook before we take questions.

During my discussion I’ll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. All growth rates mentioned in my prepared remarks represent year-over-year comparisons unless I clarify otherwise.
Overall, we delivered strong second quarter results. We came in above our guidance on both the top and bottom line, despite the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. We continued to execute against our strategic priorities during the quarter. PayPal increased global share of e-commerce off of eBay and in coming back. Solid sold items growth was partially offset by lower ASPs.
We’re pleased with the results we’ve achieved in the first half of the year. PayPal is performing better than expectations and the marketplace business is on track with the plans we laid out at the beginning of the year.
Geographically, Europe growth is up, Asia is in line and the U.S. is below our expectations. However, the stronger U.S. dollar will have a significant impact on both the top and bottom line. As a result, we are modestly adjusting full year guidance and I’ll discuss this in more detail later in the call.
Our combined businesses generated net revenues of $2.2 billion in the second quarter, a 6% increase or 15%, excluding Skype from Q2 ‘09. Foreign exchange decreased growth by 1 point and our acquisition of Gmarket increased growth by 3 points, resulting in organic revenue growth of 13%.
Second quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.40, an 8% increase or 18% excluding Skype. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.1%, up 40 basis points from Q2 ‘09. The year-over-year increases were primarily due to volume leverage and productivity gains, partially offset by a lower take rate.
We generated $519 million of free cash flow in the quarter. CapEx as a percentage of revenue was 9%, which was higher than recent quarters due to the timing of some expenses for our new mega data center we opened in Utah this -- in the second quarter.
For the full year we expect this rate to be up slightly versus last year. Return on invested capital was 22.8% on a trailing 12 month basis, the third consecutive quarter of improvement, reflecting higher earnings growth.
Now let’s take a closer look at our segment results. Starting with our payments business, PayPal posted another great quarter. Total payments revenue increased 22% to $817 million. Total payment volume increased 28% to $21.4 billion.
Geographically, TPV growth was 23% in the U.S. and 37% internationally. We continued to expand our global footprint with 40% of our TPV from outside the U.S. for the quarter, compared to 38% in the second quarter of last year.
PayPal’s merchant services business had another excellent quarter, driven by increases in the number of merchants who accept PayPal, the number of active accounts and our share of Checkout. Merchant Services TPV grew 43% in the quarter and now accounts for 61% of PayPal’s total TPV.
On the eBay platform, PayPal’s TPV growth rate was 9%. Penetration of addressable GMV increased 420 basis points, which was driven by Germany, Australia and Italy. PayPal’s transaction margin was also strong, increasing to 62.8% in the quarter.
Although global take rate was down 17 basis points and transaction expense was up modestly, these effects were offset by a significant improvement in transaction losses, which was primarily a function of better fraud detection and prevention, along with a shift of much of the cost of our Buyer Protection Program from PayPal to marketplaces.
PayPal’s segment margin came in at 19.9% in the quarter, up 380 basis points year-over-year. The increase from last year was primarily the result of operating leverage on volume, higher transaction margins and improvement at BML.
Now let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later. Bill Me Later’s gross receivable balance at quarter end was $691 million, up 25%. The quality of the portfolio continues to improve and the charge-off rate has continued to decline, down to 8.6% from 9.5% in Q1 2010. Risk-adjusted margin improved 130 bips sequentially to 12.8%.
Within the last year we’ve fully integrated Bill Me Later into the PayPal wallet, began testing Bill Me Later in eBay listings and started using eBay Inc. data with the goal of reducing the customer decline rate without taking on additional risk.
Now let’s move to our marketplaces business. Overall, marketplace has achieved net revenues of $1.4 billion, an 11% increase. Marketplaces FX neutral revenue accelerated 5 points from the first quarter, driven by a higher take rate, lower contract expense and higher ad-based revenues. Transaction revenue was up 12% and marketing services and other revenue was up 7%. Marketplaces generated 58% of its revenue internationally this quarter.
Marketing services and other grew 7% in the quarter and represents 15% of marketplaces revenue. Our classifieds business grew 7% with strong growth coming from Canada and mobile.de. Total global advertising revenue increased 9%, driven by strength in Europe and APAC display advertising.
A few quick highlights on marketplaces operational metrics, active users increased to 92 million, up 4% year-over-year. Sold items, excluding Gmarket grew 11%, geographically driven by the U.K. and China’s cross-border trade.
U.S. core GMV was 2% in the quarter, down 4 points from Q1. The decline was driven by lower ASPs due to broader selection of well priced inventory and reduced cross-border trade, primarily to Europe, as European currencies weakened. As John indicated earlier, we feel good about the expanded selection and better deals on the site, but we have work to do to increase velocity of sold items.
International core GMV grew 20% or 21% on an FX neutral basis. The growth in both the U.K. and Germany continued to be strong and accelerated for the quarter. China’s cross-border trade remains one of our fastest growing markets but was negatively impacted by the weakening of the euro and the British pound.
Marketplaces segment margin was 40% in the quarter, down 220 basis points from a year ago. The main drivers of the change include increased investments to continue to build trust, value and selection, as well as, the inclusion of Gmarket, which we acquired in June of last year. These were partially offset by savings from our operational excellence initiatives.
Global take rate was 8.03% in the quarter, up 16 bips from last year or up 10 bips excluding vehicles, StubHub and Gmarket. The take rate increase was driven by higher velocity on lower priced items and lower power seller discounts versus last year.
Turning to operating expenses, in Q2 our operating expenses were 44% of revenue, essentially in line with last year. We’ve invested more in product while leveraging our G&A infrastructure. We expect this trend to continue.
From a cash perspective, we generated free cash flow of $519 million during the quarter. Cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments totaled $5.6 billion at quarter end. Of this, we held approximately $1.2 billion in the U.S.
Now let me turn to guidance. We have outperformed our expectations for the first half of the year, but we exit the first half with a bit of caution. As we head into the second half, our guidance reflects a few things.
First, PayPal will continue to perform well, second, European currencies will remain relatively weak versus the U.S. dollar and third, the U.S. e-commerce market will be relatively slow.
The implications on these on our full year guidance we originally provided in January are as follows. PayPal will continue to perform well on the top and bottom line. For the full year, this will contribute an additional $100 million in revenue or $0.06 to $0.08 in earnings per share. Marketplaces is on track. Geographically, Europe growth is stronger, Asia is in line and the U.S. and cross-border trade are weaker. Third, the stronger dollar will hurt revenue by approximately $250 million or $0.09 to $0.11 in EPS for the full year.
So for the full year we now anticipate revenue of $8.8 to $9.0 billion, representing growth of 9% to 11%, excluding Skype and we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $1.60 to $1.65, representing growth of 9% to 12% also excluding Skype.
The implications on the third quarter are as follows. We anticipate revenue of $2.13 to $2.18 billion. This represents growth of 4% to 6%, excluding Skype. And we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $0.35 to $0.37, which represents growth of zero to 6%, excluding Skype. On a year-over-year basis we expect a stronger dollar to have a negative impact on Q3 results of approximately $70 million in revenue and approximately $0.02 in earnings per share.
In summary, we had a strong first half with double-digit top and bottom line growth. Our global footprint is expanding, innovation is accelerating and ops excellence enables investments into trust, value and selection.
PayPal has outperformed our expectations and the marketplace business is on track, and the stronger dollar creates real challenges given our global footprint. We’re confident but cautious as we enter the second half of the year.
And now we’d be happy to answer your questions. Operator?

Let take each of those in turn. In terms of active user growth, what’s encouraging is that when you peel beneath the surface, what’s happening is what we’ve been aiming toward, which is users are coming back more frequently and they’re buying more and that then is leading to new users because we think of the word-of-mouth.
The market that’s most pronounced in is in the U.K., where as I mentioned we’re growing faster than the market. We’re growing in the mid teens in the U.K. and we’re beginning to see this dynamic where the site improve -- the site experience is improved, our existing customers like it, they’re coming back more frequently, buying more and we’re beginning to see a pickup in new users as well. So we’re far from being done with where we want to go and need to go, but we are encouraged by some of those signs.
With respect to mobile users, here is what’s interesting, is they are not pure mobile users or pure website users. They are a class of users who are using both devices. And what we’re seeing is, mobile increases the intensity of the number of times they touch eBay, the number of times they use eBay.
And so someone may search for an item on their laptop or their desktop, put it into their My eBay and then they actually buy it the next day standing in line at a Starbucks or they may be standing in line at Starbucks, do a search, put it in their My eBay and actually close it later on their laptop.
So we’re looking at mobile as an extension of the ways people interact with eBay rather than being a separate set of customers and so that’s why we double down or continue to double down on mobile, and sure we’re innovating. This RedLaser application’s something that we feel excited about because it again brings eBay’s 200 million listings to consumers when they are in stores and in the offline world. So mobile’s increasing the intensity of interaction with eBay.

We’ve had very high growth rates, primarily out of greater China, China and Hong Kong, to our developed markets in Europe and in the U.S. And also cross-border trade from the U.S. to Europe is a net importer from both Asia and from the U.S. and we saw that demand slow dramatically.
Relative to the U.S. GMV decline from 6% to 2%, 2 points of that was driven by lower cross-border trade and again, we saw a fairly direct tight correlation between the weakening of the European currencies and the demand on U.S. products throughout the course of the quarter.
So, overall it was about 1 point in total. It was -- it impacted U.S. cross -- U.S. GMV more than rest of world and our challenge as we go into the second half of the year if currencies stay where they are, is how do we highlight some of the great deals of our European sellers and merchants into our stronger currency countries like the U.S.

On marketing, let me first make comment on something you said, I think the marketplace is in a better place than it has been in the last couple of years. But I’m still not satisfied. So we’re, we laid out a three-year plan. We are halfway through it. And I’m pleased with progress on some fronts but also believe we will make a lot more progress in the next six to 18 months.
And the kind of thing I think you’re going to really begin to see more of is things are now getting to the fashion experience on the core eBay business. Any of you that haven’t gone into that fashion tab, I would encourage you to go into it.
In fact, you can check today the fashion wallet, we have TAG Heuer Watches, luxury off-price watches and you’ll see most of the men’s watches are sold out already, but we’re bringing in new kinds of inventory. We ran one with Brooks Brothers last week and bringing in new kinds of inventory, and bringing it to life in very different ways.
And so that fashion application, if you will, is the first vertical we’ve built on our new search platform and it’s a precursor of additional vertical experiences that will come over the next six to 18 months. And so with respect to marketing, the most valuable indicator of if our changes are working -- are our buyers buying more and then, are they coming back?
In the second half this year we will spend roughly a comparable amount in marketing than we did in the second half of last year. We’ll probably lean in a little bit. We’ll spend a little bit more toward loyalty, eBay Bucks and a little bit less toward things like Microsoft cashback because obviously that program is stopping.
And as we move into 2011, I believe we will be on a trajectory where our user experience say by midway next year will be in a place where I think we can go back to inactive eBay users and really market to them. So a lot of work to be done, we’ve got some tweaks to make in U.S. search, given the recent changes there. But I’m confident we are on track, so to be in the right place over the next 12 to 18 months.

Second, we’ve -- we’re working to ensure we improve consumer preference, which is to say, again, it’s the frequency, the velocity, when I talk about our customer metrics, which is how frequently consumers use PayPal. Are they using PayPal every time they see it online? It’s getting the let’s be everywhere and then let’s getting consumers using it everywhere. And I would say, we’re getting better at that. We’re getting better at sort of basic marketing, basic consumer preference -- consumer frequency on PayPal.
Then the third angle that is becoming increasingly important, frankly, is innovation. And whether that is digital goods, whether that’s mobile payments, frankly, whether that’s credit in BML. I mentioned earlier some of the innovative products on credit or whether it’s, frankly, we’re now getting pulled offline by some large merchants who view a mobile payments approach on PayPal as a way to extend their private label cards and other in-store experiences. So as you know, we opened up our platform to help us expand our capacity for innovation.
So I don’t see any one area as a risk. I just see a market that is quite large, where the opportunity is expanding and we need to ensure we execute well across all those fronts. And so if you were to hear both what Scott Thompson would be saying to his team and what Bob and I are constantly focusing on in PayPal, let’s ensure we are executing on the opportunities that are in front of us.

As I said early on, as I step back, we’re sort of halfway through this turnaround and frankly, we’re ahead of where I thought we would be in the U.K. and we’re behind where I’d like to be in the U.S., at least on Q2. And so, I’m not satisfied with where we are in Q2 but I do think we’re on the right path.
And here’s sort of the facts, as you know, we launched a significant pricing and search change on April 1 in the U.S. In essence the same change that we had done in the U.K. and Germany over the previous 12 to 18 months. And we knew the states are bigger because there simply were a lot more listings that were going to be impacted in the U.S.
And so what we’ve seen is selection in core search is up. So the core search engine in the U.S. is now processing three times as many listings at the end of the quarter than it did at the beginning of the quarter, as the store’s inventory and frankly, a lot of new listings came on.
So selection is up for U.S. consumers in core search and they’re getting better deals, and we saw that in ASPs. ASPs frankly came down even more than we thought because a lot of the lower priced items from the store inventory now came in core search and people were buying them, so that we felt good about.
What did not increase however was velocity? Sold item growth was 5% in the U.S. in Q2, that was the 2 points acceleration from Q1. And we want that to go up. We want that to go up overtime, as it has in Europe.
And so we’re in the midst of making some adjustments in the format mix of auctions and fixed price. We’ve brought a lot of the stores inventory came on in fixed price and we kept our exposure auction and fixed price exposure the same, and we’re now going to be increasing gently the fixed price exposure, as well as, ensuring that higher ASP items are getting appropriate visibility. So these are actually analogous to the fine tuning we had to do in Europe last year and we’re already on it, and we will be doing that over the next remainder of the year.
And then we’re going to continue on the product innovation in the U.S., as well as, the rest of the world. CSA is our first launch. We’re looking to go through additional verticals such as technology and parts and improving that user experience.
And then the last thing I’d highlight in the U.S. that I think, I know you’ll see us a little more from. eBay Buyer Protection, I mentioned that trust on eBay is improving. Interestingly, consumers or buyers that have had experience with the eBay Buyer Protection report significant increase of satisfaction after they’ve had it, because they either got their item or they got their money back.
And yet our research is saying actually not many users are yet aware of eBay Buyer Protection, so you’ll see us increasing the awareness around the eBay Buyer Protection, which you’d hope continues to give U.S. consumers confidence that eBay is a trusted marketplace where they can find a wide selection of great deals. So our Lorrie Norrington and our U.S. team are very on top of executing between now and the remainder of the year.

What we said a year ago is that our source of differentiation, the thing that we were going to be known for was having the best deals on what we called the secondary market, increasingly we are calling it off-price inventory, right. It can be new inventory, it can be pre-owned inventory, but it’s off-price, think about it as the online outlet mall. And our target segments the shopping enthusiasts. And so we picked clothing as the first category to really focus on because it’s a large segment that frankly it’s not yet come online that much and it requires innovation to come online, because it’s almost unnatural act to buy clothing online because you want to try it on.
And so it’s already was one of the largest categories on eBay with $5 billion in GMV. We’ve brought a lot of additional inventory on, things like I mentioned earlier, the TAG Heuer watches in our fashion vault.
If you go to the U.K. site, you’ll see fashion outlets and Savile Row has opened up a store on eBay where they’re selling off-price Savile Row suits. And Brooks Brothers and others, so we’re bringing on additional inventory and then that user experience you’d see in the fashion tab on eBay or on the fashion app on iPhone is a more powerful way to bring that inventory to life for the shopping enthusiast.
Now, I go through that because we will be repeating that same formula, if you will in consumer electronics, in auto parts and other categories over the next six to 18 months, where we’ll go out and try to identify, what are the best sources of off-priced inventory?
Our eBay sellers, the 25 million eBay sellers, provide a lot of that. But there are additional sources of inventory that we can now add on and scale. And so whether that’s auto parts inventory or whether that’s consumer electronics, we’re going to go out and acquire the inventory. And then with our new search platform, we have more capacity and more flexibility to build category specific search experiences. And you’ll see us over the next 12 to 18 months do that in technology and in auto parts, and then we’ll just continue working our way down the line.

Let me just summarize what we did in Europe and then what the results were, and then I’ll talk about the U.S. In Europe we actually made separate changes around auction pricing and around fixed pricing. In Germany and the UK, and so we made four different pricing changes across the two countries over what was a nine-month period in the Q4 of ‘08 and the first quarter of ‘09. And we did it because we weren’t certain of what the short-term impact would be and we wanted to make sure we moderated any risk. And after each one we made a series of adjustments to try to, if you will balance the marketplace.
The net result was in the sort of latter half, let’s say fourth quarter of 2009 we saw, particularly the U.K. marketplace, which is the first place we did it, start to have a good balance that where business sellers were listing in fixed-price format in volume and selling in fixed price format, and consumer sellers were listing in auction format, which was a better way for them to sell and that combination was leading to more velocity in the U.K. and in the German site. So and it took, is what I said in last quarter. It took two or three quarters for it to really work its way into a good place and we anticipate it to be the same thing in the U.S.
What’s different about the U.S. was it felt riskier to do upfront because we had 50 million listings in stores. So we had roughly 30 million core listings, 50 million SIF listings that were not in core search. And coming out of the quarter we moved all 50 million of those SIF listings into core search and added 10 million new listings and frankly, our core search engine held up in Q2 in the U.S. But we held the auction, fixed price mix constant and that’s what we’re now adjusting and will adjust between now and the end of the year.
We are always quite thoughtful in search to make sure that we don’t -- it’s such a powerful part of our site, we need to make sure that we don’t overcorrect, but we’ll make a series of incremental changes and that combined with the changes in trust, that combined with the changes in the vertical experiences that I described earlier, are what, the formula that we’re pursuing that we think will allow us to be the winner in the secondary market or off price market.

The other macro factor we saw, again, Bob referenced earlier, is the -- in essence it was the weakening euro reduced imports to Europe both from the U.S. and from Asia. And so to call that a strengthening dollar or weakening euro, but it because Asia is pegged to the dollar, it had an impact on the exports out of the U.S. and exports out of Asia into Europe. And again, we don’t see that really changing in the second half of the year, although, far be it for us to be predictors of currencies.
So we’re focused on -- we’re trying to focus on what we can control and we can’t control the macro environment. We have some caution around the macro environment, and we’re focused on what we can control, which is our user experience and our execution.

And first, I would say that virtually every metric we look at both external metrics you see and our own internal metrics, particularly with PayPal and its visibility it has to a broader base of merchants and we did see a big slowdown in the end of May and during the course of June.
And so that does, in terms of the guidance we provided, while we have some things that we feel great about, the guidance we provided is influenced by what I’d characterize as a cautious outlook on the U.S. economy based on what happened in the month of June, so just a fine point on John’s comments.
In terms of cash, yeah, we’ve had this opportunity/challenge for a while of having this strong balance sheet, wonderful cash position and how do we ensure we get that cash in the right place, so we have ultimate flexibility to deploy as appropriate.
As you know, we are successful with very legitimate business purposes to bring a couple of billion dollars back, two years ago, $1 billion back at the end of last year. So we continue to look for ways to repatriate in a tax efficient manner.
One of the possibilities is, we feel very good about the Bill Me Later loan portfolio and the prospects for growth here in the U.S. So that growth will be a user of cash. At the same time, we’d love to be able to use our offshore cash in our Luxembourg bank to be the source of cash to finance that growth and that’s something that we continue to pursue.
And we’ll keep you updated as we go but our challenge is great balance sheet, great cash flows, get it in the right place and have ultimate flexibility to do the things we think are going to drive long-term shareholder value.

And then secondly, if I look at your full year guidance, a $0.10 reduction in EPS due to FX equates to about $130 million net income impact and about $160 million pre-tax income impact, which seems like quite a big number on the $250 million revenue impact?

First, I think your first question, James, was related to our hedging coming into the second quarter and I’ll macro and then deep dive. First, for the most part, we try to -- within a quarter try to hedge the lion’s share of our earnings at risk in the quarter. So we were fairly well protected coming into Q2. Obviously, what happened was revenue relative to our guidance was probably off by about $35 million due to currency changes.
In terms of income or EPS, the negative impact was about [half cent]. So the $35 million topline challenges, we had hedged a portion of that and had a relatively modest impact on EPS in the quarter, relative to where we were on April 20th, whenever our last earnings call was. And so we try to protect our earnings within the quarter at the beginning of the quarter for the most part against dramatic swings.
In terms of lower full year, the guidance we gave, the 250 and the $0.10, that was based on, we gave you our outlook for the year back in January and we’re trying to update where we were then and where we are now and isolating for currency. And the $250 million is simply at the simplistic level, over half of our business is outside the U.S.
It’s primarily the euro, the pound and the Aussie dollar. Those from the beginning of the year to today have depreciated quite a bit vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar and we need to bring those earnings back in the second half or for the full year.
It did impact our EPS in the first quarter, it did impact it in the second quarter and through the first half I would say about $100 million topline and $0.03 bottom line we’ve already had to deal with. For the second half it will be another $150 million and $0.06 to $0.07 on the bottom line because a lot of our hedging goes in place at the beginning of the quarter.
So full year $250 million, $0.10 in earnings, important to emphasize that the lion’s share of that will be offset by the progress and the momentum we’re seeing on the PayPal business both topline and through margin, operating margin expansion.

We're positioning PayPal to be the leader in global online payments and we're positioning eBay to continue as a leader in e-commerce, with competitive strength as the world's largest online marketplace for secondary or off-price, new and pre-owned merchandise. And we're working towards achieving these goals in three ways. First, we're becoming a more customer-driven organization. We have three clear customer metrics: net promoter score, velocity and market share, and we've tied a portion of management's compensation to customer satisfaction. Second, we're becoming a more technology-driven company, with an increasing commitment to innovation. Our efforts in mobile, platform and the launch of products, such as our fashion vertical, illustrate our commitment and increasing pace of innovation. And third, we're operating more efficiently. We're taking $2 billion out of our cost structure over a three-year period and reinvesting in our growth priorities. 
And now, our Q2 results. Both revenue and earnings exceeded our guidance. Excluding Skype, revenue increased 15% and non-GAAP EPS was up 18% year-over-year. PayPal continued its strong revenue and total payment volume growth, and eBay's turnaround continued with progress in key metrics.  We continue to focus on delivering strong financial results, managing a healthy balance sheet and making the necessary investments that satisfy our customers, and compete and win. 
Our Q2 results also demonstrate the global strength and increasing diversity of our company. Almost 60% of the eBay Marketplace revenue was generated outside the U.S., and more than 60% of PayPal's total payment volume comes from our Merchant Services business off of eBay. The diverse nature of our portfolio gives us the ability to balance opportunities and challenges across our businesses and geographies. 
Now let's take a look at the results from each business unit. PayPal had another great quarter. We added 1 million new accounts each month during Q2, and PayPal now has 87 million active accounts. Penetration on eBay continue to increase and our Merchant Services business grew over 40% for the third quarter in a row. Overall, PayPal continues to grow significantly faster than global e-commerce and gain share as the leading online payment method. 
As we continue to execute our plan to grow merchants and consumers, we're also taking steps to accelerate PayPal's competitive position globally and drive payments innovation. I want to touch on three brief examples in today's call. First, we're aggressively expanding PayPal's presence across Asia through pursuit of strategic relationships. For example, our previously announced partnership with China UnionPay is on track to launch in Q3, giving millions of Chinese consumers the ability to shop online and pay with PayPal. And in Q2, PayPal launched on Alibabas.com's (sic) [Alibaba.com's] AliExpress platform, giving small merchants worldwide a faster, safer way to pay for wholesale merchandise from China. 
In Japan, PayPal went wide with SoftBank Payment services and were now on the top five gateways in that country, providing access to a market with more than $25 billion in addressable spend. We've also announced significant mobile deals in Singapore and Malaysia to help make the mobile wallet a reality for millions of new consumers in Asia. For example, PayPal's mobile platform was chosen by the Singapore government to power its m-commerce infrastructure. And in Malaysia, PayPal signed a deal with Maxis, the country's largest telco operator, to provide PayPal to Maxis' 12 million subscribers on its mobile, online and Internet TV platforms. These are just a few of the examples illustrating PayPal's significant opportunities in Asia. 
We're also driving significant product innovation with Bill Me Later, both within the PayPal wallet and as a separate payment option. Merchants are recognizing the potential for Bill Me Later to help drive sales and higher order value, and consumers like the benefits of online credit as an easy payment option. As a result, Bill Me Later's growth in Q2 is accelerating. And in Q2, we also began testing Bill Me Later as the checkout option on eBay. Early results show that when buyers use BML on eBay, their purchases are generally 2x larger than the average order value on eBay. More to come on that in future quarters. 
And my third example of how PayPal is driving growth and innovation is in mobile payments. More than 2.5 million people have downloaded PayPal's mobile apps. And in the first six months of this year, PayPal has generated nearly twice the mobile payment volume than it did for all of 2009. 
In the U.S., in Q2, PayPal introduced Mobile Express Checkout, which is designed to vastly improve the mobile shopping experience for consumers and PayPal merchants. Mobile Express Checkout offers consumers the same frictionless payment experience on the mobile phone that PayPal customers enjoy online. And Mobile Express Checkout offers PayPal merchants an easy way to extend their business to the mobile phone. All in all, PayPal continues to make progress towards achieving its enormous potential to be the clear leader in online and mobile payments. 
Now let's turn to eBay. We continue to make progress in our multi-year turnaround, with ongoing improvements in the buying and selling inexperience, and growing innovation in areas such as mobile and fashion. For the quarter, Marketplace revenue was up 11% year-over-year, with solid performance on the underlying customer metrics. Net promoter scores were up for top and active buyers in the U.S., U.K. and Germany, and buyers are buying with greater frequency. 
Sold item growth continued to be strong at 11% globally. And when we look at GMV in our three largest markets, we gained share in the U.K., driving mid-teens growth in Q2. We performed well in Germany, with GMV and sold items accelerating from Q1. However, in the U.S., we grew more slowly than the market. 
We're not satisfied with our U.S. results, while clearly, we saw consumer spending soften during the quarter and the strengthening dollar hurt GMV exports from the U.S. However, we aim to do better in this market. Now we believe the changes we implemented in the U.S. at the end of Q1 to offer more competitive pricing for sellers and better experiences for buyers, ultimately, will have the same positive impact we've seen in Europe. However, we're in the midst of making a series of format and search adjustments following that price change just as we had to do last year in Europe. But overall, we're not satisfied and we're on top of it. 
That said, overall buyer satisfaction on eBay is continuing to improve. As I mentioned a minute ago, buyer net promoter scores are up in each of our major markets. This is driven by increased trust on our marketplace. Bad buyer experiences are decreasing and sellers across the site are improving their service and eBay Buyer Protection is improving buyer satisfaction. Buyer Protection allows buyers to shop on eBay with confidence. 
We've also launched a couple of innovative shopping experiences. Our new fashion vertical offers a more compelling and visual shopping experience, better surfacing our deep inventory in this $5 billion-plus eBay category. We're making strong progress in working with the top fashion brands in Europe and the U.S., and we're getting great feedback from buyers and sellers on the fashion experience, and our teams are rapidly building suggestions into, say, improvements. And mobile innovation is another way we're creating better shopping experience on eBay. We're well on our way to delivering $1.5 billion of mobile GMV this year, more than 2.5x of our volume in 2009. Our main eBay iPhone app has been downloaded almost 11 million times, and eBay is consistently a top free lifestyle app on the iPad. 
Our eBay's Selling app, which we just launched in the U.K., has quickly become a top 10 out there and is already generating an average of more than 2,000 listings per day. So we're continuing to expand the availability of our applications across all platforms, iPhone, Blackberry and Android, so that we are reaching millions of potential new users worldwide. 
In addition, in Q2, we acquired the popular RedLaser iPhone app. We'll be integrating this bar code scanning technology into our eBay apps, providing users with fast and easy selling and comparison shopping information. We'll also be enhancing selection on this free stand-alone RedLaser app by adding eBay's more than 200 million listings, as well as inventory from 7,000 merchants from Shopping.com. 
Turning briefly to our adjacent e-commerce formats, our Classifieds business was up 7% in Q2, with strong growth in Canada and Germany. And StubHub had another great quarter, continuing to reinforce its position as the tickets marketplace that offers the most choice and availability. Q2 ticket demand was stronger for sporting events, including the NBA and NHL playoffs and Major League Baseball. StubHub also expanded in the mobile commerce with the launch of its iPhone application. 
So in summary, with the first half of 2010 behind us, we continue to make progress against our three-year growth objectives and deliver on our financial commitments. PayPal is strong and has great potential and momentum. And eBay continues to make progress in key metrics, with strength in Asia and in the U.K., and solid performance in Germany. 
We still have work to do in the U.S., our toughest, most competitive market, and we're not satisfied. However, we remain confident that our turnaround is on track and we continue to target having our aggregate marketplaces businesses grow e-commerce global rates for the year. 
We're a strong company, with great competitive assets in E-Commerce and Payments. And across our two businesses, we will continue to focus on our customers, innovate and drive operating efficiencies to invest in growth. Now I'll turn it over to Bob for more details on the quarter and our financial outlook before we take questions."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. All growth rates mentioned in my prepared remarks represent year-over-year comparisons, unless I clarify otherwise. 
Overall, we delivered strong second quarter results. We came in above our guidance on both the top and bottom line despite the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. We continue to execute against our strategic priorities during the quarter. PayPal increased global share of e-commerce off of eBay and increased penetration on eBay, and the marketplaces turnaround remains on track. Solid sold items growth was partially offset by lower ASPs. 
We're pleased with the results we've achieved in the first half of the year. PayPal is performing better than expectations and the Marketplace business is on track with the plans we laid out at the beginning of the year. 
Geographically, Europe growth is up, Asia is in line and the U.S. is below our expectations. However, the stronger U.S. dollar will have a significant impact on both the top and bottom line. As a result, we're modestly adjusting full year guidance, and I'll discuss this in more detail later in the call. 
Our combined businesses generated net revenues of $2.2 billion in the second quarter, a 6% increase or 15% excluding Skype from Q2 '09. Foreign exchange decreased growth by one point and our acquisition of Gmarket increased growth by three points, resulting in organic revenue growth of 13%. 
Second quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.40, an 8% increase or 18% excluding Skype. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.1%, up 40 basis points from Q2 '09. The year-over-year increases were primarily due to volume leverage and productivity gain, partially offset by a lower take rate. 
We generated $519 million of free cash flow in the quarter. CapEx as a percentage of revenue was 9%, which was higher than recent quarters due to the timing of some expenses for our new mega data center we opened in Utah in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect this rate to be up slightly versus last year. Return on invested capital was 22.8% on a trailing 12-month basis, the third consecutive quarter of improvement reflecting higher earnings growth. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. Starting with our Payments business, PayPal posted another great quarter. Total Payments revenue increased 22% to $817 million. Total Payment volume increased 28% to $21.4 billion. Geographically, TPV growth was 23% in the U.S. and 37% internationally. We continue to expand our global footprint, with 40% of our TPV from outside the U.S. for the quarter compared to 38% in the second quarter of last year. 
PayPal's Merchant Services business had another excellent quarter, driven by increases in the number of merchants who accept PayPal, the number of active accounts and our share of checkout. Merchant Services' TPV grew 43% in the quarter and now accounts for 61% of PayPal's total TPV. 
On the eBay platform, PayPal's TPV growth rate was 9%. Penetration of addressable GMV increased 420 basis points, which was driven by Germany, Australia and Italy. PayPal's transaction margin was also strong, increasing to 62.8% in the quarter. Although global take rate was down 17 basis points and transaction expense was up modestly, these effects were offset by a significant improvement in transaction losses, which was primarily a function of better fraud detection and prevention, along with the shift of much of the cost of our Buyer Protection Program from PayPal to marketplaces.
PayPal's segment margin came in at 19.9% in the quarter, up 380 basis points year-over-year. The increase from last year was primarily the result of operating leverage on volume, higher transaction margins and improvement at BML. 
Now let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later. Bill Me Later's gross receivable balance at quarter end was $691 million, up 25%. The quality of the portfolio continues to improve and the charge-off rate has continued to decline, down to 8.6% from 9.5% in Q1 2010. Risk-adjusted margin improved 130 bps sequentially to 12.8%. Within the last year, we fully integrated Bill Me Later into the PayPal wallet, began testing Bill Me Later in eBay listings and started using eBay Inc. data, with the goal of reducing the customer decline rate without taking on additional risks. 
Now let's move to our Marketplaces business. Overall, Marketplaces achieved net revenues of $1.4 billion, an 11% increase. Marketplaces FX-neutral revenue accelerated five points from the first quarter, driven by a higher take rate, lower contract expense and higher ad-based revenues. Transaction revenue was up 12%, and marketing services and other revenue was up 7%. 
Marketplaces generated 58% of its revenue internationally this quarter. Marketing services and other grew 7% in the quarter and represents 15% of Marketplaces revenue. Our Classifieds business grew 7%, with strong growth coming from Canada and mobile [mobile.de]. Total global advertising revenue increased 9%, driven by strength in Europe and APAC display advertising.
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces operational metrics. Active users increased to 92 million, up 4% year-over-year. Sold items, excluding Gmarket, grew 11%, geographically driven by the U.K. and China's cross-border trade. U.S. core GMV was 2% in the quarter, down four points from Q1. The decline was driven by lower ASPs, due to broader selection of well-priced inventory and reduced cross-border trade, primarily to Europe, as European currencies weakened. As John indicated earlier, we feel good about the expanded selection and better deals on the site, but we have work to do to increase velocity of sold items. 
International core GMV grew 20%, or 21% on an FX neutral basis. The growth in both the U.K. and Germany continued to be strong and accelerated for the quarter. China's cross-border trade remains one of our fastest-growing markets, but was negatively impacted by the weakening of the euro and the British pound. 
Marketplaces segment margin was up 40% in the quarter, down 220 basis points from a year ago. The main drivers of the change include increased investments to continue to build trust, value and selection, as well as the inclusion of Gmarket, which we acquired in June of last year. These were partially offset by savings from our operational excellence initiatives. 
Global take rate was 8.03% in the quarter, up 16 bps for from last year, or up 10 bps, excluding vehicles, StubHub and Gmarket. The take rate increase was driven by higher velocity on lower-priced items and lower PowerSeller discounts versus last year. 
Turning to operating expenses. In Q2, our operating expenses were 44% of revenue, essentially in line with last year. We've invested more in product while leveraging our G&A infrastructure. We expect this trend to continue. 
From a cash perspective, we generated free cash flow of $519 million during the quarter. Cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments totaled $5.6 billion at quarter end. Of this, we held approximately $1.2 billion in the U.S. 
Now let me turn to guidance. We have outperformed our expectations for the first half of the year, but we exit the first half with a bit of caution. As we head into the second half, our guidance reflects a few things: first, PayPal will continue to perform well; second, European currencies will remain relatively weak versus the U.S. dollar; and third, the U.S. e-commerce market will be relatively slow. 
The implications on these on our full year guidance we originally provided in January are as follows: PayPal will continue to perform well on the top and bottom line. For the full year, this will contribute an additional $100 million in revenue or $0.06 to $0.08 in earnings per share. Market prices is on track. Geographically, Europe growth is stronger, Asia is in line and the U.S. and cross-border trade are weaker. Third, the stronger dollar will hurt revenue by approximately $250 million or $0.09 to $0.11 in EPS for the full year. 
So for the full year, we now anticipate revenue of $8.8 billion to $9.0 billion, representing growth of 9% to 11%, excluding Skype. And we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $1.60 to $1.65, representing growth of 9% to 12%, also excluding Skype. 
The implications on the third quarter are as follows: we anticipate revenue of $2.13 billion to $2.18 billion, this represents growth of 4% to 6% excluding Skype; and we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $0.35 to $0.37, which represents growth of 0% to 6%, excluding Skype. On a year-over-year basis, we expect the stronger dollar to have a negative impact on Q3 results of approximately $70 million in revenue and approximately $0.02 in earnings per share.
In summary, we had a strong first half, with double-digit top and bottom line growth. Our global footprint is expanding, innovation is accelerating and ops excellence enables investments into trust, value and selection. PayPal has outperformed our expectations, and the Marketplace business is on track and the stronger dollar creates real challenges giving our global footprint. We're confident, but cautious, as we enter the second half of the year. And now, we'd be happy to answer your question. Operator?"

Let me take each of those in turn. In terms of active user growth, what's encouraging is that when you peel beneath a surface, what's happening is what we've been aiming toward, which is users are coming back more frequently and they're buying more. And that then is leading to new users because we think of word of mouth. The market that's most pronounced then is in the U.K., where, as I mentioned, we're growing faster than the market. We're growing in the mid-teens in the U.K., and we're beginning to see this dynamic, where the site improved, the site experiences improved. Our existing customers like it. They're coming back more frequently, buying more, and we're beginning to see a pickup in new users as well. So we're far from being done with where we want to go and need to go, but we're encouraged by some of those signs. With respect to mobile users, here is what's interesting. It is there are not pure mobile users or pure website users. There are types of users who are using both devices. And what we're seeing is mobile increases the intensity of the number of times they touch eBay, the number of times they use eBay. And so someone may search for an item on their laptop or their desktop, put it into their My eBay and then they actually buy it the next day standing in line with a Starbucks. Or they may be standing in line with a Starbucks, do a search, put into their My eBay and actually close it later on their laptop. So we're looking at mobile as an extension of the way people interact with eBay rather than being a separate set of customers. And so that's why we doubled down or continue to double down on mobile, and ensure we're innovating this RedLaser application, something that we feel excited about because it, again, brings eBay's 200 million listings to consumers when they're in stores in the offline world. So mobile's increasing the intensity of interaction with eBay."

Relative to the U.S. GMV decline from 6% to 2%, two points of that was driven by lower cross-border trade. And again, we saw a fairly direct tight correlation between the weakening of the European currencies and the demand on U.S. products throughout the course of the quarter. So overall, it was about a point in total. It impacted U.S. GMV more than Rest of World. And our challenge as we go into the second half of the year, as currency stay where they are, is how do we highlight some of the great deals of our European sellers and merchants into our stronger-currency countries like the U.S."

I think the Marketplace is in a better place than it has been in the last couple of years, but I'm still not, I'm still not satisfied. So we laid out a three-year plan. We're halfway through it. And I'm pleased with progress on some fronts, but also believe we will make a lot more progress in the next six to 18 months. And the kind of saying, I think, you're going to really begin to see more of is things analogous to the fashion experience on the core eBay business. And any of you that haven't gotten into that Fashion tab, I encourage you to go into it. In fact, you could check today the Fashion Vault, we have TAG Heuer watches, luxury off-price watches. You'll see most of men's watches are sold out already. But we're bringing in new kinds of inventory. We ran with Brooks Brothers last week and bring in new kinds of inventory and bring in to life in very different ways. And so that Fashion application, if you will, is the first vertical we built on our new search platform, and is a precursor of additional vertical experiences that will come over the next six to 18 months. And so with respect to marketing, the most valuable indicator, if our changes are working, are our buyers buying more and then are they coming back. In the second half this year, we will spend roughly a comparable amount in marketing than we did in the second half of last year. We'll probably lean in a little bit. We'll spend a little bit more toward loyalty, eBay Bucks and a little bit less toward things like Microsoft cashback because, obviously, that program is stopping. And as we move into 2011, I believe we will be on a trajectory where our user experience, say, by midway next year, will be in a place where, I think, we can go back to inactive eBay users and really market to them. So a lot of work to be done. We've got some tweaks to make in U.S. a search, given the recent changes there. But I'm confident we're on track for the be in the right place over the next 12 to 18 months."

The part that we're being a very aggressive on executing on right now is simply merchant acquisition. And as Bob just mentioned, we're adding new merchants, both large and small, in all regions of the world. And frankly, we see a reasonable amount of runway left in that. Second, we're working to ensure we improve consumer preference, which is to say, again, it's the frequency, the velocity, when I talk about our customer metrics, which is how frequently do consumers use PayPal. Are they using PayPal every time they see it online? It's getting the let's be everywhere and then let's get in consumers using it everywhere. And I would say we're getting better at that. We're getting better at sort of basic marketing, basic consumer preference, consumer frequency in PayPal. And then the third angle that is becoming increasingly important, frankly, is innovation. And whether that is digital goods, whether that's mobile payments, frankly, whether that's credit and BML, I mentioned earlier some of the innovative products on credit, or weather it's -- frankly, we're now getting pulled offline by some large merchants who view a mobile-payment approach on PayPal as a way to extend their private-label cards and other in-store experiences. So as you know, we opened up our platform to help us expand our capacity for innovation. So I don't see any one area as a risk. I just see a market that is quite large where the opportunity is expanding, and we need to ensure we execute well across all those fronts. And so if you were to hear both what Scott Thompson be saying to his team and what Bob and I  are constantly focusing on the PayPal is let's ensure we're executing on the opportunities that are in front of us."

And so I'm not satisfied with where we are in Q2, but I do think we're on the right path. And here's sort of the fact. As you know, we launched a significant pricing and search change on April 1 in the U.S. In essence, the same change that we had done in the U.K. and Germany over the previous 12 to 18 months. And we knew the stakes are bigger because there simply were a lot more listings that were going to be impacted in the U.S. And so what we've seen is selection in core search is up. So the core search engine in the U.S. is now processing 3x as many listings at the end of the quarter than it did at the beginning of the quarter, as the stores inventory and, frankly, a lot of new listings came on. So selection is up for U.S. consumers in core search, and they're getting better deals, and we saw that in ASP. ASP, frankly, came down even more than we thought because a lot of the lower-price items from the store inventory now came in core search and people were buying them, so that we felt good about. What did not increase, however, was velocity. Sold item growth was 5% in the U.S. in Q2. That was a two-point deceleration from Q1. And we want that to go up. We want that to go up over time as it has in Europe. And so we're in the midst of making some adjustments in the format mix of auctions and fixed price. We brought a lot of the store's inventory came on in fixed price. And we kept our exposure auction and fixed-price exposure the same, and we're now going to be increasing gently the fixed-price exposure, as well as ensuring that higher ASP items are getting appropriate visibility. So these are actually analogous to the fine-tuning we had to do in Europe last year. And we're already on it, and we will be doing that over the next remainder of the year. And then we're going to continue on the product innovation in the U.S., as well as the rest of the world. TSA is our first launch. We're looking to go through additional vertical such as Technology and Parts and improving that user experience. And then the last thing I'd highlight in the U.S. that, I think, or I know you'll see us a little more from, eBay Buyer Protection. I mentioned that trust on eBay is improving. Interestingly, consumers or buyers that have had experience with the eBay Buyer Protection report significant increase of satisfaction after they've had it because they either got their item or they got their money back. And yet our research is saying actually not many users are yet aware of eBay Buyer Protection, so you'll see us increasing the awareness around the eBay Buyer Protection, which we hope continues to give U.S. consumers confidence that eBay is a trusted Marketplace where they can find a wide selection of great deals. So our Lorrie Norrington and our U.S. team are very on top of executing between now and the remainder of the year."

What we said a year ago is that our source of differentiation, the thing that we were going to be known for was having the best deals on what we call secondary market. Increasingly, we're calling it off-price inventory, right? It can be new inventory, it can be pre-owned inventory, but it's off-price. Think about it as the online outlet mall. And our target segment are shopping enthusiasts. And so we picked Clothing as the first category to really focus on because it's a large segment that, frankly, is not yet come online that much. And it requires innovation to come online because it's almost an unnatural act to buy clothing online because you want to try it on. And so it's already was one of the largest categories on eBay with $5 billion of GMV. We brought a lot of additional inventory on, things like, I mentioned earlier, the TAG Heuer watches in our Fashion Vault. If you go to the U.K. site, you'll see fashion outlets. And Savile Row has opened up a store on eBay, where they're selling off-price Savile Row suits and Brook Brothers (sic) [Brooks Brothers] and others. So we're bringing on additional inventory, and then that user experience you see in the Fashion tab on eBay or on the Fashion app on the iPhone is a more powerful way to bring that inventory to life for the shopping enthusiasts. Now I go through that because we will be repeating that same formula, if you will, in Consumer Electronics and Auto Parts and other categories over the next six to 18 months, where we'll go out and try to identify what are the best sources of off-price inventory. Our eBay sellers, the 25 million eBay sellers provide a lot of that. But there are additional sources of inventory that we can now add on and scale, and so whether that's Auto Parts inventory or whether that's Consumer Electronics, they want to go out and acquire the inventory. And then with our new search platform, we have more capacity or more flexibility to build category-specific search experiences. And you'll see us over the next 12 to 18 months do that in Technology and in Auto Parts, and then we'll just continue working our way down the line."

Let me just summarize what we did in Europe and then what the results were and then I'll talk about the U.S. In Europe, we actually made separate changes around auction pricing and around fixed pricing in Germany and the U.K. And so we made four different pricing changes across the two countries over what was a nine-month period in the Q4 of '08 and the first quarter of '09. And we did it because we weren't certain what the short-term impact would be and we wanted to make sure we moderated any risk. And after each one, we made a series of adjustments to try to, if you will, balance the Marketplace. The net result was in the sort of latter half, let's say, fourth quarter of 2009, we saw particularly the U.K. Marketplace, which is the first place we did it, start to have a good balance of where business sellers were listing in fixed-price format in volume and selling in fixed-price format, and consumer sellers were listing in auction format, which was a better way for them to sell. And that combination was leading to more velocity in the U.K. and in the German site. And as what I've said in the last quarter, it took two, three quarters for it to really work its way into a good place, and we anticipate it to be the same thing in the U.S. What's different about the U.S. was it felt riskier to do upfront because we had 50 million listings in the stores. So we had roughly 30 million core listing, 50 million fixed listings, so we're not in core search. And coming out of the quarter, we moved all 50 million of our fixed listings in the core search and added 10 million new listings. And frankly, our core search engine held up in Q2 in the U.S. But we held the auction fixed-price constant and that's what we're now adjusting, and we'll adjust between now and the end of the year. We're always quite thoughtful in search to make sure that we don't -- it's such a powerful part of our site. We need to make sure that we don't overcorrect, but we'll make a series of incremental changes. And that combined with the changes in trust, that combined with the changes in the vertical experiences that I described earlier, are what the formula that we're pursuing that we think will allow us to be the winner in the secondary market or off-price market."

And we saw that on eBay and in the PayPal Merchant Services business in the U.S. So that's why Bob said we're cautious in the U.S. about the second half of the year in terms of a macro environment. The other macro factor we saw, again, Bob referenced earlier, is the -- in essence, it was the weakening euro reduced imports to Europe, both from the U.S. and from Asia. And so they call that a strengthening dollar weakening euro. But because it's just peg to the dollar, it had an impact on the exports out of the U.S. and exports out of Asia into Europe. And again, we don't see that really changing in the second half of the year, although far be it for us to be predictors of currencies. So we're focused on -- we're trying to focus on what we can control, and we can't control the macro environment.

First, I would say that virtually every metric we look at, both external metrics and our own internal metrics stick with PayPal and its the visibility it has to a broader base of merchants. We did see a bit slowdown in the end of May and during the course of June. And that does in terms of the guidance we provided and while we have some things that we feel great about, the guidance we provided is influenced by what I'd characterize as a cautious outlook on U.S. economy based on what happened in the month of June. So just a fine point on John's comments. In terms of cash, we've had this opportunities less challenged for a while. We're having this strong balance sheet, wonderful cash position and how do we ensure we get that cash in the right place so we have ultimate flexibility to deploy as appropriate. As you know, we're successful with very legitimate business purposes to bring in a couple of billion dollars back two years ago, $1 billion back at the end of last year. So we continue to look for ways to repatriate in tax efficient manner. One of the possibilities there is we feel very good about the Bill Me Later Loan portfolio and the prospects for our growth here in the U.S. So that growth will be a user of cash. At the same time, we'd love to be able to use our offshore cash in our Luxembourg Bank to be the source of cash to finance that growth, and that's something that we continue to pursue. And we'll keep you updated as we go. But our challenge is great balance sheet, great cash flows, get it in the right place and have ultimate flexibility to do the things we think are going to drive long-term shareholder value."

First, for the most part, we tried to, within the quarter, tried to hedge the lion's share of our earnings at risk in the quarter. So we were fairly well protected coming into Q2. Obviously, what happened was revenue relative to our guidance was probably off by about $35 million due to currency changes. In terms of income or EPS, the negative impact is about $0.005. So the $35 million top line challenge is we had hedged a portion of that and had a relatively modest impact on EPS in the quarter relative to where we were on April 20, whenever our last earnings call was. But we tried to protect our earnings within the quarter, at the beginning of the quarter, for the most part, against dramatic swings. In terms of our full year, the guidance we gave, the $250 million and the $0.10, that was based on -- we gave you our outlook for the year back in January, and we're trying to update where we were then and where we are now and isolating foreign currency. And the $250 million is simply -- at the simplistic level, over half of our business is outside the U.S. It's primary the euro, the pound and the Aussie dollar. Those from the beginning of the year to today have depreciated quite a bit vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, and we need to bring those earnings back in the second half or for the full year. It did impact our EPS in the first quarter. It did impact it in the second quarter. And through the this first half, I'd say about $100 million top line and $0.03 bottom line, we've already had to deal with. So the second half, it will be another $150 million and $0.06 to $0.07 on the bottom line because a lot of our hedging goes in place at the beginning of the quarter, so full year, $250 million, $0.10 in earnings. Important to emphasize that the lion's share that will be offset by the progress and the momentum we're seeing on the PayPal business, both top line and through operating margin expansion."

This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet, and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of the eBay website at investor.ebayinc.com. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. 
In addition, management may make forward-looking statements relating to our future performance that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected financial results for the third quarter and full year 2010 and future growth in the Marketplaces and Payments businesses. 
Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, the continuation or worsening of the global economic downturn; changes in political, business and economic conditions; foreign exchange rate fluctuations; the impact and integration of recent and future acquisitions; our increasing need to grow revenues from existing users in established markets; an increasingly competitive environment for our businesses; the complexity of managing increasingly large enterprise with a broad range of businesses; our need to manage regulatory, tax, IP and litigation risks, including risks specific to PayPal, Bill Me Later and the financial industry; and our need to upgrade our technology and customer service infrastructure at reasonable cost, while adding new features and maintaining site stability. 
You can find more information about factors that could affect our operating results in our most recent annual report on our Form 10-K and our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q available at investor.ebayinc.com. You should not unduly rely on any forward-looking statements, and we assume no obligation to update them.

Today, I'll talk about our results for the quarter and our progress toward achieving our growth objectives. Bob will then give more details on the numbers and our guidance, and we'll take questions. 
I want to begin by reminding you of our strategic goals. We're positioning PayPal to be the leader in global online payments and we're positioning eBay to continue as a leader in e-commerce, with competitive strength as the world's largest online marketplace for secondary or off-price, new and pre-owned merchandise. And we're working towards achieving these goals in three ways. First, we're becoming a more customer-driven organization. We have three clear customer metrics: net promoter score, velocity and market share, and we've tied a portion of management's compensation to customer satisfaction. Second, we're becoming a more technology-driven company, with an increasing commitment to innovation. Our efforts in mobile, platform and the launch of products, such as our fashion vertical, illustrate our commitment and increasing pace of innovation. And third, we're operating more efficiently. We're taking $2 billion out of our cost structure over a three-year period and reinvesting in our growth priorities. 
And now, our Q2 results. Both revenue and earnings exceeded our guidance. Excluding Skype, revenue increased 15% and non-GAAP EPS was up 18% year-over-year. PayPal continued its strong revenue and total payment volume growth, and eBay's turnaround continued with progress in key metrics.  We continue to focus on delivering strong financial results, managing a healthy balance sheet and making the necessary investments that satisfy our customers, and compete and win. 
Our Q2 results also demonstrate the global strength and increasing diversity of our company. Almost 60% of the eBay Marketplace revenue was generated outside the U.S., and more than 60% of PayPal's total payment volume comes from our Merchant Services business off of eBay. The diverse nature of our portfolio gives us the ability to balance opportunities and challenges across our businesses and geographies. 
Now let's take a look at the results from each business unit. PayPal had another great quarter. We added 1 million new accounts each month during Q2, and PayPal now has 87 million active accounts. Penetration on eBay continue to increase and our Merchant Services business grew over 40% for the third quarter in a row. Overall, PayPal continues to grow significantly faster than global e-commerce and gain share as the leading online payment method. 
As we continue to execute our plan to grow merchants and consumers, we're also taking steps to accelerate PayPal's competitive position globally and drive payments innovation. I want to touch on three brief examples in today's call. First, we're aggressively expanding PayPal's presence across Asia through pursuit of strategic relationships. For example, our previously announced partnership with China UnionPay is on track to launch in Q3, giving millions of Chinese consumers the ability to shop online and pay with PayPal. And in Q2, PayPal launched on Alibabas.com's (sic) [Alibaba.com's] AliExpress platform, giving small merchants worldwide a faster, safer way to pay for wholesale merchandise from China. 
In Japan, PayPal went wide with SoftBank Payment services and were now on the top five gateways in that country, providing access to a market with more than $25 billion in addressable spend. We've also announced significant mobile deals in Singapore and Malaysia to help make the mobile wallet a reality for millions of new consumers in Asia. For example, PayPal's mobile platform was chosen by the Singapore government to power its m-commerce infrastructure. And in Malaysia, PayPal signed a deal with Maxis, the country's largest telco operator, to provide PayPal to Maxis' 12 million subscribers on its mobile, online and Internet TV platforms. These are just a few of the examples illustrating PayPal's significant opportunities in Asia. 
We're also driving significant product innovation with Bill Me Later, both within the PayPal wallet and as a separate payment option. Merchants are recognizing the potential for Bill Me Later to help drive sales and higher order value, and consumers like the benefits of online credit as an easy payment option. As a result, Bill Me Later's growth in Q2 is accelerating. And in Q2, we also began testing Bill Me Later as the checkout option on eBay. Early results show that when buyers use BML on eBay, their purchases are generally 2x larger than the average order value on eBay. More to come on that in future quarters. 
And my third example of how PayPal is driving growth and innovation is in mobile payments. More than 2.5 million people have downloaded PayPal's mobile apps. And in the first six months of this year, PayPal has generated nearly twice the mobile payment volume than it did for all of 2009. 
In the U.S., in Q2, PayPal introduced Mobile Express Checkout, which is designed to vastly improve the mobile shopping experience for consumers and PayPal merchants. Mobile Express Checkout offers consumers the same frictionless payment experience on the mobile phone that PayPal customers enjoy online. And Mobile Express Checkout offers PayPal merchants an easy way to extend their business to the mobile phone. All in all, PayPal continues to make progress towards achieving its enormous potential to be the clear leader in online and mobile payments. 
Now let's turn to eBay. We continue to make progress in our multi-year turnaround, with ongoing improvements in the buying and selling inexperience, and growing innovation in areas such as mobile and fashion. For the quarter, Marketplace revenue was up 11% year-over-year, with solid performance on the underlying customer metrics. Net promoter scores were up for top and active buyers in the U.S., U.K. and Germany, and buyers are buying with greater frequency. 
Sold item growth continued to be strong at 11% globally. And when we look at GMV in our three largest markets, we gained share in the U.K., driving mid-teens growth in Q2. We performed well in Germany, with GMV and sold items accelerating from Q1. However, in the U.S., we grew more slowly than the market. 
We're not satisfied with our U.S. results, while clearly, we saw consumer spending soften during the quarter and the strengthening dollar hurt GMV exports from the U.S. However, we aim to do better in this market. Now we believe the changes we implemented in the U.S. at the end of Q1 to offer more competitive pricing for sellers and better experiences for buyers, ultimately, will have the same positive impact we've seen in Europe. However, we're in the midst of making a series of format and search adjustments following that price change just as we had to do last year in Europe. But overall, we're not satisfied and we're on top of it. 
That said, overall buyer satisfaction on eBay is continuing to improve. As I mentioned a minute ago, buyer net promoter scores are up in each of our major markets. This is driven by increased trust on our marketplace. Bad buyer experiences are decreasing and sellers across the site are improving their service and eBay Buyer Protection is improving buyer satisfaction. Buyer Protection allows buyers to shop on eBay with confidence. 
We've also launched a couple of innovative shopping experiences. Our new fashion vertical offers a more compelling and visual shopping experience, better surfacing our deep inventory in this $5 billion-plus eBay category. We're making strong progress in working with the top fashion brands in Europe and the U.S., and we're getting great feedback from buyers and sellers on the fashion experience, and our teams are rapidly building suggestions into, say, improvements. And mobile innovation is another way we're creating better shopping experience on eBay. We're well on our way to delivering $1.5 billion of mobile GMV this year, more than 2.5x of our volume in 2009. Our main eBay iPhone app has been downloaded almost 11 million times, and eBay is consistently a top free lifestyle app on the iPad. 
Our eBay's Selling app, which we just launched in the U.K., has quickly become a top 10 out there and is already generating an average of more than 2,000 listings per day. So we're continuing to expand the availability of our applications across all platforms, iPhone, Blackberry and Android, so that we are reaching millions of potential new users worldwide. 
In addition, in Q2, we acquired the popular RedLaser iPhone app. We'll be integrating this bar code scanning technology into our eBay apps, providing users with fast and easy selling and comparison shopping information. We'll also be enhancing selection on this free stand-alone RedLaser app by adding eBay's more than 200 million listings, as well as inventory from 7,000 merchants from Shopping.com. 
Turning briefly to our adjacent e-commerce formats, our Classifieds business was up 7% in Q2, with strong growth in Canada and Germany. And StubHub had another great quarter, continuing to reinforce its position as the tickets marketplace that offers the most choice and availability. Q2 ticket demand was stronger for sporting events, including the NBA and NHL playoffs and Major League Baseball. StubHub also expanded in the mobile commerce with the launch of its iPhone application. 
So in summary, with the first half of 2010 behind us, we continue to make progress against our three-year growth objectives and deliver on our financial commitments. PayPal is strong and has great potential and momentum. And eBay continues to make progress in key metrics, with strength in Asia and in the U.K., and solid performance in Germany. 
We still have work to do in the U.S., our toughest, most competitive market, and we're not satisfied. However, we remain confident that our turnaround is on track and we continue to target having our aggregate marketplaces businesses grow e-commerce global rates for the year. 
We're a strong company, with great competitive assets in E-Commerce and Payments. And across our two businesses, we will continue to focus on our customers, innovate and drive operating efficiencies to invest in growth. Now I'll turn it over to Bob for more details on the quarter and our financial outlook before we take questions."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. All growth rates mentioned in my prepared remarks represent year-over-year comparisons, unless I clarify otherwise. 
Overall, we delivered strong second quarter results. We came in above our guidance on both the top and bottom line despite the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. We continue to execute against our strategic priorities during the quarter. PayPal increased global share of e-commerce off of eBay and increased penetration on eBay, and the marketplaces turnaround remains on track. Solid sold items growth was partially offset by lower ASPs. 
We're pleased with the results we've achieved in the first half of the year. PayPal is performing better than expectations and the Marketplace business is on track with the plans we laid out at the beginning of the year. 
Geographically, Europe growth is up, Asia is in line and the U.S. is below our expectations. However, the stronger U.S. dollar will have a significant impact on both the top and bottom line. As a result, we're modestly adjusting full year guidance, and I'll discuss this in more detail later in the call. 
Our combined businesses generated net revenues of $2.2 billion in the second quarter, a 6% increase or 15% excluding Skype from Q2 '09. Foreign exchange decreased growth by one point and our acquisition of Gmarket increased growth by three points, resulting in organic revenue growth of 13%. 
Second quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.40, an 8% increase or 18% excluding Skype. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.1%, up 40 basis points from Q2 '09. The year-over-year increases were primarily due to volume leverage and productivity gain, partially offset by a lower take rate. 
We generated $519 million of free cash flow in the quarter. CapEx as a percentage of revenue was 9%, which was higher than recent quarters due to the timing of some expenses for our new mega data center we opened in Utah in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect this rate to be up slightly versus last year. Return on invested capital was 22.8% on a trailing 12-month basis, the third consecutive quarter of improvement reflecting higher earnings growth. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. Starting with our Payments business, PayPal posted another great quarter. Total Payments revenue increased 22% to $817 million. Total Payment volume increased 28% to $21.4 billion. Geographically, TPV growth was 23% in the U.S. and 37% internationally. We continue to expand our global footprint, with 40% of our TPV from outside the U.S. for the quarter compared to 38% in the second quarter of last year. 
PayPal's Merchant Services business had another excellent quarter, driven by increases in the number of merchants who accept PayPal, the number of active accounts and our share of checkout. Merchant Services' TPV grew 43% in the quarter and now accounts for 61% of PayPal's total TPV. 
On the eBay platform, PayPal's TPV growth rate was 9%. Penetration of addressable GMV increased 420 basis points, which was driven by Germany, Australia and Italy. PayPal's transaction margin was also strong, increasing to 62.8% in the quarter. Although global take rate was down 17 basis points and transaction expense was up modestly, these effects were offset by a significant improvement in transaction losses, which was primarily a function of better fraud detection and prevention, along with the shift of much of the cost of our Buyer Protection Program from PayPal to marketplaces.
PayPal's segment margin came in at 19.9% in the quarter, up 380 basis points year-over-year. The increase from last year was primarily the result of operating leverage on volume, higher transaction margins and improvement at BML. 
Now let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later. Bill Me Later's gross receivable balance at quarter end was $691 million, up 25%. The quality of the portfolio continues to improve and the charge-off rate has continued to decline, down to 8.6% from 9.5% in Q1 2010. Risk-adjusted margin improved 130 bps sequentially to 12.8%. Within the last year, we fully integrated Bill Me Later into the PayPal wallet, began testing Bill Me Later in eBay listings and started using eBay Inc. data, with the goal of reducing the customer decline rate without taking on additional risks. 
Now let's move to our Marketplaces business. Overall, Marketplaces achieved net revenues of $1.4 billion, an 11% increase. Marketplaces FX-neutral revenue accelerated five points from the first quarter, driven by a higher take rate, lower contract expense and higher ad-based revenues. Transaction revenue was up 12%, and marketing services and other revenue was up 7%. 
Marketplaces generated 58% of its revenue internationally this quarter. Marketing services and other grew 7% in the quarter and represents 15% of Marketplaces revenue. Our Classifieds business grew 7%, with strong growth coming from Canada and mobile [mobile.de]. Total global advertising revenue increased 9%, driven by strength in Europe and APAC display advertising.
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces operational metrics. Active users increased to 92 million, up 4% year-over-year. Sold items, excluding Gmarket, grew 11%, geographically driven by the U.K. and China's cross-border trade. U.S. core GMV was 2% in the quarter, down four points from Q1. The decline was driven by lower ASPs, due to broader selection of well-priced inventory and reduced cross-border trade, primarily to Europe, as European currencies weakened. As John indicated earlier, we feel good about the expanded selection and better deals on the site, but we have work to do to increase velocity of sold items. 
International core GMV grew 20%, or 21% on an FX neutral basis. The growth in both the U.K. and Germany continued to be strong and accelerated for the quarter. China's cross-border trade remains one of our fastest-growing markets, but was negatively impacted by the weakening of the euro and the British pound. 
Marketplaces segment margin was up 40% in the quarter, down 220 basis points from a year ago. The main drivers of the change include increased investments to continue to build trust, value and selection, as well as the inclusion of Gmarket, which we acquired in June of last year. These were partially offset by savings from our operational excellence initiatives. 
Global take rate was 8.03% in the quarter, up 16 bps for from last year, or up 10 bps, excluding vehicles, StubHub and Gmarket. The take rate increase was driven by higher velocity on lower-priced items and lower PowerSeller discounts versus last year. 
Turning to operating expenses. In Q2, our operating expenses were 44% of revenue, essentially in line with last year. We've invested more in product while leveraging our G&A infrastructure. We expect this trend to continue. 
From a cash perspective, we generated free cash flow of $519 million during the quarter. Cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments totaled $5.6 billion at quarter end. Of this, we held approximately $1.2 billion in the U.S. 
Now let me turn to guidance. We have outperformed our expectations for the first half of the year, but we exit the first half with a bit of caution. As we head into the second half, our guidance reflects a few things: first, PayPal will continue to perform well; second, European currencies will remain relatively weak versus the U.S. dollar; and third, the U.S. e-commerce market will be relatively slow. 
The implications on these on our full year guidance we originally provided in January are as follows: PayPal will continue to perform well on the top and bottom line. For the full year, this will contribute an additional $100 million in revenue or $0.06 to $0.08 in earnings per share. Market prices is on track. Geographically, Europe growth is stronger, Asia is in line and the U.S. and cross-border trade are weaker. Third, the stronger dollar will hurt revenue by approximately $250 million or $0.09 to $0.11 in EPS for the full year. 
So for the full year, we now anticipate revenue of $8.8 billion to $9.0 billion, representing growth of 9% to 11%, excluding Skype. And we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $1.60 to $1.65, representing growth of 9% to 12%, also excluding Skype. 
The implications on the third quarter are as follows: we anticipate revenue of $2.13 billion to $2.18 billion, this represents growth of 4% to 6% excluding Skype; and we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $0.35 to $0.37, which represents growth of 0% to 6%, excluding Skype. On a year-over-year basis, we expect the stronger dollar to have a negative impact on Q3 results of approximately $70 million in revenue and approximately $0.02 in earnings per share.
In summary, we had a strong first half, with double-digit top and bottom line growth. Our global footprint is expanding, innovation is accelerating and ops excellence enables investments into trust, value and selection. PayPal has outperformed our expectations, and the Marketplace business is on track and the stronger dollar creates real challenges giving our global footprint. We're confident, but cautious, as we enter the second half of the year. And now, we'd be happy to answer your question. Operator?"

Let me take each of those in turn. In terms of active user growth, what's encouraging is that when you peel beneath a surface, what's happening is what we've been aiming toward, which is users are coming back more frequently and they're buying more. And that then is leading to new users because we think of word of mouth. The market that's most pronounced then is in the U.K., where, as I mentioned, we're growing faster than the market. We're growing in the mid-teens in the U.K., and we're beginning to see this dynamic, where the site improved, the site experiences improved. Our existing customers like it. They're coming back more frequently, buying more, and we're beginning to see a pickup in new users as well. So we're far from being done with where we want to go and need to go, but we're encouraged by some of those signs. With respect to mobile users, here is what's interesting. It is there are not pure mobile users or pure website users. There are types of users who are using both devices. And what we're seeing is mobile increases the intensity of the number of times they touch eBay, the number of times they use eBay. And so someone may search for an item on their laptop or their desktop, put it into their My eBay and then they actually buy it the next day standing in line with a Starbucks. Or they may be standing in line with a Starbucks, do a search, put into their My eBay and actually close it later on their laptop. So we're looking at mobile as an extension of the way people interact with eBay rather than being a separate set of customers. And so that's why we doubled down or continue to double down on mobile, and ensure we're innovating this RedLaser application, something that we feel excited about because it, again, brings eBay's 200 million listings to consumers when they're in stores in the offline world. So mobile's increasing the intensity of interaction with eBay."

Relative to the U.S. GMV decline from 6% to 2%, two points of that was driven by lower cross-border trade. And again, we saw a fairly direct tight correlation between the weakening of the European currencies and the demand on U.S. products throughout the course of the quarter. So overall, it was about a point in total. It impacted U.S. GMV more than Rest of World. And our challenge as we go into the second half of the year, as currency stay where they are, is how do we highlight some of the great deals of our European sellers and merchants into our stronger-currency countries like the U.S."

I think the Marketplace is in a better place than it has been in the last couple of years, but I'm still not, I'm still not satisfied. So we laid out a three-year plan. We're halfway through it. And I'm pleased with progress on some fronts, but also believe we will make a lot more progress in the next six to 18 months. And the kind of saying, I think, you're going to really begin to see more of is things analogous to the fashion experience on the core eBay business. And any of you that haven't gotten into that Fashion tab, I encourage you to go into it. In fact, you could check today the Fashion Vault, we have TAG Heuer watches, luxury off-price watches. You'll see most of men's watches are sold out already. But we're bringing in new kinds of inventory. We ran with Brooks Brothers last week and bring in new kinds of inventory and bring in to life in very different ways. And so that Fashion application, if you will, is the first vertical we built on our new search platform, and is a precursor of additional vertical experiences that will come over the next six to 18 months. And so with respect to marketing, the most valuable indicator, if our changes are working, are our buyers buying more and then are they coming back. In the second half this year, we will spend roughly a comparable amount in marketing than we did in the second half of last year. We'll probably lean in a little bit. We'll spend a little bit more toward loyalty, eBay Bucks and a little bit less toward things like Microsoft cashback because, obviously, that program is stopping. And as we move into 2011, I believe we will be on a trajectory where our user experience, say, by midway next year, will be in a place where, I think, we can go back to inactive eBay users and really market to them. So a lot of work to be done. We've got some tweaks to make in U.S. a search, given the recent changes there. But I'm confident we're on track for the be in the right place over the next 12 to 18 months."

And as Bob just mentioned, we're adding new merchants, both large and small, in all regions of the world. And frankly, we see a reasonable amount of runway left in that. Second, we're working to ensure we improve consumer preference, which is to say, again, it's the frequency, the velocity, when I talk about our customer metrics, which is how frequently do consumers use PayPal. Are they using PayPal every time they see it online? It's getting the let's be everywhere and then let's get in consumers using it everywhere. And I would say we're getting better at that. We're getting better at sort of basic marketing, basic consumer preference, consumer frequency in PayPal. And then the third angle that is becoming increasingly important, frankly, is innovation. And whether that is digital goods, whether that's mobile payments, frankly, whether that's credit and BML, I mentioned earlier some of the innovative products on credit, or weather it's -- frankly, we're now getting pulled offline by some large merchants who view a mobile-payment approach on PayPal as a way to extend their private-label cards and other in-store experiences. So as you know, we opened up our platform to help us expand our capacity for innovation. So I don't see any one area as a risk. I just see a market that is quite large where the opportunity is expanding, and we need to ensure we execute well across all those fronts. And so if you were to hear both what Scott Thompson be saying to his team and what Bob and I  are constantly focusing on the PayPal is let's ensure we're executing on the opportunities that are in front of us."

And so I'm not satisfied with where we are in Q2, but I do think we're on the right path. And here's sort of the fact. As you know, we launched a significant pricing and search change on April 1 in the U.S. In essence, the same change that we had done in the U.K. and Germany over the previous 12 to 18 months. And we knew the stakes are bigger because there simply were a lot more listings that were going to be impacted in the U.S. And so what we've seen is selection in core search is up. So the core search engine in the U.S. is now processing 3x as many listings at the end of the quarter than it did at the beginning of the quarter, as the stores inventory and, frankly, a lot of new listings came on. So selection is up for U.S. consumers in core search, and they're getting better deals, and we saw that in ASP. ASP, frankly, came down even more than we thought because a lot of the lower-price items from the store inventory now came in core search and people were buying them, so that we felt good about. What did not increase, however, was velocity. Sold item growth was 5% in the U.S. in Q2. That was a two-point deceleration from Q1. And we want that to go up. We want that to go up over time as it has in Europe. And so we're in the midst of making some adjustments in the format mix of auctions and fixed price. We brought a lot of the store's inventory came on in fixed price. And we kept our exposure auction and fixed-price exposure the same, and we're now going to be increasing gently the fixed-price exposure, as well as ensuring that higher ASP items are getting appropriate visibility. So these are actually analogous to the fine-tuning we had to do in Europe last year. And we're already on it, and we will be doing that over the next remainder of the year. And then we're going to continue on the product innovation in the U.S., as well as the rest of the world. TSA is our first launch. We're looking to go through additional vertical such as Technology and Parts and improving that user experience. And then the last thing I'd highlight in the U.S. that, I think, or I know you'll see us a little more from, eBay Buyer Protection. I mentioned that trust on eBay is improving. Interestingly, consumers or buyers that have had experience with the eBay Buyer Protection report significant increase of satisfaction after they've had it because they either got their item or they got their money back. And yet our research is saying actually not many users are yet aware of eBay Buyer Protection, so you'll see us increasing the awareness around the eBay Buyer Protection, which we hope continues to give U.S. consumers confidence that eBay is a trusted Marketplace where they can find a wide selection of great deals. So our Lorrie Norrington and our U.S. team are very on top of executing between now and the remainder of the year."

Increasingly, we're calling it off-price inventory, right? It can be new inventory, it can be pre-owned inventory, but it's off-price. Think about it as the online outlet mall. And our target segment are shopping enthusiasts. And so we picked Clothing as the first category to really focus on because it's a large segment that, frankly, is not yet come online that much. And it requires innovation to come online because it's almost an unnatural act to buy clothing online because you want to try it on. And so it's already was one of the largest categories on eBay with $5 billion of GMV. We brought a lot of additional inventory on, things like, I mentioned earlier, the TAG Heuer watches in our Fashion Vault. If you go to the U.K. site, you'll see fashion outlets. And Savile Row has opened up a store on eBay, where they're selling off-price Savile Row suits and Brook Brothers (sic) [Brooks Brothers] and others. So we're bringing on additional inventory, and then that user experience you see in the Fashion tab on eBay or on the Fashion app on the iPhone is a more powerful way to bring that inventory to life for the shopping enthusiasts. Now I go through that because we will be repeating that same formula, if you will, in Consumer Electronics, in Auto Parts and other categories over the next six to 18 months, where we'll go out and try to identify what are the best sources of off-price inventory. Our eBay sellers, the 25 million eBay sellers provide a lot of that. But there are additional sources of inventory that we can now add on and scale, and so whether that's Auto Parts inventory or whether that's Consumer Electronics, we're going  to go out and acquire the inventory. And then with our new search platform, we have more capacity or more flexibility to build category-specific search experiences. And you'll see us over the next 12 to 18 months do that in Technology and in Auto Parts, and then we'll just continue working our way down the line."

Let me just summarize what we did in Europe and then what the results were and then I'll talk about the U.S. In Europe, we actually made separate changes around auction pricing and around fixed pricing in Germany and the U.K. And so we made four different pricing changes across the two countries over what was a nine-month period in the Q4 of '08 and the first quarter of '09. And we did it because we weren't certain of what the short-term impact would be and we wanted to make sure we moderated any risk. And after each one, we made a series of adjustments to try to, if you will, balance the Marketplace. The net result was in the sort of latter half, let's say, fourth quarter of 2009, we saw particularly the U.K. Marketplace, which is the first place we did it, start to have a good balance of where business sellers were listing in fixed-price format in volume and selling in fixed-price format, and consumer sellers were listing in auction format, which was a better way for them to sell. And that combination was leading to more velocity in the U.K. and in the German site. And as what I've said in the last quarter, it took two, three quarters for it to really work its way into a good place, and we anticipate it to be the same thing in the U.S. What's different about the U.S. was it felt riskier to do upfront because we had 50 million listings in the stores. So we had roughly 30 million core listing, 50 million fixed listings, so we're not in core search. And coming out of the quarter, we moved all 50 million of our fixed listings in the core search and added 10 million new listings. And frankly, our core search engine held up in Q2 in the U.S. But we held the auction fixed-price mix constant and that's what we're now adjusting, and we'll adjust between now and the end of the year. We're always quite thoughtful in search to make sure that we don't -- it's such a powerful part of our site. We need to make sure that we don't overcorrect, but we'll make a series of incremental changes. And that combined with the changes in trust, that combined with the changes in the vertical experiences that I described earlier, are what the formula that we're pursuing that we think will allow us to be the winner in the secondary market or off-price market."

And we saw that on eBay and in the PayPal Merchant Services business in the U.S. So that's why Bob said we're cautious in the U.S. about the second half of the year in terms of a macro environment. The other macro factor we saw, again, Bob referenced earlier, is the -- in essence, it was the weakening euro reduced imports to Europe, both from the U.S. and from Asia. And so they call that a strengthening dollar weakening euro. But because it's just peg to the dollar, it had an impact on the exports out of the U.S. and exports out of Asia into Europe. And again, we don't see that really changing in the second half of the year, although far be it for us to be predictors of currencies.

We did see a big slowdown in the end of May and during the course of June.

So just a fine point on John's comments. In terms of cash, we've had this opportunity/challenge for a while. We're having this strong balance sheet, wonderful cash position and how do we ensure we get that cash in the right place so we have ultimate flexibility to deploy as appropriate. As you know, we're successful with very legitimate business purposes to bring a couple of billion dollars back two years ago, $1 billion back at the end of last year. So we continue to look for ways to repatriate in tax efficient manners. One of the possibilities there is we feel very good about the Bill Me Later Loan portfolio and the prospects for our growth here in the U.S. So that growth will be a user of cash. At the same time, we'd love to be able to use our offshore cash in our Luxembourg Bank to be the source of cash to finance that growth, and that's something that we continue to pursue. And we'll keep you updated as we go. But our challenge is great balance sheet, great cash flows, get it in the right place and have ultimate flexibility to do the things we think are going to drive long-term shareholder value."

First, for the most part, we tried to, within the quarter, tried to hedge the lion's share of our earnings at risk in the quarter. So we were fairly well protected coming into Q2. Obviously, what happened was revenue relative to our guidance was probably off by about $35 million due to currency changes. In terms of income or EPS, the negative impact is about $0.005. So the $35 million top line challenge is we had hedged a portion of that and had a relatively modest impact on EPS in the quarter relative to where we were on April 20, whenever our last earnings call was. But we tried to protect our earnings within the quarter, at the beginning of the quarter, for the most part, against dramatic swings. In terms of our full year, the guidance we gave, the $250 million and the $0.10, that was based on -- we gave you our outlook for the year back in January, and we're trying to update where we were then and where we are now and isolating foreign currency. And the $250 million is simply -- at the simplistic level, over half of our business is outside the U.S. It's primary the euro, the pound and the Aussie dollar. Those from the beginning of the year to today have depreciated quite a bit vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, and we need to bring those earnings back in the second half or for the full year. It did impact our EPS in the first quarter. It did impact it in the second quarter. And through the this first half, I'd say about $100 million top line and $0.03 bottom line, we've already had to deal with. So the second half, it will be another $150 million and $0.06 to $0.07 on the bottom line because a lot of our hedging goes in place at the beginning of the quarter, so full year, $250 million, $0.10 in earnings.

Thank you for joining us, and welcome to eBay's earnings release conference call for the second quarter of 2010. Joining me today in the call are John Donahoe, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Swan, our Chief Financial Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany Bob's commentary during the call. This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet, and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of the eBay website at investor.ebayinc.com. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. 
In addition, management may make forward-looking statements relating to our future performance that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected financial results for the third quarter and full year 2010 and future growth in the Marketplaces and Payments businesses. 
Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, the continuation or worsening of the global economic downturn; changes in political, business and economic conditions; foreign exchange rate fluctuations; the impact and integration of recent and future acquisitions; our increasing need to grow revenues from existing users in established markets; an increasingly competitive environment for our businesses; the complexity of managing increasingly large enterprise with a broad range of businesses; our need to manage regulatory, tax, IP and litigation risks, including risks specific to PayPal, Bill Me Later and the financial industry; and our need to upgrade our technology and customer service infrastructure at reasonable cost, while adding new features and maintaining site stability. 
You can find more information about factors that could affect our operating results in our most recent annual report on our Form 10-K and our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q available at investor.ebayinc.com.

And good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q2 earnings call. Today, I'll talk about our results for the quarter and our progress toward achieving our growth objectives.

Today, I'll talk about our results for the quarter and our progress toward achieving our growth objectives. Bob will then give more details on the numbers and our guidance, and we'll take questions. 
I want to begin by reminding you of our strategic goals. We're positioning PayPal to be the leader in global online payments and we're positioning eBay to continue as a leader in e-commerce, with competitive strength as the world's largest online marketplace for secondary or off-price, new and pre-owned merchandise. And we're working towards achieving these goals in three ways. First, we're becoming a more customer-driven organization. We have three clear customer metrics: net promoter score, velocity and market share, and we've tied a portion of management's compensation to customer satisfaction. Second, we're becoming a more technology-driven company, with an increasing commitment to innovation. Our efforts in mobile, platform and the launch of products, such as our fashion vertical, illustrate our commitment and increasing pace of innovation. And third, we're operating more efficiently. We're taking $2 billion out of our cost structure over a three-year period and reinvesting in our growth priorities. 
And now, our Q2 results. Both revenue and earnings exceeded our guidance. Excluding Skype, revenue increased 15% and non-GAAP EPS was up 18% year-over-year. PayPal continued its strong revenue and total payment volume growth, and eBay's turnaround continued with progress in key metrics.  We continue to focus on delivering strong financial results, managing a healthy balance sheet and making the necessary investments that satisfy our customers, and compete and win. 
Our Q2 results also demonstrate the global strength and increasing diversity of our company. Almost 60% of the eBay Marketplace revenue was generated outside the U.S., and more than 60% of PayPal's total payment volume comes from our Merchant Services business off of eBay. The diverse nature of our portfolio gives us the ability to balance opportunities and challenges across our businesses and geographies. 
Now let's take a look at the results from each business unit. PayPal had another great quarter. We added 1 million new accounts each month during Q2, and PayPal now has 87 million active accounts. Penetration on eBay continue to increase and our Merchant Services business grew over 40% for the third quarter in a row. Overall, PayPal continues to grow significantly faster than global e-commerce and gain share as the leading online payment method. 
As we continue to execute our plan to grow merchants and consumers, we're also taking steps to accelerate PayPal's competitive position globally and drive payments innovation. I want to touch on three brief examples in today's call. First, we're aggressively expanding PayPal's presence across Asia through pursuit of strategic relationships. For example, our previously announced partnership with China UnionPay is on track to launch in Q3, giving millions of Chinese consumers the ability to shop online and pay with PayPal. And in Q2, PayPal launched on Alibabas.com's (sic) [Alibaba.com's] AliExpress platform, giving small merchants worldwide a faster, safer way to pay for wholesale merchandise from China. 
In Japan, PayPal went wide with SoftBank Payment services and were now on the top five gateways in that country, providing access to a market with more than $25 billion in addressable spend. We've also announced significant mobile deals in Singapore and Malaysia to help make the mobile wallet a reality for millions of new consumers in Asia. For example, PayPal's mobile platform was chosen by the Singapore government to power its m-commerce infrastructure. And in Malaysia, PayPal signed a deal with Maxis, the country's largest telco operator, to provide PayPal to Maxis' 12 million subscribers on its mobile, online and Internet TV platforms. These are just a few of the examples illustrating PayPal's significant opportunities in Asia. 
We're also driving significant product innovation with Bill Me Later, both within the PayPal wallet and as a separate payment option. Merchants are recognizing the potential for Bill Me Later to help drive sales and higher order value, and consumers like the benefits of online credit as an easy payment option. As a result, Bill Me Later's growth in Q2 is accelerating. And in Q2, we also began testing Bill Me Later as the checkout option on eBay. Early results show that when buyers use BML on eBay, their purchases are generally 2x larger than the average order value on eBay. More to come on that in future quarters. 
And my third example of how PayPal is driving growth and innovation is in mobile payments. More than 2.5 million people have downloaded PayPal's mobile apps. And in the first six months of this year, PayPal has generated nearly twice the mobile payment volume than it did for all of 2009. 
In the U.S., in Q2, PayPal introduced Mobile Express Checkout, which is designed to vastly improve the mobile shopping experience for consumers and PayPal merchants. Mobile Express Checkout offers consumers the same frictionless payment experience on the mobile phone that PayPal customers enjoy online. And Mobile Express Checkout offers PayPal merchants an easy way to extend their business to the mobile phone. All in all, PayPal continues to make progress towards achieving its enormous potential to be the clear leader in online and mobile payments. 
Now let's turn to eBay. We continue to make progress in our multi-year turnaround, with ongoing improvements in the buying and selling inexperience, and growing innovation in areas such as mobile and fashion. For the quarter, Marketplace revenue was up 11% year-over-year, with solid performance on the underlying customer metrics. Net promoter scores were up for top and active buyers in the U.S., U.K. and Germany, and buyers are buying with greater frequency. 
Sold item growth continued to be strong at 11% globally. And when we look at GMV in our three largest markets, we gained share in the U.K., driving mid-teens growth in Q2. We performed well in Germany, with GMV and sold items accelerating from Q1. However, in the U.S., we grew more slowly than the market. 
We're not satisfied with our U.S. results, while clearly, we saw consumer spending soften during the quarter and the strengthening dollar hurt GMV exports from the U.S. However, we aim to do better in this market. Now we believe the changes we implemented in the U.S. at the end of Q1 to offer more competitive pricing for sellers and better experiences for buyers, ultimately, will have the same positive impact we've seen in Europe. However, we're in the midst of making a series of format and search adjustments following that price change just as we had to do last year in Europe. But overall, we're not satisfied and we're on top of it. 
That said, overall buyer satisfaction on eBay is continuing to improve. As I mentioned a minute ago, buyer net promoter scores are up in each of our major markets. This is driven by increased trust on our marketplace. Bad buyer experiences are decreasing and sellers across the site are improving their service and eBay Buyer Protection is improving buyer satisfaction. Buyer Protection allows buyers to shop on eBay with confidence. 
We've also launched a couple of innovative shopping experiences. Our new fashion vertical offers a more compelling and visual shopping experience, better surfacing our deep inventory in this $5 billion-plus eBay category. We're making strong progress in working with the top fashion brands in Europe and the U.S., and we're getting great feedback from buyers and sellers on the fashion experience, and our teams are rapidly building suggestions into, say, improvements. And mobile innovation is another way we're creating better shopping experience on eBay. We're well on our way to delivering $1.5 billion of mobile GMV this year, more than 2.5x of our volume in 2009. Our main eBay iPhone app has been downloaded almost 11 million times, and eBay is consistently a top free lifestyle app on the iPad. 
Our eBay's Selling app, which we just launched in the U.K., has quickly become a top 10 out there and is already generating an average of more than 2,000 listings per day. So we're continuing to expand the availability of our applications across all platforms, iPhone, Blackberry and Android, so that we are reaching millions of potential new users worldwide. 
In addition, in Q2, we acquired the popular RedLaser iPhone app. We'll be integrating this bar code scanning technology into our eBay apps, providing users with fast and easy selling and comparison shopping information. We'll also be enhancing selection on this free stand-alone RedLaser app by adding eBay's more than 200 million listings, as well as inventory from 7,000 merchants from Shopping.com. 
Turning briefly to our adjacent e-commerce formats, our Classifieds business was up 7% in Q2, with strong growth in Canada and Germany. And StubHub had another great quarter, continuing to reinforce its position as the tickets marketplace that offers the most choice and availability. Q2 ticket demand was stronger for sporting events, including the NBA and NHL playoffs and Major League Baseball. StubHub also expanded in the mobile commerce with the launch of its iPhone application. 
So in summary, with the first half of 2010 behind us, we continue to make progress against our three-year growth objectives and deliver on our financial commitments. PayPal is strong and has great potential and momentum. And eBay continues to make progress in key metrics, with strength in Asia and in the U.K., and solid performance in Germany. 
We still have work to do in the U.S., our toughest, most competitive market, and we're not satisfied. However, we remain confident that our turnaround is on track and we continue to target having our aggregate marketplaces businesses grow e-commerce global rates for the year. 
We're a strong company, with great competitive assets in E-Commerce and Payments. And across our two businesses, we will continue to focus on our customers, innovate and drive operating efficiencies to invest in growth. Now I'll turn it over to Bob for more details on the quarter and our financial outlook before we take questions."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. All growth rates mentioned in my prepared remarks represent year-over-year comparisons, unless I clarify otherwise. 
Overall, we delivered strong second quarter results. We came in above our guidance on both the top and bottom line despite the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. We continue to execute against our strategic priorities during the quarter. PayPal increased global share of e-commerce off of eBay and increased penetration on eBay, and the marketplaces turnaround remains on track. Solid sold items growth was partially offset by lower ASPs. 
We're pleased with the results we've achieved in the first half of the year. PayPal is performing better than expectations and the Marketplace business is on track with the plans we laid out at the beginning of the year. 
Geographically, Europe growth is up, Asia is in line and the U.S. is below our expectations. However, the stronger U.S. dollar will have a significant impact on both the top and bottom line. As a result, we're modestly adjusting full year guidance, and I'll discuss this in more detail later in the call. 
Our combined businesses generated net revenues of $2.2 billion in the second quarter, a 6% increase or 15% excluding Skype from Q2 '09. Foreign exchange decreased growth by one point and our acquisition of Gmarket increased growth by three points, resulting in organic revenue growth of 13%. 
Second quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.40, an 8% increase or 18% excluding Skype. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.1%, up 40 basis points from Q2 '09. The year-over-year increases were primarily due to volume leverage and productivity gain, partially offset by a lower take rate. 
We generated $519 million of free cash flow in the quarter. CapEx as a percentage of revenue was 9%, which was higher than recent quarters due to the timing of some expenses for our new mega data center we opened in Utah in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect this rate to be up slightly versus last year. Return on invested capital was 22.8% on a trailing 12-month basis, the third consecutive quarter of improvement reflecting higher earnings growth. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. Starting with our Payments business, PayPal posted another great quarter. Total Payments revenue increased 22% to $817 million. Total Payment volume increased 28% to $21.4 billion. Geographically, TPV growth was 23% in the U.S. and 37% internationally. We continue to expand our global footprint, with 40% of our TPV from outside the U.S. for the quarter compared to 38% in the second quarter of last year. 
PayPal's Merchant Services business had another excellent quarter, driven by increases in the number of merchants who accept PayPal, the number of active accounts and our share of checkout. Merchant Services' TPV grew 43% in the quarter and now accounts for 61% of PayPal's total TPV. 
On the eBay platform, PayPal's TPV growth rate was 9%. Penetration of addressable GMV increased 420 basis points, which was driven by Germany, Australia and Italy. PayPal's transaction margin was also strong, increasing to 62.8% in the quarter. Although global take rate was down 17 basis points and transaction expense was up modestly, these effects were offset by a significant improvement in transaction losses, which was primarily a function of better fraud detection and prevention, along with the shift of much of the cost of our Buyer Protection Program from PayPal to marketplaces.
PayPal's segment margin came in at 19.9% in the quarter, up 380 basis points year-over-year. The increase from last year was primarily the result of operating leverage on volume, higher transaction margins and improvement at BML. 
Now let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later. Bill Me Later's gross receivable balance at quarter end was $691 million, up 25%. The quality of the portfolio continues to improve and the charge-off rate has continued to decline, down to 8.6% from 9.5% in Q1 2010. Risk-adjusted margin improved 130 bps sequentially to 12.8%. Within the last year, we fully integrated Bill Me Later into the PayPal wallet, began testing Bill Me Later in eBay listings and started using eBay Inc. data, with the goal of reducing the customer decline rate without taking on additional risks. 
Now let's move to our Marketplaces business. Overall, Marketplaces achieved net revenues of $1.4 billion, an 11% increase. Marketplaces FX-neutral revenue accelerated five points from the first quarter, driven by a higher take rate, lower contract expense and higher ad-based revenues. Transaction revenue was up 12%, and marketing services and other revenue was up 7%. 
Marketplaces generated 58% of its revenue internationally this quarter. Marketing services and other grew 7% in the quarter and represents 15% of Marketplaces revenue. Our Classifieds business grew 7%, with strong growth coming from Canada and mobile [mobile.de]. Total global advertising revenue increased 9%, driven by strength in Europe and APAC display advertising.
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces operational metrics. Active users increased to 92 million, up 4% year-over-year. Sold items, excluding Gmarket, grew 11%, geographically driven by the U.K. and China's cross-border trade. U.S. core GMV was 2% in the quarter, down four points from Q1. The decline was driven by lower ASPs, due to broader selection of well-priced inventory and reduced cross-border trade, primarily to Europe, as European currencies weakened. As John indicated earlier, we feel good about the expanded selection and better deals on the site, but we have work to do to increase velocity of sold items. 
International core GMV grew 20%, or 21% on an FX neutral basis. The growth in both the U.K. and Germany continued to be strong and accelerated for the quarter. China's cross-border trade remains one of our fastest-growing markets, but was negatively impacted by the weakening of the euro and the British pound. 
Marketplaces segment margin was up 40% in the quarter, down 220 basis points from a year ago. The main drivers of the change include increased investments to continue to build trust, value and selection, as well as the inclusion of Gmarket, which we acquired in June of last year. These were partially offset by savings from our operational excellence initiatives. 
Global take rate was 8.03% in the quarter, up 16 bps for from last year, or up 10 bps, excluding vehicles, StubHub and Gmarket. The take rate increase was driven by higher velocity on lower-priced items and lower PowerSeller discounts versus last year. 
Turning to operating expenses. In Q2, our operating expenses were 44% of revenue, essentially in line with last year. We've invested more in product while leveraging our G&A infrastructure. We expect this trend to continue. 
From a cash perspective, we generated free cash flow of $519 million during the quarter. Cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments totaled $5.6 billion at quarter end. Of this, we held approximately $1.2 billion in the U.S. 
Now let me turn to guidance. We have outperformed our expectations for the first half of the year, but we exit the first half with a bit of caution. As we head into the second half, our guidance reflects a few things: first, PayPal will continue to perform well; second, European currencies will remain relatively weak versus the U.S. dollar; and third, the U.S. e-commerce market will be relatively slow. 
The implications on these on our full year guidance we originally provided in January are as follows: PayPal will continue to perform well on the top and bottom line. For the full year, this will contribute an additional $100 million in revenue or $0.06 to $0.08 in earnings per share. Market prices is on track. Geographically, Europe growth is stronger, Asia is in line and the U.S. and cross-border trade are weaker. Third, the stronger dollar will hurt revenue by approximately $250 million or $0.09 to $0.11 in EPS for the full year. 
So for the full year, we now anticipate revenue of $8.8 billion to $9.0 billion, representing growth of 9% to 11%, excluding Skype. And we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $1.60 to $1.65, representing growth of 9% to 12%, also excluding Skype. 
The implications on the third quarter are as follows: we anticipate revenue of $2.13 billion to $2.18 billion, this represents growth of 4% to 6% excluding Skype; and we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $0.35 to $0.37, which represents growth of 0% to 6%, excluding Skype. On a year-over-year basis, we expect the stronger dollar to have a negative impact on Q3 results of approximately $70 million in revenue and approximately $0.02 in earnings per share.
In summary, we had a strong first half, with double-digit top and bottom line growth. Our global footprint is expanding, innovation is accelerating and ops excellence enables investments into trust, value and selection. PayPal has outperformed our expectations, and the Marketplace business is on track and the stronger dollar creates real challenges giving our global footprint. We're confident, but cautious, as we enter the second half of the year. And now, we'd be happy to answer your question. Operator?"

Let me take each of those in turn. In terms of active user growth, what's encouraging is that when you peel beneath a surface, what's happening is what we've been aiming toward, which is users are coming back more frequently and they're buying more. And that then is leading to new users because we think of word of mouth. The market that's most pronounced then is in the U.K., where, as I mentioned, we're growing faster than the market. We're growing in the mid-teens in the U.K., and we're beginning to see this dynamic, where the site improved, the site experiences improved. Our existing customers like it. They're coming back more frequently, buying more, and we're beginning to see a pickup in new users as well. So we're far from being done with where we want to go and need to go, but we're encouraged by some of those signs. With respect to mobile users, here is what's interesting. It is there are not pure mobile users or pure website users. There are types of users who are using both devices. And what we're seeing is mobile increases the intensity of the number of times they touch eBay, the number of times they use eBay. And so someone may search for an item on their laptop or their desktop, put it into their My eBay and then they actually buy it the next day standing in line with a Starbucks. Or they may be standing in line with a Starbucks, do a search, put into their My eBay and actually close it later on their laptop. So we're looking at mobile as an extension of the way people interact with eBay rather than being a separate set of customers. And so that's why we doubled down or continue to double down on mobile, and ensure we're innovating this RedLaser application, something that we feel excited about because it, again, brings eBay's 200 million listings to consumers when they're in stores in the offline world. So mobile's increasing the intensity of interaction with eBay."

I think the Marketplace is in a better place than it has been in the last couple of years, but I'm still not, I'm still not satisfied. So we laid out a three-year plan. We're halfway through it. And I'm pleased with progress on some fronts, but also believe we will make a lot more progress in the next six to 18 months. And the kind of saying, I think, you're going to really begin to see more of is things analogous to the fashion experience on the core eBay business. And any of you that haven't gotten into that Fashion tab, I encourage you to go into it. In fact, you could check today the Fashion Vault, we have TAG Heuer watches, luxury off-price watches. You'll see most of men's watches are sold out already. But we're bringing in new kinds of inventory. We ran with Brooks Brothers last week and bring in new kinds of inventory and bring in to life in very different ways. And so that Fashion application, if you will, is the first vertical we built on our new search platform, and is a precursor of additional vertical experiences that will come over the next six to 18 months. And so with respect to marketing, the most valuable indicator, if our changes are working, are our buyers buying more and then are they coming back. In the second half this year, we will spend roughly a comparable amount in marketing than we did in the second half of last year. We'll probably lean in a little bit. We'll spend a little bit more toward loyalty, eBay Bucks and a little bit less toward things like Microsoft cashback because, obviously, that program is stopping. And as we move into 2011, I believe we will be on a trajectory where our user experience, say, by midway next year, will be in a place where, I think, we can go back to inactive eBay users and really market to them. So a lot of work to be done. We've got some tweaks to make in U.S. a search, given the recent changes there. But I'm confident we're on track for the be in the right place over the next 12 to 18 months."

And as Bob just mentioned, we're adding new merchants, both large and small, in all regions of the world. And frankly, we see a reasonable amount of runway left in that. Second, we're working to ensure we improve consumer preference, which is to say, again, it's the frequency, the velocity, when I talk about our customer metrics, which is how frequently do consumers use PayPal. Are they using PayPal every time they see it online? It's getting the let's be everywhere and then let's get in consumers using it everywhere. And I would say we're getting better at that. We're getting better at sort of basic marketing, basic consumer preference, consumer frequency in PayPal. And then the third angle that is becoming increasingly important, frankly, is innovation. And whether that is digital goods, whether that's mobile payments, frankly, whether that's credit and BML, I mentioned earlier some of the innovative products on credit, or weather it's -- frankly, we're now getting pulled offline by some large merchants who view a mobile-payment approach on PayPal as a way to extend their private-label cards and other in-store experiences. So as you know, we opened up our platform to help us expand our capacity for innovation. So I don't see any one area as a risk. I just see a market that is quite large where the opportunity is expanding, and we need to ensure we execute well across all those fronts. And so if you were to hear both what Scott Thompson be saying to his team and what Bob and I  are constantly focusing on the PayPal is let's ensure we're executing on the opportunities that are in front of us."

And so I'm not satisfied with where we are in Q2, but I do think we're on the right path. And here's sort of the fact. As you know, we launched a significant pricing and search change on April 1 in the U.S. In essence, the same change that we had done in the U.K. and Germany over the previous 12 to 18 months. And we knew the stakes are bigger because there simply were a lot more listings that were going to be impacted in the U.S. And so what we've seen is selection in core search is up. So the core search engine in the U.S. is now processing 3x as many listings at the end of the quarter than it did at the beginning of the quarter, as the stores inventory and, frankly, a lot of new listings came on. So selection is up for U.S. consumers in core search, and they're getting better deals, and we saw that in ASP. ASP, frankly, came down even more than we thought because a lot of the lower-price items from the store inventory now came in core search and people were buying them, so that we felt good about. What did not increase, however, was velocity. Sold item growth was 5% in the U.S. in Q2. That was a two-point deceleration from Q1. And we want that to go up. We want that to go up over time as it has in Europe. And so we're in the midst of making some adjustments in the format mix of auctions and fixed price. We brought a lot of the store's inventory came on in fixed price. And we kept our exposure auction and fixed-price exposure the same, and we're now going to be increasing gently the fixed-price exposure, as well as ensuring that higher ASP items are getting appropriate visibility. So these are actually analogous to the fine-tuning we had to do in Europe last year. And we're already on it, and we will be doing that over the next remainder of the year. And then we're going to continue on the product innovation in the U.S., as well as the rest of the world. TSA is our first launch. We're looking to go through additional vertical such as Technology and Parts and improving that user experience. And then the last thing I'd highlight in the U.S. that, I think, or I know you'll see us a little more from, eBay Buyer Protection. I mentioned that trust on eBay is improving. Interestingly, consumers or buyers that have had experience with the eBay Buyer Protection report significant increase of satisfaction after they've had it because they either got their item or they got their money back. And yet our research is saying actually not many users are yet aware of eBay Buyer Protection, so you'll see us increasing the awareness around the eBay Buyer Protection, which we hope continues to give U.S. consumers confidence that eBay is a trusted Marketplace where they can find a wide selection of great deals. So our Lorrie Norrington and our U.S. team are very on top of executing between now and the remainder of the year."

Increasingly, we're calling it off-price inventory, right? It can be new inventory, it can be pre-owned inventory, but it's off-price. Think about it as the online outlet mall. And our target segment are shopping enthusiasts. And so we picked Clothing as the first category to really focus on because it's a large segment that, frankly, is not yet come online that much. And it requires innovation to come online because it's almost an unnatural act to buy clothing online because you want to try it on. And so it's already was one of the largest categories on eBay with $5 billion of GMV. We brought a lot of additional inventory on, things like, I mentioned earlier, the TAG Heuer watches in our Fashion Vault. If you go to the U.K. site, you'll see fashion outlets. And Savile Row has opened up a store on eBay, where they're selling off-price Savile Row suits and Brook Brothers (sic) [Brooks Brothers] and others. So we're bringing on additional inventory, and then that user experience you see in the Fashion tab on eBay or on the Fashion app on the iPhone is a more powerful way to bring that inventory to life for the shopping enthusiasts. Now I go through that because we will be repeating that same formula, if you will, in Consumer Electronics, in Auto Parts and other categories over the next six to 18 months, where we'll go out and try to identify what are the best sources of off-price inventory. Our eBay sellers, the 25 million eBay sellers provide a lot of that. But there are additional sources of inventory that we can now add on and scale, and so whether that's Auto Parts inventory or whether that's Consumer Electronics, we're going  to go out and acquire the inventory. And then with our new search platform, we have more capacity or more flexibility to build category-specific search experiences. And you'll see us over the next 12 to 18 months do that in Technology and in Auto Parts, and then we'll just continue working our way down the line."

Let me just summarize what we did in Europe and then what the results were and then I'll talk about the U.S. In Europe, we actually made separate changes around auction pricing and around fixed pricing in Germany and the U.K. And so we made four different pricing changes across the two countries over what was a nine-month period in the Q4 of '08 and the first quarter of '09. And we did it because we weren't certain of what the short-term impact would be and we wanted to make sure we moderated any risk. And after each one, we made a series of adjustments to try to, if you will, balance the Marketplace. The net result was in the sort of latter half, let's say, fourth quarter of 2009, we saw particularly the U.K. Marketplace, which is the first place we did it, start to have a good balance of where business sellers were listing in fixed-price format in volume and selling in fixed-price format, and consumer sellers were listing in auction format, which was a better way for them to sell. And that combination was leading to more velocity in the U.K. and in the German site. And as what I've said in the last quarter, it took two, three quarters for it to really work its way into a good place, and we anticipate it to be the same thing in the U.S. What's different about the U.S. was it felt riskier to do upfront because we had 50 million listings in the stores. So we had roughly 30 million core listing, 50 million fixed listings, so we're not in core search. And coming out of the quarter, we moved all 50 million of our fixed listings in the core search and added 10 million new listings. And frankly, our core search engine held up in Q2 in the U.S. But we held the auction fixed-price mix constant and that's what we're now adjusting, and we'll adjust between now and the end of the year. We're always quite thoughtful in search to make sure that we don't -- it's such a powerful part of our site. We need to make sure that we don't overcorrect, but we'll make a series of incremental changes. And that combined with the changes in trust, that combined with the changes in the vertical experiences that I described earlier, are what the formula that we're pursuing that we think will allow us to be the winner in the secondary market or off-price market."

The other macro factor we saw, again, Bob referenced earlier, is the -- in essence, it was the weakening euro reduced imports to Europe, both from the U.S. and from Asia. And so they call that a strengthening dollar weakening euro. But because it's just peg to the dollar, it had an impact on the exports out of the U.S. and exports out of Asia into Europe. And again, we don't see that really changing in the second half of the year, although far be it for us to be predictors of currencies.

But I wonder if we could dive into the impact of FX a little bit. First of all, to what extent you were hedged for FX for the eBay and PayPal businesses entering the second quarter and then today? And then secondly, if I look at your full year guidance, a $0.10 reduction in EPS due to FX equates to about $130 million net income impact and about $160 million pretax income impact, it seems like quite a big number on the $250 million revenue impact?"

First, for the most part, we tried to, within the quarter, tried to hedge the lion's share of our earnings at risk in the quarter. So we were fairly well protected coming into Q2. Obviously, what happened was revenue relative to our guidance was probably off by about $35 million due to currency changes. In terms of income or EPS, the negative impact is about $0.005. So the $35 million top line challenge is we had hedged a portion of that and had a relatively modest impact on EPS in the quarter relative to where we were on April 20, whenever our last earnings call was. But we tried to protect our earnings within the quarter, at the beginning of the quarter, for the most part, against dramatic swings. In terms of our full year, the guidance we gave, the $250 million and the $0.10, that was based on -- we gave you our outlook for the year back in January, and we're trying to update where we were then and where we are now and isolating foreign currency. And the $250 million is simply -- at the simplistic level, over half of our business is outside the U.S. It's primary the euro, the pound and the Aussie dollar. Those from the beginning of the year to today have depreciated quite a bit vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, and we need to bring those earnings back in the second half or for the full year. It did impact our EPS in the first quarter. It did impact it in the second quarter. And through the this first half, I'd say about $100 million top line and $0.03 bottom line, we've already had to deal with. So the second half, it will be another $150 million and $0.06 to $0.07 on the bottom line because a lot of our hedging goes in place at the beginning of the quarter, so full year, $250 million, $0.10 in earnings. Important to emphasize that the lion's share that will be offset by the progress and the momentum we're seeing on the PayPal business, both top line and through operating margin expansion."

In addition, an archive of the webcast will be accessible for 90 days to the same link. 
Before we begin, I'd like remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call.

These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2010 and focus on the future growth of the Payments and Marketplaces businesses. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to the continuing impact of the global economic downturn; changes in political, business and economic conditions; foreign exchange rate fluctuations; the impact and integration of recent and future acquisitions; our increasing need to grow revenues from existing users in established markets; an increasingly competitive environment for our businesses; the complexity of managing increasingly large enterprise with broad range of businesses and different stages of maturity; our need to manage regulatory, tax, IP and litigation risks, including risks specific to PayPal, Bill Me Later and the financial industry; and our need to upgrade our technology and customer service infrastructure at reasonable cost, while adding new features and maintaining site stability. You can find more information about factors that could affect our operating results in our most recent annual report on our Form 10-K and our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q available at investor.ebayinc.com.

Today I'll talk about our results for the quarter and how we're sharpening our focus on our strategic, priorities and growth opportunities, and then Bob will give more operating details and provide guidance before we'll answer your questions. 
Each quarter, I consistently highlighted the three ways in which we're driving our growth. First, we're focused on customers, measured by net promoter score, velocity and market share with the portion of our senior executive compensation tied to customer satisfaction. Second, we're focused on technology to drive increased innovation as seen in areas such as mobile, platform and our overall user experience. And third, we're operating more efficiently, taking $2 billion out of our cost structure over three years to reinvest in growth. 
Our focus on these priorities is paying off as we make progress each quarter against our goals, positioning PayPal to be the leader in global online payments and positioning eBay as a global leader in e-commerce and mobile commerce. In Q3, both revenue and earnings exceeded our guidance. Excluding Skype, revenue increased 10% and non-GAAP EPS was up 14% year-over-year. PayPal post strong growth in revenue, total payment volume and active registered accounts. eBay continues to improve key metrics such as net promoter scores for active users, which were up globally and sold items, which were up almost 13% excluding Gmarket. 
Now let's take a look at the results from each business unit. PayPal had a great quarter, expanding its leadership position in online payments and gaining share across global e-commerce. For the fourth consecutive quarter, PayPal's total payment volume for Merchant Services grew at 40% or more year-over-year. This consistently strong growth reflects what more and more merchants worldwide understand. PayPal is good for their business. PayPal helps drive incremental sales by providing merchants access to a global base of 90 million active accounts. And for both merchants and buyers, PayPal's secured digital wallet provide a safe and convenient way to pay online and via mobile, enabling frictionless domestic and global trade. 
PayPal's penetration on eBay continues to grow, reaching 70% in Q3, up more than four percentage points over last year. We continue to see great synergy between eBay and PayPal. And eBay's proven to be just as powerful, a customer acquisition channel for Bill Me Later as it was for PayPal. But more on that in a minute. All in all, we're making significant progress against our long-term growth priorities and strategies, and I'd like to take a brief moment to touch on three examples to illustrate PayPal's momentum and opportunities. 
First, Bill Me Later is beginning to demonstrate its potential. BML had a strong quarter with TPV growth accelerating to 53% in Q3, and we're seeing promising early results from BMLs expansion on eBay. With prominent positioning in eBay's checkout flow, BML acquired 60,000 new accounts in Q3 and double the TPV has generated on eBay versus the prior quarter. And when buyers use BML on eBay, their purchases are 2x larger than the average order size. So consumers are seeing the benefits BML offers and we're very pleased with these results. As growth accelerates, we believe BML is continuing to manage its credit portfolio well and is effectively controlling risks and credit exposure. 
My second example highlights PayPal's continued expansion of its global leadership and the strengthening of its local competitive offerings in markets around the world. I talked before about Asia, where PayPal continues to sign large merchants like China Airlines and PayPal's building alliances throughout the Asian region. For example, PayPal launched with DBS, Singapore's largest bank in Q3. More than 4 million DBS consumers can now use their bank accounts to shop online with PayPal. And PayPal launched its first co-branded prepaid card in Asia with Money Online, one of Malaysia's largest payments companies. 
In addition to Asia, I want to highlight the opportunities PayPal has in Latin America where we're beginning to establish a strong and growing presence. For sample, PayPal has localized our presence in Brazil, the region's largest market, to grow our business and to better serve the over 2 million registered accounts we have in the Brazilian market. We're beginning to offer payment capabilities tailored to the preferences of Brazilian consumers. PayPal has great potential in Brazil and Latin America, and we intend to continue aggressively pursuing opportunities in that region. 
The final example I'll touch on today is mobile payments where PayPal is driving tremendous momentum and share growth. This year, mobile TPV on PayPal will exceed $500 million, and PayPal continues to drive innovation in the mobile area. For example, customers can now use their iPhone to take a photo of a check made out to them and upload it to PayPal to make payments. 
Next week, PayPal is hosting more than 2,000 developers in San Francisco at our second annual Innovate Developer conference. We'll introduce new technology, new partnerships and new services that squarely position PayPal as the leader in innovation for mobile payments and digital goods. I hope that we'll see many of you at the event. 
Turning to eBay, our team continues to make progress in improving the customer experience to driving customer focused innovation in areas such as mobile and fashion. Revenue was up 3% over last year and core GMV growth was stable, both in the U.S. and internationally. With our U.S. business stabilized, we are making the adjustments necessary to capitalize on the pricing and search changes made earlier this year, and we're continuing to innovate around the user experience. For example, eBay is delivering a better experience in key categories such as fashion and electronics where we've made it easier to shop in three popular categories: MP3 players, GPS navigation systems and DVDs. We're also offering consumers incredible value with our daily deals and fashion vault sales. And we're delivering more convenient ways to shop on eBay any time, anywhere, and to get the best deals through our mobile innovation. 
Mobile commerce is exploding, and eBay is leading the way globally across multiple platforms. Our eBay iPhone app has been downloaded almost 13 million times around the world and mobile shoppers can now find eBay on all four major smartphone platforms: Apple, Android, Blackberry and Windows 7. Compared to the 600 million in GMV we did last year, this year, we expect mobile GMV to easily exceed our $1.5 billion goal. As we enhance our product experience to drive innovation, overall buyer satisfaction is improving on eBay based on net promoter scores related to trust, value and selection. And our top-rated sellers continue to thrive and growth on eBay. In Q3, they generated about 35% of core GMV in the U.S. and the same-store sales accelerated two points to 9% year-over-year. 
With holiday shopping about to begin, we're reminding consumers of the eBay buyer protection program. Expanded earlier this year, this program improves trust on eBay by covering the purchase and shipping price if consumers don't receive their merchandise or if the item is not as described. eBay Bucks, our first ever awards program is also gaining traction. Over 3 million shoppers have enrolled in that cashback program since its launch in August, spending 5x more than those not enrolled. 
So as you can see, eBay is increasingly offering a better shopping experience than a year ago and we'll keep on making it better. We'll continue to work aggressively to drive product improvements, expand and leverage our global presence, deliver unique shopping experiences in key verticals and drive innovation. 
Turning briefly to the other parts of our business, StubHub is celebrating its 10th anniversary this week with another great quarter behind it. Revenue was up 9% and ticket sales up 13% year-over-year, reinforcing its position as the ticket marketplace that offers the most choice and availability. And in our adjacent e-commerce format, Classifieds is up 15% in Q3 on an FX neutral basis versus the prior year with strong growth in Canada and in our Mobile.de business. 
So in summary, Q3 was a strong quarter with great performance at PayPal and stable results at eBay. Our company is strong. We're leveraging our global portfolio to balance strengths, challenges and opportunities. We're investing in growth and delivering consistent performance. Each quarter, we make progress and are driving improvements. And we're staying focused on our three priorities: Serving our customers, leveraging technology to create innovation and driving operating efficiency. Now I will turn it over to Bob for more details on the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Bob?"

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. All growth rates mentioned in my prepared remarks represent year-over-year comparisons unless I clarify otherwise. 
Overall, we delivered strong third-quarter results. We came in above our guidance on both the top and bottom line. We continued to execute against our strategic priorities for both PayPal and Marketplaces. During the quarter, we generated free cash flow of $580 million and repurchased approximately $300 million worth of eBay shares. Today, we announced that our Board of Directors has authorized an additional $2 billion stock repurchase program, which is intended to offset dilution from our equity compensation program. For the full year, we are raising both revenue and EPS guidance. 
Let me provide some more color. In the third quarter, our combined businesses generated net revenues of $2.2 billion, up 1% or a 10% increase excluding Skype. Organic revenue was up 12%. Foreign exchange decreased growth by two points and the inclusion of Skype in 2009 results decreased growth by nine points. Our third quarter revenue was approximately $94 million above the midpoint of our guidance due to top line growth from both Marketplaces and PayPal, as well as the weaker dollar. 
Third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.40, a 4% increase or 14%, excluding Skype. Non-GAAP operating margin was 28.7%, up 30 basis points from Q3 last year. The year-over-year increase in EPS was primarily due to strong top line growth and solid productivity, partially offset by lower take rates and the impact from FX movements. Our third quarter EPS was $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily driven by stronger top line growth. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. Starting with our Payments business, PayPal posted another great quarter. Total payments revenue was $838 million, representing growth of 22%. Total payment volume increased to $22.4 billion or up 26%. We continue to expand our global footprint with 41% of our TPV from outside the U.S. for the quarter compared to 39% in the same quarter last year. 
Merchant Services TPV grew 40% in the quarter and accounted for 62% at PayPal's total TPV in Q3. On eBay, PayPal's TPV growth rate was 8%. Penetration of addressable GMV increased 410 basis points. PayPal transaction margin was also strong, increasing to 62.2% in the quarter. The global trends at decreasing take rate and modest swing increasing transaction expenses continues, but were offset by a significant improvement in transaction losses. The transaction loss improvement was primarily a function of better fraud detection and prevention along with the shift of much of the cost of our Buyer Protection Program from PayPal to Marketplaces. These improvements were partially offset by an expansion of our PayPal Merchant Services' Buyer Protection Program. 
PayPal's segment margin came in at 19.3% in the quarter, up 450 basis points year-over-year. The increase from last year was primarily the result of operating leverage, higher transaction margins and continued improvement at Bill Me Later. 
Let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later, which continue to make solid progress in the quarter. Bill Me Later's gross receivable balance at quarter end was $767 million, up 37%. The quality of the portfolio continues to improve and the charge-off rate has continued to decline, down to 7.3% from 8.6% in the second quarter.  Risk-adjusted margin declined 120 basis points sequentially to 11.6%, as we saw an impact from moving from a 90 day financing program to a six months financing program to comply with the CARD Act. 
Now let's move to our Marketplaces business. Overall, Marketplaces achieved net revenues of $1.4 billion, a 3% increase. Marketplaces' FX neutral revenue was up 6%, transaction revenue was up 3% and marketing services and other revenue was up 6%. Marketplaces generated 67% of its revenue internationally this quarter. 
Beyond transaction revenue, we connect buyers and sellers through alternative formats, which are becoming increasingly important to Marketplaces. We expect these businesses to contribute approximately $900 million in annual revenue in 2010. In the third quarter, marketing services and other represented 16% of Marketplaces' revenue and had FX neutral growth of 11%. 
A couple of specifics. Our Classifieds business has the number one or two market position at eight different countries. This business had FX neutral growth of 15% in Q3, driven by strong results from Canada and mobile. The Classifieds format continues to accelerate growth in the number of business to our properties around the globe with an increase of 21% in the quarter. Global advertising increased by 15% on an FX neutral basis, driven by strength in international display advertising. 
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces operational metrics. Active users increased to $93 million, up 4% year-over-year. Sold items grew at 13% at Gmarket, a two-point acceleration from the second quarter driven by accelerations in the U.S. of two points and the U.K. of three points. 
U.S. core GMV growth was 2% in the quarter, flat with Q2 2010. While sold items increased two points, GMV was negatively impacted by lower ASPs due to a broader selection of well-priced inventory. International core GMV grew 4% or 8% on an FX neutral basis. The growth in Europe, particularly the U.K. and Germany, continued to be strong despite tougher comps from a year ago. 
Across the China's cross-border trade remains one of our fastest-growing markets, but was negatively impacted by the year-over-year weakening of the euro and the British pound. Our Korean business continued to exhibit solid growth, but GMV slowed as we continue to be left dependent on coupons that don't generate buyer loyalty. 
Market prices segment margin was 40% in Q3, down 230 bps from year ago. The main drivers of the change include increased buyer protection programs and FX, which were partially offset by savings from operational excellence initiatives. Our global take rate was 8.04% in the quarter, up 16 bps from last year, or flat excluding vehicles and StubHub. 
Turning to operating expenses. In the third quarter, our operating expenses were 44% of revenue, essentially flat on a year-over-year and sequential basis. We've invested more in product development, while achieving productivity gains in our G&A infrastructure. We expect this trend to continue. 
From a cash perspective, we generated free cash flow of $580 million during the quarter. Cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments totaled $6.1 billion at quarter end. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 13.1 million shares of stock at an average price of $22.89 per share for an aggregate price of $300 million. While we had a strong balance sheet, we only had $950 million in the U.S. at the end of the third quarter. As such, we've announced a series of steps that we believe will enable us to leverage our strong offshore cash position more effectively and maintain the flexibility to capitalize on M&A opportunities in both the U.S. and abroad, while we distribute in excess cash to shareholders. 
We continue to be optimistic about the medium and long-term growth of the Bill Me Later receivables portfolio. During the third quarter, we implemented a strategy to finance BML's new customer portfolio growth with cash available through PayPal's loss bank. This will enable us to leverage on our strong offshore cash position to fund our domestic loan portfolio. Also, the Board approved the establishment of an up to $1 billion commercial paper program to fund a portion of Bill Me Later's receivables. 
To capitalize on historically low U.S. interest rates and maintain financial flexibility, our Board approved the issuance of up to $1.5 billion in term debt financing under our existing Shelf Registration statement. We may seek to execute these transactions in the near-term subject to market conditions. Our Board of Directors has also approved an additional $2 billion stock repurchase program with the purpose of offsetting earnings per share dilution from our equity compensation programs. 
Now let me turn to guidance. We have outperformed our expectations to the first three quarters of the year and entered the holiday season with confidence in our Payments business and are also seeing strength in the Marketplaces business relative to our prior expectations. We are increasing our full-year guidance we provided in July by $200 million on the top line and approximately $0.06 on the bottom line. 
First, we expect PayPal will continue its strong performance and will expand merchant coverage and share of checkout. Second, we expect Marketplaces will have a strong performance in Europe and a stable performance in the U.S. And third, the weaker U.S. dollar should increase revenue by approximately $80 million and add $0.01 to EPS. 
For the full year, we now anticipate revenue of $9.05 billion to $9.15 billion. This represents growth of 12% to 13%, excluding Skype. We anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $1.67 to $1.70, which represents growth of 14% to 16%, excluding Skype. 
In summary, we had a strong first three quarters with double-digit top and bottom line growth. From a business standpoint, our global footprint is expanding, innovation is accelerating and ops excellence has freed-up capacity to invest in the business and strengthen our competitive position. 
We repurchased $300 million in eBay shares during the quarter and we increased our authorization under our share repurchase program by an additional $2 billion. We've increased our financial flexibility through an offshore funding vehicle for Bill Me Later growth, and the Board approved a potential commercial paper program of up to $1  billion and a potential term debt financing of up to $1.5 billion. And last, we've raised our full-year guidance for both revenue and earnings per share. And with that, operator, we'd be happy to answer any questions."

But the delta is really, partially eBay Bucks in the U.S. and on other mechanisms that you've used to improve the experience for sellers. So I'm just wondering if you could talk through where we are in that process? How aggressive you're going to be with eBay Bucks in the future and where we are in the pricing grid for sellers going forward?"

And as you mentioned, as you know, a year ago, we said we're really focusing on sold item growth because with an uncertain economic time, we wanted to increase the frequency with which our buyers are using our product. And as you mentioned,  the good news is global sold item growth, when you take the effect of Gmarket, which is a little distorting, were 13%. In fact in the U.S, sold items was up 2% to 7%, and frankly, in the U.S. bought items was up 5% to 13%. So consumers are using eBay with more frequency and that's a good sign. But as you also mentioned, the ASPs have come down, and while sold items are up five points, we lost -- we're up seven points in the U.S., we lost five points of that to ASP declines and so GMV is at 2%. So we look at the whole funnel and look at the health of each element. If I look into 2011, we're going to keep focusing on trying to get buyers to use our product more frequently. I hope we're through a cycle of lower ASPs have come from a lapping issue and also the change we made in North America earlier this year. So I hope ASPs stabilize a little bit. And then over time, sold item growth and GMV growth and revenue growth are a more or less in line with one another. But we'll continue to do things on the marketing front that drive growth. We don't really care if it's a cost of revenue issue or a marketing expenditure, we treat them as one and the same. And the real goal, to keep the positive momentum that we're seeing among our buying community and with our competitive position."

But the last thing just on pricing, we've made a series of pricing changes over the last couple of years, lower insertion fee, more back-end loaded where our interest in our seller's interest are jointly aligned and lots of other changes around the edges. And we feel today that we have a pricing with our sellers or a take rate that is as competitive or more competitive essentially across all geographies in all verticals. So that's one that we'll continue to be competitive. But right now, in light of all the changes we've made, we feel pretty good about where we are and how our interests are aligned with our community of sellers."

Let's just take that fashion experience in terms of merchant behavior. Probably the biggest shift you've seen in the last six to 12 months is we now have a growing number of recognizable brands and retailers that have opened up outlet shops on eBay. So if you were you to go to the eBay U.K. Homepage and just click on Outlet Shops, you'll see that Savile Row has an outlet shop, so the luxury of suit maker; Jigsaw, which is a major U.K. company has an outlet shop on eBay; Ed Hardy, has an outlet shop on eBay. And what these large merchants and brands are doing is they're finding eBay is a good place to sell their liquidation stock and sell their excess in ways that doesn't cannibalize their core businesses. So it's a good incremental channel. Buyers are responding to that. Buyers, while they love the new fashion experience and is engaging, what they really love is getting great product at great prices. And so the feedback we're getting from buyers around the fashion experience is that they love getting the kind of inventory they can get on eBay they can't get anywhere else in terms of front name, brand new items at significant discounts. In Consumer Electronics, if you look at what we've been recently, we're collapsing in DVDs, GPS navigation systems and iPods and MP3 players, we're collapsing from the a listing-space approach to more of a product-based approach. And this builds on the catalog where if you heard Mark had just talked about, that really only went in across the site two, three weeks ago. So it's still too early to tell any major reaction. But we know from our testing, the consumers first want to find the product, then they want to evaluate which seller and what price and what condition they buy the product in. So we're excited about that. On mobile versus desktop, I can just tell you this, mobile users are 4x as active as a non-mobile user. And the key thing to remember there is mobile users don't only use mobile. They engage with more frequency across their desktop, their laptop and their mobile device. And so we're going to continue to push mobile aggressively. It increases buyer engagement, it increases buyer frequency."

So we now set the sellers two weeks ago, that goes into effect this week, I believe, so I get the list three weeks ago. And I think that will improve the buyer experience.

One is the healthy thing and the healthier thing is the shoppers are searching for greater deals. And so we see even within a category where someone may have bought the latest Blackberry Storm a-year-ago, this year or two years ago and last year. This year, they're buying a brand new one but maybe it was last season's model or refurbished model. So we're seeing people trade down in what they're buying. Second, related to that, we've seen an increase in cross-border. And in particular, an increase in Chinese and imports from Asia, and that's had a significant impact on U.S. ASPs. And we think that's fundamentally a good thing if someone is finding an import cross-border item to help stretch their dollar a little further, that's a good thing. But that's creating some downward pressure. And then the third thing that I think is a little more temporary is when we made the change at the end of March, bringing SIF inventory into core search, there was a lot of lower priced inventory that was sitting in SIF. It's now in core search and it was part of what was driving the spike in special items which is a good thing, but I think in the process, probably pushing down the higher ASP items and search results, and that's one of the adjustments we'll make now as we tune things.

As we think about kind of the best practice sharing that goes on between Gmarket and ISC, one of the things that Gmarket has done historically is they were much higher use of coupons to generate traffic. And as we dissect it, the two different approaches, we've migrated to a model that's more similar to here in the U.S, more loyalty based versus coupon based. And as a result, their GMV and sold items growth slowed in the quarter. Revenues accelerated because coupons accounts for our revenue and we made more money. So we're still integrating these two platforms. We're trying to take the best of both, put them together, adjust and adapt and continue to take steps to improve our competitive position.

The first part is and I'll remind you, we have a booming cross-border business out of China. In fact, this year between eBay and PayPal, over $2 billion will trade over eBay and PayPal, outbound volume from China using eBay and PayPal. So we are enabling Chinese sellers and when I say Chinese sellers, your Greater China, including Taiwan and Hong Kong. Greater Chinese sellers are selling roughly $1 billion in eBay and roughly $1 billion on PayPal off of eBay. So there's a very strong business at eBay and PayPal are enabling out of China today. Secondly, you've heard us talk about our partnership with China UnionPay, and that's a way to link PayPal's capabilities to an enormous card base, if you will, of Chinese consumers, so that they can buy things from outside of China using PayPal. And we're in some early test phases but China UnionPay, that's over 2 billion cardholders in China. And then third, the Domestic business, the state of play there is you correct today that a non-Chinese entity cannot manage or run a domestic payment system. However, the government will, any month now, issue some licensing guidelines where they'll begin taking applications from non-Chinese financial institutions or payments companies like PayPal to participate in Chinese domestic payments. And so we fully intend to apply under those guidelines. Those guidelines may require us to partner with someone locally, but we certainly, that's on our radar screen, and I believe that they've given themselves a year after they announced it, the guidelines roughly before they adjudicate. And so in the end, we're going to keep pushing our cross-border, keep pushing our China UnionPay partnership and be in a position hopefully a year to two years down the road to have PayPal be an important competitor in Chinese domestic payments."

One is we're as prone to sell a Maserati as we are to sell an iPod on the mobile devices. And so -- which ties to the second area that I think is interesting when you look at it. It's turning out, mobile is not a separate shopping experience. Mobile is simply another screen or another device in our consumer shopping experience. And so what you see is you see people starting some of their shopping on their laptop and finishing it on mobile or starting on the mobile device and finishing on their laptop. And so the power of mobile is partly the application, but partly, it brings eBay's listings and PayPal's payments capabilities to consumers everywhere, no matter where they are. And that's part of the reason we bought RedLaser frankly because it's bringing eBay and PayPal off line, in the sense that a consumer can access eBay's inventory and PayPal's payments capability when they're standing in a store looking at an off-line item. So I think mobile being an enormous trend and we're seeing good traction across the board. On  private sales sites, we're always keeping our eyes out. We felt a year ago, these sites tended to be very richly valued ,and many of the sites are having a little more challenge having year-over-year comps, given their growth. And we now have daily deals and we now -- private sales we didn't see as a defensible segment per se.

You know on international versus domestic, it's not a whole lot different to what I've been saying all the way along. 80% of the changes we've been making, we've been making in the U.S., U.K. and Germany, our ""big three markets"" relatively. We've customized them a little bit. The change where there's the most difference is that fundamental pricing and search change we made when we bought SIF inventory into core and lowered insertion fees to align out of our sellers. And we knew that was a much bigger ecosystem change in the U.S. And as I said, it took us sort of three to four quarters in Europe to make the tuning and adjustments and I think the same thing is true here. The second area where the U.K. is a little bit ahead that I think the U.S. is roughly catching is just in getting more and more brands on and our business development and effort working with the brands to get them to put their inventories on to eBay. So those are the two areas I'd probably highlight the most."

And during the second and the third quarter, in light of the dramatic moving currencies, we still, particularly, Greater China to rest of the world, we still benefited quite a bit from cross-border trade. It's just that the deceleration of the growth because of the currencies, it slowed things down a bit. So I would expect the market is pretty adaptive to changes in currency and I would expect that more rates are clearly relative to where they were back in the June timeframe, we would expect. And that's incorporated into our thinking about the fourth quarter is higher cross-border trade in both businesses."

One is just the volume of cross-border transactions that happen on our platform, and one of the stunning things to see is how quickly and linearly it moves with the exchange rates. There's nothing we do other than have this global platform where Bulk took close to 20% of cross-border and we've had a lot of movement in exchange rates, both on out directions in last year. And it's stunning how fast the trade was moved and changed. So the volume of cross-border, I think is the real strength of our platform that, that can happen so fast, and then how it converts into U.S. dollar accounting, which is really what we're talking about in our guidance, that's so much a separate matter and that's why always break out FX neutral. But I believe one of our core competitive strength is our cross-border platform. And I believe that will grow in importance, not decline, as the world comes more of a global market."

And we'll stand behind our merchants and the propositions that we offer. And then going into the competitive landscape, look, I would say that there's a lot of activity going on in the payment space and our challenge is to stay out in front to continue to innovate in our core business and innovate around the edges to strengthen our proposition for merchants and consumers.

And then the recent decision we've made to double down on the innovation fronts by opening up the platform, what we're beginning to see is an awful lot of the new innovative startup in the payments space are building on top of PayPal.

Today, I’ll talk about our results for the quarter and how we are sharpening our focus on our strategic priorities and growth opportunities, and then Bob will give more operating details and provide guidance before we’ll answer your questions.
Each quarter, I’ve consistently highlighted the three ways in which we’re driving our growth. First, we’re focused on customers, measured by net promoter score, velocity, and market share, with the portion of our senior executive compensation tied to customer satisfaction.
Second, we’re focused on technology to drive increased innovation as seen in areas such as mobile platform, and our overall user experience.
Third, we’re operating more efficiently taking $2 billion out of our cost structure over three years to reinvest in growth.
Our focus on these priorities is paying off as we made progress each quarter against our goals, positioning PayPal to be the leader in global online payments and (inaudible) eBay as a global leader in ecommerce and mobile-commerce.
In Q3, both revenue and earnings exceeded our guidance. Excluding Skype, revenue increased 10% and non-GAAP EPS was up 14% year-over-year. PayPal drove strong growth in revenue, total payment volume, and active registered accounts.
eBay continued to improve key metrics, such as net promoter scores for active users, which are up globally and sold items which are up 13% excluding Gmarket.
Now let’s take a look at the results from each business unit. PayPal had a great quarter, expanding its leadership position in online payments and gaining share across global ecommerce.
For the fourth consecutive quarter, PayPal’s total payment volume for merchant services grew at 40% or more year-over-year. This consistently strong growth reflects what more and more merchants worldwide understand PayPal is good for their business.
PayPal helps drive incremental sales by providing merchants access to a global base of 90 million active accounts, and for both merchants and buyers, PayPal’s secure digital wallet provides a safe and convenient way to pay online and via mobile, enabling frictionless domestic and global trade.
PayPal’s penetration on eBay continues to grow reaching 70% in Q3, up more than 4 points over last year. We continue to see great synergy between eBay and PayPal. eBay is proving to be just as powerful at customer acquisition channel for Bill Me Later as it was PayPal, but more on that in a minute.
All and all, we’re making significant progress against our long-term growth priorities and strategies, and I’d like to take a brief moment to touch on three examples to illustrate PayPal’s momentum and opportunity.
First, Bill Me Later is beginning to demonstrate its potential. BML had a strong with quarter TPV growth accelerating to 53% in Q3. We’re seeing promising early results from BML’s expansion on eBay.
With prominent positioning in eBay’s checkout flow, BML acquired 60,000 new accounts in Q3 and doubled the TPVs generated on eBay versus the prior quarter, and when buyers use BML on eBay their purchases are two times larger then the average order size.
So consumers are seeing the benefits BML offers and we’re very pleased with these results. As growth accelerates, we believe BML is continuing to manage this credit portfolio well and is effectively controlling risk and credit exposure.
My second example highlights PayPal’s continued expansion of its global leadership and the strengthening of its local competitive offerings in markets around the world.
I’ve talked before about Asia, where PayPal continues to sign large merchants like, China Airlines and PayPal’s building alliances throughout the Asian region. For example, PayPal launched with DBS Singapore’s largest bank in Q3.
More than 4 million DBS consumers can now use their bank accounts to shop online with PayPal. PayPal launched its first co-branded prepaid card in Asia with Money Online, one of Malaysia’s largest payment companies.
In addition to Asia, I want to highlight the opportunities PayPal has in the Latin America, where we’re beginning to establish a strong and growing presence. For example, PayPal has localized our presence in Brazil, the region’s largest market, to grow our business and to better serve the over two million registered accounts we have in the Brazilian market.
We’re beginning to offer payment capabilities tailored to the preferences of Brazilian consumers. PayPal has great potential in Brazil and Latin America and we intend to continue aggressively pursuing opportunities in that region.
The final example I’ll touch on today is mobile payments, where PayPal is driving tremendous momentum and share growth. This year mobile TPV on PayPal will exceed $500 million and PayPal continues to driven innovation in the mobile area. For example, customers can now use their iPhone to take a photo of a check made out to them and upload it to PayPal to make payments.
Next week, PayPal is hosting more than 2,000 developers in San Francisco at our second annual Innovate Developer Conference. We’ll introduce new technology, new partnerships and new services that squarely position PayPal as the leader in innovation from mobile payments and digital goods. I hope that we’ll see many of you at the event.
Turning to eBay, our team continues to make progress in improving the customer experience and driving customer focused innovation in areas such as mobile and fashion.
Revenue was up 3% over last year and core GMV growth was stable, both in the U.S. and internationally. With our U.S. business stabilized, we are making the adjustments necessary to capitalize on the pricing and search changes made earlier this year, and we are continuing to innovate around the user experience.
For example, eBay is delivering a better experience in key categories such as fashion and electronics, where we’ve made it easier to shop in three popular categories, MP3 players, GPS navigation systems, and DVDs.
We’re also offering consumers incredible value with our daily deals and fashion bulk sales and we’re delivering more convenient ways to shop on eBay anytime, anywhere and to get the best deals through our mobile innovation.
Mobile commerce is exploding and eBay is leading the way globally across multiple platforms. Our eBay iPhone app has been downloaded almost 13 million times around the world and mobile shoppers can now find eBay on all four major smartphone platforms - Apple, Android, BlackBerry and Windows 7. Compared to the $600 million in GMV we did last year, this year we expect mobile GMV to easily exceed our $1.5 billion goal.
As we enhance our product experience and drive innovation, overall buyer satisfaction is improving on eBay based on net promoter scores related to trust, value, and selection.
Our top rated sellers continue to thrive and grow on eBay. In Q3 they generated about 35% of core GMV in the U.S. and their same-store sales accelerated two points to 9% year-over-year.
With holiday shopping about to begin, we’re reminding consumers of the eBay Buyer Protection program. Expanded earlier this year, this program improves trust on eBay by covering the purchase and shipping price if consumers don’t receive the merchandise or if the item is not as described.
eBay Bucks, our first of ever rewards program, is also gaining traction. Over three million shoppers have enrolled in the cash-back program since its launch in August, spending five times more than those not enrolled. So, as you can see, eBay is increasingly offering a better shopping experience than a year ago and will keep on making it better.
We’ll continue to work aggressively to drive product improvements, expand and leverage of global presence, deliver unique shopping experiences in key verticals, and drive innovation.
Turning briefly to the other parts of our business, StubHub is celebrating its 10th anniversary this week with another great quarter behind it. Revenue was up 9% and ticket sales up 13% year-over-year reinforcing its position as the ticket marketplace that offers the most choice and availability.
In our adjacent ecommerce formats, classifieds was up 15% in Q3 on FX neutral basis versus the prior year, with strong growth in Canada and in our Mobile.de business.
So in summary, Q3 was a strong quarter with great performance at PayPal and stable results at eBay. Our company is strong. We’re leveraging our global portfolio to balance strengths, challenges and opportunities. We’re investing in growth and delivering consistent performance.
Each quarter we make progress and are driving improvements, and we’re staying focused on our three priorities, serving our customers, leveraging technology to create innovation, and driving operating efficiency.
Now, I’ll turn it over to Bob, for more details on the quarter and our financial outlook, before we take your questions. Bob?

During my discussion, I’ll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. All growth rates mentioned in my prepared remarks represent year-over-year comparisons unless I clarify otherwise.
Overall, we delivered strong third quarter results. We came in above our guidance on both the top and bottom line. We continue to execute against our strategic priorities for both PayPal and Marketplaces.
During the quarter we generated free cash flow of $580 million and repurchased approximately $300 million worth of eBay shares. Today, we announced that our Board of Directors has authorized an additional $2 billion stock repurchase program, which is intended to offset dilution from our equity compensation programs. For the full year we are raising both revenue and EPS guidance.
Let me provide some more color. In the third quarter our combined businesses generated net revenues of $2.2 billion, up 1% or a 10% increase excluding Skype. Organic revenue was up 12%. Foreign exchange decreased growth by 2 points and the inclusion of Skype in 2009 results decreased growth by 9 points.
Our third quarter revenue was approximately $94 million above the midpoint of our guidance due to top line growth from both Marketplaces and PayPal, as well as the weaker dollar. Third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.40, a 4% increase or 14% excluding Skype. Non-GAAP operating margin was 28.7%, up 30 basis points from Q3 last year.
The year-over-year increase in EPS was primarily due to strong top line growth and solid productivity, partially offset by our lower take rates and the impact from FX movements. Our third quarter EPS was $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance range primarily driven by strong top line growth.
Now, let’s take a closer look at our segment results. Starting with our Payments business; PayPal posted another great quarter. Total Payments revenue was $838 million, representing growth of 22%. Total Payments volume increased to $22.4 billion or up 26%.
We continued to expand our global footprint with 41% of our TPV from outside the U.S. for the quarter compared to 39% in the same quarter last year. Merchant Services TPV grew 40% in the quarter and accounted for 62% as PayPal’s total TPV in Q3.
On the eBay, PayPal’s TPV growth rate was 8%. Penetration of addressable GMV increased 410 basis points. PayPal transaction margin was also strong, increasing to 62% in the quarter. The global trends of decreasing take rate and modestly increasing transaction expenses continued, but were offset by a significant improvement in transaction losses.
The transaction loss improvement was primarily a function of better fraud detection and prevention, along with a shift of much of the cost of our Buyer Protection program from PayPal to marketplaces. These improvements were partially offset by an expansion of our PayPal Merchant Services Buyer Protection program.
PayPal’s segment margin came in at 19.3% in the quarter, up 450 basis points year-over-year. The increase from last year was primarily the result of operating leverage, higher transaction margins and continued improvement at Bill Me Later.
Let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later, which continue to make solid progress in the quarter. Bill Me Later’s gross receivable balance at quarter end was $767 million, up 37%.
The quality of the portfolio continues to improve and the charge-off rate has continued to decline, down to 7.3% from 8.6% in the second quarter. Risk-adjusted margins declined 120 basis points sequentially to 11.6% as we saw an impact from moving from a 90-day financing program to a six months financing program to comply with the CARD Act.
Now, let’s move to our Marketplaces business. Overall, Marketplaces achieved net revenues of $1.4 billion, a 3% increase. Marketplaces FX neutral revenue was up 6%. Transaction revenue was up 3% and marketing services and other revenue was up 6%. Marketplaces generated 57% of its revenue internationally this quarter.
Beyond transaction revenue, we connect buyers and sellers through alternative formats, which are becoming increasingly important to Marketplaces. We expect these businesses to contribute approximately $900 million in annual revenues in 2010. In the third quarter, marketing services and other represented 16% of the Marketplaces revenue and had FX neutral growth of 11%.
A couple of specifics; our classified business has the number one or two market position in eight different countries. This business had FX neutral growth of 15% in Q3 driven by strong results from Canada and Mobile.de.
The classified format continues to accelerate growth in a number of visits to our properties around the globe, with an increase of 21% in the quarter. Global advertising increased by 15% on an FX neutral basis, driven by strength in international display advertising.
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces’ operational metrics. Active users increased to 93 million, up 4% year-over-year. Sold items grew 13% ex-Gmarket, 2 point acceleration from the second quarter, driven by accelerations in the U.S. of 2 points and the U.K. of 3 points.
U.S. core GMV growth was 2% in the quarter, flat with Q2, 2010. While sold items increased 2 points, GMV was negatively impacted by lower ASPs due to a broader selection of well priced inventory. International core GMV grew 4% or 8% on an FX neutral basis. The growth in Europe, particularly the U.K. and Germany, continued to be strong despite tougher comps from a year ago.
China’s cross-border trade remains one of our fastest growing markets, but was negatively impacted by the year-over-year weakening of the euro and the British pound. Our Korean business continued to exhibit solid growth, but GMV slowed as we continued to be less dependent on coupons that don’t generate buyer loyalty.
Marketplaces segment margin was 40% in Q3, down 230 bps from a year ago. The main drivers of the change include, increased buyer protection programs and FX, which were partially offset by savings from operational excellence initiatives. Our global take rate was 8.04% in the quarter, up 16 bps from last year or flat excluding vehicles and StubHub.
Turning to operating expenses, in the third quarter our operating expenses were 44% of revenue, essentially flat on year-over-year and sequential basis. We’ve invested more in product development while achieving productivity gains in our G&A infrastructure. We expect this trend to continue.
From a cash perspective, we generated free cash flow of $580 million during the quarter. Cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments totaled $6.1 billion at quarter end. During the quarter we repurchased 13.1 million shares of stock at an average price of $22.89 per share for an aggregate price of $300 million.
While we had strong balance sheet, we only had $915 million in the U.S. at the end of the third quarter. As such we’ve announced a series of steps that we believe will enable us to leverage our strong offshore cash position more effectively and maintain the flexibility to capitalize on M&A opportunities in both the U.S. and abroad, while redistributing excess cash to shareholders.
We continue to be optimistic about the medium and long-term growth of the Bill Me Later receivables portfolio. During the third quarter, we implemented a strategy to finance BML’s new customer portfolio growth with cash available through PayPal’s Lux bank. This will enable us to leverage our strong offshore cash position to fund our domestic loan portfolio.
Also, the Board approved the establishment of an up to $1 billion commercial paper program to fund a portion of Bill Me Later’s receivables.
To capitalize on historically low U.S. interest rates and maintain financial flexibility, our Board approved the issuance of up to $1.5 billion in term debt financing under our existing shelf registration statement. We may seek to execute these transactions in the near term, subject to market conditions.
Our Board of Directors has also approved an additional $2 billion stock repurchase program with the purpose of offsetting earnings per share dilution from our equity compensation programs.
Now, let me turn to guidance. We have outperformed our expectations through the first three quarters of the year and entered a holiday season with confidence in our Payments business and are also seeing strength in the Marketplaces business relative to our prior expectations. We are increasing our full year guidance we provided in July by $200 million on the top line and approximately $0.06 on the bottom line.
First, we expect PayPal will continue its strong performance and will expand merchant coverage and share checkout. Second, we expect marketplaces rather strong performance in Europe and a stable performance in the U.S. And third, the weaker U.S. dollar should increase revenue by approximately $80 million and add $0.01 to EPS.
For the full year, we now anticipate revenue of $9.05 billion to $9.15 billion. This represents growth of 12% to 13%, excluding Skype. We anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $1.67 to $1.70, which represents growth of 14% to 16% excluding Skype.
In summary, we had a strong first three quarters with double-digit top and bottom line growth. From the business standpoint, our global footprint is expanding, innovation is accelerating and ops excellence has freed up capacity to invest in the business and strengthen our competitive position.
We repurchased 300 million in eBay shares during the quarter and we increased our authorization under our share repurchase program by an additional $2 billion. We’ve increased our financial flexibility through an offshore funding vehicle for Bill Me Later growth and the Board approved a potential commercial paper program of up to $1 billion and a potential term debt financing of up to $1.5 billion. And last we’ve raised our full year guidance for both revenue and earnings per share.
And with that, operator, we’d be happy to answer any questions.

Second, John, at Analyst Day, you talked a little bit about growing Marketplaces revenues in line with ecommerce, and for this year, faster than ecommerce next year, considering the numbers you just put out this quarter, do you feel that that’s still on track, particularly the faster than the ecommerce growth for 2011?

Obviously, what PayPal stand-alone business was, but most importantly, what the combination of those two companies could be. Our enthusiasm about the opportunity is not waned at all. Over the last 18 months, we’ve been focused on the credit decisioning quality in a very opaque economic environment; secondly, integrating the product both in PayPal wallet and in the eBay view item flows.
So, now we’re in a position where we’ve gotten good traction during the course of the year and we feel better about credit decisioning, we feel better about our ability to use data to supplement Bill Me Later’s decision engine, but most importantly, we now have a product that is launched on the eBay platform and as a result of that, we’re pretty bullish about where we are today, the prospects of the future. And relative to how big the opportunity can be, we’ll let that play itself out as we continue to focus on getting more presence on all merchants, including eBay.

Recall that 60% of our business is outside the U.S. and when we look at the weighted average growth rates of the markets, we think we’re more or less on track for that. Now, obviously, under eBay service, we have a portfolio of different markets. In the U.K. for example, we are growing faster than the market, in Germany we’re growing roughly in line with the market, the market growth rate seems to be jumping around in Germany a little bit.
Obviously, in the U.S. we’re growing more slowly than the market. If I look into 2011, I don’t think we’ll get the U.S. up to market growth rates, although I intend and believe we will close that gap significantly. Our ambition is still to grow the global portfolio faster than the weighted average of ecommerce revenue growth rates. Frankly, I’m going to worry about that in four months from now when we talk about 2011. What we’re really focused on at the moment is having a real strong Q4.

As you mentioned, as you know, a year ago we said we are really focusing on sold item growth because with an uncertain economic time we wanted to increase the frequency with which our buyers are using our product.
And as you mentioned, the good news is, the global sold item growth when you take out the effect of Gmarket, which is a little distorting, was 13%. In fact, in the U.S., sold items was about 2% to 7%, and frankly in the U.S. bought items, which was us 5% to 13%. So consumers are using eBay with more frequency and that’s a good thing, but as you also mentioned, the ASPs have come down and while sold items were up 7 points in the U.S., we lost 5 points to ASP declines, and so GMV is 2%. So we look at the whole funnel and look at the health of each element.
As I look into 2011, we’re going to keep focusing on trying to get buyers to use our product more frequently. I hope we are through a cycle of lower ASPs that have come from a lapping issue and also the change we made in North America earlier this year, as I hope ASPs stabilize a little bit, and that over time sold item growth and GMV growth and revenue growth are more or less in line with one another, but we’ll continue to do things on the marketing front that drive growth. We don’t really care about the contra-revenue issue or marketing expenditure, we treat them as one and the same, and the real goal is to keep the positive momentum that we are seeing among our buying community and with our competitive position.

eBay Bucks is an example of historically marketing spend, which, as you know, is our largest line item in the P&L that brought traffic. We’re migrating more through the traffic that comes, building loyalty so that they’ll come back again and tell their friends. eBay Bucks is a component of that we’re, whatever, three quarters into the program now and we feel pretty good about the role that, that plays in driving frequency and loyalty from our consumer base.
The last thing just on pricing, we made a series of pricing changes over the last couple of years, lowering insertion fee, more backend loaded, where our interests and our sellers’ interests are jointly aligned and lots of other changes around the edges. So, we feel today that we have a pricing with our sellers for a take rate that is as competitive or more competitive essentially across all geographies and all verticals. So, that’s one that we’ll continue to be competitive, but right now, in the light of all the changes we’ve made, we feel pretty good about where we are and how our interests are aligned with our community of sellers.

Let just take the fashion experience in terms of the merchant behavior, probably the biggest shift you’ve seen in the last 6 to 12 months is, we now have a growing number of recognizable brands and retailers that have opened up outlet shops on eBay. So, if you were to go the eBay U.K. homepage and just click on outlet shops, you will see that Savile Row has an outlet shop, so the luxury suit maker, Jigsaw, which is a major U.K. company, has an outlet shop on eBay. Ed Hardy has an outlet shop on eBay.
And what these large merchants and brands are doing is, they are finding eBay as a good place to sell their liquidation stock and sell their excess in ways that doesn’t cannibalize their core businesses. So, it a good incremental channel. Buyers are responding to that. Buyers, while they love the new fashion experience and it’s engaging, what they really love is getting great product at great prices.
And so the feedback we’re getting from buyers around the fashion experience is that they love getting the kind of inventory they can get on eBay. They can’t get anywhere else in terms of front name, brand new items at significant discounts. In consumer electronics, if you look at what we’ve done recently, in DVDs, GPS navigation systems and iPods and MP3 players, we’re collapsing from a listings-based approach to more of a product-based approach and this still is on the catalog where (inaudible) just talked about, that really only went in across to take two to three weeks ago.
So it’s still too early to tell any major reaction, but we know from our testing that consumers first want to find the product, then they want to evaluate which seller and what price and what condition they buy the product in. So, we’re excited about that.
On mobile versus desktop, I can just tell you this, mobile users are four times as active as a non-mobile user. The key thing to remember there is, mobile users don’t only mobile, they engage with more frequency across their desktop, their laptop and their mobile device, and so we’re going to continue to push mobile aggressively and increase engagement and increases buyer frequency.

We announced that to sellers two weeks ago, that goes into effect this week I believe. So I guess it was three weeks ago, and I think that will improve the buyer experience.
And then second, we are increasing exposure for higher ASP items because we think those have got a little bit pushed down with all the SIF inventory coming on.

So, we see even within a category where someone may have bought the latest Blackberry Storm a year ago, or two years ago, last year, this year they’re buying a brand-new one, but maybe the last seasons’ model or refurbished model. So, we’re seeing people trade down in what they’re buying.
Second, related to that, we’ve seen an increase in cross-border, and in particular an increase in imports from Asia, and that’s had a significant impact on U.S. ASPs. We think that’s fundamentally a good thing if someone’s finding an import cross-border item to help stretch their dollar a little further, that’s a good thing, but that’s providing some downward pressure.
The third thing that I think is a little more temporary is, when we made the change at the end of March, bringing SIF inventory into core search, there was a lot of lower-priced inventory that was sitting in SIF, it’s now in core search and it was part of what was driving the spike in successful items, which was a good thing, but I think in the process, probably pushing down higher ASP items in search results. That’s one of the adjustments we’ll make now as we tune things. My hope and our goal is to see ASPs stabilize over the next couple of quarters.

As we dissected two different approaches, we’ve migrated to a model that’s more similar to here in the U.S., more loyalty-based versus coupon-based, and as a result, GMV and sold items growth slowed in the quarter, revenues accelerated, because coupons are contra-revenue and we made more money. So, we’re still integrating these two platforms. We’re trying to take the best of both, put them together, adjust and adapt and continue to take steps to improve our competitive position.

The first part is and I will remind, you we have a booming cross-border business out of China. In fact, this year between eBay and PayPal, over $2 billion will trade over eBay and PayPal of outbound volume from China using eBay and PayPal. So, we are enabling Chinese sellers. Now when I say Chinese sellers, they are Greater China, including Taiwan and Hong Kong. Greater Chinese sellers are selling roughly a $1 billion in eBay and roughly $1 billion on PayPal off of eBay, so there’s a very strong business that eBay and PayPal are enabling out of China today.
Secondly, you’ve heard us talk about our partnership with China UnionPay and that’s a way to link PayPal’s capabilities to an enormous card base, if you will, of Chinese consumers, so that they can buy things from outside of China using PayPal and we are in some early test phases, where China UnionPay’s got over 2 billion cardholders in China.
Third, the domestic business, the state of play there is, you are correct today that a non-Chinese entity cannot manage or run a domestic payment system, however, the government will any months now issue some licensing guidelines where they’ll begin taking applications from non-Chinese financial institutions or payments companies like PayPal to participate in Chinese domestic payments and so we fully intend to apply under those guidelines.
Those guidelines may require us to partner with someone locally, but certainly that’s on our radar screen and I believe that they’ve given themselves a year after they announce it, the guidelines roughly before they adjudicate, and so in the interim we are going to keep pushing on cross-border, keep pushing our China UnionPay partnership and be in a position, hopefully, a year to two years down the road to (inaudible) important competitors in Chinese domestic payments.

So,",308,"Brian, on mobile, you know what’s fascinating is, it’s across the board. I would say two things are different than what I would have expected with mobile. One is, we’re as prone to sell a Maserati as we are to sell an iPod on the mobile devices. So, which ties to the second area that I think is interesting when you look at it. It’s turning out mobile is not a separate shopping experience, mobile is simply another screen or another device in a consumer shopping experience.
So, what you see is, you see people starting some of their shopping on their laptop and finishing it on mobile or starting on the mobile device and finishing on their laptop. So, the power of mobile is partly the application, but partly it brings eBay’s listings and PayPal’s payments capability to consumers everywhere, no matter where they are. That’s a part of the reason we bought Red Laser frankly, because it’s bringing eBay and PayPal offline in the sense that a consumer can access eBay’s inventory and PayPal’s payments capability when they’re standing in a store looking at an offline item. So I think mobile will be an enormous trend and we’re seeing good traction across the board.
On private sales sites, we’re always keeping our eyes out. We felt a year ago these sites tended to be very richly valued and many of the sites are having a little more challenge having year-over-year comps, given their growth. And we now have daily deals. Private sales we didn’t see as a defensible segment per se and so between daily deals and our outlet shops and things we’re doing, we’re providing private sale like capabilities, and over time we certainly wouldn’t shy away from partnering or buying a private sales entity if we saw an opportunity that would accelerate our progress.

We’d customize them a little bit. The change where there is the most difference is the fundamental pricing and search change we made when we brought SIF inventory into core and lowered insertion fees to align that of our sellers. And we knew that was a much bigger ecosystem change in the U.S.
And as I said, it has took us sort of three to four quarters in Europe to make the tuning and adjustments and I think the same thing is true here. The second area where the U.K. is a little bit ahead that I think the U.S. is rapidly catching up is just in getting more and more brands on and our business development and effort working with the brands to get them to put their inventory on to eBay. So, those would be the two areas I’d probably highlight the most.

One is just the volume of cross-border transactions that happen on our platform and one of the stunning things to see is, how quickly and linearly it moves with exchange rates. There’s nothing we do other than have this global platform where close to 20% is cross-border, and we’ve had a lot of movement in exchange rates on all directions last year, and it’s stunning how fast the trade flows moved and changed.
So the volume of cross-border I think is the real strength of our platform that can happen so fast and then how it converts into U.S. dollar accounting, which is really what we’re talking about in our guidance. That’s almost a separate matter and that’s why we always break out FX neutral. I believe one of our core competitive strengths is our cross-border platform and I believe that will grow in importance not decline as the world becomes more of a global market.

Going into the competitive landscape, look, I would say that there’s a lot of activity going on in the payment space and our challenges to stay out in front, continue to innovate in our core business and innovate around the edges to strengthen our proposition for merchants and consumers and the opportunity for us. if we focus on merchants’ needs, consumers’ needs and leverage our global platform and the inherent characteristics that there is a significant opportunity for us to continue to distance ourselves vis-à-vis other emerging players in the space, and that’s what we’re focused on.

And then the recent decision we’ve made to double down on the innovation front by opening up the platform. What we’re beginning to see is an awful lot of the new innovative startups and the payments space is building on top of PayPal. If you were to come to our Innovate Developers Conference next week, you will see mobile applications, digital applications, social networking applications that are now being built in partnership and on top of PayPal, as more and more conclude that’s the way to scale your global payments capability. So, we’re always paranoid about competition, but we are absolutely stepping on the gas on PayPal. With that, we’ll wrap it up for the quarter. Hope to talk with you in three months.

27862,114449807,80602,"eBay Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tracey, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q3 earnings call. Today I'll talk about our results for the quarter and how we're sharpening our focus on our strategic priorities and growth opportunities, and then Bob will give more opera",1436,"Thanks, Tracey, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q3 earnings call. Today I'll talk about our results for the quarter and how we're sharpening our focus on our strategic priorities and growth opportunities, and then Bob will give more operating details and provide guidance before we'll answer your questions. 
Each quarter, I consistently highlighted the three ways in which we're driving our growth. First, we're focused on customers, measured by net promoter score, velocity and market share with the portion of our senior executive compensation tied to customer satisfaction. Second, we're focused on technology to drive increased innovation as seen in areas such as mobile, platform and our overall user experience. And third, we're operating more efficiently, taking $2 billion out of our cost structure over three years to reinvest in growth. 
Our focus on these priorities is paying off as we make progress each quarter against our goals, positioning PayPal to be the leader in global online payments and positioning eBay as a global leader in e-commerce and mobile commerce. In Q3, both revenue and earnings exceeded our guidance. Excluding Skype, revenue increased 10% and non-GAAP EPS was up 14% year-over-year. PayPal showed strong growth in revenue, total payment volume and active registered accounts. eBay continues to improve key metrics such as net promoter scores for active users, which were up globally and sold items, which were up almost 13% excluding Gmarket. 
Now let's take a look at the results from each business unit. PayPal had a great quarter, expanding its leadership position in online payments and gaining share across global e-commerce. For the fourth consecutive quarter, PayPal's total payment volume for Merchant Services grew at 40% or more year-over-year. This consistently strong growth reflects what more and more merchants worldwide understand. PayPal is good for their business. PayPal helps drive incremental sales by providing merchants access to a global base of 90 million active accounts. And for both merchants and buyers, PayPal's secured digital wallet provide a safe and convenient way to pay online and via mobile, enabling frictionless domestic and global trade. 
PayPal's penetration on eBay continues to grow, reaching 70% in Q3, up more than four percentage points over last year. We continue to see great synergy between eBay and PayPal. And eBay's proving to be just as powerful, a customer acquisition channel for Bill Me Later as it was for PayPal. But more on that in a minute. All in all, we're making significant progress against our long-term growth priorities and strategies, and I'd like to take a brief moment to touch on three examples to illustrate PayPal's momentum and opportunities. 
First, Bill Me Later is beginning to demonstrate its potential. BML had a strong quarter with TPV growth accelerating to 53% in Q3, and we're seeing promising early results from BMLs expansion on eBay. With prominent positioning in eBay's checkout flow, BML acquired 60,000 new accounts in Q3 and doubled the TPV has generated on eBay versus the prior quarter. And when buyers use BML on eBay, their purchases are 2x larger than the average order size. So consumers are seeing the benefits BML offers and we're very pleased with these results. As growth accelerates, we believe BML is continuing to manage its credit portfolio well and is effectively controlling risks and credit exposure. 
My second example highlights PayPal's continued expansion of its global leadership and the strengthening of its local competitive offerings in markets around the world. I talked before about Asia, where PayPal continues to sign large merchants like China Airlines and PayPal's building alliances throughout the Asian region. For example, PayPal launched with DBS, Singapore's largest bank in Q3. More than 4 million DBS consumers can now use their bank accounts to shop online with PayPal. And PayPal launched its first co-branded prepaid card in Asia with Money Online, one of Malaysia's largest payments companies. 
In addition to Asia, I want to highlight the opportunities PayPal has in Latin America where we're beginning to establish a strong and growing presence. For example, PayPal has localized our presence in Brazil, the region's largest market, to grow our business and to better serve the over 2 million registered accounts we have in the Brazilian market. We're beginning to offer payment capabilities tailored to the preferences of Brazilian consumers. PayPal has great potential in Brazil and Latin America, and we intend to continue aggressively pursuing opportunities in that region. 
The final example I'll touch on today is mobile payments where PayPal is driving tremendous momentum and share growth. This year, mobile TPV on PayPal will exceed $500 million, and PayPal continues to drive innovation in the mobile area. For example, customers can now use their iPhone to take a photo of a check made out to them and upload it to PayPal to make payments. 
Next week, PayPal is hosting more than 2,000 developers in San Francisco at our second annual Innovate Developer conference. We'll introduce new technology, new partnerships and new services that squarely position PayPal as the leader in innovation for mobile payments and digital goods. I hope that we'll see many of you at the event. 
Turning to eBay, our team continues to make progress in improving the customer experience to driving customer focused innovation in areas such as mobile and fashion. Revenue was up 3% over last year and core GMV growth was stable, both in the U.S. and internationally. With our U.S. business stabilized, we are making the adjustments necessary to capitalize on the pricing and search changes made earlier this year, and we're continuing to innovate around the user experience. For example, eBay is delivering a better experience in key categories such as fashion and electronics where we've made it easier to shop in three popular categories: MP3 players, GPS navigation systems and DVDs. We're also offering consumers incredible value with our daily deals and fashion vault sales. And we're delivering more convenient ways to shop on eBay anytime, anywhere, and to get the best deals through our mobile innovation. 
Mobile commerce is exploding, and eBay is leading the way globally across multiple platforms. Our eBay iPhone app has been downloaded almost 13 million times around the world and mobile shoppers can now find eBay on all four major smartphone platforms: Apple, Android, Blackberry and Windows 7. Compared to the 600 million in GMV we did last year, this year, we expect mobile GMV to easily exceed our $1.5 billion goal. As we enhance our product experience and drive innovation, overall buyer satisfaction is improving on eBay based on net promoter scores related to trust, value and selection. And our top-rated sellers continue to thrive and growth on eBay. In Q3, they generated about 35% of core GMV in the U.S. and the same-store sales accelerated two points to 9% year-over-year. 
With holiday shopping about to begin, we're reminding consumers of the eBay buyer protection program. Expanded earlier this year, this program improves trust on eBay by covering the purchase and shipping price if consumers don't receive their merchandise or if the item is not as described. eBay Bucks, our first ever awards program is also gaining traction. Over 3 million shoppers have enrolled in that cash back program since its launch in August, spending 5x more than those not enrolled. 
So as you can see, eBay is increasingly offering a better shopping experience than a year ago and we'll keep on making it better. We'll continue to work aggressively to drive product improvements, expand and leverage our global presence, deliver unique shopping experiences in key verticals and drive innovation. 
Turning briefly to the other parts of our business, StubHub is celebrating its 10th anniversary this week with another great quarter behind it. Revenue was up 9% and ticket sales up 13% year-over-year, reinforcing its position as the ticket marketplace that offers the most choice and availability. And in our adjacent e-commerce format, Classifieds is up 15% in Q3 on an FX neutral basis versus the prior year with strong growth in Canada and in our Mobile.de business. 
So in summary, Q3 was a strong quarter with great performance at PayPal and stable results at eBay. Our company is strong. We're leveraging our global portfolio to balance strengths, challenges and opportunities. We're investing in growth and delivering consistent performance. Each quarter, we make progress and are driving improvements. And we're staying focused on our three priorities: Serving our customers, leveraging technology to create innovation and driving operating efficiency. Now I will turn it over to Bob for more details on the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Bob?"

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. All growth rates mentioned in my prepared remarks represent year-over-year comparisons unless I clarify otherwise. 
Overall, we delivered strong third-quarter results. We came in above our guidance on both the top and bottom line. We continued to execute against our strategic priorities for both PayPal and Marketplaces. During the quarter, we generated free cash flow of $580 million and repurchased approximately $300 million worth of eBay shares. Today, we announced that our Board of Directors has authorized an additional $2 billion stock repurchase program, which is intended to offset dilution from our equity compensation program. For the full year, we are raising both revenue and EPS guidance. 
Let me provide some more color. In the third quarter, our combined businesses generated net revenues of $2.2 billion, up 1% or a 10% increase excluding Skype. Organic revenue was up 12%. Foreign exchange decreased growth by two points and the inclusion of Skype in 2009 results decreased growth by nine points. Our third quarter revenue was approximately $94 million above the midpoint of our guidance due to top line growth from both Marketplaces and PayPal, as well as the weaker dollar. 
Third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.40, a 4% increase or 14%, excluding Skype. Non-GAAP operating margin was 28.7%, up 30 basis points from Q3 last year. The year-over-year increase in EPS was primarily due to strong top line growth and solid productivity, partially offset by lower take rates and the impact from FX movements. Our third quarter EPS was $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily driven by stronger top line growth. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. Starting with our Payments business, PayPal posted another great quarter. Total payments revenue was $838 million, representing growth of 22%. Total payment volume increased to $22.4 billion or up 26%. We continue to expand our global footprint with 41% of our TPV from outside the U.S. for the quarter compared to 39% in the same quarter last year. 
Merchant Services TPV grew 40% in the quarter and accounted for 62% at PayPal's total TPV in Q3. On eBay, PayPal's TPV growth rate was 8%. Penetration of addressable GMV increased 410 basis points. PayPal transaction margin was also strong, increasing to 62.2% in the quarter. The global trends at decreasing take rate and modest swing increasing transaction expenses continues, but were offset by a significant improvement in transaction losses. The transaction loss improvement was primarily a function of better fraud detection and prevention along with the shift of much of the cost of our Buyer Protection Program from PayPal to Marketplaces. These improvements were partially offset by an expansion of our PayPal Merchant Services' Buyer Protection Program. 
PayPal's segment margin came in at 19.3% in the quarter, up 450 basis points year-over-year. The increase from last year was primarily the result of operating leverage, higher transaction margins and continued improvement at Bill Me Later. 
Let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later, which continue to make solid progress in the quarter. Bill Me Later's gross receivable balance at quarter end was $767 million, up 37%. The quality of the portfolio continues to improve and the charge-off rate has continued to decline, down to 7.3% from 8.6% in the second quarter.  Risk-adjusted margin declined 120 basis points sequentially to 11.6%, as we saw an impact from moving from a 90 day financing program to a six months financing program to comply with the CARD Act. 
Now let's move to our Marketplaces business. Overall, Marketplaces achieved net revenues of $1.4 billion, a 3% increase. Marketplaces' FX neutral revenue was up 6%, transaction revenue was up 3% and marketing services and other revenue was up 6%. Marketplaces generated 67% of its revenue internationally this quarter. 
Beyond transaction revenue, we connect buyers and sellers through alternative formats, which are becoming increasingly important to Marketplaces. We expect these businesses to contribute approximately $900 million in annual revenue in 2010. In the third quarter, marketing services and other represented 16% of Marketplaces' revenue and had FX neutral growth of 11%. 
A couple of specifics. Our Classifieds business has the number one or two market position at eight different countries. This business had FX neutral growth of 15% in Q3, driven by strong results from Canada and Mobile. The Classifieds format continues to accelerate growth in the number of business to our properties around the globe with an increase of 21% in the quarter. Global advertising increased by 16% on an FX neutral basis, driven by strength in international display advertising. 
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces operational metrics. Active users increased to $93 million, up 4% year-over-year. Sold items grew at 13% at Gmarket, a two-point acceleration from the second quarter driven by accelerations in the U.S. of two points and the U.K. of three points. 
U.S. core GMV growth was 2% in the quarter, flat with Q2 2010. While sold items increased two points, GMV was negatively impacted by lower ASPs due to a broader selection of well-priced inventory. International core GMV grew 4% or 8% on an FX neutral basis. The growth in Europe, particularly the U.K. and Germany, continued to be strong despite tougher comps from a year ago. 
Across the China's cross-border trade remains one of our fastest-growing markets, but was negatively impacted by the year-over-year weakening of the euro and the British pound. Our Korean business continued to exhibit solid growth, but GMV slowed as we continue to be left dependent on coupons that don't generate buyer loyalty. 
Marketplaces segment margin was 40% in Q3, down 230 bps from year ago. The main drivers of the change include increased buyer protection programs and FX, which were partially offset by savings from operational excellence initiatives. Our global take rate was 8.04% in the quarter, up 16 bps from last year, or flat excluding vehicles and StubHub. 
Turning to operating expenses. In the third quarter, our operating expenses were 44% of revenue, essentially flat on a year-over-year and sequential basis. We've invested more in product development, while achieving productivity gains in our G&A infrastructure. We expect this trend to continue. 
From a cash perspective, we generated free cash flow of $580 million during the quarter. Cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments totaled $6.1 billion at quarter end. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 13.1 million shares of stock at an average price of $22.89 per share for an aggregate price of $300 million. While we had a strong balance sheet, we only had $950 million in the U.S. at the end of the third quarter. As such, we've announced a series of steps that we believe will enable us to leverage our strong offshore cash position more effectively and maintain the flexibility to capitalize on M&A opportunities in both the U.S. and abroad, while we distribute in excess cash to shareholders. 
We continue to be optimistic about the medium and long-term growth of the Bill Me Later receivables portfolio. During the third quarter, we implemented a strategy to finance BML's new customer portfolio growth with cash available through PayPal's loss bank. This will enable us to leverage on our strong offshore cash position to fund our domestic loan portfolio. Also, the Board approved the establishment of an up to $1 billion commercial paper program to fund a portion of Bill Me Later's receivables. 
To capitalize on historically low U.S. interest rates and maintain financial flexibility, our Board approved the issuance of up to $1.5 billion in term debt financing under our existing Shelf Registration statement. We may seek to execute these transactions in the near-term subject to market conditions. Our Board of Directors has also approved an additional $2 billion stock repurchase program with the purpose of offsetting earnings per share dilution from our equity compensation programs. 
Now let me turn to guidance. We have outperformed our expectations to the first three quarters of the year and entered the holiday season with confidence in our Payments business and are also seeing strength in the Marketplaces business relative to our prior expectations. We are increasing our full-year guidance we provided in July by $200 million on the top line and approximately $0.06 on the bottom line. 
First, we expect PayPal will continue its strong performance and will expand merchant coverage and share of checkout. Second, we expect Marketplaces will have a strong performance in Europe and a stable performance in the U.S. And third, the weaker U.S. dollar should increase revenue by approximately $80 million and add $0.01 to EPS. 
For the full year, we now anticipate revenue of $9.05 billion to $9.15 billion. This represents growth of 12% to 13%, excluding Skype. We anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $1.67 to $1.70, which represents growth of 14% to 16%, excluding Skype. 
In summary, we had a strong first three quarters with double-digit top and bottom line growth. From a business standpoint, our global footprint is expanding, innovation is accelerating and ops excellence has freed-up capacity to invest in the business and strengthen our competitive position. 
We repurchased $300 million in eBay shares during the quarter and we increased our authorization under our share repurchase program by an additional $2 billion. We've increased our financial flexibility through an offshore funding vehicle for Bill Me Later growth, and the Board approved a potential commercial paper program of up to $1 billion and a potential term debt financing of up to $1.5 billion. And last, we've raised our full-year guidance for both revenue and earnings per share. And with that, operator, we'd be happy to answer any questions."

Recall that 60% of our businesses is outside the U.S. and when we look at kind of the weighted average growth rates of the markets, we think we're more or less on track for that. Now obviously underneath the surface, we have a portfolio of different markets. So the U.K. for example, we are growing faster than the market, in Germany, we're growing roughly in line with the market. The market growth rate seems to be jumping around in Germany a little bit. And obviously in the U.S., we're growing more slowly than the market. And as I look into 2011, I don't think we'll get the U.S. up to market growth rates, although I intend and believe we will close that gap significantly. And our ambition is still to grow the global portfolio faster than the weighted average of e-commerce revenue growth rates.

And as you mentioned, as you know, a year ago, we said we're really focusing on sold item growth because with an uncertain economic time, we wanted to increase the frequency with which our buyers are using our product. And as you mentioned, the good news is global sold item growth, when you take the effect of Gmarket, which is a little distorting, were 13%. In fact in the U.S, sold items was up 2% to 7%, and frankly, in the U.S. bought items was up 5% to 13%. So consumers are using eBay with more frequency and that's a good sign. But as you also mentioned, the ASPs have come down, and while sold items are up five points, we lost -- we're up seven points in the U.S., we lost five points of that to ASP declines and so GMV is at 2%. So we look at the whole funnel and look at the health of each element. If I look into 2011, we're going to keep focusing on trying to get buyers to use our product more frequently. I hope we're through a cycle of lower ASPs have come from a lapping issue and also the change we made in North America earlier this year. So I hope ASPs stabilize a little bit. And then over time, sold item growth and GMV growth and revenue growth are a more or less in line with one another. But we'll continue to do things on the marketing front that drive growth. We don't really care if it's a cost of revenue issue or a marketing expenditure, we treat them as one and the same. And the real goal, to keep the positive momentum that we're seeing among our buying community and with our competitive position."

But the last thing just on pricing, we've made a series of pricing changes over the last couple of years, lower insertion fee, more back-end loaded where our interest in our seller's interest are jointly aligned and lots of other changes around the edges. And we feel today that we have a pricing with our sellers or a take rate that is as competitive or more competitive essentially across all geographies in all verticals. So that's one that we'll continue to be competitive. But right now, in light of all the changes we've made, we feel pretty good about where we are and how our interests are aligned with our community of sellers."

Let's just take that fashion experience in terms of merchant behavior. Probably the biggest shift you've seen in the last six to 12 months is we now have a growing number of recognizable brands and retailers that have opened up outlet shops on eBay. So if you were you to go to the eBay U.K. Homepage and just click on Outlet Shops, you'll see that Savile Row has an outlet shop, so the luxury of suit maker; Jigsaw, which is a major U.K. company has an outlet shop on eBay; Ed Hardy, has an outlet shop on eBay. And what these large merchants and brands are doing is they're finding eBay is a good place to sell their liquidation stock and sell their excess in ways that doesn't cannibalize their core businesses. So it's a good incremental channel. Buyers are responding to that. Buyers, while they love the new fashion experience and is engaging, what they really love is getting great product at great prices. And so the feedback we're getting from buyers around the fashion experience is that they love getting the kind of inventory they can get on eBay they can't get anywhere else in terms of front name, brand new items at significant discounts. In Consumer Electronics, if you look at what we've done recently, we're collapsing in DVDs, GPS navigation systems and iPods and MP3 players, we're collapsing from the a listing-space approach to more of a product-based approach. And this builds on the catalog where if you heard Mark had just talked about, that really only went in across the site two, three weeks ago. So it's still too early to tell any major reaction. But we know from our testing, that consumers first want to find the product, then they want to evaluate which seller and what price and what condition they buy the product in. So we're excited about that. On mobile versus desktop, I can just tell you this, mobile users are 4x as active as a non-mobile user. And the key thing to remember there is mobile users don't only use mobile. They engage with more frequency across their desktop, their laptop and their mobile device. And so we're going to continue to push mobile aggressively. It increases buyer engagement, it increases buyer frequency."

And so we see even within a category where someone may have bought the latest Blackberry Storm a-year-ago, this year or two years ago and last year. This year, they're buying a brand new one but maybe it was last season's model or refurbished model. So we're seeing people trade down in what they're buying. Second, related to that, we've seen an increase in cross-border. And in particular, an increase in Chinese and imports from Asia, and that's had a significant impact on U.S. ASPs. And we think that's fundamentally a good thing if someone is finding an import cross-border item to help stretch their dollar a little further, that's a good thing. But that's creating some downward pressure. And then the third thing that I think is a little more temporary is when we made the change at the end of March, bringing SIF inventory into core search, there was a lot of lower priced inventory that was sitting in SIF. It's now in core search and it was part of what was driving the spike in special items which is a good thing, but I think in the process, probably pushing down the higher ASP items and search results, and that's one of the adjustments we'll make now as we tune things.

In fact, this year between eBay and Pa",326,"I actually think that's not what they're requiring. What's going in China, there's two parts to when you think about China. The first part is and I'll remind you, we have a booming cross-border business out of China. In fact, this year between eBay and PayPal, over $2 billion will trade over eBay and PayPal, outbound volume from China using eBay and PayPal. So we are enabling Chinese sellers and when I say Chinese sellers, your Greater China, including Taiwan and Hong Kong. Greater Chinese sellers are selling roughly $1 billion in eBay and roughly $1 billion on PayPal off of eBay. So there's a very strong business at eBay and PayPal are enabling out of China today. Secondly, you've heard us talk about our partnership with China UnionPay, and that's a way to link PayPal's capabilities to an enormous card base, if you will, of Chinese consumers, so that they can buy things from outside of China using PayPal. And we're in some early test phases but China UnionPay, that's over 2 billion cardholders in China. And then third, the Domestic business, the state of play there is you correct today that a non-Chinese entity cannot manage or run a domestic payment system. However, the government will, any month now, issue some licensing guidelines where they'll begin taking applications from non-Chinese financial institutions or payments companies like PayPal to participate in Chinese domestic payments. And so we fully intend to apply under those guidelines. Those guidelines may require us to partner with someone locally, but we certainly, that's on our radar screen, and I believe that they've given themselves a year after they announced it, the guidelines roughly before they adjudicate. And so in the interim, we're going to keep pushing our cross-border, keep pushing our China UnionPay partnership and be in a position hopefully a year to two years down the road to have PayPal be an important competitor in Chinese domestic payments."

One is we're as prone to sell a Maserati as we are to sell an iPod on the mobile devices. And so -- which ties to the second area that I think is interesting when you look at it. It's turning out, mobile is not a separate shopping experience. Mobile is simply another screen or another device in our consumer shopping experience. And so what you see is you see people starting some of their shopping on their laptop and finishing it on mobile or starting on the mobile device and finishing on their laptop. And so the power of mobile is partly the application, but partly, it brings eBay's listings and PayPal's payments capabilities to consumers everywhere, no matter where they are. And that's part of the reason we bought RedLaser frankly because it's bringing eBay and PayPal off line, in the sense that a consumer can access eBay's inventory and PayPal's payments capability when they're standing in a store looking at an off-line item. So I think mobile being an enormous trend and we're seeing good traction across the board. On private sales sites, we're always keeping our eyes out. We felt a year ago, these sites tended to be very richly valued, and many of the sites are having a little more challenge having year-over-year comps, given their growth. And we now have daily deals and we now -- private sales we didn't see as a defensible segment per se. And so between daily deals and our outlet shops and things we're doing, we're providing private sale like capabilities. And over time, we strongly wouldn't be shy away from partnering or buying a private sales entity if we saw an opportunity that would accelerate our progress."

We've customized them a little bit. The change where there's the most difference is that fundamental pricing and search change we made when we bought SIF inventory into core and lowered insertion fees to align out of our sellers. And we knew that was a much bigger ecosystem change in the U.S. And as I said, it took us sort of three to four quarters in Europe to make the tuning and adjustments and I think the same thing is true here. The second area where the U.K. is a little bit ahead that I think the U.S. is roughly catching is just in getting more and more brands on and our business development and effort working with the brands to get them to put their inventories on to eBay. So those are the two areas I'd probably highlight the most."

It's just that the deceleration of the growth because of the currencies, it slowed things down a bit. So I would expect the market is pretty adaptive to changes in currency and I would expect that more rates are clearly relative to where they were back in the June timeframe, we would expect. And that's incorporated into our thinking about the fourth quarter is higher cross-border trade in both businesses."

One is just the volume of cross-border transactions that happen on our platform, and one of the stunning things to see is how quickly and linearly it moves with the exchange rates. There's nothing we do other than have this global platform where Bulk took close to 20% of cross-border and we've had a lot of movement in exchange rates, both on out directions in last year. And it's stunning how fast the trade was moved and changed. So the volume of cross-border, I think is the real strength of our platform that, that can happen so fast, and then how it converts into U.S. dollar accounting, which is really what we're talking about in our guidance, that's almost a separate matter and that's why always break out FX neutral. But I believe one of our core competitive strengths is our cross-border platform. And I believe that will grow in importance, not decline, as the world becomes more of a global market."
