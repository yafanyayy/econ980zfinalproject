Joining me on our call today are: Norman Ferber, Chairman of the Board; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bobbi Chaville, Senior Director, Investor Relations. We will begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2009 performance, followed by our outlook for 2010 and the longer term. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.Before we start, I want to note that our comments on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results and other matters that are based on management's current forecast of aspects of the company's future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risk factors are detailed in today's press release and our fiscal 2008 Form 10-K, fiscal 2009 Form 10-Qs and fiscal 2009 and 2010 Form 8-Ks on file with the SEC.Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended January 30, 2010, grew 53% to $1.16, up from $0.76 for the 13 weeks ended January 31, 2009. Net earnings for the quarter grew to a record $142.9 million, up 47% from $97.4 million in the prior-year period. For the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010, earnings per share grew 52% to $3.54, up from $2.33 for the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009. Net earnings for fiscal 2009 increased 45% to a record $442.8 million, up from $305.4 million in 2008. Fourth quarter sales increased 14% to $1,980,000,000, with comparable store sales up 10% over the prior year. For the full year, total sales rose 11% to $7,184,000,000, with same-store sales up 6% on top of a 2% gain in the prior year. Our better-than-expected sales for both the quarter and the year benefited from healthy traffic to our stores, as an increasing number of shoppers were attracted to our great values. The best-performing merchandise categories for both the quarter and the year were Shoes, Dresses and Home, all posting double-digit gains in same-store sales for both periods. Geographic trends were broad-based with high-single to low-double-digit percentage same-store sales increases across all regions for the quarter and mid- to high-single-digit gains for the year.The Northwest and Southwest regions were the best performing markets in the fourth quarter, while the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast were the top regions for the year. California same-store sales rose 8% during the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year.We are extremely pleased with our outstanding sales and earnings results. Our 52% gain in earnings per share in fiscal 2009 was on top of a 23% increase in the prior year. Ross was one of the very few retailers to generate this level of robust growth in 2009. Our ability to execute a rough [ph] (25:18) price strategy successfully throughout all areas of our company was the primary driver of our exceptional financial results. During one of the most challenging economic and retail environments, we not only generated much higher-than-planned revenues, but did so with record merchandise gross margins that drove double-digit operating profit as a percent of sales.Earnings before interest and taxes for 2009 fourth quarter grew about 260 basis points to 11.7% of sales, up from 9.1% in the prior year. This higher profit margin was mainly due to a 230 basis point reduction in cost of goods sold, along with a 30 basis points decline in selling, general and administrative costs. For the 2009 fiscal year, operating margin increased about 250 basis points over the prior year to 10.1% of sales, also driven by a 230 basis point decline in cost of goods sold, combined with a 20 basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. Key drivers of our improved profitability for both the fourth quarter and the year were significant growth in merchandise gross margin, lower shortage costs and leverage on operating expenses from the strong gains in same-store sales. John will provide some additional color on operating margin trends in a few minutes.On average, in-store inventories were down in the mid-teen percentage range throughout 2009 and ended the year down about 11%. Now operating our business with much lower in-store inventories increases the percentage of fresh and exciting merchandise that our customers see when they shop at our stores. By exceeding our sales targets with leaner inventories, we realized significantly fast returns in 2009, which resulted in much fewer markdowns. For 2010, we are planning further reductions of in-store inventories with average levels targeted down in the mid- to high-single digit percentage range compared to 2009. We believe our ongoing focus on tight inventory management will further accelerate inventory turns and maximize merchandise gross margin.Turning to our store expansion program, we added 56 new stores in 2009, including 52 Ross Dress for Less and four dd's DISCOUNTS locations. dd's DISCOUNTS' outstanding performance in 2009 continued in the fourth quarter, with sales and profitability for both the quarter and the full year, well ahead of our original expectations. In fact, the earnings impact or drag from dd's was relatively neutral in 2009 compared to a 35 basis point drag in 2008. We are pleased to report that on a pretax basis before interest cost and corporate overhead allocations, dd's DISCOUNTS was profitable for the first time in its history.This improvement was driven by both higher sales productivity and much higher gross margin. Like Ross, dd's is benefiting from our ability to deliver a faster flow of fresh and exciting products to our stores while operating on lower inventory levels. dd's strong gains in sales and profitability also reflect that its valued focus merchandise offerings are resonating well with its customers. dd's results make us even more enthusiastic about dd's long-term prospects and our plans to accelerate its expansion in 2010 and beyond.Now let's talk about our financial condition. Our balance sheet remains very healthy with cash and short-term investments of $770 million at year end. Our higher cash balances benefited primarily from much better-than-expected earnings, as well as reduced working capital needs from operating our stores with lower inventories. Our consistently strong cash flows enabled us to continue to enhance stockholder returns through both our dividend and stock repurchase programs. During 2009, after internally financing both our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, we used available cash to buy back $70 million of common stock in the fourth quarter and $300 million for the fiscal year. This allowed us to retire about 1.6 million and 7.4 million shares in the fourth quarter and fiscal year periods, respectively. This completed the prior two-year $600 million program announced in early 2008.In January 2010, our Board of Directors approved a new two-year $750 million stock repurchase program, along with a 45% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.16 per common share. These actions reflect our confidence and our ongoing ability to generate healthy amount of excess cash and our long-term commitment to enhancing stockholder returns.Now I'd like to review the 2010 targets we communicated with our January sales release in early February. We have a resilient and flexible off-price model that when we execute it well, enables us to deliver solid results in both favorable and challenging business cycles. That said, we are off against a year of exceptional growth in both sales and earnings in 2009. As a result, we have been prudent in setting our targets for 2010 with the hope that we can do better, as we recently did in February when sales were well above plans. For the 2010 fiscal year, we are forecasting same-store sales to increase 1% to 2% on top of a strong 6% gain in 2009, and projecting earnings per share to increase 7% to 12%, to $3.80 to $3.95. It's important to remember that this projected earnings per share growth is on top of an outstanding 52% increase in 2009, our largest annual increase in more than a decade. We are projecting the largest earnings per share increases in the first half of 2010. We faced the easiest prior-year sales and operating margin comparisons in the first quarter, providing us greater opportunity for improvement during this period. For the second quarter, earnings per share are forecast to grow in the low-double-digit percentage range. We are up against to our toughest sales in merchandise margin and shortage comparisons in the third and fourth quarters of 2010. In the second half of 2009, a 9% increase in comparable store sales and operating profits that grew over 300 basis points as a percent of sales drove a 67% increase in earnings per share. As a result, we are projecting flattish earnings per share in the second half versus the prior year. Now John will provide some additional details on our fourth quarter results, and review the underlying operating statement assumptions that support our earnings per share targets for the first quarter and fiscal 2010."

As Michael discussed, our fourth quarter operating margin increased by 260 basis points over the prior year, due to a 230 basis point reduction in cost of goods sold, and a 30 basis point decline in selling, general and administrative",557,"Thank you, Michael. As Michael discussed, our fourth quarter operating margin increased by 260 basis points over the prior year, due to a 230 basis point reduction in cost of goods sold, and a 30 basis point decline in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sale. The higher gross margin during the fourth quarter was driven mainly by a better merchandise margin, which increased about 195 basis points. Lower shortage and freight added about 25 and 20 basis points, respectively to better margins. The remaining operating margin gains came from the leverage of occupancy, distribution, store and corporate expenses from the roll of up to [ph] (34:30) 10% increase in same-store sales, partially offset by higher incentive costs compared to the prior year.Now I'll spend a few moments summarizing the underlying assumptions that support our 2010 fiscal year EPS targets. A more detailed version is available in the written transcript of our January sales release recorded comments in the Investors section of our corporate website. Our fiscal year 2010 earnings per share forecast of $3.80 to $3.95 is based on projected total sales growth of 4% to 5% over the prior year, driven by a 4% to 5% increase in the number of stores and a 1% to 2% increase in same-store sales on top of the 6% gain in 2009. Our projected store growth includes about 35 Ross Dress for Less and as Michael mentioned, 15 new dd's DISCOUNTS locations. The exciting growth for dd's includes our anticipated entry into a few new states in the latter part of the year. We are forecasting operating margin of 10.1% to 10.3%, which represents flat incremental growth over 2009 when EBIT grew by about 250 basis points. Drivers include flattish merchandise gross margin in 2010 with flat to incremental improvement in expenses.Net interest expense is expected to be about $8 million to $9 million. Our tax rate is planned to be approximately 38% to 39%, and we expect an approximate 4% decline in diluted shares to about $120 million. Our first quarter guidance that we issued at the beginning of February was for same-store sales to increase 2% to 3% on top of the 3% increase last year, and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.92 to $0.95, up from $0.72 in the first quarter of 2009. As Michael noted, these targets reflected that we face our ages [ph] (36:50) prior-year sales and operating margin comparisons in the first quarter. We recently reported February sales that were well ahead of our expectations, with same-store sales up 11% versus our forecast for a 4% of 5% increase. While we are encouraged by the healthy start of the year, February is a small month of the quarter for both sales and earnings with the important March-April Easter selling period still ahead of us. In addition, Easter is moving to the first Sunday of fiscal April 2010 from the second Sunday in fiscal April last year, shifting all of our pre-Easter business into March. Holiday shifts like this are always very difficult to predict. As a result, earlier this month, we reiterated our guidance for same-store sales to be up 3% to 4% in March and flat to up 1% in April. Now I'll turn the call back over to Michael for some closing comments."

We continue to believe that the main reason for our exceptional performance in 2009 has been our ability to execute our strategies with unwavering focus and discipline throughout all areas of the company. This has enabled us to capitalize",681,"Thank you, John. We continue to believe that the main reason for our exceptional performance in 2009 has been our ability to execute our strategies with unwavering focus and discipline throughout all areas of the company. This has enabled us to capitalize on our favorable position as a value retailer in the current economic and retail environment. By consistently stocking our stores with great bargains, operating our business on lower inventories to drive faster turns and fewer markdowns and strictly controlling expenses throughout the business, we have been able to deliver record sales and earnings results. Looking ahead, we believe that consumers increased focus on value will continue for the foreseeable future, which bodes well for our bargain-oriented merchandise strategy. We know that our ability to give our customers the best value as possible on a wide array of name brand fashions for the family and the home is, and always will be, the key to our success. To ensure that we have plenty of access to enough quality name brand products to grow profitably in the future, we continue to make further investments in our merchandise organizations.  We currently have hundreds of merchants, sourcing products everyday from thousands of vendors. As previously mentioned, another key driver of our record results in 2009 was the significant gains we realized in merchandise gross margin. This improved profitability was not only from buying great product, but also from maintaining strict controls on merchandise inventories. We also believe there are additional opportunities to enhance revenues and gross margin over the longer term through micro-merchandising, which was rolled out to all merchandise categories across all Ross locations in 2009. These tools consist of new systems and processes to help us more accurately plan, buy and allocate merchandise down to a local level. Building inventory plans from the bottom up, ahead of each season and then trending sales and inventory levels against these plans as the season progresses, is expected to strengthen our ability overtime, to get the right merchandise to the right store at the right time. Today, we operate a total of 1,000 Ross and dd's locations in just 27 states, giving us significant room to grow going forward. As we have previously noted, our planned unit growth of 4% to 5% for Ross and dd's, combined in 2010, is projected to accelerate to about 7% in 2011, when we expect to enter new geographic markets for both chains. There remains plenty of expansion opportunity as we believe that Ross can have as many as 1,500 locations, and that dd's DISCOUNTS can ultimately grow to approximately 500 stores. That would represent a doubling of our existing store base and exciting prospects. Finally, while our 2009 operating margin is close to record levels, we believe that this current level of profitability is not only sustainable, but have some room for incremental improvement in 2010 as noted in our guidance. While our projected earnings per share range for 2010 reflect a slightly lower growth rate than we would normally forecast, we felt that this was appropriate based on the very strong 52% earnings per share gain we are up against from 2009. Again, our practice is to be somewhat cautious in our planning process while constantly striving to beat our targets as we have done over the past couple of years. Over the longer term, we believe that earnings per share growth of 10% to 15% is a realistic and very achievable goal. The formula remains unchanged: A combination of store growth, comparable store sales gains, flat to incremental improvement in operating margin, generating excess cash that can be used to fund our dividend and stock repurchase programs. In closing, I want to reiterate that we have a long history of delivering solid sales and earnings gains, with very healthy cash flow and returns on equity and assets in all types of economic environments. We are confident that we can continue to do so in 2010 and beyond. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."

The more people we have covering the market, spending more time with resources, we think it's good thing for our business. So basically, what we've done is we've continue to split our businesses into tighter, into smaller and smaller segments, so people are responsible for a smaller pyramid, so they can focus more on the business, as well as bend the relationships. This additional splitting of the business helps us manage our inventory tighter, in addition to having greater market coverage.

Joining me on our call today are: Norman Ferber, Chairman of the Board; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bobbi Chaville, Senior Director, Investor Relations. We will begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2009 performance, followed by our outlook for 2010 and the longer term. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.Before we start, I want to note that our comments on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results and other matters that are based on management's current forecast of aspects of the company's future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risk factors are detailed in today's press release and our fiscal 2008 Form 10-K, fiscal 2009 Form 10-Qs and fiscal 2009 and 2010 Form 8-Ks on file with the SEC.Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended January 30, 2010, grew 53% to $1.16, up from $0.76 for the 13 weeks ended January 31, 2009. Net earnings for the quarter grew to a record $142.9 million, up 47% from $97.4 million in the prior-year period. For the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010, earnings per share grew 52% to $3.54, up from $2.33 for the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009. Net earnings for fiscal 2009 increased 45% to a record $442.8 million, up from $305.4 million in 2008. Fourth quarter sales increased 14% to $1,980,000,000, with comparable store sales up 10% over the prior year. For the full year, total sales rose 11% to $7,184,000,000, with same-store sales up 6% on top of a 2% gain in the prior year. Our better-than-expected sales for both the quarter and the year benefited from healthy traffic to our stores, as an increasing number of shoppers were attracted to our great values. The best-performing merchandise categories for both the quarter and the year were Shoes, Dresses and Home, all posting double-digit gains in same-store sales for both periods. Geographic trends were broad-based with high-single to low-double-digit percentage same-store sales increases across all regions for the quarter and mid- to high-single-digit gains for the year.The Northwest and Southwest regions were the best performing markets in the fourth quarter, while the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast were the top regions for the year. California same-store sales rose 8% during the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year.We are extremely pleased with our outstanding sales and earnings results. Our 52% gain in earnings per share in fiscal 2009 was on top of a 23% increase in the prior year. Ross was one of the very few retailers to generate this level of robust growth in 2009. Our ability to execute a rough [ph] (25:18) price strategy successfully throughout all areas of our company was the primary driver of our exceptional financial results. During one of the most challenging economic and retail environments, we not only generated much higher-than-planned revenues, but did so with record merchandise gross margins that drove double-digit operating profit as a percent of sales.Earnings before interest and taxes for 2009 fourth quarter grew about 260 basis points to 11.7% of sales, up from 9.1% in the prior year. This higher profit margin was mainly due to a 230 basis point reduction in cost of goods sold, along with a 30 basis points decline in selling, general and administrative costs. For the 2009 fiscal year, operating margin increased about 250 basis points over the prior year to 10.1% of sales, also driven by a 230 basis point decline in cost of goods sold, combined with a 20 basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. Key drivers of our improved profitability for both the fourth quarter and the year were significant growth in merchandise gross margin, lower shortage costs and leverage on operating expenses from the strong gains in same-store sales. John will provide some additional color on operating margin trends in a few minutes.On average, in-store inventories were down in the mid-teen percentage range throughout 2009 and ended the year down about 11%. Now operating our business with much lower in-store inventories increases the percentage of fresh and exciting merchandise that our customers see when they shop at our stores. By exceeding our sales targets with leaner inventories, we realized significantly fast returns in 2009, which resulted in much fewer markdowns. For 2010, we are planning further reductions of in-store inventories with average levels targeted down in the mid- to high-single digit percentage range compared to 2009. We believe our ongoing focus on tight inventory management will further accelerate inventory turns and maximize merchandise gross margin.Turning to our store expansion program, we added 56 new stores in 2009, including 52 Ross Dress for Less and four dd's DISCOUNTS locations. dd's DISCOUNTS' outstanding performance in 2009 continued in the fourth quarter, with sales and profitability for both the quarter and the full year well ahead of our original expectations. In fact, the earnings impact or drag from dd's was relatively neutral in 2009 compared to a 35 basis point drag in 2008. We are pleased to report that on a pretax basis before interest cost and corporate overhead allocations, dd's DISCOUNTS was profitable for the first time in its history.This improvement was driven by both higher sales productivity and much higher gross margin. Like Ross, dd's is benefiting from our ability to deliver a faster flow of fresh and exciting products to our stores while operating on lower inventory levels. dd's strong gains in sales and profitability also reflect that its valued focus merchandise offerings are resonating well with its customers. dd's results make us even more enthusiastic about dd's long-term prospects and our plans to accelerate its expansion in 2010 and beyond.Now let's talk about our financial condition. Our balance sheet remains very healthy with cash and short-term investments of $770 million at year end. Our higher cash balances benefited primarily from much better-than-expected earnings, as well as reduced working capital needs from operating our stores with lower inventories. Our consistently strong cash flows enabled us to continue to enhance stockholder return through both our dividend and stock repurchase programs. During 2009, after internally financing both our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, we used available cash to buy back $70 million of common stock in the fourth quarter and $300 million for the fiscal year. This allowed us to retire about 1.6 million and 7.4 million shares in the fourth quarter and fiscal year periods, respectively. This completed the prior two-year $600 million program announced in early 2008.In January 2010, our Board of Directors approved a new two-year $750 million stock repurchase program, along with a 45% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.16 per common share. These actions reflect our confidence and our ongoing ability to generate healthy amount of excess cash and our long-term commitment to enhancing stockholder returns.Now I'd like to review the 2010 targets we communicated with our January sales release in early February. We have a resilient and flexible off-price model that when we execute it well, enables us to deliver solid results in both favorable and challenging business cycles. That said, we are off against a year of exceptional growth in both sales and earnings in 2009. As a result, we have been prudent in setting our targets for 2010 with the hope that we can do better, as we recently did in February when sales were well above plans. For the 2010 fiscal year, we are forecasting same-store sales to increase 1% to 2% on top of a strong 6% gain in 2009, and projecting earnings per share to increase 7% to 12%, to $3.80 to $3.95. It's important to remember that this projected earnings per share growth is on top of an outstanding 52% increase in 2009, our largest annual increase in more than a decade. We are projecting the largest earnings per share increases in the first half of 2010. We faced the easiest prior-year sales and operating margin comparisons in the first quarter, providing us greater opportunity for improvement during this period. For the second quarter, earnings per share are forecast to grow in the low-double digit percentage range. We are up against to our toughest sales in merchandise margin and shortage comparisons in the third and fourth quarters of 2010. In the second half of 2009, a 9% increase in comparable store sales and operating profits that grew over 300 basis points as a percent of sales drove a 67% increase in earnings per share. As a result, we are projecting flattish earnings per share in the second half versus the prior year. Now John will provide some additional details on our fourth quarter results, and review the underlying operating statement assumptions that support our earnings per share targets for the first quarter and fiscal 2010."

As Michael discussed, our fourth quarter operating margin increased by 260 basis points over the prior year due to a 230 basis point reduction in cost of goods sold and a 30 basis point decline in selling, general and administrative co",554,"Thank you, Michael. As Michael discussed, our fourth quarter operating margin increased by 260 basis points over the prior year due to a 230 basis point reduction in cost of goods sold and a 30 basis point decline in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sale. The higher gross margin during the fourth quarter was driven mainly by a better merchandise margin, which increased about 195 basis points. Lower shortage and freight added about 25 and 20 basis points, respectively to better margins. The remaining operating margin gains came from the leverage of occupancy, distribution, store and corporate expenses from the roll of up to [ph] 10% increase in same-store sales, partially offset by higher incentive costs compared to the prior year.Now I'll spend a few moments summarizing the underlying assumptions that support our 2010 fiscal year EPS targets. A more detailed version is available in the written transcript of our January sales release recorded comments in the Investors section of our corporate website. Our fiscal year 2010 earnings per share forecast of $3.80 to $3.95 is based on projected total sales growth of 4% to 5% over the prior year, driven by a 4% to 5% increase in the number of stores and a 1% to 2% increase in same-store sales on top of the 6% gain in 2009. Our projected store growth includes about 35 Ross Dress for Less and as Michael mentioned, 15 new dd's DISCOUNTS locations. The accelerated growth for dd's includes our anticipated entry into a few new states in the latter part of the year. We are forecasting operating margin of 10.1% to 10.3%, which represents flat incremental growth over 2009 when EBIT grew by about 250 basis points. Drivers include flattish merchandise gross margin in 2010 with flat to incremental improvement in expenses.Net interest expense is expected to be about $8 million to $9 million. Our tax rate is planned to be approximately 38% to 39%, and we expect an approximate 4% decline in diluted shares to about $120 million. Our first quarter guidance that we issued at the beginning of February was for same-store sales to increase 2% to 3% on top of a 3% increase last year, and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.92 to $0.95, up from $0.72 in the first quarter of 2009. As Michael noted, these targets reflected that we face our ages [ph] prior-year sales and operating margin comparisons in the first quarter. We recently reported February sales that were well ahead of our expectations, with same-store sales up 11% versus our forecast for a 4% of 5% increase. While we are encouraged by the healthy start to the year, February is a small month of the quarter for both sales and earnings with the important March-April Easter selling period still ahead of us. In addition, Easter is moving to the first Sunday of fiscal April 2010 from the second Sunday in fiscal April last year, shifting all of our pre-Easter business into March. Holiday shifts like this are always very difficult to predict. As a result, earlier this month, we reiterated our guidance for same-store sales to be up 3% to 4% in March and flat to up 1% in April. Now I'll turn the call back to Michael for some closing comments."

We continue to believe that the main reason for our exceptional performance in 2009 has been our ability to execute our strategies with unwavering focus and discipline throughout all areas of the company. This has enabled us to capitalize",681,"Thank you, John. We continue to believe that the main reason for our exceptional performance in 2009 has been our ability to execute our strategies with unwavering focus and discipline throughout all areas of the company. This has enabled us to capitalize on our favorable position as a value retailer in the current economic and retail environment. By consistently stocking our stores with great bargains, operating our business on lower inventories to drive faster turns and fewer markdowns and strictly controlling expenses throughout the business, we have been able to deliver record sales and earnings results. Looking ahead, we believe that consumers increased focus on value will continue for the foreseeable future, which bodes well for our bargain-oriented merchandise strategy. We know that our ability to give our customers the best value as possible on a wide array of name brand fashions for the family and the home is, and always will be, the key to our success. To ensure that we have plenty of access to enough quality name brand products to grow profitably in the future, we continue to make further investments in our merchandise organizations.  We currently have hundreds of merchants, sourcing products everyday from thousands of vendors. As previously mentioned, another key driver of our record results in 2009 was the significant gains we realized in merchandise gross margin. This improved profitability was not only from buying great product, but also from maintaining strict controls on merchandise inventories. We also believe there are additional opportunities to enhance revenues and gross margin over the longer term through micro-merchandising, which was rolled out to all merchandise categories across all Ross locations in 2009. These tools consist of new systems and processes to help us more accurately plan, buy and allocate merchandise down to a local level. Building inventory plans from the bottom up, ahead of each season and then trending sales and inventory levels against these plans as the season progresses, is expected to strengthen our ability overtime, to get the right merchandise to the right store at the right time. Today, we operate a total of 1,000 Ross and dd's locations in just 27 states, giving us significant room to grow going forward. As we have previously noted, our planned unit growth of 4% to 5% for Ross and dd's, combined in 2010, is projected to accelerate to about 7% in 2011, when we expect to enter new geographic markets for both chains. There remains plenty of expansion opportunity as we believe that Ross can have as many as 1,500 locations, and that dd's DISCOUNTS can ultimately grow to approximately 500 stores. That would represent a doubling of our existing store base and exciting prospects. Finally, while our 2009 operating margin is close to record levels, we believe that this current level of profitability is not only sustainable, but have some room for incremental improvement in 2010 as noted in our guidance. While our projected earnings per share range for 2010 reflect a slightly lower growth rate than we would normally forecast, we felt that this was appropriate based on the very strong 52% earnings per share gain we are up against from 2009. Again, our practice is to be somewhat cautious in our planning process while constantly striving to beat our targets as we have done over the past couple of years. Over the longer term, we believe that earnings per share growth of 10% to 15% is a realistic and very achievable goal. The formula remains unchanged: A combination of store growth, comparable store sales gains, flat to incremental improvement in operating margin, generating excess cash that can be used to fund our dividend and stock repurchase programs. In closing, I want to reiterate that we have a long history of delivering solid sales and earnings gains, with very healthy cash flow and returns on equity and assets in all types of economic environments. We are confident that we can continue to do so in 2010 and beyond. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."

Joining me on our call today are: Norman Ferber, Chairman of the Board; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bobbi Chaville, Senior Director, Investor Relations. We will begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2009 performance, followed by our outlook for 2010 and the longer term. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.Before we start, I want to note that our comments on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results and other matters that are based on management's current forecast of aspects of the company's future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risk factors are detailed in today's press release and our fiscal 2008 Form 10-K, fiscal 2009 Form 10-Qs and fiscal 2009 and 2010 Form 8-Ks on file with the SEC.Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended January 30, 2010, grew 53% to $1.16, up from $0.76 for the 13 weeks ended January 31, 2009. Net earnings for the quarter grew to a record $142.9 million, up 47% from $97.4 million in the prior-year period. For the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010, earnings per share grew 52% to $3.54, up from $2.33 for the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009. Net earnings for fiscal 2009 increased 45% to a record $442.8 million, up from $305.4 million in 2008. Fourth quarter sales increased 14% to $1,980,000,000, with comparable store sales up 10% over the prior year. For the full year, total sales rose 11% to $7,184,000,000, with same-store sales up 6% on top of a 2% gain in the prior year. Our better-than-expected sales for both the quarter and the year benefited from healthy traffic to our stores, as an increasing number of shoppers were attracted to our great values. The best-performing merchandise categories for both the quarter and the year were Shoes, Dresses and Home, all posting double-digit gains in same-store sales for both periods. Geographic trends were broad-based with high-single to low-double-digit percentage same-store sales increases across all regions for the quarter and mid- to high-single-digit gains for the year.The Northwest and Southwest regions were the best performing markets in the fourth quarter, while the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast were the top regions for the year. California same-store sales rose 8% during the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year.We are extremely pleased with our outstanding sales and earnings results. Our 52% gain in earnings per share in fiscal 2009 was on top of a 23% increase in the prior year. Ross was one of the very few retailers to generate this level of robust growth in 2009. Our ability to execute a rough [ph] (25:18) price strategy successfully throughout all areas of our company was the primary driver of our exceptional financial results. During one of the most challenging economic and retail environments, we not only generated much higher-than-planned revenues, but did so with record merchandise gross margins that drove double-digit operating profit as a percent of sales.Earnings before interest and taxes for 2009 fourth quarter grew about 260 basis points to 11.7% of sales, up from 9.1% in the prior year. This higher profit margin was mainly due to a 230 basis point reduction in cost of goods sold, along with a 30 basis points decline in selling, general and administrative costs. For the 2009 fiscal year, operating margin increased about 250 basis points over the prior year to 10.1% of sales, also driven by a 230 basis point decline in cost of goods sold, combined with a 20 basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. Key drivers of our improved profitability for both the fourth quarter and the year were significant growth in merchandise gross margin, lower shortage costs and leverage on operating expenses from the strong gains in same-store sales. John will provide some additional color on operating margin trends in a few minutes.On average, in-store inventories were down in the mid-teen percentage range throughout 2009 and ended the year down about 11%. Now operating our business with much lower in-store inventories increases the percentage of fresh and exciting merchandise that our customers see when they shop at our stores. By exceeding our sales targets with leaner inventories, we realized significantly fast returns in 2009, which resulted in much fewer markdowns. For 2010, we are planning further reductions of in-store inventories with average levels targeted down in the mid- to high-single digit percentage range compared to 2009. We believe our ongoing focus on tight inventory management will further accelerate inventory turns and maximize merchandise gross margin.Turning to our store expansion program, we added 56 new stores in 2009, including 52 Ross Dress for Less and four dd's DISCOUNTS locations. dd's DISCOUNTS' outstanding performance in 2009 continued in the fourth quarter, with sales and profitability for both the quarter and the full year well ahead of our original expectations. In fact, the earnings impact or drag from dd's was relatively neutral in 2009 compared to a 35 basis point drag in 2008. We are pleased to report that on a pretax basis before interest cost and corporate overhead allocations, dd's DISCOUNTS was profitable for the first time in its history.This improvement was driven by both higher sales productivity and much higher gross margin. Like Ross, dd's is benefiting from our ability to deliver a faster flow of fresh and exciting products to our stores while operating on lower inventory levels. dd's strong gains in sales and profitability also reflect that its valued focus merchandise offerings are resonating well with its customers. dd's results make us even more enthusiastic about dd's long-term prospects and our plans to accelerate its expansion in 2010 and beyond.Now let's talk about our financial condition. Our balance sheet remains very healthy with cash and short-term investments of $770 million at year end. Our higher cash balances benefited primarily from much better-than-expected earnings, as well as reduced working capital needs from operating our stores with lower inventories. Our consistently strong cash flows enabled us to continue to enhance stockholder return through both our dividend and stock repurchase programs. During 2009, after internally financing both our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, we used available cash to buy back $70 million of common stock in the fourth quarter and $300 million for the fiscal year. This allowed us to retire about 1.6 million and 7.4 million shares in the fourth quarter and fiscal year periods, respectively. This completed the prior two-year $600 million program announced in early 2008.In January 2010, our Board of Directors approved a new two-year $750 million stock repurchase program, along with a 45% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.16 per common share. These actions reflect our confidence and our ongoing ability to generate healthy amount of excess cash and our long-term commitment to enhancing stockholder returns.Now I'd like to review the 2010 targets we communicated with our January sales release in early February. We have a resilient and flexible off-price model that when we execute it well, enables us to deliver solid results in both favorable and challenging business cycles. That said, we are off against a year of exceptional growth in both sales and earnings in 2009. As a result, we have been prudent in setting our targets for 2010 with the hope that we can do better, as we recently did in February when sales were well above plans. For the 2010 fiscal year, we are forecasting same-store sales to increase 1% to 2% on top of a strong 6% gain in 2009, and projecting earnings per share to increase 7% to 12%, to $3.80 to $3.95. It's important to remember that this projected earnings per share growth is on top of an outstanding 52% increase in 2009, our largest annual increase in more than a decade. We are projecting the largest earnings per share increases in the first half of 2010. We faced the easiest prior-year sales and operating margin comparisons in the first quarter, providing us greater opportunity for improvement during this period. For the second quarter, earnings per share are forecast to grow in the low-double digit percentage range. We are up against to our toughest sales in merchandise margin and shortage comparisons in the third and fourth quarters of 2010. In the second half of 2009, a 9% increase in comparable store sales and operating profits that grew over 300 basis points as a percent of sales drove a 67% increase in earnings per share. As a result, we are projecting flattish earnings per share in the second half versus the prior year. Now John will provide some additional details on our fourth quarter results, and review the underlying operating statement assumptions that support our earnings per share targets for the first quarter and fiscal 2010."

As Michael discussed, our fourth quarter operating margin increased by 260 basis points over the prior year due to a 230 basis point reduction in cost of goods sold and a 30 basis point decline in selling, general and administrative co",554,"Thank you, Michael. As Michael discussed, our fourth quarter operating margin increased by 260 basis points over the prior year due to a 230 basis point reduction in cost of goods sold and a 30 basis point decline in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sale. The higher gross margin during the fourth quarter was driven mainly by a better merchandise margin, which increased about 195 basis points. Lower shortage and freight added about 25 and 20 basis points, respectively to better margins. The remaining operating margin gains came from the leverage of occupancy, distribution, store and corporate expenses from the roll of up to [ph] 10% increase in same-store sales, partially offset by higher incentive costs compared to the prior year.Now I'll spend a few moments summarizing the underlying assumptions that support our 2010 fiscal year EPS targets. A more detailed version is available in the written transcript of our January sales release recorded comments in the Investors section of our corporate website. Our fiscal year 2010 earnings per share forecast of $3.80 to $3.95 is based on projected total sales growth of 4% to 5% over the prior year, driven by a 4% to 5% increase in the number of stores and a 1% to 2% increase in same-store sales on top of the 6% gain in 2009. Our projected store growth includes about 35 Ross Dress for Less and as Michael mentioned, 15 new dd's DISCOUNTS locations. The accelerated growth for dd's includes our anticipated entry into a few new states in the latter part of the year. We are forecasting operating margin of 10.1% to 10.3%, which represents flat incremental growth over 2009 when EBIT grew by about 250 basis points. Drivers include flattish merchandise gross margin in 2010 with flat to incremental improvement in expenses.Net interest expense is expected to be about $8 million to $9 million. Our tax rate is planned to be approximately 38% to 39%, and we expect an approximate 4% decline in diluted shares to about $120 million. Our first quarter guidance that we issued at the beginning of February was for same-store sales to increase 2% to 3% on top of a 3% increase last year, and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.92 to $0.95, up from $0.72 in the first quarter of 2009. As Michael noted, these targets reflected that we face our ages [ph] prior-year sales and operating margin comparisons in the first quarter. We recently reported February sales that were well ahead of our expectations, with same-store sales up 11% versus our forecast for a 4% of 5% increase. While we are encouraged by the healthy start to the year, February is a small month of the quarter for both sales and earnings with the important March-April Easter selling period still ahead of us. In addition, Easter is moving to the first Sunday of fiscal April 2010 from the second Sunday in fiscal April last year, shifting all of our pre-Easter business into March. Holiday shifts like this are always very difficult to predict. As a result, earlier this month, we reiterated our guidance for same-store sales to be up 3% to 4% in March and flat to up 1% in April. Now I'll turn the call back to Michael for some closing comments."

This has enabled us to capitalize on our favorable position as a value retailer in the current economic and retail environment. By consistently stocking our stores with great bargains, operating our business on lower inventories to drive faster turns and fewer markdowns and strictly controlling expenses throughout the business, we have been able to deliver record sales and earnings results. Looking ahead, we believe that consumers increased focus on value will continue for the foreseeable future, which bodes well for our bargain-oriented merchandise strategy. We know that our ability to give our customers the best value as possible on a wide array of name brand fashions for the family and the home is, and always will be, the key to our success. To ensure that we have plenty of access to enough quality name brand products to grow profitably in the future, we continue to make further investments in our merchandise organizations.  We currently have hundreds of merchants, sourcing products everyday from thousands of vendors. As previously mentioned, another key driver of our record results in 2009 was the significant gains we realized in merchandise gross margin. This improved profitability was not only from buying great product, but also from maintaining strict controls on merchandise inventories. We also believe there are additional opportunities to enhance revenues and gross margin over the longer term through micro-merchandising, which was rolled out to all merchandise categories across all Ross locations in 2009. These tools consist of new systems and processes to help us more accurately plan, buy and allocate merchandise down to a local level. Building inventory plans from the bottom up, ahead of each season and then trending sales and inventory levels against these plans as the season progresses, is expected to strengthen our ability overtime, to get the right merchandise to the right store at the right time. Today, we operate a total of 1,000 Ross and dd's locations in just 27 states, giving us significant room to grow going forward. As we have previously noted, our planned unit growth of 4% to 5% for Ross and dd's, combined in 2010, is projected to accelerate to about 7% in 2011, when we expect to enter new geographic markets for both chains. There remains plenty of expansion opportunity as we believe that Ross can have as many as 1,500 locations, and that dd's DISCOUNTS can ultimately grow to approximately 500 stores. That would represent a doubling of our existing store base and exciting prospects. Finally, while our 2009 operating margin is close to record levels, we believe that this current level of profitability is not only sustainable, but have some room for incremental improvement in 2010 as noted in our guidance. While our projected earnings per share range for 2010 reflect a slightly lower growth rate than we would normally forecast, we felt that this was appropriate based on the very strong 52% earnings per share gain we are up against from 2009. Again, our practice is to be somewhat cautious in our planning process while constantly striving to beat our targets as we have done over the past couple of years. Over the longer term, we believe that earnings per share growth of 10% to 15% is a realistic and very achievable goal. The formula remains unchanged: A combination of store growth, comparable store sales gains, flat to incremental improvement in operating margin, generating excess cash that can be used to fund our dividend and stock repurchase programs. In closing, I want to reiterate that we have a long history of delivering solid sales and earnings gains, with very healthy cash flow and returns on equity and assets in all types of economic environments. We are confident that we can continue to do so in 2010 and beyond. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."

Joining me on our call today are: Norman Ferber, Chairman of the Board; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bobbi Chaville, Senior Director, Investor Relations. We will begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2009 performance, followed by our outlook for 2010 and the longer term. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.Before we start, I want to note that our comments on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results and other matters that are based on management's current forecast of aspects of the company's future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risk factors are detailed in today's press release and our fiscal 2008 Form 10-K, fiscal 2009 Form 10-Qs and fiscal 2009 and 2010 Form 8-Ks on file with the SEC.Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended January 30, 2010, grew 53% to $1.16, up from $0.76 for the 13 weeks ended January 31, 2009. Net earnings for the quarter grew to a record $142.9 million, up 47% from $97.4 million in the prior-year period. For the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010, earnings per share grew 52% to $3.54, up from $2.33 for the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009. Net earnings for fiscal 2009 increased 45% to a record $442.8 million, up from $305.4 million in 2008. Fourth quarter sales increased 14% to $1,980,000,000, with comparable store sales up 10% over the prior year. For the full year, total sales rose 11% to $7,184,000,000, with same-store sales up 6% on top of a 2% gain in the prior year. Our better-than-expected sales for both the quarter and the year benefited from healthy traffic to our stores, as an increasing number of shoppers were attracted to our great values. The best-performing merchandise categories for both the quarter and the year were Shoes, Dresses and Home, all posting double-digit gains in same-store sales for both periods. Geographic trends were broad-based with high-single to low-double-digit percentage same-store sales increases across all regions for the quarter and mid- to high-single-digit gains for the year.The Northwest and Southwest regions were the best performing markets in the fourth quarter, while the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast were the top regions for the year. California same-store sales rose 8% during the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year.We are extremely pleased with our outstanding sales and earnings results. Our 52% gain in earnings per share in fiscal 2009 was on top of a 23% increase in the prior year. Ross was one of the very few retailers to generate this level of robust growth in 2009. Our ability to execute a rough price strategy successfully throughout all areas of our company was the primary driver of our exceptional financial results. During one of the most challenging economic and retail environments, we not only generated much higher-than-planned revenues, but did so with record merchandise gross margins that drove double-digit operating profit as a percent of sales.Earnings before interest and taxes for 2009 fourth quarter grew about 260 basis points to 11.7% of sales, up from 9.1% in the prior year. This higher profit margin was mainly due to a 230 basis point reduction in cost of goods sold, along with a 30 basis points decline in selling, general and administrative costs. For the 2009 fiscal year, operating margin increased about 250 basis points over the prior year to 10.1% of sales, also driven by a 230 basis point decline in cost of goods sold, combined with a 20 basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. Key drivers of our improved profitability for both the fourth quarter and the year were significant growth in merchandise gross margin, lower shortage costs and leverage on operating expenses from the strong gains in same-store sales. John will provide some additional color on operating margin trends in a few minutes.On average, in-store inventories were down in the mid-teen percentage range throughout 2009 and ended the year down about 11%. Now operating our business with much lower in-store inventories increases the percentage of fresh and exciting merchandise that our customers see when they shop at our stores. By exceeding our sales targets with leaner inventories, we realized significantly fast returns in 2009, which resulted in much fewer markdowns. For 2010, we are planning further reductions of in-store inventories with average levels targeted down in the mid- to high-single digit percentage range compared to 2009. We believe our ongoing focus on tight inventory management will further accelerate inventory turns and maximize merchandise gross margin.Turning to our store expansion program, we added 56 new stores in 2009, including 52 Ross Dress for Less and four dd's DISCOUNTS locations. dd's DISCOUNTS' outstanding performance in 2009 continued in the fourth quarter, with sales and profitability for both the quarter and the full year well ahead of our original expectations. In fact, the earnings impact or drag from dd's was relatively neutral in 2009 compared to a 35 basis point drag in 2008. We are pleased to report that on a pretax basis before interest cost and corporate overhead allocations, dd's DISCOUNTS was profitable for the first time in its history.This improvement was driven by both higher sales productivity and much higher gross margin. Like Ross, dd's is benefiting from our ability to deliver a faster flow of fresh and exciting products to our stores while operating on lower inventory levels. dd's strong gains in sales and profitability also reflect that its valued focus merchandise offerings are resonating well with its customers. dd's results make us even more enthusiastic about dd's long-term prospects and our plans to accelerate its expansion in 2010 and beyond.Now let's talk about our financial condition. Our balance sheet remains very healthy with cash and short-term investments of $770 million at year end. Our higher cash balances benefited primarily from much better-than-expected earnings, as well as reduced working capital needs from operating our stores with lower inventories. Our consistently strong cash flows enabled us to continue to enhance stockholder return through both our dividend and stock repurchase programs. During 2009, after internally financing both our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, we used available cash to buy back $70 million of common stock in the fourth quarter and $300 million for the fiscal year. This allowed us to retire about 1.6 million and 7.4 million shares in the fourth quarter and fiscal year periods, respectively. This completed the prior two-year $600 million program announced in early 2008.In January 2010, our Board of Directors approved a new two-year $750 million stock repurchase program, along with a 45% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.16 per common share. These actions reflect our confidence and our ongoing ability to generate healthy amount of excess cash and our long-term commitment to enhancing stockholder returns.Now I'd like to review the 2010 targets we communicated with our January sales release in early February. We have a resilient and flexible off-price model that when we execute it well, enables us to deliver solid results in both favorable and challenging business cycles. That said, we are off against a year of exceptional growth in both sales and earnings in 2009. As a result, we have been prudent in setting our targets for 2010 with the hope that we can do better, as we recently did in February when sales were well above plans. For the 2010 fiscal year, we are forecasting same-store sales to increase 1% to 2% on top of a strong 6% gain in 2009, and projecting earnings per share to increase 7% to 12%, to $3.80 to $3.95. It's important to remember that this projected earnings per share growth is on top of an outstanding 52% increase in 2009, our largest annual increase in more than a decade. We are projecting the largest earnings per share increases in the first half of 2010. We faced the easiest prior-year sales and operating margin comparisons in the first quarter, providing us greater opportunity for improvement during this period. For the second quarter, earnings per share are forecast to grow in the low-double digit percentage range. We are up against to our toughest sales in merchandise margin and shortage comparisons in the third and fourth quarters of 2010. In the second half of 2009, a 9% increase in comparable store sales and operating profits that grew over 300 basis points as a percent of sales drove a 67% increase in earnings per share. As a result, we are projecting flattish earnings per share in the second half versus the prior year. Now John will provide some additional details on our fourth quarter results, and review the underlying operating statement assumptions that support our earnings per share targets for the first quarter and fiscal 2010."

As Michael discussed, our fourth quarter operating margin increased by 260 basis points over the prior year due to a 230 basis point reduction in cost of goods sold and a 30 basis point decline in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sale. The higher gross margin during the fourth quarter was driven mainly by a better merchandise margin, which increased about 195 basis points. Lower shortage and freight added about 25 and 20 basis points, respectively to better margins. The remaining operating margin gains came from the leverage of occupancy, distribution, store and corporate expenses from the roll of up to [ph] 10% increase in same-store sales, partially offset by higher incentive costs compared to the prior year.Now I'll spend a few moments summarizing the underlying assumptions that support our 2010 fiscal year EPS targets. A more detailed version is available in the written transcript of our January sales release recorded comments in the Investors section of our corporate website. Our fiscal year 2010 earnings per share forecast of $3.80 to $3.95 is based on projected total sales growth of 4% to 5% over the prior year, driven by a 4% to 5% increase in the number of stores and a 1% to 2% increase in same-store sales on top of the 6% gain in 2009. Our projected store growth includes about 35 Ross Dress for Less and as Michael mentioned, 15 new dd's DISCOUNTS locations. The accelerated growth for dd's includes our anticipated entry into a few new states in the latter part of the year. We are forecasting operating margin of 10.1% to 10.3%, which represents flat incremental growth over 2009 when EBIT grew by about 250 basis points. Drivers include flattish merchandise gross margin in 2010 with flat to incremental improvement in expenses.Net interest expense is expected to be about $8 million to $9 million. Our tax rate is planned to be approximately 38% to 39%, and we expect an approximate 4% decline in diluted shares to about $120 million. Our first quarter guidance that we issued at the beginning of February was for same-store sales to increase 2% to 3% on top of a 3% increase last year, and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.92 to $0.95, up from $0.72 in the first quarter of 2009. As Michael noted, these targets reflected that we face our ages [ph] prior-year sales and operating margin comparisons in the first quarter. We recently reported February sales that were well ahead of our expectations, with same-store sales up 11% versus our forecast for a 4% of 5% increase. While we are encouraged by the healthy start to the year, February is a small month of the quarter for both sales and earnings with the important March-April Easter selling period still ahead of us. In addition, Easter is moving to the first Sunday of fiscal April 2010 from the second Sunday in fiscal April last year, shifting all of our pre-Easter business into March. Holiday shifts like this are always very difficult to predict. As a result, earlier this month, we reiterated our guidance for same-store sales to be up 3% to 4% in March and flat to up 1% in April. Now I'll turn the call back to Michael for some closing comments."

This has enabled us to capitalize",681,"Thank you, John. We continue to believe that the main reason for our exceptional performance in 2009 has been our ability to execute our strategies with unwavering focus and discipline throughout all areas of the company. This has enabled us to capitalize on our favorable position as a value retailer in the current economic and retail environment. By consistently stocking our stores with great bargains, operating our business on lower inventories to drive faster turns and fewer markdowns and strictly controlling expenses throughout the business, we have been able to deliver record sales and earnings results. Looking ahead, we believe that consumers increased focus on value will continue for the foreseeable future, which bodes well for our bargain-oriented merchandise strategy. We know that our ability to give our customers the best value as possible on a wide array of name brand fashions for the family and the home is, and always will be, the key to our success. To ensure that we have plenty of access to enough quality name brand products to grow profitably in the future, we continue to make further investments in our merchandise organizations.  We currently have hundreds of merchants, sourcing products everyday from thousands of vendors. As previously mentioned, another key driver of our record results in 2009 was the significant gains we realized in merchandise gross margin. This improved profitability was not only from buying great product, but also from maintaining strict controls on merchandise inventories. We also believe there are additional opportunities to enhance revenues and gross margin over the longer term through micro-merchandising, which was rolled out to all merchandise categories across all Ross locations in 2009. These tools consist of new systems and processes to help us more accurately plan, buy and allocate merchandise down to a local level. Building inventory plans from the bottom up, ahead of each season and then trending sales and inventory levels against these plans as the season progresses, is expected to strengthen our ability overtime, to get the right merchandise to the right store at the right time. Today, we operate a total of 1,000 Ross and dd's locations in just 27 states, giving us significant room to grow going forward. As we have previously noted, our planned unit growth of 4% to 5% for Ross and dd's, combined in 2010, is projected to accelerate to about 7% in 2011, when we expect to enter new geographic markets for both chains. There remains plenty of expansion opportunity as we believe that Ross can have as many as 1,500 locations, and that dd's DISCOUNTS can ultimately grow to approximately 500 stores. That would represent a doubling of our existing store base and exciting prospects. Finally, while our 2009 operating margin is close to record levels, we believe that this current level of profitability is not only sustainable, but have some room for incremental improvement in 2010 as noted in our guidance. While our projected earnings per share range for 2010 reflect a slightly lower growth rate than we would normally forecast, we felt that this was appropriate based on the very strong 52% earnings per share gain we are up against from 2009. Again, our practice is to be somewhat cautious in our planning process while constantly striving to beat our targets as we have done over the past couple of years. Over the longer term, we believe that earnings per share growth of 10% to 15% is a realistic and very achievable goal. The formula remains unchanged: A combination of store growth, comparable store sales gains, flat to incremental improvement in operating margin, generating excess cash that can be used to fund our dividend and stock repurchase programs. In closing, I want to reiterate that we have a long history of delivering solid sales and earnings gains, with very healthy cash flow and returns on equity and assets in all types of economic environments. We are confident that we can continue to do so in 2010 and beyond. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."

Thank you for joining us today. Also on the call are Norman Ferber, Chairman of the Board; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bobbi Chaville, Senior Director of Investor Relations. 
We'll begin with a brief review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. Before we begin, I want to note that our comments on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results and other matters that are based on management's current forecast of aspects of the company's future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. These risk factors are detailed in today's press release, in our fiscal 2009 Form 10-K and 2010 Form 8-Ks on file with the SEC.
Turning to our results. Today, we reported first quarter earnings per share of $1.16, up from $0.72 per share for the 2009 first quarter. These results represent an outstanding 61% increase on top of 20% growth in the prior year. Net earnings for the current quarter, the current-year quarter, grew 56% to a record $142.3 million, up from $91.4 million in the prior-year period. Our 2010 first quarter sales increased 14% to $1,935,000,000, with comparable store sales up 10% on top of a 3% gain in the prior year.
We are very pleased with our exceptional first quarter performance, which was driven by robust sales gains and record levels of profitability that were well ahead of plan. We believe our results continue to benefit from the superior execution of our off-price strategies combined with our favorable position as a value retailer in the current economic and retail environment.
During the first quarter, we continued to see healthy traffic to our stores as an increasing number of shoppers were attracted to our wide assortments of fresh and exciting name-brand bargains. Shoes and Home were the top performing merchandise categories, both with same-store sales gains in the high teen percentage range, while the Northwest and Florida were the strongest regions, posting low to mid teen increases in comparable store sales. California, which was impacted by unseasonable weather in April, posted a solid same-store sales gain of 7% for the quarter on top of a 4% increase in the prior year. 
Operating margin grew about 320 basis points to a record 12.1% due to a 230 basis point increase in gross margin and a 90 basis point improvement in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales. Key drivers of our improved profitability in the first quarter were significant growth in merchandise gross margin and leverage on operating expenses from the double-digit gain in same-store sales. John will provide some additional details on operating margin trends in a few minutes. 
As we ended the first quarter, total consolidated inventories were down 1% with average selling store inventories down about 8%. Packaway was about 33% of total inventories compared to 34% at this time last year. For 2010, we continue to plan further reductions of in-store inventories with average levels targeted down in the mid to high single-digit percentage range compared to 2009. Our customers continue to respond favorably to the higher percentage of fresh and exciting merchandise, resulting from our faster inventory turns. Additionally, our ongoing focus on tight inventory management also helps to maximize merchandise gross margins.
Turning to our store expansion program. We remain on track with our 2010 opening program, adding 14 net new Ross and two dd's DISCOUNTS in the first quarter. We are also pleased to report that dd's DISCOUNTS' strong performance in 2009 continued in the first quarter. Our accelerated growth plans for this promising business remain on track with a total of 15 new locations planned for 2010.
Based on our first quarter results and outlook for the balance of the year, we continue to expect dd's DISCOUNTS to be slightly profitable in 2010 before allocations for corporate expense. Like Ross, dd's is benefiting from our ability to deliver a faster flow of fresh and exciting product to our stores by operating on lower inventory levels. The continued solid gains in sales and profitability at dd's also reflect that its value-focused merchandise offerings are resonating well with its customers, and we are very excited about our accelerated expansion plans for dd's in 2010 and beyond.
Now let's talk about our financial condition. We are pleased to report that both our balance sheet and cash flows remain healthy. We ended the quarter with $826 million of cash and short-term investments. Our cash position benefited from our much-better-than-expected earnings and reduced working capital needs as we operate the business on lower inventories. 
We also returned a significant amount of our excess cash to stockholders through our dividend and stock repurchase programs. Earlier this year, we raised our cash dividend by 45% and announced a new two-year $750 million stock repurchase program for 2010 and 2011. During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $94 million and remain on track to complete approximately $375 million of our current authorization by the end of 2010. 
Now John will provide some additional color on our first quarter results and details on our guidance for the second quarter."

As Michael noted, we saw healthy traffic to our stores during the first quarter. Our 10% comparable store sale gain was driven by high single-digit growth in a number of transactions, combined with a low single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. 
Again, operating margin improved by about 320 basis points in the quarter to 12.1%, driven by a 230 basis point increase in gross margin and a 90 basis point decline in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales. 
Merchandise margin increased about 130 basis points, including our shortage accrual that was about 25 basis points lower than the prior year. We also realized leverage on occupancy and distribution expenses of about 70 and 40 basis points, respectively. Partially offsetting these improvements was a 10 basis point increase in freight cost. 
The decline in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales was due to a combination of leverage on both store and corporate expenses from the robust 10% increase in same-store sales. Our buyback program drove a 3% reduction in diluted shares outstanding.
Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. As noted in today's press release, our previously issued guidance for the second quarter remains unchanged. While we are exceedingly pleased with our excellent start to the year, sales trends in the current macroeconomic and retail climate can be difficult to predict. In addition, on a two-year basis, we are anniversarying tougher comparisons in the second quarter when same-store sales rose 9% for 2008 and 2009 combined, after being up 6% for the first quarter. 
We believe that planning somewhat cautiously while hoping to do better is appropriate in this environment. This practice has enabled us to chase the business, resulting in faster inventory turns and better gross margin and expense leverage when we do outperform.
As a result, for the second quarter, we continue to forecast the comparable store sales gains of 3% to 4% and earnings per share of $0.95 to $0.99. This represents forecasted EPS growth of 16% to 21% on top of an outstanding 52% gain in the second quarter of 2009. These targets are based on the following assumptions: Total sales are expected to grow about 7% to 8%, driven by a combination of new store growth and, as mentioned, same-store sales that are up 3% to 4%. We are forecasting about 15 net new stores to open during the period, including 12 Ross Dress for Less and three dd's DISCOUNTS. We are planning comparable store sales gains of 2% to 3% for May and 3% to 4% for both June and July. Last year, same-store sales rose 4%, 1% and 4%, in May, June and July, respectively.
Operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be 10.2% to 10.4%, up from 9.7% last year. This represents a projected 50 to 70 basis point increase on top of a 260 basis point gain in the second quarter of 2009. Net interest expense is planned to be approximately $2.5 million, and our tax rate is expected to be about 39%. We also estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding of about $121 million. 
As noted in today's press release, fiscal 2010 EPS is projected to grow 16% to 20% to $4.11 to $4.24, up from $3.54 last year. This forecasted increase is especially noteworthy considering it is also on top of a robust 52% gain in EPS in 2009. Now I'll turn the call back to Michael."

Again, while we plan strong earnings growth in the first quarter, our actual results were even better than expected. As mentioned earlier, through strong execution of our off-price strategies, we have been able to take advantage of our favorable position as a value retailer in the current economic and retail environment.
Looking ahead, we believe that consumers focus on value will continue for the foreseeable future, which bodes well for our bargain-oriented business. We also know that our ability to give our customers the best values possible on a wide array of name-brand fashions for the family and the home is and always will be the key to our success. We remain committed to ensuring that we have access to as wide a supply of bargains as possible by making ongoing investments in our merchandise organization. 
A larger number of merchants increases the contact we have with our resources and maximizes our potential to be in the right place at the right time to take advantage of the best value-priced branded products in the marketplace. To maximize our prospects for future sales and earnings growth, we will continue our efforts to stock our stores with great bargains, operate our business on lower inventories and strictly control expenses throughout the company.

But once we get up to scale, we have a critical mass of stores, we expect the economics to be very comparable and very attractive."

Also on the call are Norman Ferber, Chairman of the Board; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bobbi Chaville, Senior Director of Investor Relations. 
We'll begin with a brief review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. Before we begin, I want to note that our comments on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results and other matters that are based on management's current forecast of aspects of the company's future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. These risk factors are detailed in today's press release, in our fiscal 2009 Form 10-K and 2010 Form 8-Ks on file with the SEC.
Turning to our results. Today, we reported first quarter earnings per share of $1.16, up from $0.72 per share for the 2009 first quarter. These results represent an outstanding 61% increase on top of 20% growth in the prior year. Net earnings for the current quarter, the current-year quarter, grew 56% to a record $142.3 million, up from $91.4 million in the prior-year period. Our 2010 first quarter sales increased 14% to $1,935,000,000, with comparable store sales up 10% on top of a 3% gain in the prior year.
We are very pleased with our exceptional first quarter performance, which was driven by robust sales gains and record levels of profitability that were well ahead of plan. We believe our results continue to benefit from the superior execution of our off-price strategies combined with our favorable position as a value retailer in the current economic and retail environment.
During the first quarter, we continued to see healthy traffic to our stores as an increasing number of shoppers were attracted to our wide assortments of fresh and exciting name-brand bargains. Shoes and Home were the top performing merchandise categories, both with same-store sales gains in the high teen percentage range, while the Northwest and Florida were the strongest regions, posting low to mid teen increases in comparable store sales. California, which was impacted by unseasonable weather in April, posted a solid same-store sales gain of 7% for the quarter on top of a 4% increase in the prior year. 
Operating margin grew about 320 basis points to a record 12.1% due to a 230 basis point increase in gross margin and a 90 basis point improvement in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales. Key drivers of our improved profitability in the first quarter were significant growth in merchandise gross margin and leverage on operating expenses from the double-digit gain in same-store sales. John will provide some additional details on operating margin trends in a few minutes. 
As we ended the first quarter, total consolidated inventories were down 1% with average selling store inventories down about 8%. Packaway was about 33% of total inventories compared to 34% at this time last year. For 2010, we continue to plan further reductions of in-store inventories with average levels targeted down in the mid to high single-digit percentage range compared to 2009. Our customers continue to respond favorably to the higher percentage of fresh and exciting merchandise, resulting from our faster inventory turns. Additionally, our ongoing focus on tight inventory management also helps to maximize merchandise gross margins.
Turning to our store expansion program. We remain on track with our 2010 opening program, adding 14 net new Ross and two dd's DISCOUNTS in the first quarter. We are also pleased to report that dd's DISCOUNTS' strong performance in 2009 continued in the first quarter. Our accelerated growth plans for this promising business remain on track with a total of 15 new locations planned for 2010.
Based on our first quarter results and outlook for the balance of the year, we continue to expect dd's DISCOUNTS to be slightly profitable in 2010 before allocations for corporate expense. Like Ross, dd's is benefiting from our ability to deliver a faster flow of fresh and exciting product to our stores by operating on lower inventory levels. The continued solid gains in sales and profitability at dd's also reflect that its value-focused merchandise offerings are resonating well with its customers, and we are very excited about our accelerated expansion plans for dd's in 2010 and beyond.
Now let's talk about our financial condition. We are pleased to report that both our balance sheet and cash flows remain healthy. We ended the quarter with $826 million of cash and short-term investments. Our cash position benefited from our much-better-than-expected earnings and reduced working capital needs as we operate the business on lower inventories. 
We also returned a significant amount of our excess cash to stockholders through our dividend and stock repurchase programs. Earlier this year, we raised our cash dividend by 45% and announced a new two-year $750 million stock repurchase program for 2010 and 2011. During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $94 million and remain on track to complete approximately $375 million of our current authorization by the end of 2010. 
Now John will provide some additional color on our first quarter results and details on our guidance for the second quarter."

As Michael noted, we saw healthy traffic to our stores during the first quarter.

As Michael noted, we saw healthy traffic to our stores during the first quarter. Our 10% comparable store sale gain was driven by high single-digit growth in a number of transactions, combined with a low single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. 
Again, operating margin improved by about 320 basis points in the quarter to 12.1%, driven by a 230 basis point increase in gross margin and a 90 basis point decline in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales. 
Merchandise margin increased about 130 basis points, including our shortage accrual that was about 25 basis points lower than the prior year. We also realized leverage on occupancy and distribution expenses of about 70 and 40 basis points, respectively. Partially offsetting these improvements was a 10 basis point increase in freight cost. 
The decline in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales was due to a combination of leverage on both store and corporate expenses from the robust 10% increase in same-store sales. Our buyback program drove a 3% reduction in diluted shares outstanding.
Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. As noted in today's press release, our previously issued guidance for the second quarter remains unchanged. While we are exceedingly pleased with our excellent start to the year, sales trends in the current macroeconomic and retail climate can be difficult to predict. In addition, on a two-year basis, we are anniversarying tougher comparisons in the second quarter when same-store sales rose 9% for 2008 and 2009 combined, after being up 6% for the first quarter. 
We believe that planning somewhat cautiously while hoping to do better is appropriate in this environment. This practice has enabled us to chase the business, resulting in faster inventory turns and better gross margin and expense leverage when we do outperform.
As a result, for the second quarter, we continue to forecast a comparable store sales gain of 3% to 4% and earnings per share of $0.95 to $0.99. This represents forecasted EPS growth of 16% to 21% on top of an outstanding 52% gain in the second quarter of 2009. These targets are based on the following assumptions: Total sales are expected to grow about 7% to 8%, driven by a combination of new store growth and, as mentioned, same-store sales that are up 3% to 4%. We are forecasting about 15 net new stores to open during the period, including 12 Ross Dress for Less and three dd's DISCOUNTS. We are planning comparable store sales gains of 2% to 3% for May and 3% to 4% for both June and July. Last year, same-store sales rose 4%, 1% and 4%, in May, June and July, respectively.
Operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be 10.2% to 10.4%, up from 9.7% last year. This represents a projected 50 to 70 basis point increase on top of a 260 basis point gain in the second quarter of 2009. Net interest expense is planned to be approximately $2.5 million, and our tax rate is expected to be about 39%. We also estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding of about 121 million. 
As noted in today's press release, fiscal 2010 EPS is projected to grow 16% to 20% to $4.11 to $4.24, up from $3.54 last year. This forecasted increase is especially noteworthy considering it is also on top of a robust 52% gain in EPS in 2009. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Michael."

We also know that our ability to give our customer the best values possible on a wide array of name-brand fashions for the family and the home is and always will be the key to our success. We remain committed to ensuring that we have access to as wide a supply of bargains as possible by making ongoing investments in our merchandise organization.

Also on our call are: Norman Ferber, Chairman of the Board; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bobbi Chaville, Senior Director, Investor Relations. We'll begin with a brief review of our second quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
Before we begin, I want to note that our comments on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results and other matters that are based on management's current forecast of aspects of the company's future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. These risk factors are detailed in today's press release and our fiscal 2009 Form 10-K, and 2010 Forms 10-Q and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.
Turning to our results. Today, we reported second quarter earnings per share of $1.07, up from $0.82 per share for the 2009 second quarter. These results represent a 30% increase on top of 52% growth in the prior year. Net earnings for the current year quarter grew 25% to a record $129.3 million, up from $103.4 million in the prior year period. Our 2010 second quarter sales increased 8% to $1,912,000,000, with comparable store sales up 4%, which was at the high end of our forecast.
For the six months ended July 31, 2010, earnings per share were $2.24, up from $1.55 in the first half of 2009. These results represent a 45% increase on top of a 37% gain in earnings per share during the first half of 2009. Net earnings for the first six months rose 39% to a record $271.6 million, up from $194.8 million last year. 
Sales for the first six months of 2010 increased 11% to $3,847,000,000 with comparable store sales up 7%. Unlike the many other retailers who reported negative same-store sales in the first half of 2009, our growth for both the second quarter and the first six months of 2010 was on top of a solid 3% gain for both periods last year.
We believe our results continue to benefit from the efficient execution of our off-price strategies, combined with our favorable position as a value retailer in this difficult macroeconomic and retail environment. Home, Dresses and Shoes were the top performing merchandise categories for both the second quarter and the first six months. Same-store sales for all three businesses were up in the high single to low double-digit percentage range during the quarter. 
Geographic trends were relatively broad-based. Florida was the strongest region for the quarter and year-to-date period, with high-single digit and low-double digit comparable store sales gains, respectively. 
California trailed a chain, with second quarter same-store sales that were flat on top of a 3% increase in the prior year. For the first six months, California comparable store sales were up 3% on top of a 3% gain in 2009. Clearly, the macroeconomic environment in California remains very difficult with among other issues, higher than average unemployment and ongoing weakness in housing. That said, we believe that the widespread recognition of the Ross brand in our most mature region, as well as our consistent focus on value, are enabling us to navigate through this climate better than most other retailers. 
Our average store sales volumes in the state are among the highest in the chain. More importantly, our successful inventory management and improved allocation through micro-merchandising have enabled us to show solid growth and average store profitability in California, for both the second quarter and the first six months of the year.
For our second quarter, we are pleased to report that the company's operating margin grew about 140 basis points to 11.1%, on top of a 260-basis-point improvement in the same period last year. These profitability gains were driven by a 110-basis-point increase in gross margin and a 30-basis-point decline in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales. 
Key drivers of our stronger profit margins for both the second quarter and year-to-date periods were higher merchandise gross margin, a timing shift in distribution expenses related to packaway level, lower shortage costs and leverage on other operating expenses. John will provide some additional details on operating margin trends in a few minutes.
As we entered the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were down 1% with average selling store inventories down about 9%. Packaway was about 37% of total inventories compared to 36% at this time last year. We continue to plan further reductions of in-store inventories for the back half of 2010, with average levels targeted down in the high-single digit percentage range compared to 2009. 
Our ongoing focus on tight inventory management allows us to maximize the percentage of fresh receipts the customer sees when she shops our stores, driving faster inventory turns and higher merchandise gross margin.
Turning to our store expansion program. We added a net 26 Ross and 5 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in the first half of the year and remain on track to open a total of about 35 Ross and 15 dd's locations in 2010. Sales growth rate trends at dd's DISCOUNTS also slowed in the second quarter, due in part to very difficult prior year comparisons. In addition, dd's has a large exposure to California, with about 2/3 of its stores in the state. That said, based on our first half results and outlook for the balance of the year, we continue to expect dd's DISCOUNTS to be slightly profitable in 2010 before allocations for corporate expense.
Now let's talk about our financial condition. We are pleased to report that both our balance sheet and cash flows remain healthy. We ended the quarter with $775 million of cash and short-term investments. Our cash position benefited from our better-than-expected earnings and reduced working capital needs as we operate the business on lower inventories. 
During the second quarter and first six months of 2010, we repurchased 1.8 million and 3.6 million shares of common stock, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $193 million year-to-date. We remain on track to complete during 2010, approximately $375 million of our current two-year $750 million stock repurchase program.
I'd like to turn now to our updated outlook for the second half of the year. As we noted in today's press release, predicting the future in today's uncertain macroeconomic and retail climate remains challenging. We also face extremely tough comparisons in the second half of the year, as same-store sales grew 9% and earnings per share rose 67% in the back half of 2009. As a result, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain a somewhat-cautious outlook concerning our sales and earnings targets for the second half of 2010's. 
Now John will provide some additional color on our second quarter results and details of our third and fourth quarter guidance."

Our 4% comparable store sales gain in the second quarter was driven by a combination of low-single digit increases in both the number of transactions and in the size of the average basket. Again, operating margin improved by about 140 basis points in the quarter to 11.1%, driven by a 110 basis point increase in gross margin and a 30 basis point decline in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales. Merchandise margin increased about 80 basis points, which includes our shortage accrual that was about 25 basis point lower than the prior year. 
Distribution expenses declined about 40 basis points. The second quarter benefited from certain distribution costs related to our packaway balances that are moving into the second half of 2010. We expect these expenses, which are equivalent to about $0.05 in earnings per share, to be incurred in the third and fourth quarters and be neutral for the full year. 
Occupancy expense benefited the quarter by about 20 basis points. These favorable comparisons were partially offset by a 20 basis point increase in freight cost and a 10 basis point increase in buying and incentive expenses. The decline in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales was mainly due to leverage on corporate expenses from the 4% increase in same-store sales. Our buyback program drove a 4% reduction in diluted shares outstanding and a slightly lower tax rate added about 1% net earnings growth in the quarter.
Turning now to our guidance for the second half of the year. Again, for the reasons Michael just mentioned, we believe it is prudent in this environment to stay somewhat cautious, as we plan our business for the third and fourth quarters. For the 13 weeks ending October 30, 2010, we forecast a comparable store sales gain of 1% to 2% on top of the very strong 8% growth in last year's third quarter. 
Earnings per share projected to be $0.79 to $0.83 compared to $0.84 in the prior year period when earnings per share almost doubled with a 91% increase. As a reminder, last year's third quarter included a $0.09 per share benefit from much better-than-expected shortage results. 
Our third quarter 2010 targets are based on the following assumptions: Sales are expected to grow about 5% to 6%, driven by a combination of new store growth, and as mentioned, same-store sales are up 1% to 2%; we are forecasting about 20 net-new stores to open during the period, including 10 Ross Dress for Less and ten dd's DISCOUNTS; we are planning comparable store sales to increase 3% to 4% for August, 1% to 2% for September and to be flat to up 1% for October. Last year, same-store sales drove 6%, 8%, 9%, in August, September and October, respectively. 
Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be 8.5% to 8.8%. This compares to 9.9% in the 2009 third quarter, which included an approximate 100 basis point benefit from last year's very favorable shortage results. 
As is our practice, our third quarter guidance does not assume any benefit to earnings that may occur if shortage is lower than our accrual. While we have put in place numerous shortage control initiatives over the past few years that have been successful in reducing shrink, we need to complete our annual physical inventory in September to determine our actual shortage for the current year. 
Net interest expense is planned to be approximately $2 million, and our tax rate is expected to be about 38%. We also estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding of about 119 million. 
For the fourth quarter ending January 29, 2011, same-store sales are projected to be flat to down 1% compared to an exceptional 10% increase in last year's fourth quarter. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter are forecast to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.20. This compares to $1.16 for the prior year, which was up 52% over the same period in 2008. 
Given our first half performance and projections for the third and fourth quarters, we are now estimating earnings per share for the fiscal year ending January 29, 2011, to be in the range of $4.18 to $4.27 compared to $3.54 for the 2009 fiscal year. This represents projected growth of 18% to 21%, on top of a 52% gain in fiscal 2009. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Michael."

Thank you for joining us today. Also on our call are: Norman Ferber, Chairman of the Board; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bobbi Chaville, Senior Director of Investor Relations. We'll begin with a brief review of our third quarter performance followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
Before we begin, I want to note that our comments on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results and other matters that are based on management's current forecast of aspects of the company's future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. These risk factors are detailed in today's press release and our fiscal 2009 Form 10-K, and 2010 Form 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC. 
Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $1.02, up from $0.84 per share for the 2009 third quarter. These results represent a 21% increase on top of exceptional growth in the prior year when earnings per share were up 91%. Net earnings for the current year quarter grew 16% to a record $121.4 million, up from $105.1 million last year. 
Our third quarter sales increased 7% to $1,874,000,000, with comparable store sales up a better than expected 3% on top of an 8% gain in the prior year. For the nine months ended October 30, 2010, earnings per share were $3.26, up from $2.39 for the same period in 2009. These results represent a 36% increase on top of a robust 52% gain in earnings per share during the first nine months of last year. Year-to-date through October 30, net earnings grew 31% to a record $393 million, up from $299.9 million last year.
Sales for the first nine months of 2010 increased 10% to $5,721,000,000, with comparable store sales up 6% versus a 5% gain for the same period in 2009. We delivered strong sales and earnings increases in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, on top of outstanding gains in the prior year. This is especially noteworthy considering the ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and retail environment.
Our third quarter performance was driven by our continued ability to deliver exciting bargains while operating our business on lower inventories, as well as much better than expected shortage results. Dresses and Home were the top performing merchandise categories for the third quarter, both with low double-digit same-store sales increases. 
Geographic trends were relatively broad based. Florida remained the strongest region with low double-digit comparable store sales gains for the third quarter and first nine months. We are pleased to report that sales trends in California improved during the quarter. Despite ongoing weakness in the housing market and high unemployment, same store sales in our largest state rose 2% in the third quarter, on top of an 8% increase in the prior year. Year-to-date, California is up 3% on top of a 5% gain last year.
For the third quarter and first nine months, profit margins rose to new record levels on top of exceptional gains in the prior year. Earnings before interest and taxes as a percent of sales grew to 10.5% in the quarter for a 60 basis point increase on top of a 385 basis point gain in the same period last year. 
Gross margin rose 80 basis points as higher merchandise gross margin, lower distribution cost and leverage on occupancy expenses were partially offset mainly by higher incentive and freight costs as a percent of sales versus the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 20 basis points, mainly due to higher incentive cost as a percent of sales. John will provide some additional details on these operating margin trends in a few minutes.
As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up about 3% with average selling store inventory down about 10%. Packaway was about 37% of total inventories compared to 32% at this time last year. We continue to plan further reductions of in-store inventories with average levels targeted down in the high single-digit percentage range in the fourth quarter compared to 2009. As we have mentioned on previous calls, our ongoing focus on tight inventory management allows us to maximize the percentage of fresh receipts the customers use while shopping our stores. It also drives faster inventory turns, fewer markdowns, and ultimately, higher merchandise gross margin.
Turning to our store expansion program. We added 12 Ross and 10 dd's DISCOUNTS stores in the most recent quarter, and ended the period with 1,057 combined locations in 27 states in Guam. 
dd's DISCOUNTS sales trends improved during the third quarter with positive comparable store sales increases on top of exceptionally strong prior year results. As I mentioned, we opened 10 dd stores in the period including entry into the Atlanta market. Year-to-date, we have added 15 locations and now operate 67 dd's DISCOUNTS stores in six states. 
Based on our year-to-date results and outlook for the fourth quarter, we continue to expect dd's DISCOUNTS to be slightly profitable in 2010 before allocations for corporate expense. Now let's talk about our financial condition.
Our balance sheet and cash flows remain healthy and we ended the quarter with $735 million of cash and short-term investments. Our cash position continues to benefit from better-than-expected earnings and reduced working capital needs as we operate the business on lower inventories. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, we repurchased 1.7 million and 5.4 million shares of our common stock, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $287 million year-to-date. We remain on track to complete, during 2010, approximately $375 million of our current two-year $750 million stock repurchase program.
I'd like to turn now to our updated outlook for the fourth quarter. As we noted in today's press release, we are solidly positioned as a value retailer, and our stores are stocked with fresh and exciting merchandise. That said, while we have outperformed our projections year-to-date, there are a number of reasons why we believe it is prudent to maintain a cautious outlook for the fourth quarter.
It still remains difficult to predict the future in today's uncertain macro economic and retail climate. We also see the likelihood of a very promotional and competitive holiday season this year, combined with the fact that we are up against our toughest prior year sales comparison as well as robust earnings growth. In last year's fourth quarter, same-store sales grew 10% and earnings per share rose 53%. In addition, the timing of Christmas Day means that we have one less Saturday of business in our largest volume month of the year. As a result, while we hope to do better, we are maintaining our prior forecast for both sales and earnings in the 2010 fourth quarter.
Now John will provide additional color on our third quarter results and details of our fourth quarter guidance."
33926,115381812,88669,"Ross Stores Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2010",2010-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Ross Stores, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michael.

Again, operating margin improved by about 60 ba",615,"Thank you, Michael. Our 3% comparable store sales gain in the third quarter was driven by a combination of low single-digit increases in both the number of transactions and in the size of the average basket. Again, operating margin improved by about 60 basis points in the quarter to 10.5%, driven by an 80 basis point increase in gross margin, partially offset by a 20 basis point rise in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales. 
Merchandise market increased about 85 basis points, mainly due to faster inventory turns that resulted in lower markdowns. As we noted with our September sales release, the shortage results from our annual physical inventory of stores were much better than expected and added about $0.10 in earnings per share to our third quarter 2010 results. 
Distribution costs declined about 50 basis points, while occupancy expense benefited the quarter by about 15 basis points. These favorable comparisons were partially offset mainly by 60 basis points in higher buying and incentive costs and a 10 basis point increase in freight expense. The 20 basis point increase in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales is mainly due to higher incentive expenses. Our buyback program drove a 5% reduction in diluted shares outstanding, and a slightly lower tax rate added about 2% to net earnings growth in the quarter.
Turning now to our guidance for the fourth quarter. Again, for the reasons Michael just mentioned, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent in this environment to stay somewhat cautious as we plan our business for the holiday season. For the 13 weeks ending January 29, 2011, we continue to forecast comparable store sales to be flat to down 1% on top of our very strong 10% growth in last year's fourth quarter. Earnings per share are projected to be $1.15 to $1.20, compared to $1.16 in the prior year period when earnings per share were up a robust 53%. Our fourth quarter 2010 targets are based on the following assumptions.
Total sales are planned to grow about 3% to 4%, driven by a combination of new store growth, and as mentioned, same-store sales that are flat-to-down 1%. Our guidance assumes that comparable store sales are up 2% to 3% in November, and down 1% to 2% in both December and January. 
Last year's same-store sales rose 8%, 12%, and 8% in November, December and January, respectively. Based on these sales assumptions, operating margins for the fourth quarter is projected to be 11% to 11.2%. This compares to 11.7% in the 2009 fourth quarter. As a percent of sales, we are planning flat to slightly better merchandise gross margin that is projected to be offset by somewhat higher freight costs. 
Due to timing issues on packaway inventories, distribution costs are forecast to increase as a percent of sales in the fourth quarter. Based on our assumptions of flat to down 1% same-store sales, we would also expect to see some deleveraging on occupancy and other selling, general and administrative costs. 
Net interest expense is planned to be approximately $2 million, and our tax rate is expected to be about 38%. We also estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding of about 118 million. Given our year-to-date performance and projections for the fourth quarter, we now are estimating earnings per share for the fiscal year ending January 29, 2011, to be in the range of $4.41 to $4.46 compared to $3.54 in the 2009 fiscal year. This represents robust projected growth of 25% to 26% on top of the outstanding 52% gain we delivered in fiscal 2009. Now I'll turn the call back to Michael."

To sum up, we are very pleased with our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance. In addition, even if fourth quarter earnings performed just in line with our guidance, we will be on track to report a record operating margin of 1",530,"Thank you, John. To sum up, we are very pleased with our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance. In addition, even if fourth quarter earnings performed just in line with our guidance, we will be on track to report a record operating margin of 11% or more for fiscal 2010. 
One of the most frequently asked questions we get now is if this current level of profitability is sustainable. We strongly believe that it is, due to a permanent structural change in our business model. Over the past three years, we have made substantial gains in operating margin, driven by the successful implementation of a number of strategic initiatives.
The biggest driver of our improved profitability has been record merchandise gross margin resulting from better buying and the significant reductions we have made in selling store inventories. Off-price buying is our most important business strategy, and we remain committed to making ongoing investments in our merchandise organization. By putting hundreds of Ross and dd's merchants in the market to source product from thousands of vendors, we are maximizing our access to the best bargains available. Going forward, we will continue to invest in this critical area of our business.
We have also been extremely successful over the last few years in operating our business on much lower inventories. Today, selling store inventories are more than 30% lower than they were just three years ago. This sizable reduction has resulted in a much larger percentage of fresh merchandise that the customers use while shopping our stores, which we believe had benefited sales. Lower inventories have also driven much faster inventory turns and a meaningful decline in markdown activity over this period. The implementation of our shortage control initiatives has also benefited margins by dramatically reducing shrink over the past few years to record low levels today.
Other sustainable drivers of operating margin include the numerous productivity enhancements and efficiencies we have implemented throughout the company to drive down cost, including our distribution centers, stores organization and back-office functions. As a result of all these structural changes, we believe that annual operating margin in a low double-digit percentage range is sustainable going forward. 
This gives us the confidence to continue to target, over the longer term, average annual earnings per share growth of 10% to 15%. The formula for achieving this is a combination of unit growth, annual increases in same-store sales and ongoing reduction in diluted shares outstanding from our stock repurchase program.
In closing, we believe that consumers increased focus on pricing value will continue for the foreseeable future, which bodes well for our business. We also know that our ability to give our customers the best bargain possible on a wide array of fashions for the family and the home will always be the most critical factor to our success. 
As a result, we will maintain an unwavering focus on what has worked so well for us over the past few years, solid execution of all our merchandising strategies, along with the continued focus on tight inventory and expense controls. At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."

Thank you for joining us today. Also on our call are Norman Ferber, Chairman of the Board; Michael O’Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bobbi Chaville, Senior Director of Investor Relations.
We’ll begin with a brief review of our third quarter performance followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we’ll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
Before we begin, I want to note that our comments on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results and other matters that are based on management’s current forecast of aspects of the company’s future business.
These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. These risk factors are detailed in today’s press release and our fiscal 2009 Form 10-K and 2010 Form 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.
Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $1.02, up from $0.84 per share for the 2009 third quarter. These results represent a 21% increase on top of exceptional growth in the prior year, when earnings per share were up 91%. Net earnings for the current year quarter grew 16% to a record $121.4 million, up from $105.1 million last year.
Our third quarter sales increased 7% to $1.874 billion, with comparable store sales up a better than expected 3% on top of an 8% gain in the prior year. For the nine months ended October 30, 2010, earnings per share were $3.26, up from $2.39 for the same period in 2009.
These results represent a 36% increase on top of a robust 52% gain in earnings per share during the first nine months of last year. Year-to-date through October 30, net earnings grew 31% to a record $393 million, up from $299.9 million last year.
Sales for the first nine months of 2010 increased 10% to $5.721 billion with comparable store sales up 6% versus a 5% gain for the same period in 2009. We delivered strong sales and earnings increases in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 on top of outstanding gains in the prior year. This is especially noteworthy considering the ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and retail environment.
Our third quarter performance was driven by our continued ability to deliver exciting bargains while operating our business on lower inventories as well as much better than expect shortage results.
Dresses and Home were the top performing merchandise categories for the third quarter, both with low double-digit same stores sales increases. Geographic trends were relatively broad-based.
Florida remained the strongest region with low double-digit comparable store sales gains for the third quarter and first nine months. We are pleased to report that sales trends in California improved during the quarter.
Despite ongoing weakness in the housing market and high unemployment, same-store sales in our largest state rose 2% in the third quarter on top of an 8% increase in the prior year. Year-to-date, California is up 3% on top of a 5% gain last year.
For the third quarter and first nine months, profit margins rose to new record levels on top of exceptional gains in the prior year. Earnings before interest and taxes as a percent of sales grew to 10.5% in the quarter for a 60 basis point increase on top of a 385 basis point gain in the same period last year.
Gross margin rose 80 basis points as higher merchandise gross margin, lower distribution costs and leverage on occupancy expenses were partially offset, mainly by higher intensive and freight cost as a percent of sales versus the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 20 basis points mainly due to higher incentive costs as a percent of sales. John will provide some additional details on these operating margin trends in a few minutes.
At the end of the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up about 3% with average selling store inventories down about 10%. Packaway was about 37% of total inventories compared to 32% at this time last year.
We continue to plan further reductions of in-store inventories with average levels targeted down in the high single-digit percentage range in the fourth quarter compared to 2009.
As we have mentioned on previous calls, our ongoing focus on tight inventory management allows us to maximize the percentage of fresh receipts the customer sees while shopping our stores. It also drives faster inventory turns, fewer markdowns and ultimately higher merchandise gross margins.
Turning to our store expansion program, we added 12 Ross and 10 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in the most recent quarter and ended the period with 1,057 combine locations in 27 states in Guam. Dd’s DISCOUNTS sales trends improved during the third quarter with positive comparable store sales increases on top of exceptionally strong prior year results.
As I mentioned we opened 10 dd’s stores in the period, including entry into the Atlanta market. Year-to-date we have added 15 locations and now operate 67 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in six states. Based on our year-to-date results and outlook for the fourth quarter, we continue to expect dd’s DISCOUNTS to be slightly profitable in 2010 before allocations for corporate expense.
Now let’s talk about our financial condition. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain healthy and we ended the quarter with $735 million of cash and short-term investments. Our cash position continues to benefit from better than expected earnings and reduced working capital needs, as we operate the business on lower inventories.
Turning to third quarter and first nine months of 2010, we repurchased 1.7 million and 5.4 million shares of our common stock respectively for an aggregate purchase price of $287 million year-to-date. We remain on track to complete during 2010 approximately $375 million of our current two year $750 million stock repurchase program.
I’d like to turn now to our updated outlook for the fourth quarter. As we noted in today’s press release, we are solidly positioned as a value retailer and our stores are stocked with fresh and exciting merchandise.
That said while we have outperformed our projections year-to-date, there are a number of seasons why we believe it is prudent to maintain a cautious outlook for the fourth quarter.
It still remains difficult to predict the future in today’s uncertain macroeconomic and retail climate. We also see the likelihood of a very promotional and competitive holiday season this year combined with the fact that we are up against our toughest prior year sales comparison as well as robust earnings growth.
In last year’s fourth quarter, same store sales grew 10% and earnings per share rose 53%. In addition the timing of the Christmas day means that we have one less Saturday of business in our largest volume month of the year. As a result, while we hope to do better, we are maintaining our prior forecast of both sales and earnings in 2010 fourth quarter.
Now, John will provide additional color on our third quarter results and details of our fourth quarter guidance.

On our 3% comparable store sales gain in the third quarter was driven by a combination of low single digit increases in both the number of transactions and in the size of the average baskets.
Again, operating margin improved by about 60 basis points in the quarter to 10.5% driven by an 80 basis point increase in gross margins, partially offset by a 20 basis point drive in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales. Merchandise margin increased about 85 basis points, mainly due to faster inventory turns that resulted in lower mark-up.
As we noted with our September sales release, the shortage results from our annual physical inventory of stores were much better-than-expected and added about $0.10 in earnings per share to our third quarter 2010 results.
Distribution comps declined about 50 basis points while occupancy expense benefited the quarter by about 15 basis points. These favorable comparisons were partially offset mainly by 50 basis points in higher buying and incentive comp and a 10 basis point increase in freight expense.
The 20 basis point increase in selling, general and administrative cost as a percent of sales was mainly due to higher incentive expenses. Our buyback program drove a 5% reduction in diluted shares outstanding and a slightly lower tax rate added about 2% to net earnings growth in the quarter.
Turning now to our guidance for the fourth quarter; again for the reasons Michael just mentioned, while we hope to do better we believe it is prudent in this environment to stay somewhat cautious as we plan our business for the holiday season.
For the 13-weeks ending January 29, 2011, we continue to forecast a comparable store sales to be flat to down 1% on top of our very strong 10% growth in last year’s fourth quarter.
Earnings per share are projected to be $1.15 to $1.20 compared to $1.16 in the prior year period when earnings per share were up, a robust 53%.
Our fourth quarter 2010 targets are based on the following assumptions. Total sales are planned to grow about 3% to 4%, driven by a combination of new store growth, and as mentioned, same store sales that are flat to down 1%. Our guidance assumes that comparables store sales are up 2% to 3% in November and down 1% to 2% in both December and January.
Last year, same-store sales rose 8%, 12% and 8% in November, December and January respectively. Based on these sales assumptions, operating margin for the fourth quarter is projected to be 11% to 11.2%, this compares to 11.7% in the 2009 fourth quarter.
As a percent of sales, we are planning flat to slightly better merchandise gross margin that is projected to be offset by somewhat higher freight costs. Due to timing issues on packaway inventory, distribution costs are forecast to increase as a percent of sales in the fourth quarter.
Based on our assumptions, a flat to down 1% same-store sales, we would also expect to see some deleveraging on occupancy and other selling, general and administrative cost.
Net interest expense is planned to be approximately $2 million and our tax rate is expected to be about 38%. We also estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding of about $118 million.
Given our year-to-date performance and projections for the fourth quarter, we now are estimating earnings per share for the fiscal year ending January 29, 2011 to be in the range of $4.41 to $4.46 compared to $3.54 in the 2009 fiscal year. This represents robust projected growth of 25% to 26% on top of the outstanding 52% gain we delivered in fiscal 2009.
Now, I’ll turn the call back to Michael.

To sum up, we are very pleased with our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance. In addition, even if fourth quarter earnings perform just in line with our guidance, we will be on track to report a record operating margin of 11%",529,"Thank you, John. To sum up, we are very pleased with our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance. In addition, even if fourth quarter earnings perform just in line with our guidance, we will be on track to report a record operating margin of 11% or more for fiscal 2010.
One of the most frequently asked questions we get now is, if this current level of profitability is sustainable. We strongly believe that it is due to a permanent structural change in our business model.
Over the past three years, we have made substantial gains in operating margin, driven by the successful implementation of a number of strategic initiatives. The biggest driver of our improved profitability has been record merchandise gross margin, resulting from better buying and a significant reductions we have made in selling store inventories.
Off-price buying is our most important business strategy and we remain committed to making ongoing investments in our merchandise organization. By putting hundreds of Ross and dd’s merchants in the market to source product from thousands of vendors, we are maximizing our access to the best bargains available. Going forward, we will continue to invest in this critical area of our business.
We have also been extremely successful over the last few years in operating our business on much lower inventories. Today, selling store inventories are more than 30% lower than they were just three years ago.
This sizable reduction has resulted in a much larger percentage of fresh merchandise that the customer sees while shopping our stores, which we believe had benefited sales. Lower inventories have also driven much faster inventory turns and a meaningful decline in markdown activity over this period.
Implementation of our shortage control initiatives has also benefited margins by dramatically reducing shrink over the past few years to record low levels today.
Other sustainable drivers of operating margin include the numerous productivity enhancement and efficiencies we have implemented throughout the company to drive down cost, including our distribution centers, stores organization and back office functions.
As a result of all these structural changes, we believe that annual operating margin in the low double-digit percentage range is sustainable going forward. This gives us the confidence to continue to target, over the longer-term, average annual earnings per share growth of 10% to 15%.
The formula for achieving it is a combination of unit growth, annual increases in same-store sales and ongoing reductions in diluted shares outstanding from our stock repurchase program.
In closing, we believe that consumers increased focus on price and value will continue for the foreseeable future which bodes well for our business. We also know that our ability to give our customers the best bargain possible on a wide array of fashions for the family and the home will always be the most critical factor to our success.
As a result, we will maintain an unwavering focus on what has worked so well for us over the past few years, solid execution of all our merchandising strategies along with a continued focus on tight inventory and expense controls.
At this point, we’d like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.

In the January timeframe we’ll take another look at that and make some announcements probably in early 2011 announcing further increases.
On your second question about store growth, I think we’ve announced previously that in 2011 we’ll probably have round about 6% to 7% unit growth for stores. And I would say about 1% to 2% of that would be in new markets, and hopefully that’s the product in terms of where we use cash, using cash to fuel growth.

These results represent a 21% increase on top of exceptional growth in the prior year when earnings per share were up 91%. Net earnings for the current year quarter grew 16% to a record $121.4 million, up from $105.1 million last year. 
Our third quarter sales increased 7% to $1,874,000,000, with comparable store sales up a better than expected 3% on top of an 8% gain in the prior year. For the nine months ended October 30, 2010, earnings per share were $3.26, up from $2.39 for the same period in 2009. These results represent a 36% increase on top of a robust 52% gain in earnings per share during the first nine months of last year. Year-to-date through October 30, net earnings grew 31% to a record $393 million, up from $299.9 million last year.
Sales for the first nine months of 2010 increased 10% to $5,721,000,000, with comparable store sales up 6% versus a 5% gain for the same period in 2009. We delivered strong sales and earnings increases in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, on top of outstanding gains in the prior year. This is especially noteworthy considering the ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and retail environment.
Our third quarter performance was driven by our continued ability to deliver exciting bargains while operating our business on lower inventories, as well as much better than expected shortage results. Dresses and Home were the top performing merchandise categories for the third quarter, both with low double-digit same-store sales increases. 
Geographic trends were relatively broad based. Florida remained the strongest region with low double-digit comparable store sales gains for the third quarter and first nine months. We are pleased to report that sales trends in California improved during the quarter. Despite ongoing weakness in the housing market and high unemployment, same store sales in our largest state rose 2% in the third quarter, on top of an 8% increase in the prior year. Year-to-date, California is up 3% on top of a 5% gain last year.
For the third quarter and first nine months, profit margins rose to new record levels on top of exceptional gains in the prior year. Earnings before interest and taxes as a percent of sales grew to 10.5% in the quarter for a 60 basis point increase on top of a 385 basis point gain in the same period last year. 
Gross margin rose 80 basis points as higher merchandise gross margin, lower distribution cost and leverage on occupancy expenses were partially offset mainly by higher incentive and freight costs as a percent of sales versus the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 20 basis points, mainly due to higher incentive cost as a percent of sales. John will provide some additional details on these operating margin trends in a few minutes.
As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up about 3% with average selling store inventory down about 10%. packaway was about 37% of total inventories compared to 32% at this time last year. We continue to plan further reductions of in-store inventories with average levels targeted down in the high single-digit percentage range in the fourth quarter compared to 2009. As we have mentioned on previous calls, our ongoing focus on tight inventory management allows us to maximize the percentage of fresh receipts the customers use while shopping our stores. It also drives faster inventory turns, fewer markdowns, and ultimately, higher merchandise gross margin.
Turning to our store expansion program. We added 12 Ross and 10 dd's DISCOUNTS stores in the most recent quarter, and ended the period with 1,057 combined locations in 27 states in Guam. 
dd's DISCOUNTS sales trends improved during the third quarter with positive comparable store sales increases on top of exceptionally strong prior year results. As I mentioned, we opened 10 dd stores in the period including entry into the Atlanta market. Year-to-date, we have added 15 locations and now operate 67 dd's DISCOUNTS stores in six states. 
Based on our year-to-date results and outlook for the fourth quarter, we continue to expect dd's DISCOUNTS to be slightly profitable in 2010 before allocations for corporate expense. Now let's talk about our financial condition.
Our balance sheet and cash flows remain healthy and we ended the quarter with $735 million of cash and short-term investments. Our cash position continues to benefit from better-than-expected earnings and reduced working capital needs as we operate the business on lower inventories. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, we repurchased 1.7 million and 5.4 million shares of our common stock, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $287 million year-to-date. We remain on track to complete, during 2010, approximately $375 million of our current two-year $750 million stock repurchase program.
I'd like to turn now to our updated outlook for the fourth quarter. As we noted in today's press release, we are solidly positioned as a value retailer, and our stores are stocked with fresh and exciting merchandise. That said, while we have outperformed our projections year-to-date, there are a number of reasons why we believe it is prudent to maintain a cautious outlook for the fourth quarter.
It still remains difficult to predict the future in today's uncertain macroeconomic and retail climate. We also see the likelihood of a very promotional and competitive holiday season this year, combined with the fact that we are up against our toughest prior year sales comparison as well as robust earnings growth. In last year's fourth quarter, same-store sales grew 10% and earnings per share rose 53%. In addition, the timing of Christmas Day means that we have one less Saturday of business in our largest volume month of the year. As a result, while we hope to do better, we are maintaining our prior forecast for both sales and earnings in the 2010 fourth quarter.
Now John will provide additional color on our third quarter results and details of our fourth quarter guidance."

Again, operating margin improved by about 60 ba",615,"Thank you, Michael. Our 3% comparable store sales gain in the third quarter was driven by a combination of low single-digit increases in both the number of transactions and in the size of the average basket. Again, operating margin improved by about 60 basis points in the quarter to 10.5%, driven by an 80 basis point increase in gross margin, partially offset by a 20 basis point rise in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales. 
Merchandise market increased about 85 basis points, mainly due to faster inventory turns that resulted in lower markdowns. As we noted with our September sales release, the shortage results from our annual physical inventory of stores were much better than expected and added about $0.10 in earnings per share to our third quarter 2010 results. 
Distribution costs declined about 50 basis points, while occupancy expense benefited the quarter by about 15 basis points. These favorable comparisons were partially offset mainly by 60 basis points in higher buying and incentive costs and a 10 basis point increase in freight expense. The 20 basis point increase in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales is mainly due to higher incentive expenses. Our buyback program drove a 5% reduction in diluted shares outstanding, and a slightly lower tax rate added about 2% to net earnings growth in the quarter.
Turning now to our guidance for the fourth quarter. Again, for the reasons Michael just mentioned, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent in this environment to stay somewhat cautious as we plan our business for the holiday season. For the 13 weeks ending January 29, 2011, we continue to forecast comparable store sales to be flat to down 1% on top of our very strong 10% growth in last year's fourth quarter. Earnings per share are projected to be $1.15 to $1.20, compared to $1.16 in the prior year period when earnings per share were up a robust 53%. Our fourth quarter 2010 targets are based on the following assumptions.
Total sales are planned to grow about 3% to 4%, driven by a combination of new store growth, and as mentioned, same-store sales that are flat-to-down 1%. Our guidance assumes that comparable store sales are up 2% to 3% in November, and down 1% to 2% in both December and January. 
Last year's same-store sales rose 8%, 12%, and 8% in November, December and January, respectively. Based on these sales assumptions, operating margins for the fourth quarter is projected to be 11% to 11.2%. This compares to 11.7% in the 2009 fourth quarter. As a percent of sales, we are planning flat to slightly better merchandise gross margin that is projected to be offset by somewhat higher freight costs. 
Due to timing issues on packaway inventories, distribution costs are forecast to increase as a percent of sales in the fourth quarter. Based on our assumptions of flat to down 1% same-store sales, we would also expect to see some deleveraging on occupancy and other selling, general and administrative costs. 
Net interest expense is planned to be approximately $2 million, and our tax rate is expected to be about 38%. We also estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding of about 118 million. Given our year-to-date performance and projections for the fourth quarter, we now are estimating earnings per share for the fiscal year ending January 29, 2011, to be in the range of $4.41 to $4.46 compared to $3.54 in the 2009 fiscal year. This represents robust projected growth of 25% to 26% on top of the outstanding 52% gain we delivered in fiscal 2009. Now I'll turn the call back to Michael."
33926,115381812,88725,"Ross Stores Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2010",2010-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Ross Stores, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. To sum up, we are very pleased with our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance. In addition, even if fourth quarter earnings performed just in line with our guidance, we will be on track to report a record operating margin of 1",531,"Thank you, John. To sum up, we are very pleased with our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance. In addition, even if fourth quarter earnings performed just in line with our guidance, we will be on track to report a record operating margin of 11% or more for fiscal 2010. 
One of the most frequently asked questions we get now is if this current level of profitability is sustainable. We strongly believe that it is, due to a permanent structural change in our business model. Over the past three years, we have made substantial gains in operating margin, driven by the successful implementation of a number of strategic initiatives.
The biggest driver of our improved profitability has been record merchandise gross margin resulting from better buying and the significant reductions we have made in selling store inventories. Off-price buying is our most important business strategy, and we remain committed to making ongoing investments in our merchandise organization. By putting hundreds of Ross and dd's merchants in the market to source product from thousands of vendors, we are maximizing our access to the best bargains available. Going forward, we will continue to invest in this critical area of our business.
We have also been extremely successful over the last few years in operating our business on much lower inventories. Today, selling store inventories are more than 30% lower than they were just three years ago. This sizable reduction has resulted in a much larger percentage of fresh merchandise that the customer sees while shopping our stores, which we believe had benefited sales. Lower inventories have also driven much faster inventory turns and a meaningful decline in markdown activity over this period. The implementation of our shortage control initiatives has also benefited margins by dramatically reducing shrink over the past few years to record low levels today.
Other sustainable drivers of operating margin include the numerous productivity enhancements and efficiencies we have implemented throughout the company to drive down cost, including our distribution centers, stores organization and back-office functions. As a result of all these structural changes, we believe that annual operating margin in a low double-digit percentage range is sustainable going forward. 
This gives us the confidence to continue to target, over the longer term, average annual earnings per share growth of 10% to 15%. The formula for achieving this is a combination of unit growth, annual increases in same-store sales and ongoing reduction in diluted shares outstanding from our stock repurchase program.
In closing, we believe that consumers increased focus on price and value will continue for the foreseeable future, which bodes well for our business. We also know that our ability to give our customers the best bargain possible on a wide array of fashions for the family and the home will always be the most critical factor to our success. 
As a result, we will maintain an unwavering focus on what has worked so well for us over the past few years, solid execution of all our merchandising strategies, along with the continued focus on tight inventory and expense controls. At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."
