Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our call. We appreciate your interest in Qwest. I'm enjoyed by Ed Mueller, our Chairman and CEO; Teresa Taylor, our COO and Joe Euteneuer, our CFO. We'll begin today's call with a few comments on the quarter from Ed and then Teresa will provide a review of business unit results. Joe will conclude our prepared remarks with a discussion of our consolidated financial results and the 2010 outlook. We will then open it up for your questions.As we begin our call, let me point you to Slide 3 and remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail on our periodic filings with the SEC, and I strongly encourage you to thoroughly review them. Additionally, we do not adopt analyst estimates nor that we necessarily commit to updating forward-looking statements that we're going to be making this morning. Also, let me mention that in order to supplement the reporting of our consolidated financial information, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow and net debt. A full reconciliation of these majors is available on our website.Moving on to Slide 4. Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.06 compared to $0.10 in the fourth quarter of 2008. Current quarter earnings include a $0.02 charge for severance costs. The year-ago period includes a $0.01 charge four severance. Full-year reported earnings per share for 2009 was $0.38, and that compares to $0.37 for 2008. One-time charges for severance and litigation in 2009  netted to zero. The prior year includes net charges of $0.03 per share from a combination of severance realignment, litigation and property tax elements. In addition to these adjustments, 2009  reported earnings have been impacted by dilution from incremental non-cash pension and OPEB expense. In the current quarter, this dilution was $0.06 per share and the full-year impact is $0.07. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Ed. Ed?"

I want to begin by saying we're very pleased with our financial performance for both the quarter and for the full year. Under challenging economic conditions and competitive pressures, we delivered strong cash flows, improved margins and we made great progress on several key initiatives to drive long-term shareholder value. Throughout the course of 2009, we delivered solid growth in our strategic revenues, and we are pleased with the increasing margins for these services. Our Business Market group had very good relative performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2009. As far as our overall revenues, we would have liked to have reported better growth. However, I would point out that in addition to a tough economy, our reported revenues were also impacted by our initiatives to improve profitability. These include our move to a new wireless business model, which accounted 30% of our revenue decline and the elimination of poor margin wholesale long-distance revenue. While these initiatives will continue to impact our reported comparisons for the next couple of quarters, we should have easier comps in the second half of the year. Our efforts to improve margins was another area where we had strong success in 2009. For the full-year, our adjusted EBITDA margin was at its best level since the merger with U.S. West in 2000. Adjusted free cash flow generated for the year was also at its highest level since the merger. Our performance continues to demonstrate that our initiatives are working, and we are carrying this momentum into 2010. In the fourth quarter, we improved our revenue mix and continue to transition away from a legacy revenue base. This transition is supported by our state-of-the-art nationwide network. This is a tremendous asset that delivers best-in-class services to businesses and government agencies throughout the country and supports all of our fiber deployment strategies. Much of our margin improvement in 2009 was from these services, and we remain focused on leveraging growth from this asset. Over the course of the year, we continued to make progress in enhancing our market position by delivering on simplified integrated solutions, improving partnerships and expanding broadband capabilities. Mid-year, we announced a five-year extension to our strategic partnership with DIRECTV. In addition, we jointly launched a new suite of integrated services to maximize the combination of DIRECTV and Qwest high-speed Internet. We've also made progress on our wireless partnership and in the fourth quarter, we concluded a very successful transition to the Verizon Wireless Reseller model. Finally, we continue to deploy Fiber-to-the-Node reaching more than 3.5 million homes at year and serving 420,000 subscribers. Our broadband initiatives remain a top priority as we look to 2010. We have had some early success in marketing our Fiber-to-the-Cell Site products, and we expect to build on this momentum in 2010. To drive transport efficiencies, we announced plans to upgrade our backbone capacities to 100 gigabit speed, and we will continue to deploy Fiber-to-the-Node across our residential footprint. In 2009, we strengthened our balance sheet. Despite a tough Capital Markets environment, especially early in the year, we were able to access the credit market at favorable rates. We also announced the new four-year revolving credit facility. Collectively, these actions has significantly improved our maturity profile and enhanced our financial ability. Finally, we remain committed to our balanced approach to investment returns. For all of 2009, our direct shareholder returns in the form of cash dividends were $550 million. In addition, we reduced net debt by $1.2 billion during the year. To some up, I thank we had a solid year at nearly a every level of the company. The Qwest team's ability to deliver these results in tough markets has really been quite remarkable throughout 2009. In 2010, you will continue to see the results of our efforts to improve efficiency and productivity, and we will remain dedicated focused on the top line. Now I'll hand it up to Teresa who will discuss our business unit performance."

In the fourth quarter, we maintained solid operating performance. Overall, we continued to see strong demand for broadband strategic products, which grew 4% for the quarter and 6% for the full year. This was driven by 37% full year growth in enterprise IP services, and higher take rates for fiber-based consumer broadband services. We also remain disciplined in our expense control. This focus produced margin gains across all three segments, a significant accomplishment in light of challenging market conditions.In 2009, we demonstrate that we can adjust to the market and manage the bottom line. In the coming year, our goal are to improve our revenue trajectory while retaining a bottom-line discipline. As we turn to 2010, we see encouraging signs in each of our segments.Let's start with the Business Markets segment on Slide 8. Results reflect our continued success in growing our strategic revenue and expanding our margins. Business Markets reported total revenues of $1 billion in the fourth quarter. In the quarter, Business Markets revenue performance outpaced major competitors although revenue decreased 2% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and declined 1% sequentially. As we have previously noted, a key metric we monitor is recurring service revenue. In the fourth quarter, recurring revenues were down 1% year-over-year and reflect with the third quarter. For the full year, recurring revenues were modestly ahead of 2008.Strategic revenues within Business Markets increased 7%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This is driven by strong demand for our MPLS IP services, which increased 26%. In the quarter, strategic revenues were 40% of total business revenue, an increase from 36% a year ago.In the fourth quarter, legacy revenues declined 8% compared to a year ago due to lower vocal voice revenues and legacy LAN data services. As customers continue to migrate to next-generation services. This was partially offset by growth in demand for call center applications and we are deep in the transition of the customers from legacy data transport services such as ATM and frame relay.Revenues from those services we're under 6% of total Business Market revenue in the fourth quarter compared to 8% a year ago. The decline in data integration revenue in the quarter reflects lower equipment sales, partially offset growth in demand for professional services. In the fourth quarter, Business Market segment income of $405 million improved 3% year-over-year but declined 1% sequentially. Segment income for the full year improved 7%, primarily due to channel efficiencies and lower network and facility spend.For 2010, our plans four Business Market is to build up success for the past year. We have a diverse customer portfolio we offer unique support and have a strong mix of managed and next-generation data IP services. The key strengths provide a strong foundation four us to grow our enterprise top line as the economy improves in coming quarters.Results for our wholesale segment are summarized on Slide 9. Wholesale results reflect an improved strategic product mix and continued progress on improving profitability. Revenue for the quarter told at $679 million. This is an annual decline of 14% and a sequential decline of 3%. In the quarter, strategic revenues were stable and increased to 45% of total wholesale revenue from 39% a year ago. Legacy revenue decreased 22% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. The annual decline was in part due to proactively managing long-distance profitability. The sequential decline was mainly due to ongoing local voice and access revenue pressure. In the quarter, long-distance revenue, which was a little under 20% of total Wholesale segment revenues, declined by more than 30% from the quarter of 2008. Even with the significant decrease, the profit contribution from long-distance was relatively flat with the year ago.Segment income for the quarter was $447 million, an 8% decline from a year ago and a 3% sequential decline. Segment margin was 65.8%, a 410 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2008. Margins improved to 660 basis points for the full year. In 2010, we expect Wholesale long-distance revenue comparisons will improve beginning in the second quarter. Our Wholesale group continues to seize the opportunity to leverage our broadband fiber investments, and capitalize on growing demand for wireless backhaul services. We currently have contracts to provide fiber-based access to nearly 2,000 wireless cell sites. These contracts provide an avenue for strategic revenue growth, while protecting existing copper backhaul services. We will begin to recognize revenues in 2010. However, the full-year impact will be minor. Over the next couple of years, this could add 1% to 2% to our annual consolidated revenue.Now we'll turn to Mass Markets results on Slide 10. As Ed mentioned, we completed the migration to are new wireless reseller business model during the quarter. Excluding the impact of this transition, Mass Markets revenue for the quarter declined 7% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Strategic revenues improved 3% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. In the quarter, strategic revenue was 30% of total Mass Markets revenue compared to 25% a year ago. In the fourth quarter, legacy revenue declined due to lower demand for traditional local voice services. Segment income of $685 million declined 7% compared to fourth quarter of 2008. On a sequential basis, expense reductions outpaced revenue decline, and this drove a 2% improvement in segment income and a 220 basis point improvement in margin. For the full year, segment income was down 3% as a result of continued top line pressure. It was offset by substantial expense reductions. For the full year, margins improved 550 basis points. Our quarterly subscriber results are contained on Slide 11. We made solid progress on retention efforts during the quarter. In fact, the absolute number of consumer access line losses is at the lowest level in two years. We also continue to grow the revenues from customers we retain. Consumer ARPU improved during the quarter to $60, up 6% compared to fourth quarter of 2008. Next, broadband subscriber additions were 23,000 for the quarter, and we ended the year with nearly 3 million subscribers. Our fiber investments continue to pay dividends. In the quarter, we added 80,000 new subscribers on fiber. We ended the period with 420,000 broadband fiber subscribers, or about 14% of our total high-speed Internet customers.On average, FTTN customers generate a 15% less in ARPU compared to DSL customers. And therefore, we believe migrations, alone, provide a great growth opportunity. In addition, about 35% of households in our territory, or about 4 million homes, do not have any high-speed Internet service today. This also represents an opportunity for us.We achieved solid performance in bundled services in the quarter, and we enhanced subscriber retention through our video and wireless service offering. In the quarter, we added 23,000 DIRECTV subscribers. These additions were partially offset by the elimination of 5,000 Qwest legacy video customer.  In efforts to wind down the Qwest-branded video in Arizona and Colorado are now complete. In the fourth quarter, we had success in acquiring new Verizon Wireless customers and moving existing subscribers to a single bill offered by Qwest. In total, we increased the number of Qwest-billed Verizon users by 64,000 in the quarter, and ended the year with 850,000 total customers.In 2010, our Mass Markets group is focused on acquiring and retaining customers by providing a differentiated customer experience. As a result of our initiatives, we are seeing early signs of success. For example, our new on-boarding process for consumer broadband users has increased install rates and improved take rates on value-added services. Additionally, we have implemented a new regional operating structure. This creates new customer touch points, while enhancing our ability to drive market-based solutions. Before I close, I want to touch on our ongoing effort to match our work-force to work-load, which is depicted on Slide 12. Our total employee count declined by more than 1,200 in the fourth quarter, and by 2,800 or 8% for the full year. The vast majority of fourth quarter reductions occurred in the latter stages of the quarter. And while these were difficult decisions, I am confident that we will continue to provide a superior customer experience. In closing, I am pleased with our execution for the quarter and full year. In one of the most difficult economic times, we remained disciplined and actively managed resources to reflect market conditions. We successfully grew strategic revenue and associated margins, while driving expenses out of the legacy business. In 2010, we will continue to focus on growth through disciplined investment. I look forward to meeting many of you and providing more details on our progress and future plans at our upcoming investment community meeting. Now I will turn it over to Joe."

I am pleased to report that this was another quarter of consistent performance, and we finished with strong results for the year. We delivered solid EBITDA, improved margins and generated strong free cash flow, despite unprecedented market conditions. We successfully access the capital markets during the year and in doing so, we eliminated refinancing risks for the foreseeable future while improving our financial flexibility. We continue to provide a balanced mix of returns for our shareholders, including paying out $550 million in dividends, reducing net debt levels by $1.2 billion and investing $1.5 billion of capital back into the business. This investment will fund future growth and return for our shareholders. Now I'd like to turn to the income statement on Slide 14. In the fourth quarter, consolidated net operating revenues of $3 billion declined 10% compared to the prior year. Without the impacts of the wireless transition, revenues declined only 7%. Teresa provided you some sense of the efforts on our reported top line, associated with our efforts to improve Wholesale long-distance margins. For the full year, revenue declined 9% or 6% after adjusting for the wireless MVNO transition. Consolidated strategic services revenue improved 4% in the quarter and 6% for the full year. We continue to improve our revenue mix by shifting to fiber-based initiatives and IP-based data solutions. In the quarter, strategic revenue accounted for 36% of total revenue versus 31% a year ago. Total operating expenses improved 1% sequentially, and 8% year-over-year. For the full year, total expenses improved 9%. The improved operating cost in the quarter and for the full year are driven by our continued efforts to increase operating efficiency through innovative process improvement, increased productivity and lower unit cost for purchase goods and services.Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $1.09 billion compared with $1.18 billion a year ago. The adjusted EBITDA margin improved 60 basis points for the same period. The current quarter includes 44 million of incremental non-cash pension and OPEB expense compared to prior year's quarter. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 billion on a margin of 35.9%. Excluding the impact of incremental non-cash pension and OPEB expense of $210 million, the margin improved 390 basis points for the year. On this same basis, we would have reported 2% growth in full year adjusted EBITDA. The improved profitability was mainly due to the transition to a new wireless business model and improved revenue mix in Wholesale and substantial reductions in direct channel expense and overhead cost.Moving on to Slide 15. We continue to strengthen the balance sheet in the fourth quarter and improve our financial flexibility. As a result of our strong free cash flows, we ended the year with net debt of $11.8 billion compared to $13 billion at the end of 2008. Cash and cash equivalents increased to $2.4 billion from $565 million a year ago. Net debt to annualize adjusted EBITDA was 2.7x at year end, a significant improvement from the year-ago period. During the quarter, we completed a new four-year revolving credit facility which was upsized to $1.04 billion and it currently remains undrawn. In January of 2010, we issued $800 million of notes with a coupon of 7.125%. While our success in the capital markets has substantially removed refinancing risks, we are all also taking efforts to put these resources to productive use, calling $525 million of notes that were scheduled to mature in February 2011.Finally, we may decide to call our $1.27 billion convertible debt later this year. These actions, along with our planned redemptions over the next 12 months, would reduce total debt by nearly $3.5 billion. This will further improve our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Details on adjusted free cash flow and capital expenditures are shown on Slide 16. In the quarter, we continued to maintain a strong management of receivables and payables. Both DSOs and DPOs improved year-over-year. Our collection staff has done an outstanding job all year for us. Bad debt expense was 0.6% of revenue in the quarter, and 1.1% for the full year. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $506 million and it was $1.9 billion for the full year. Strong EBITDA, lower capital expenditures and working capital contributions drove these results. Capital expenditures were $386 million in the quarter. Capital spending for the full year totaled $1.4 billion, plus we leased capital of a little over $100 million. This compares to capital spending of $1.8 billion in 2008. The principal reasons for our lower capital expenditures are lower customer demand, moderation of network traffic growth and lower requirements associated with the slowdown in new housing construction. We also benefited from our efforts within our purchasing, engineering and operations group, which have produced vendor savings, improved inventory levels and lowered our capital unit cost.Now I'd like to close my remarks with a discussion on guidance, on Slide 17. In 2009, we focused our efforts in the guidance we provided on EBITDA and free cash flow. We realized we cannot simply cut cost to achieve long-term prosperity. In addition, the markets are starting to stabilize and therefore, we feel the time is appropriate to provide some guidance commentary on our efforts to improve the top line. For the near term, we continue to see a stable outlook for Business Markets, with revenue continuing to beat industry averages. In Wholesale, we are likely to continue to report significant year-over-year declines, but as Teresa noted, the Wholesale long-distance comparisons should start to improve beginning in the second quarter. Mass Markets revenue in the short run will continue to follow access line trends, partially offset by increased ARPU from bundled services and growth in high-speed Internet subscribers. In looking at overall consolidated revenues, we expect that our year-over-year comparisons will improve over the course of the year.As a reminder, there was a little over $100 million of wireless MVNO revenues that we reported in the first three quarters of 2009 that won't be repeated in 2010. Our goal is to reduce our year-over-year revenue declines to a low to mid-single digit rate by the fourth quarter of this year. We will continue to be keenly focused on efficiently managing our business to maintain or improve margins. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion. We are expecting non-cash pension and OPEB expense to be approximately $130 million in 2010, which would be a $70 million improvement from 2009. The outlook for capital investment is $1.7 billion or less. We may use lease financing in 2010 for some portion of this capital spending. Our capital spending program will perfect our opportunity in  Fiber-to-the-Cell, while we continued to invest in Fiber-to-the-Node on an integrated basis. The combination of continued solid cash flows from operating activities and strong investment in the business is expected to produce adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion for the full year 2010. We do not expect to make any funding contributions to the pension plan in 2010. In 2011, we believe our pension funding requirements could be in the range of zero to $120 million, but the information necessary to finalize our contribution calculations will not be available until later in 2010. On the subject of cash taxes, our available NOLs continue to limit federal cash tax payments to the alternative minimum tax, which is approximately 2%. We currently expect this will be the case for approximately the next five years. It is our current expectation that we will continue to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share in 2010. For now, we are deferring on any additional comments on our free cash flow allocations beyond these dividends and paying off unregulated debt maturities. We will continue to assess the best use of future excess cash flows, including reinvestments back into the business, stock buybacks, dividend increases and additional deleveraging actions. In closing, I'd like to reiterate how pleased I am with 2009 results. The Qwest team has consistently demonstrated its ability to drive productivity and efficiency to improve EBITDA and free cash flow despite a challenging environment. This success has been achieved against a backdrop of high unemployment rates, competition from wireless, more aggressive promotions from cable service providers and continued business weakness with low levels of investment. We are looking forward to applying our considerable capabilities under better market conditions in the month ahead. Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, Ed, Teresa and I along with the management team would like to congratulate the workforce for a job well done in 2009, and thank them for all their hard work. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and open up the line for questions."

That was not just driven by the Wireless piece. BMG and Wholesale, as I commented earlier, we expect BMG to continue to pace along as it had. And actually assuming a bit of an uptick there as the economy improves. We are seeing signs of customer starting to move, even though they didn't make many decisions last year. I think now they're in a position where they have to expend their data network, and they have to expand their broadband efforts. And we plan on being there, where I think we've been very good at focusing on the products that we're good at in the space that we're good as far as the segmentation. On the Wholesale side, any growth that comes, they will be from Fiber-to-the-Cell. We are very excited that we're already at 2,000 cell sites that are under contract. And there's many more behind that. That's a very big number for us. And we know we can deliver. We're very good at fiber buildouts, and this is our spot. It also allows us to retain the copper backhaul that we offer today, to those wireless providers. For long-distance revenue and Wholesale, I think we'll continue to stabilize. We've been through the rough part where we create the margins largest that we want and now, we'll keep that stable."

All of our work we've done before, we will jump in there if we can make an adequate return and meet our hurdle rates. So I'd say we're cautiously optimistic about being able to participate. But there's still I think a lot of confusion, there's also not a clear strategy of what broadband would look like in the long toll, and what really is unserved or underserved, but more to come there. So we would all be upside for us, no downside. Secondly, on the IPTV front, as you know, that's the reason we built this architecture, was to take advantage of the continued movement of what I call ala carte video. We're still very bullish on that. We worked with people right now, it would be primarily an enablement. We would enable others. We closed down our video product, our retail video product in our two regions, which has been good for us. We would had to have a large capital spend to even upgrade it. And I really believe that this will continue, the momentum's hot and heavy. But I also think the other part of this that will make a huge difference is that we are seeing content people that are not traditional content people. And so I think that's also encouraging, and we've had contact with people in Silicon Valley, primarily California who have a little different model how to monetize this.

Joe will conclude our prepared remarks with a discussion of our consolidated financial results and the 2010 outlook. We will then open it up for your questions.As we begin our call, let me point you to Slide 3 and remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail on our periodic filings with the SEC, and I strongly encourage you to thoroughly review them. Additionally, we do not adopt analyst estimates nor that we necessarily commit to updating forward-looking statements that we're going to be making this morning. Also, let me mention that in order to supplement the reporting of our consolidated financial information, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow and net debt. A full reconciliation of these majors is available on our website.Moving on to Slide 4. Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.06 compared to $0.10 in the fourth quarter of 2008. Current quarter earnings include a $0.02 charge for severance costs. The year-ago period includes a $0.01 charge for severance. Full year reported earnings per share for 2009 was $0.38, and that compares to $0.37 for 2008. One-time charges for severance and litigation in 2009 netted to zero. The prior year includes net charges of $0.03 per share from a combination of severance, realignment litigation and property tax settlements. In addition to these adjustments, 2009 reported earnings have been impacted by dilution from incremental non-cash pension and OPEB expense. In the current quarter, this dilution was $0.02 per share and the full year impact is $0.07. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Ed. Ed?"

I want to begin by saying we're very pleased with our financial performance for both the quarter and for the full year. Under challenging economic conditions and competitive pressures, we delivered strong cash flows, improved margins and we made great progress on several key initiatives to drive long-term shareholder value. Throughout the course of 2009, we delivered solid growth in our strategic revenues, and we are pleased with the increasing margins for these services. Our Business Markets Group had very good relative performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2009. As far as our overall revenues, we would have liked to have reported better growth. However, I would point out that in addition to a tough economy, our reported revenues were also impacted by our initiatives to improve profitability. These include our move to a new wireless business model, which accounted 30% of our revenue decline and the elimination of poor margin wholesale long-distance revenue. While these initiatives will continue to impact our reported comparisons for the next couple of quarters, we should have easier comps in the second half of the year. Our efforts to improve margins was another area where we had strong success in 2009. For the full year, our adjusted EBITDA margin was at its best level since the merger with U.S. West in 2000. Adjusted free cash flow generated for the year was also at its highest level since the merger. Our performance continues to demonstrate that our initiatives are working, and we are carrying this momentum into 2010. In the fourth quarter, we improved our revenue mix and continue to transition away from a legacy revenue base. This transition is supported by our state-of-the-art nationwide network. This is a tremendous asset that delivers best-in-class services to businesses and government agencies throughout the country and supports all of our fiber deployment strategies. Much of our margin improvement in 2009 was from these services, and we remain focused on leveraging growth from this asset. Over the course of the year, we continued to make progress in enhancing our market position by delivering on simplified integrated solutions, improving partnerships and expanding broadband capabilities. Mid-year, we announced a five-year extension to our strategic partnership with DIRECTV. In addition, we jointly launched a new suite of integrated services to maximize the combination of DIRECTV and Qwest high-speed Internet. We've also made progress on our wireless partnership and in the fourth quarter, we concluded a very successful transition to the Verizon Wireless reseller model. Finally, we continue to deploy Fiber-to-the-Node reaching more than 3.5 million homes at year and serving 420,000 subscribers. Our broadband initiatives remain a top priority as we look to 2010. We have had some early success in marketing our Fiber-to-the-Cell Site products, and we expect to build on this momentum in 2010. To drive transport efficiencies, we announced plans to upgrade our backbone capacities to 100 gigabit speed, and we will continue to deploy Fiber-to-the-Node across our residential footprint. In 2009, we strengthened our balance sheet. Despite a tough capital markets environment, especially early in the year, we were able to access the credit markets at favorable rates. We also announced the new four-year revolving credit facility. Collectively, these actions has significantly improved our maturity profile and enhanced our financial flexibility. Finally, we remain committed to our balanced approach to investment returns. For all of 2009, our direct shareholder returns in the form of cash dividends were $550 million. In addition, we reduced net debt by $1.2 billion during the year. To some up, I think we had a solid year at nearly every level of the company. The Qwest team's ability to deliver these results in tough markets has really been quite remarkable throughout 2009. In 2010, you will continue to see the results of our efforts to improve efficiency and productivity, and we will remain dedicated focused on the top line. Now I'll hand it off to Teresa who will discuss our business unit performance."

In the fourth quarter, we maintained solid operating performance. Overall, we continued to see strong demand for broadband strategic products, which grew 4% for the quarter and 6% for the full year. This was driven by 37% full year growth in enterprise IP services and higher take rates for fiber-based consumer broadband services. We also remain disciplined in our expense control. This focus produced margin gains across all three segments, a significant accomplishment in light of challenging market conditions.In 2009, we demonstrate that we can adjust to the market and manage the bottom line. In the coming year, our goals are to improve our revenue trajectory while retaining a bottom-line discipline. As we turn to 2010, we see encouraging signs in each of our segments.Let's start with the Business Markets segment on Slide 8. Results reflect our continued success in growing our strategic revenues and expanding our margins. Business Markets reported total revenues of $1 billion in the fourth quarter. In the quarter, Business Markets revenue performance outpaced major competitors although revenue decreased 2% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and declined 1% sequentially. As we have previously noted, a key metric we monitor is recurring service revenue. In the fourth quarter, recurring revenues were down 1% year-over-year and were flat with the third quarter. For the full year, recurring revenues were modestly ahead of 2008.Strategic revenues within Business Markets increased 7%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This is driven by strong demand for our MPLS IP services, which increased 26%. In the quarter, strategic revenues were 40% of total business revenue, an increase from 36% a year ago.In the fourth quarter, legacy revenues declined 8% compared to a year ago due to lower vocal voice revenues and legacy LAN data services. As customers continue to migrate to next-generation services. This was partially offset by growth in demand for call center applications and we are deep in the transition of the customers from legacy data transport services such as ATM and frame relay.Revenues from those services we're under 6% of total Business Market revenue in the fourth quarter compared to 8% a year ago. The decline in data integration revenue in the quarter reflects lower equipment sales, partially offset growth in demand for professional services. In the fourth quarter, Business Market segment income of $405 million improved 3% year-over-year but declined 1% sequentially. Segment income for the full year improved 7%, primarily due to channel efficiencies and lower network and facility spend.For 2010, our plans four Business Market is to build up success for the past year. We have a diverse customer portfolio we offer unique support and have a strong mix of managed and next-generation data IP services. The key strengths provide a strong foundation four us to grow our enterprise top line as the economy improves in coming quarters.Results for our wholesale segment are summarized on Slide 9. Wholesale results reflect an improved strategic product mix and continued progress on improving profitability. Revenue for the quarter told at $679 million. This is an annual decline of 14% and a sequential decline of 3%. In the quarter, strategic revenues were stable and increased to 45% of total wholesale revenue from 39% a year ago. Legacy revenue decreased 22% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. The annual decline was in part due to proactively managing long-distance profitability. The sequential decline was mainly due to ongoing local voice and access revenue pressure. In the quarter, long-distance revenue, which was a little under 20% of total Wholesale segment revenues, declined by more than 30% from the quarter of 2008. Even with the significant decrease, the profit contribution from long-distance was relatively flat with the year ago.Segment income for the quarter was $447 million, an 8% decline from a year ago and a 3% sequential decline. Segment margin was 65.8%, a 410 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2008. Margins improved to 660 basis points for the full year. In 2010, we expect Wholesale long-distance revenue comparisons will improve beginning in the second quarter. Our Wholesale group continues to seize the opportunity to leverage our broadband fiber investments, and capitalize on growing demand for wireless backhaul services. We currently have contracts to provide fiber-based access to nearly 2,000 wireless cell sites. These contracts provide an avenue for strategic revenue growth, while protecting existing copper backhaul services. We will begin to recognize revenues in 2010. However, the full year impact will be minor. Over the next couple of years, this could add 1% to 2% to our annual consolidated revenue.Now we'll turn to Mass Markets results on Slide 10. As Ed mentioned, we completed the migration to our new wireless reseller business model during the quarter. Excluding the impact of this transition, Mass Markets revenue for the quarter declined 7% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Strategic revenues improved 3% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. In the quarter, strategic revenue was 30% of total Mass Markets revenue compared to 25% a year ago. In the fourth quarter, legacy revenue declined due to lower demand for traditional local voice services. Segment income of $685 million declined 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. On a sequential basis, expense reductions outpaced revenue declines, and this drove a 2% improvement in segment income and a 220 basis point improvement in margin. For the full year, segment income was down 3% as a result of continued top line pressure. It was offset by substantial expense reductions. And for the full year, margins improved to 550 basis points. Our quarterly subscriber results are contained on Slide 11. We made solid progress on retention efforts during the quarter. In fact, the absolute number of consumer access line losses is at the lowest level in two years. We also continue to grow the revenues from customers we retain. Consumer ARPU improved during the quarter to $60, up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Next, broadband subscriber additions were 23,000 for the quarter, and we ended the year with nearly 3 million subscribers. Our fiber investments continue to pay dividends. In the quarter, we added 80,000 new subscribers on fiber. We ended the period with 420,000 broadband fiber subscribers, or about 14% of our total high-speed Internet customers.On average, FTTN customers generate a 15% less in ARPU compared to DSL customers. And therefore, we believe migrations, alone, provide a great growth opportunity. In addition, about 35% of households in our territory, or about 4 million homes, do not have any high-speed Internet service today. This also represents an opportunity for us.We achieved solid performance in bundled services in the quarter, and we enhanced subscriber retention through our video and wireless service offering. In the quarter, we added 23,000 DIRECTV subscribers. These additions were partially offset by the elimination of 5,000 Qwest legacy video customers.  In efforts to wind down the Qwest-branded video in Arizona and Colorado are now complete. In the fourth quarter, we had success in acquiring new Verizon Wireless customers and moving existing subscribers to a single bill offered by Qwest. In total, we increased the number of Qwest-billed Verizon users by 64,000 in the quarter, and ended the year with 850,000 total customers.In 2010, our Mass Markets group is focused on acquiring and retaining customers by providing a differentiated customer experience. As a result of our initiatives, we are seeing early signs of success. For example, our new on-boarding process for consumer broadband users has increased install rates and improved take rates on value-added services. Additionally, we have implemented a new regional operating structure. This creates new customer touch points, while enhancing our ability to drive market-based solutions. Before I close, I want to touch on our ongoing efforts to match our work-force to work-load, which is depicted on Slide 12. Our total employee count declined by more than 1,200 in the fourth quarter, and by 2,800 or 8% for the full year. The vast majority of fourth quarter reductions occurred in the latter stages of the quarter. And while these were difficult decisions, I am confident that we will continue to provide a superior customer experience. In closing, I am pleased with our execution for the quarter and full year. In one of the most difficult economic times, we remained disciplined and actively managed resources to reflect market conditions. We successfully grew strategic revenue and associated margins, while driving expenses out of the legacy business. In 2010, we will continue to focus on growth through disciplined investment. I look forward to meeting many of you and providing more details on our progress and future plans at our upcoming investment community meeting. Now I will turn it over to Joe."

We successfully access the capital markets during the year and in doing so, we eliminated refinancing risks for the foreseeable future while improving our financial flexibility. We continue to provide a balanced mix of returns for our shareholders, including paying out $550 million in dividends, reducing net debt levels by $1.2 billion and investing $1.5 billion of capital back into the business. This investment will fund future growth and return for our shareholders. Now I'd like to turn to the income statement on Slide 14. In the fourth quarter, consolidated net operating revenues of $3 billion declined 10% compared to the prior year. Without the impacts of the wireless transition, revenues declined only 7%. Teresa provided you some sense of the efforts on our reported top line associated with our efforts to improve Wholesale long-distance margins. For the full year, revenue declined 9% or 6% after adjusting for the wireless MVNO transition. Consolidated strategic services revenue improved 4% in the quarter and 6% for the full year. We continue to improve our revenue mix by shifting to fiber-based initiatives and IP-based data solutions. In the quarter, strategic revenue accounted for 36% of total revenue versus 31% a year ago. Total operating expenses improved 1% sequentially, and 8% year-over-year. For the full year, total expenses improved 9%. The improved operating cost in the quarter and for the full year are driven by our continued efforts to increase operating efficiency through innovative process improvement, increased productivity and lower unit cost for purchase goods and services.Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $1.09 billion compared with $1.18 billion a year ago. The adjusted EBITDA margin improved 60 basis points for the same period. The current quarter includes $44 million of incremental non-cash pension and OPEB expense compared to prior year's quarter. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 billion on a margin of 35.9%. Excluding the impact of incremental non-cash pension and OPEB expense of $210 million, the margin improved 390 basis points for the year. On this same basis, we would have reported 2% growth in full year adjusted EBITDA. The improved profitability was mainly due to the transition to a new wireless business model and improved revenue mix in Wholesale and substantial reductions in direct channel expense and overhead cost.Moving on to Slide 15. We continue to strengthen the balance sheet in the fourth quarter and improve our financial flexibility. As a result of our strong free cash flows, we ended the year with net debt of $11.8 billion compared to $13 billion at the end of 2008. Cash and cash equivalents increased to $2.4 billion from $565 million a year ago. Net debt to annualize adjusted EBITDA was 2.7x at year end, a significant improvement from the year-ago period. During the quarter, we completed a new four-year revolving credit facility which was upsized to $1.04 billion and it currently remains undrawn. In January of 2010, we issued $800 million of notes with a coupon of 7.125%. While our success in the capital markets has substantially removed refinancing risks, we are all also taking efforts to put these resources to productive use, calling $525 million of notes that were scheduled to mature in February 2011.Finally, we may decide to call our $1.27 billion convertible debt later this year. These actions, along with our planned redemptions over the next 12 months, would reduce total debt by nearly $3.5 billion. This will further improve our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Details on adjusted free cash flow and capital expenditures are shown on Slide 16. In the quarter, we continued to maintain a strong management of receivables and payables. Both DSOs and DPOs improved year-over-year. Our collection staff has done an outstanding job all year for us. Bad debt expense was 0.6% of revenue in the quarter, and 1.1% for the full year. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $506 million and it was $1.9 billion for the full year. Strong EBITDA, lower capital expenditures and working capital contributions drove these results. Capital expenditures were $386 million in the quarter. Capital spending for the full year totaled $1.4 billion, plus we leased capital of a little over $100 million. This compares to capital spending of $1.8 billion in 2008. The principal reasons for our lower capital expenditures are lower customer demand, moderation of network traffic growth and lower requirements associated with the slowdown in new housing construction. We also benefited from our efforts within our purchasing, engineering and operations group, which have produced vendor savings, improved inventory levels and lowered our capital unit cost.Now I'd like to close my remarks with a discussion on guidance, on Slide 17. In 2009, we focused our efforts in the guidance we provided on EBITDA and free cash flow. We realized we cannot simply cut cost to achieve long-term prosperity. In addition, the markets are starting to stabilize and therefore, we feel the time is appropriate to provide some guidance commentary on our efforts to improve the top line. For the near term, we continue to see a stable outlook for Business Markets, with revenue continuing to beat industry averages. In Wholesale, we are likely to continue to report significant year-over-year declines, but as Teresa noted, the Wholesale long-distance comparisons should start to improve beginning in the second quarter. Mass Markets revenue in the short run will continue to follow access line trends, partially offset by increased ARPU from bundled services and growth in high-speed Internet subscribers. In looking at overall consolidated revenues, we expect that our year-over-year comparisons will improve over the course of the year.As a reminder, there was a little over $100 million of wireless MVNO revenues that we reported in the first three quarters of 2009 that won't be repeated in 2010. Our goal is to reduce our year-over-year revenue declines to a low to mid-single digit rate by the fourth quarter of this year. We will continue to be keenly focused on efficiently managing our business to maintain or improve margins. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion. We are expecting non-cash pension and OPEB expense to be approximately $130 million in 2010, which would be a $70 million improvement from 2009. The outlook for capital investment is $1.7 billion or less. We may use lease financing in 2010 for some portion of this capital spending. Our capital spending program will perfect our opportunity in  Fiber-to-the-Cell, while we continued to invest in Fiber-to-the-Node on an integrated basis. The combination of continued solid cash flows from operating activities and strong investment in the business is expected to produce adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion for the full year 2010. We do not expect to make any funding contributions to the pension plan in 2010. In 2011, we believe our pension funding requirements could be in the range of zero to $120 million, but the information necessary to finalize our contribution calculations will not be available until later in 2010. On the subject of cash taxes, our available NOLs continue to limit federal cash tax payments to the alternative minimum tax, which is approximately 2%. We currently expect this will be the case for approximately the next five years. It is our current expectation that we will continue to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share in 2010. For now, we are deferring on any additional comments on our free cash flow allocations beyond these dividends and paying off unregulated debt maturities. We will continue to assess the best use of future excess cash flows, including reinvestments back into the business, stock buybacks, dividend increases and additional deleveraging actions. In closing, I'd like to reiterate how pleased I am with 2009 results. The Qwest team has consistently demonstrated its ability to drive productivity and efficiency to improve EBITDA and free cash flow despite a challenging environment. This success has been achieved against a backdrop of high unemployment rates, competition from wireless, more aggressive promotions from cable service providers and continued business weakness with low levels of investment. We are looking forward to applying our considerable capabilities under better market conditions in the month ahead. Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, Ed, Teresa and I along with the management team would like to congratulate the workforce for a job well done in 2009, and thank them for all their hard work. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and open up the line for questions."

So the list up that you saw in the fourth quarter was driven by efficiencies. One example, if we went to the regional structure, I think that I described before, and that actually took cost out, which I know sounds color-intuitive. But that gave us a chance to focus locally on individual markets, and remove some layers and some pieces of management there. And the second driver was we are efficiently moving our customers online. So as much as we can, we are moving sales channel through an online structure as well as support. So those are the drivers. So to answer your question, it is sustainable. That was not just driven by the Wireless piece. BMG and Wholesale, as I commented earlier, we expect BMG to continue to pace along as it had. And actually assuming a bit of an uptick there as the economy improves. We are seeing signs of customer starting to move, even though they didn't make many decisions last year. I think now they're in a position where they have to expend their data network, and they have to expand their broadband efforts. And we plan on being there, where I think we've been very good at focusing on the products that we're good at in the space that we're good as far as the segmentation. On the Wholesale side, any growth that comes, they will be from Fiber-to-the-Cell. We are very excited that we're already at 2,000 cell sites that are under contract. And there's many more behind that. That's a very big number for us. And we know we can deliver. We're very good at fiber buildouts, and this is our spot. It also allows us to retain the copper backhaul that we offer today, to those wireless providers. For long-distance revenue and Wholesale, I think we'll continue to stabilize. We've been through the rough part where we create the margins largest that we want and now, we'll keep that stable."

As you know, everybody can read. They're having trouble disbursing the first chunk of money. We are actively pursuing the second phase of this, and if we can make money at it, we think the rules have improved. All of our work we've done before, we will jump in there if we can make an adequate return and meet our hurdle rates. So I'd say we're cautiously optimistic about being able to participate. But there's still I think a lot of confusion, there's also not a clear strategy of what broadband would look like in the long toll, and what really is unserved or underserved, but more to come there. So we would all be upside for us, no downside. Secondly, on the IPTV front, as you know, that's the reason we built this architecture, was to take advantage of the continued movement of what I call ala carte video. We're still very bullish on that. We worked with people right now, it would be primarily an enablement. We would enable others. We closed down our video product, our retail video product in our two regions, which has been good for us. We would had to have a large capital spend to even upgrade it. And I really believe that this will continue, the momentum's hot and heavy. But I also think the other part of this that will make a huge difference is that we are seeing content people that are not traditional content people. And so I think that's also encouraging, and we've had contact with people in Silicon Valley, primarily California who have a little different model how to monetize this. I think there's more to come, which is both subscription and what I'd call an ad-based model. So I think it's coming faster than some would have predicted.

We will then open it up for your questions.As we begin our call, let me point you to Slide 3 and remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail on our periodic filings with the SEC, and I strongly encourage you to thoroughly review them. Additionally, we do not adopt analyst estimates nor that we necessarily commit to updating forward-looking statements that we're going to be making this morning. Also, let me mention that in order to supplement the reporting of our consolidated financial information, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow and net debt. A full reconciliation of these majors is available on our website.Moving on to Slide 4. Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.06 compared to $0.10 in the fourth quarter of 2008. Current quarter earnings include a $0.02 charge for severance costs. The year-ago period includes a $0.01 charge for severance. Full year reported earnings per share for 2009 was $0.38, and that compares to $0.37 for 2008. One-time charges for severance and litigation in 2009 netted to zero. The prior year includes net charges of $0.03 per share from a combination of severance, realignment litigation and property tax settlements. In addition to these adjustments, 2009 reported earnings have been impacted by dilution from incremental non-cash pension and OPEB expense. In the current quarter, this dilution was $0.02 per share and the full year impact is $0.07. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Ed. Ed?"

Our Business Markets Group had very good relative performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2009. As far as our overall revenues, we would have liked to have reported better growth. However, I would point out that in addition to a tough economy, our reported revenues were also impacted by our initiatives to improve profitability. These include our move to a new wireless business model, which accounted 30% of our revenue decline and the elimination of poor margin wholesale long-distance revenue. While these initiatives will continue to impact our reported comparisons for the next couple of quarters, we should have easier comps in the second half of the year. Our efforts to improve margins was another area where we had strong success in 2009. For the full year, our adjusted EBITDA margin was at its best level since the merger with U.S. West in 2000. Adjusted free cash flow generated for the year was also at its highest level since the merger. Our performance continues to demonstrate that our initiatives are working, and we are carrying this momentum into 2010. In the fourth quarter, we improved our revenue mix and continue to transition away from a legacy revenue base. This transition is supported by our state-of-the-art nationwide network. This is a tremendous asset that delivers best-in-class services to businesses and government agencies throughout the country and supports all of our fiber deployment strategies. Much of our margin improvement in 2009 was from these services, and we remain focused on leveraging growth from this asset. Over the course of the year, we continued to make progress in enhancing our market position by delivering on simplified integrated solutions, improving partnerships and expanding broadband capabilities. Mid-year, we announced a five-year extension to our strategic partnership with DIRECTV. In addition, we jointly launched a new suite of integrated services to maximize the combination of DIRECTV and Qwest high-speed Internet. We've also made progress on our wireless partnership and in the fourth quarter, we concluded a very successful transition to the Verizon Wireless reseller model. Finally, we continue to deploy Fiber-to-the-Node reaching more than 3.5 million homes at year and serving 420,000 subscribers. Our broadband initiatives remain a top priority as we look to 2010. We have had some early success in marketing our Fiber-to-the-Cell Site products, and we expect to build on this momentum in 2010. To drive transport efficiencies, we announced plans to upgrade our backbone capacities to 100 gigabit speed, and we will continue to deploy Fiber-to-the-Node across our residential footprint. In 2009, we strengthened our balance sheet. Despite a tough capital markets environment, especially early in the year, we were able to access the credit markets at favorable rates. We also announced the new four-year revolving credit facility. Collectively, these actions has significantly improved our maturity profile and enhanced our financial flexibility. Finally, we remain committed to our balanced approach to investment returns. For all of 2009, our direct shareholder returns in the form of cash dividends were $550 million. In addition, we reduced net debt by $1.2 billion during the year. To some up, I think we had a solid year at nearly every level of the company. The Qwest team's ability to deliver these results in tough markets has really been quite remarkable throughout 2009. In 2010, you will continue to see the results of our efforts to improve efficiency and productivity, and we will remain dedicated focused on the top line. Now I'll hand it off to Teresa who will discuss our business unit performance."

In the fourth quarter, we maintained solid operating performance. Overall, we continued to see strong demand for broadband strategic products, which grew 4% for the quarter and 6% for the full year. This was driven by 37% full year growth in enterprise IP services and higher take rates for fiber-based consumer broadband services. We also remain disciplined in our expense control. This focus produced margin gains across all three segments, a significant accomplishment in light of challenging market conditions.In 2009, we demonstrate that we can adjust to the market and manage the bottom line. In the coming year, our goals are to improve our revenue trajectory while retaining a bottom-line discipline. As we turn to 2010, we see encouraging signs in each of our segments.Let's start with the Business Markets segment on Slide 8. Results reflect our continued success in growing our strategic revenues and expanding our margins. Business Markets reported total revenues of $1 billion in the fourth quarter. In the quarter, Business Markets revenue performance outpaced major competitors although revenue decreased 2% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and declined 1% sequentially. As we have previously noted, a key metric we monitor is recurring service revenue. In the fourth quarter, recurring revenues were down 1% year-over-year and were flat with the third quarter. For the full year, recurring revenues were modestly ahead of 2008.Strategic revenues within Business Markets increased 7%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This is driven by strong demand for our MPLS IP services, which increased 26%. In the quarter, strategic revenues were 40% of total business revenue, an increase from 36% a year ago.In the fourth quarter, legacy revenues declined 8% compared to a year ago due to lower vocal voice revenues and legacy LAN data services. As customers continue to migrate to next-generation services. This was partially offset by growth in demand for call center applications and we are deep in the transition of the customers from legacy data transport services such as ATM and frame relay.Revenues from those services we're under 6% of total Business Market revenue in the fourth quarter compared to 8% a year ago. The decline in data integration revenue in the quarter reflects lower equipment sales, partially offset growth in demand for professional services. In the fourth quarter, Business Market segment income of $405 million improved 3% year-over-year but declined 1% sequentially. Segment income for the full year improved 7%, primarily due to channel efficiencies and lower network and facility spend.For 2010, our plans four Business Market is to build up success for the past year. We have a diverse customer portfolio we offer unique support and have a strong mix of managed and next-generation data IP services. The key strengths provide a strong foundation four us to grow our enterprise top line as the economy improves in coming quarters.Results for our wholesale segment are summarized on Slide 9. Wholesale results reflect an improved strategic product mix and continued progress on improving profitability. Revenue for the quarter told at $679 million. This is an annual decline of 14% and a sequential decline of 3%. In the quarter, strategic revenues were stable and increased to 45% of total wholesale revenue from 39% a year ago. Legacy revenue decreased 22% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. The annual decline was in part due to proactively managing long-distance profitability. The sequential decline was mainly due to ongoing local voice and access revenue pressure. In the quarter, long-distance revenue, which was a little under 20% of total Wholesale segment revenues, declined by more than 30% from the quarter of 2008. Even with the significant decrease, the profit contribution from long-distance was relatively flat with the year ago.Segment income for the quarter was $447 million, an 8% decline from a year ago and a 3% sequential decline. Segment margin was 65.8%, a 410 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2008. Margins improved to 660 basis points for the full year. In 2010, we expect Wholesale long-distance revenue comparisons will improve beginning in the second quarter. Our Wholesale group continues to seize the opportunity to leverage our broadband fiber investments, and capitalize on growing demand for wireless backhaul services. We currently have contracts to provide fiber-based access to nearly 2,000 wireless cell sites. These contracts provide an avenue for strategic revenue growth, while protecting existing copper backhaul services. We will begin to recognize revenues in 2010. However, the full year impact will be minor. Over the next couple of years, this could add 1% to 2% to our annual consolidated revenue.Now we'll turn to Mass Markets results on Slide 10. As Ed mentioned, we completed the migration to our new wireless reseller business model during the quarter. Excluding the impact of this transition, Mass Markets revenue for the quarter declined 7% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Strategic revenues improved 3% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. In the quarter, strategic revenue was 30% of total Mass Markets revenue compared to 25% a year ago. In the fourth quarter, legacy revenue declined due to lower demand for traditional local voice services. Segment income of $685 million declined 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. On a sequential basis, expense reductions outpaced revenue declines, and this drove a 2% improvement in segment income and a 220 basis point improvement in margin. For the full year, segment income was down 3% as a result of continued top line pressure. It was offset by substantial expense reductions. And for the full year, margins improved to 550 basis points. Our quarterly subscriber results are contained on Slide 11. We made solid progress on retention efforts during the quarter. In fact, the absolute number of consumer access line losses is at the lowest level in two years. We also continue to grow the revenues from customers we retain. Consumer ARPU improved during the quarter to $60, up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Next, broadband subscriber additions were 23,000 for the quarter, and we ended the year with nearly 3 million subscribers. Our fiber investments continue to pay dividends. In the quarter, we added 80,000 new subscribers on fiber. We ended the period with 420,000 broadband fiber subscribers, or about 14% of our total high-speed Internet customers.On average, FTTN customers generate a 15% less in ARPU compared to DSL customers. And therefore, we believe migrations, alone, provide a great growth opportunity. In addition, about 35% of households in our territory, or about 4 million homes, do not have any high-speed Internet service today. This also represents an opportunity for us.We achieved solid performance in bundled services in the quarter, and we enhanced subscriber retention through our video and wireless service offering. In the quarter, we added 23,000 DIRECTV subscribers. These additions were partially offset by the elimination of 5,000 Qwest legacy video customers.  In efforts to wind down the Qwest-branded video in Arizona and Colorado are now complete. In the fourth quarter, we had success in acquiring new Verizon Wireless customers and moving existing subscribers to a single bill offered by Qwest. In total, we increased the number of Qwest-billed Verizon users by 64,000 in the quarter, and ended the year with 850,000 total customers.In 2010, our Mass Markets group is focused on acquiring and retaining customers by providing a differentiated customer experience. As a result of our initiatives, we are seeing early signs of success. For example, our new on-boarding process for consumer broadband users has increased install rates and improved take rates on value-added services. Additionally, we have implemented a new regional operating structure. This creates new customer touch points, while enhancing our ability to drive market-based solutions. Before I close, I want to touch on our ongoing efforts to match our work-force to work-load, which is depicted on Slide 12. Our total employee count declined by more than 1,200 in the fourth quarter, and by 2,800 or 8% for the full year. The vast majority of fourth quarter reductions occurred in the latter stages of the quarter. And while these were difficult decisions, I am confident that we will continue to provide a superior customer experience. In closing, I am pleased with our execution for the quarter and full year. In one of the most difficult economic times, we remained disciplined and actively managed resources to reflect market conditions. We successfully grew strategic revenue and associated margins, while driving expenses out of the legacy business. In 2010, we will continue to focus on growth through disciplined investment. I look forward to meeting many of you and providing more details on our progress and future plans at our upcoming investment community meeting. Now I will turn it over to Joe."

I am pleased to report that this was another quarter of consistent performance, and we finished with strong results for the year. We delivered solid EBITDA, improved margins and generated strong free cash flow, despite unprecedented market conditions. We successfully access the capital markets during the year and in doing so, we eliminated refinancing risks for the foreseeable future while improving our financial flexibility. We continue to provide a balanced mix of returns for our shareholders, including paying out $550 million in dividends, reducing net debt levels by $1.2 billion and investing $1.5 billion of capital back into the business. This investment will fund future growth and return for our shareholders. Now I'd like to turn to the income statement on Slide 14. In the fourth quarter, consolidated net operating revenues of $3 billion declined 10% compared to the prior year. Without the impacts of the wireless transition, revenues declined only 7%. Teresa provided you some sense of the efforts on our reported top line associated with our efforts to improve Wholesale long-distance margins. For the full year, revenue declined 9% or 6% after adjusting for the wireless MVNO transition. Consolidated strategic services revenue improved 4% in the quarter and 6% for the full year. We continue to improve our revenue mix by shifting to fiber-based initiatives and IP-based data solutions. In the quarter, strategic revenue accounted for 36% of total revenue versus 31% a year ago. Total operating expenses improved 1% sequentially, and 8% year-over-year. For the full year, total expenses improved 9%. The improved operating cost in the quarter and for the full year are driven by our continued efforts to increase operating efficiency through innovative process improvement, increased productivity and lower unit cost for purchase goods and services.Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $1.09 billion compared with $1.18 billion a year ago. The adjusted EBITDA margin improved 60 basis points for the same period. The current quarter includes $44 million of incremental non-cash pension and OPEB expense compared to prior year's quarter. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 billion on a margin of 35.9%. Excluding the impact of incremental non-cash pension and OPEB expense of $210 million, the margin improved 390 basis points for the year. On this same basis, we would have reported 2% growth in full year adjusted EBITDA. The improved profitability was mainly due to the transition to a new wireless business model and improved revenue mix in Wholesale and substantial reductions in direct channel expense and overhead cost.Moving on to Slide 15. We continue to strengthen the balance sheet in the fourth quarter and improve our financial flexibility. As a result of our strong free cash flows, we ended the year with net debt of $11.8 billion compared to $13 billion at the end of 2008. Cash and cash equivalents increased to $2.4 billion from $565 million a year ago. Net debt to annualize adjusted EBITDA was 2.7x at year end, a significant improvement from the year-ago period. During the quarter, we completed a new four-year revolving credit facility which was upsized to $1.04 billion and it currently remains undrawn. In January of 2010, we issued $800 million of notes with a coupon of 7.125%. While our success in the capital markets has substantially removed refinancing risks, we are all also taking efforts to put these resources to productive use, calling $525 million of notes that were scheduled to mature in February 2011.Finally, we may decide to call our $1.27 billion convertible debt later this year. These actions, along with our planned redemptions over the next 12 months, would reduce total debt by nearly $3.5 billion. This will further improve our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Details on adjusted free cash flow and capital expenditures are shown on Slide 16. In the quarter, we continued to maintain a strong management of receivables and payables. Both DSOs and DPOs improved year-over-year. Our collection staff has done an outstanding job all year for us. Bad debt expense was 0.6% of revenue in the quarter, and 1.1% for the full year. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $506 million and it was $1.9 billion for the full year. Strong EBITDA, lower capital expenditures and working capital contributions drove these results. Capital expenditures were $386 million in the quarter. Capital spending for the full year totaled $1.4 billion, plus we leased capital of a little over $100 million. This compares to capital spending of $1.8 billion in 2008. The principal reasons for our lower capital expenditures are lower customer demand, moderation of network traffic growth and lower requirements associated with the slowdown in new housing construction. We also benefited from our efforts within our purchasing, engineering and operations group, which have produced vendor savings, improved inventory levels and lowered our capital unit cost.Now I'd like to close my remarks with a discussion on guidance, on Slide 17. In 2009, we focused our efforts in the guidance we provided on EBITDA and free cash flow. We realized we cannot simply cut cost to achieve long-term prosperity. In addition, the markets are starting to stabilize and therefore, we feel the time is appropriate to provide some guidance commentary on our efforts to improve the top line. For the near term, we continue to see a stable outlook for Business Markets, with revenue continuing to beat industry averages. In Wholesale, we are likely to continue to report significant year-over-year declines, but as Teresa noted, the Wholesale long-distance comparisons should start to improve beginning in the second quarter. Mass Markets revenue in the short run will continue to follow access line trends, partially offset by increased ARPU from bundled services and growth in high-speed Internet subscribers. In looking at overall consolidated revenues, we expect that our year-over-year comparisons will improve over the course of the year.As a reminder, there was a little over $100 million of wireless MVNO revenues that we reported in the first three quarters of 2009 that won't be repeated in 2010. Our goal is to reduce our year-over-year revenue declines to a low to mid-single digit rate by the fourth quarter of this year. We will continue to be keenly focused on efficiently managing our business to maintain or improve margins. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion. We are expecting non-cash pension and OPEB expense to be approximately $130 million in 2010, which would be a $70 million improvement from 2009. The outlook for capital investment is $1.7 billion or less. We may use lease financing in 2010 for some portion of this capital spending. Our capital spending program will perfect our opportunity in  Fiber-to-the-Cell, while we continued to invest in Fiber-to-the-Node on an integrated basis. The combination of continued solid cash flows from operating activities and strong investment in the business is expected to produce adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion for the full year 2010. We do not expect to make any funding contributions to the pension plan in 2010. In 2011, we believe our pension funding requirements could be in the range of zero to $120 million, but the information necessary to finalize our contribution calculations will not be available until later in 2010. On the subject of cash taxes, our available NOLs continue to limit federal cash tax payments to the alternative minimum tax, which is approximately 2%. We currently expect this will be the case for approximately the next five years. It is our current expectation that we will continue to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share in 2010. For now, we are deferring on any additional comments on our free cash flow allocations beyond these dividends and paying off unregulated debt maturities. We will continue to assess the best use of future excess cash flows, including reinvestments back into the business, stock buybacks, dividend increases and additional deleveraging actions. In closing, I'd like to reiterate how pleased I am with 2009 results. The Qwest team has consistently demonstrated its ability to drive productivity and efficiency to improve EBITDA and free cash flow despite a challenging environment. This success has been achieved against a backdrop of high unemployment rates, competition from wireless, more aggressive promotions from cable service providers and continued business weakness with low levels of investment. We are looking forward to applying our considerable capabilities under better market conditions in the month ahead. Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, Ed, Teresa and I along with the management team would like to congratulate the workforce for a job well done in 2009, and thank them for all their hard work. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and open up the line for questions."

So the list up that you saw in the fourth quarter was driven by efficiencies. One example, if we went to the regional structure, I think that I described before, and that actually took cost out, which I know sounds color-intuitive. But that gave us a chance to focus locally on individual markets, and remove some layers and some pieces of management there. And the second driver was we are efficiently moving our customers online. So as much as we can, we are moving sales channel through an online structure as well as support. So those are the drivers. So to answer your question, it is sustainable. That was not just driven by the Wireless piece. BMG and Wholesale, as I commented earlier, we expect BMG to continue to pace along as it had. And actually assuming a bit of an uptick there as the economy improves. We are seeing signs of customer starting to move, even though they didn't make many decisions last year. I think now they're in a position where they have to expend their data network, and they have to expand their broadband efforts. And we plan on being there, where I think we've been very good at focusing on the products that we're good at in the space that we're good as far as the segmentation. On the Wholesale side, any growth that comes, they will be from Fiber-to-the-Cell. We are very excited that we're already at 2,000 cell sites that are under contract. And there's many more behind that. That's a very big number for us. And we know we can deliver. We're very good at fiber buildouts, and this is our spot. It also allows us to retain the copper backhaul that we offer today, to those wireless providers. For long-distance revenue and Wholesale, I think we'll continue to stabilize. We've been through the rough part where we create the margins largest that we want and now, we'll keep that stable."

So there's about 18,000 cell sites throughout the 14 states, and about 8,000 towers. We believe that approximately 50% of the sites will need fiber by 2014. So if you think about simple math there, about 9,000 cell sites, at some point, by 2014, will need fiber. And obviously this is in the concentrated areas, Colorado, Arizona, Washington, Minnesota. We currently have 2,000 under contract today that are in construction and moving along. And they're absolutely thousands behind that. And those are in negotiation right now. And we feel very confident about the service that we offer, and the pricing structure that we have in place to win those bids. Right now, we feel like we are taking a large market share inside the 14 states. And the other good news is that it also protects our copper. So while some cell sites will continue to have copper-fed, it allows us to maintain that revenue. And then overlay the fiber into it.[indiscernible]"

SO when you look at our guidance, you see we're really trying to exit the year on a positive note, so that we can get to that 2011 growth story. And I think as you see that execution and you'll see the confidence happen, then you'll get more of a discussion about what had happened in the deployment of cash. And don't forget that the capital we're spending is to provide that proper return. So the whole Fiber-to-the-Cell and Fiber-to-the-Node, we've delivered on a consistent basis.

As you know, everybody can read. They're having trouble disbursing the first chunk of money.

All of our work we've done before, we will jump in there if we can make an adequate return and meet our hurdle rates. So I'd say we're cautiously optimistic about being able to participate. But there's still I think a lot of confusion, there's also not a clear strategy of what broadband would look like in the long toll, and what really is unserved or underserved, but more to come there. So we would all be upside for us, no downside. Secondly, on the IPTV front, as you know, that's the reason we built this architecture, was to take advantage of the continued movement of what I call ala carte video. We're still very bullish on that. We worked with people right now, it would be primarily an enablement. We would enable others. We closed down our video product, our retail video product in our two regions, which has been good for us. We would had to have a large capital spend to even upgrade it. And I really believe that this will continue, the momentum's hot and heavy. But I also think the other part of this that will make a huge difference is that we are seeing content people that are not traditional content people. And so I think that's also encouraging, and we've had contact with people in Silicon Valley, primarily California who have a little different model how to monetize this. I think there's more to come, which is both subscription and what I'd call an ad-based model. So I think it's coming faster than some would have predicted.

Good morning and welcome, everyone, to Qwest first quarter earnings call. Today I am joined by Ed Mueller, our Chairman and CEO; Teresa Taylor, our COO; and Joe Euteneuer, our CFO.
We will begin today's call with a few comments on the quarter from Ed followed, followed by a review of segment results from Teresa. Joe will conclude our prepared remarks with the discussion of our consolidated financial results and outlook. We will then open it up for your questions.
As we begin our call, let me point you to slide three and remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail in our periodic filings with the SEC and I strongly encourage you to thoroughly review them. Additionally, we do not adopt analyst estimates nor do we necessarily commit to updating forward-looking statements that we will be making this morning. 
To supplement the recording of our consolidated financial information, on our call today we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow, and net debt. A full reconciliation of these measures is available on our web site.
Moving on to slide four, earnings per share for the quarter was $0.02 compared to $0.12 in the first quarter of 2009. The current quarter earnings include a $0.06 charge for tax changes under the Medicare Part D program and $0.02 for the early retirement of debt and severance and restructuring charges.
The year-ago period includes a $0.01 charge for severance, which was offset by a $0.01 benefit for a lower tax rate. In addition to these adjustments, reported earnings had been affected by dilution from incremental, non-cash, pension and OPEB expenses. In the current quarter, this dilution was $0.01 per share and in the year-ago period it was $0.02 per share.
Turning to slide five, we have made some changes this quarter in our continual efforts to improve the transparency of our recording. These recording changes include revised definitions for cost of sales, selling and administrative expenses, expanded detail disclosure of segment expenses and additional assignment of overhead costs to our segments where management accountability exists. As a result, segment expenses have been restated to include the assignment of real estate, procurement and insurance costs.
The six new categories of expenses that we are now providing at the segment level, will give added insight into the variable, fixed and acquisition cost leverage that we pull in managing EBITDA and free cash flow.
On the income statement, these costs along with costs for fleet operations and posting centers have been reclassified from general and administrative expense to cost of sales. We have also revised our subscriber and access line metrics to align with our revenue recording.
As a result, we have removed approximately 400,000 affiliate access lines. We have also aligned our recorded video subscribers to fully capture all billing subscribers under our agreement with DIRECTV.
Finally, we removed business and wholesale subscribers from our reported high-speed internet units in our mass markets group. We have provided results with these new classifications for the past 12 quarters on our website.
With that I am going to turn it over to Ed.

I want to begin by saying I'm very pleased with our continued execution and results in the quarter. We are off to a solid start in 2010 with improving revenue trends and expanding EBITDA margins.
Our performance in the quarter is a demonstration of the sharp focus we have on our key initiatives to drive the top-line, while maintaining disciplined expense management to improve operating efficiencies. We continue to see strong growth in our strategic revenues and we are aggressively pursuing broadband based initiatives.
In the quarter, Qwest again strengthened the balance sheet and enhanced financial flexibility. We clearly have solid momentum across our businesses and we intend to maintain this momentum throughout the year and leading up to the close of our planned merger with CenturyLink.
I'm very excited about the prospects that arise from our combination of CenturyLink and Qwest; with this transaction, the combined company will become an even stronger competitor as a national player with substantially increased scale and broader scope. The increased scale will allow us to invest in and deliver differentiated products and services that our customers will demand in the future.
The combination creates new strategic opportunities with other industry participants, including marketing partners and network suppliers. This transaction will provide several benefits for our shareholders. At the exchange rate of 0.1664, it provides a 15% premium from the closing price of our stock on the day before the announcement. Qwest shareholders can also participate in a future upside that will be supported by strong operating synergies.
In addition, our shareholders will receive a higher dividend following the close, which is the equivalent of about $0.48 per share or a 50% increase.
Finally, this transaction accelerates our deleveraging and provides financial strength and flexibilities. Activities are already underway to begin the detailed planning for the integration of our two companies. We have also engaged with the various commissions and other agencies that will need to approve the transaction and of course you would receive updates on our progress throughout the year.
To sum up, I'm very excited about our execution in the quarter and very confident that our transaction with CenturyLink will further bolster our results and drive superior shareholder value. Our strategy and execution will not change as a result of this announcement and I suspect our efforts to improve the top-line, while increasing efficiency and productivity will continue to produce improved results.
Now I'll hand it off to Teresa, who will discuss our business unit performance.

We have a solid start to the year and we continue to achieve good operating momentum in the first quarter. We made strong progress on our goals to improve our revenue trajectories with each of the business units reporting improved year-over-year comparisons.
Overall, we continued to experience strong demand for strategic products, which grew 5% compared to the year-ago quarter. This was driven by 33% growth in enterprise IP services and a higher take rate for fiber based consumer broadband. We also continue to maintain a disciplined focus on the bottom line and reported steady margin improvement.
I will begin the discussion of our individual business unit performance with the business market segment on slide 10.
In the enterprise space, we are beginning to see signs of increased customer activity, although we are in the early stages of that cycle. While our sales remain stable in the quarter, sales activity levels and pipeline ramped up. Business markets reported first quarter revenues of $1 billion. This was flat with the prior year's quarter and down 1% sequentially.
However, recurring revenue was up modestly compared with the fourth quarter. Strategic revenues within business markets increased 8% compared to the first quarter of 2009; this was driven by strong demand for MPLS IP services.
In the quarter, strategic revenues were 43% of total business revenues, compared to 39% a year ago. In response to growing demand for hosting and cloud-based infrastructure services, we opened our 17th nationwide CyberCenter in the Washington, D.C. area. Our data centers provide highly secure, reliable scalable services and a cloud computing infrastructure.
In the first quarter, business market segment income of $400 million improved 5% year-over-year and 2% in the fourth quarter. The increase is primarily due to customer acquisition efficiencies and lower facility cost.
In summary, we are well positioned to grow the enterprise top-line and we continue to expect revenues will start to pick up in the second half of the year.
As you know, we have been very disappointed in our pursuit of possible revenue growth and you should expect us to maintain that discipline in the quarters ahead.
Results for our wholesale segment are summarized on slide 11. Wholesale results reflect an increased strategic product mix and improved top-line trends. Strategic revenue now represents 46% of total wholesale revenue compared to 41% a year ago.
Segment revenue for the quarter totaled $685 million, a decline of 11% year-over-year and a marked improvement from the 14% decline last quarter. Wholesale revenue declined 1% sequentially. During the course of the quarter, we experienced improving access revenue trends, another sign that economically sensitive services such as long distance may be improving.
We saw the same activity in our retail long distance volumes. While these trends are encouraging, our wholesale legacy revenues still decreased 19% year-over-year and 4% from the last quarter.
As a reminder, the annual decline was in large part due to proactively managing long distance profitability throughout late 2008 and early 2009. We continue to expect wholesale long distance revenue comparisons will improve beginning the second quarter. In the quarter, strong improvements in network facility costs contribute to a sequential improvement in wholesale segment income and a margin of 67%.
Our wholesale growth made significant progress in the quarter to deliver fiber based backhaul services for wireless carriers. This provides an avenue for strategic revenue growth, while protecting existing copper backhaul services. Although it's still early, bandwidth fixed rates on the initial cell sites in service are exceeding our expectations.
We will have a modest amount of revenues from this program this year. However, we continue to believe over the next couple of year, fiber based backhaul services could add 1% to 2% for annual consolidated revenue.
Now, we'll turn to mass markets results on slide 12. As a reminder, we completed the migration to our new wireless reseller business model last quarter. Excluding the impact of this transition, mass markets revenue for the quarter declined 7% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.
Strategic revenues improved 3% from the fourth quarter and 5% year-over-year, while legacy revenue declined 11% due to lower demand for traditional local voice services. In the quarter, strategic revenue grew to 31% of total mass markets revenue compared to 26% a year-ago.
In the first quarter, our small business unit produced a little more than $900 million in annual revenues and represented about 20% of the mass markets total revenue. For the first time since 2008, small business revenues were stable in each month during the quarter. We are hopeful this is a positive sign for better results in the future.
Segment income of $627 million declined 9% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Segment margin of 53% improved 110 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. Mass markets have done an excellent job matching expenses to volume. In the quarter, total expenses declined 13% from the first quarter of 2009.
Our quarterly subscriber results are contained on slide 13. We continue to make steady progress on retention efforts during the quarter. The absolute number of consumer access line losses is at the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2007, an improved 22% from the year ago period.
We also grew our revenues from customers we retain. Consumer ARPU improved in the quarter to $62, up 7% compared to the fist quarter of 2009.
Net broadband subscriber additions were 40,000 for the quarter. We continue to expand our fiber to the node footprint and services are now available to approximately 3.8 million residential households.
We added 64,000 new subscribers on fiber services, ending the period with approximately 480,000 broadband fiber subscribers. This is about 17% of mass markets high speed internet customers.
In addition to generating stronger share flow, our FTTN subscribers are migrating to higher speeds, which generates the high ARPU. On average FTTN customers generate a 15% lift in ARPU compared to traditional DSL customers. And we believe migrations to the fiber services provide a great growth opportunity.
We continue to have good success from our key business partnerships that drive improved subscriber retention. In the quarter, we added 11,000 video subscribers bringing the total to 951,000 at quarter's end. In total, we increased the number of Qwest build Verizon Wireless users by 84,000 and ended the period with 922,000 total customers.
This year our mass markets group remains keenly focused on acquiring and retaining customers by enhancing the customer experience. We are seeing early signs of success from our initiative such as on boarding process for consumer broadband users and we achieved a reduction in HSI during this quarter.
Additionally, we launched @Ease packages that provide additional text support and security features.
In closing, I'm pleased with the progress we've made as we begin the year, and I look forward to updating you in the quarters ahead.
Now I will turn it over to Joe.

As we begin 2010, I'm pleased we have delivered another solid quarter. The improvement in the top-line is very encouraging and it puts us ahead of schedule for meeting our revenue improvement goal for 2010. I think it is also very noteworthy that we again achieved both sequential and year-over-year improvement in EBITDA margin.
Our free cash-flow was solid in the quarter and we continue to strengthen the balance sheet. Now let's turn to slide 15 so we can talk about the income statement.
In the first quarter, consolidated net operating revenues of $2.97 billion declined 6.5% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the wireless transition, revenues declined 5%. As you will recall in the fourth quarter our year-over-year decline was 7% excluding wireless.
As Teresa noted, the improved year-over-year comparison is due to stronger result in each segment. First quarter revenue declined 1% sequentially compared to a 2% sequential decline last quarter. This was in part due to the wrap up of the wireless MVNO business in the fourth quarter and better wholesale performance.
Consolidated strategic service revenue increased 5% compared to the year-ago quarter. We continue to improve our revenue mix by shifting to fiber based initiatives and IT solutions.
In the quarter, strategic revenue accrued at 37% of total revenue from 33% a year ago. This quarter is a good demonstration of our progress in turning the top-line, for maintaining a disciplined approach to the bottom line.
Total operating expenses improved 9% from the prior year and 6% sequentially. The improved operating cost are driven by our continued efforts to increase operating efficiency through process improvement, lower customer service and acquisition cost in mass markets and decline in wholesale facility cost.
Approximately 25% of the annual facility cost decline was due to wireless migration completed last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.12 billion for the first quarter, a 4% improvement from $1.09 billion in the fourth quarter and a 2% decline from $1.15 billion a year ago.
The adjusted EBITDA margin of 37.9% expanded by 170 basis points sequentially and 180 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2009.
Moving on to slide 16, we continue to strengthen the balance sheet in the first quarter and improve our financial flexibility. We ended the first quarter with net debt of $11.7 billion compared to $12.8 billion in the first quarter of 2009. Cash plus short term investments increased to $1.9 billion from $547 million a year ago. Net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA was 2.7 times at the end of the quarter, a slight improvement compared with 2.8 times a year ago and flat with the fourth quarter.
In January, we raised $800 million in eight-year notes with a coupon of 7.5%. In February and March, we called $525 million in notes early and successfully completed the cash tender for $916 million in notes.
These two actions reduced total debt by $1.5 billion of the $3.5 billion planned reduction through the first quarter of next year. Now let's turn to slide 17 which shows details on adjusted free cash flow and capital expenditures.
In the quarter, we continued to maintain strong disciplined management of receivables and payables. DSOs improved year-over-year to 37.8 days. Our collection stat continues to do an outstanding job for us. Bad debt expense improved to just 0.8% of revenue in the quarter, compared to 1.6% for the same period a year ago.
Adjusted free cash-flow for the quarter was $335 million reflecting the usual first quarter seasonality. Capital expenditures were $387 million compared with $334 million in the first quarter of 2009.
We saw an increase in capital expending in this quarter, in part due to a cautious investment climate in late 2008 and early 2009, increased spending on our strategic initiatives and timing of cash payments.
Before I close my remarks with the discussion of our guidance, I'd like to quickly update you on our progress of improving returns on invested capital. This is depicted on slide 18. As you can see, we've made a consistent improvement in this area over the past few years. And this past year, we started earning above our weighted average cost to capital. This is largely the result of steady operating income and declining net investment balance.
Now let's turn to our guidance on slide 19. This year we've turned our focus to the top-line, while maintaining a diligent focus on the bottom line. I'm pleased that we're beginning to see improved trends in revenue, largely driven to date by improved customer retention. Our focus going forward will be to bolster these trends through increased new customer acquisition.
For the near term, we continue to see a stable outlook for business markets with revenue beginning to improve in the second half of the year.
In wholesale, we are likely to continue to report improving year-over-year rates of the client as the long distance comparisons start to improve next quarter. In the short run, mass markets revenue will continue to follow access lines trend, partially offset by increased ARPU from bundled services and growth in high speed internet subscribers.
Due to the sharp decline in wireless revenues throughout 2009, mass markets is expected to have easier reported revenue comparison over the course of the year.
In looking at our overall consolidated revenues, we expect that are our reported year-over-year comparisons will continue to improve over the course of the year. Our goal continues to be, to reduce reported year-over-year revenue declines, to a low mid-single digit rate by the fourth quarter of this year.
And as I noted earlier, our first quarter result have us on good pace to meet that goal. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion.
We expect steady to improving margins in 2010 compared to 2009. As a reminder, we do have some seasonality in our EBITDA, results due to increased spending in warmer months for example, and we expect the same this year.
The outlook for capital investments is $1.7 billion or less. We may use lease financing in 2010 for some portion of this capital spending, as we did in 2009. Our capital spending program will reflect our opportunity in fiber to the cell, while we continue to invest in fiber to the node on an integrated basis.
The combination of continued solid cash flows from operating activities and strong investments in the business is expected to produce adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion for the full year of 2010.
We do not expect to make any funding contributions to the pension plan in 2010. Our current expectation is that we will not have any required funding in 2011 as well. As you will recall, we previously thought that our funding requirement for 2011 could be in the range of zero to $120 million.
We continue to expect to pay taxes of approximately 2% this year. As we noted in the CenturyLink merger announcement, it is our current expectation that we will continue to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share to the close of the transaction.
In closing I would like to reiterate how pleased I am with our results to this quarter. I share Ed and Teresa's optimism that we will continue our momentum throughout the year.
With that I turn the call back over to the operator and will open the lines for questions.

What can you say about that, maybe strategically if not specifically? And how might that be impacted by your CenturyTel relationship?
And then the second question, could you be more specific about, what you're seeing either in certain verticals or in sales funnel that makes you as confident as you seem to be, that the second half is going to be an enterprise recovery in revenues? Thanks.

We're just beginning our integration teams to talk about all of these items, as you know we run our companies separately and will continue to do that. But our customers, they're excited about our financial flexibility.
The announcement that we're keeping our BMG Group In Tech run by Chris Ancell, who works for Qwest right now, is really a good move for our customer base. And we also believe we'll pick up some markets as an example, some on-ramps and off-ramps in CenturyLink territory particularly Las Vegas, as well as central Florida.
So that's been good. Employer action has generally been good. It all depends, however, how you're personally impacted, so we're mindful of that. We're very in tune to how it impacts the employee body. But by and large, I think we always look at ourselves as not a Denver company, we're a national company. And our employee body is excited about the security of a better financial future.
And I think that's how we position it, Simon, and really has the added virtue being the truth. And so having a bigger financial foot print, way more free cash flow, a dividend increase for our customers de-leveraging; and all the things we put out is great.
On a state approval front, it's a little early to tell but we don't see that as a big hurdle. There's some overlapping states, which CenturyLink provides well, it's minimal.
But the states that do overlap. CenturyLink has a good reputation. We have a good reputation, so at this point I think we're very optimistic that this will get closed in a nice way and speedily.
On the national front, I know you didn't ask about this, but on a national front, because it's a share-per-share as well as it has really no heading trust implications that we see, maybe a little, but not much. We think that being a third strong provider in the nation is a good thing for the competition as well as the marketplace.

Thank you, Matthew, and good morning, everybody and welcome to our call. We appreciate your time and interest in what is going to be a very busy day for many of you.
We will begin today’s call with a few comments on the quarter from Ed Mueller, our Chairman and CEO. Ed will be followed by Teresa Taylor, our COO, who will review segment results and then Joe Euteneuer; our CFO will conclude the prepared remarks with a discussion of our consolidated financial results and outlook. We’ll then open it up for your questions.
As we begin our call, let me point you to slide three and remind everyone that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail in our periodic filings with the SEC and I strongly encourage you to thoroughly review our filings. I also want to point out that we do not adopt analyst’s estimates nor do we necessarily commit to updating any forward-looking statements that we will be making this morning.
To supplement the recording of our financial information, on our call today we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow, and net debt. A full reconciliation of these measures is available on our web site.
Now, we’ll move on to slide four to touch on EPS and some special items that impacted EPS in the quarter.
Our reported earnings per share for the quarter were $0.09 and that compares to $0.12 in the second quarter of 2009. Our adjusted net income this quarter also rounded to $0.09 per share. The current quarter’s earnings includes a little under $0.02 charge for merger and severance expenses. This was offset by a little over $0.01 per share gain related to the change in fair value of the company’s convertible debt option.
Under the terms of our merger agreement with CenturyLink, we have committed to redeem our convertible debt and the intrinsic value of the associated option for cash. Therefore, we have reclassified the option component of the note from equity to a liability and that’s now included in the accrued expenses noted. The value of this liability at the end of the quarter was $145 million after initially being valued at $166 million at the date of the merger announcement.
Future stock price movements are likely to cause us to recognize periodic gains or losses through the redemption of the notes. These gains or losses will have no tax impact and a result there could also be some variability in our effective tax rate as we go forward.
Reported and adjusted earnings included dilution from non-cash and OPEB expenses. In the current quarter, this dilution was $0.01 per share and in the year-ago period. We have an impact of $0.02 per share.
Now, I’m going to turn it over to Ed.

I want to begin by saying I’m very pleased with our continued execution and performance in the quarter. In light of continued challenging market conditions, we reported expanded margins and improved year-over-year revenue trends across all segments and we generated strong cash flow.
Our performance in the quarter is a demonstration of the sharp focus we have on our key strategies to drive the top-line, while maintaining disciplined expense management to improve operating efficiencies. We delivered on key initiatives and continue to see solid growth in our strategic revenues and while we aggressively pursue broadband based services.
In the quarter, Qwest further strengthened its financial flexibility by improving the balance sheet. We launched a tender offer for our convertible debt and we are well on our way to achieving our stated debt reduction objectives.
In addition, I’m very pleased with the progress we’re making toward completion of our merger with CenturyLink. The senior leadership team for the combined company has been named and activities are underway in the planning process for the integration of the two companies.
Each of the named leaders has appointed an integrated lead, who will focus on the planning process for every functional organization. There are 10 integration leads in total. To ensure input and insights are captured from both companies, about half of the leads are from Qwest and about half are from CenturyLink.
We have reached several key milestones in the approval process with various agencies and commissions required to review the transaction. We have received approvals in six states. In addition to the FCC, we have 16 states remaining to review and approved the transaction.
In July, we received clearance from the Department of Justice and CenturyLink filed the final joint proxy statement with the SEC. The special meeting to vote on the transaction will be held on August 24th.
To sum up, we had solid execution in the quarter despite a soft economy and highly competitive markets. Our results over the past several quarters demonstrate our ability to overcome these challenges. I’m very confident that we’re on track to deliver on our key strategies throughout the remainder of the year. We will continue to drive top-line results while increasing cost efficiency and productivity.
I’m excited about the prospects that will arise from the combination of Qwest and CenturyLink. In addition, to owning a stake in the stronger competitor, Qwest shareholders will benefit from significant synergies of substantial increase in dividends, accelerating deleveraging of the balance sheet, a strong management team and a talented employee base.
I am convince this transaction will further bolster our results and drive superior shareholder value.
Now, I’ll hand it off to Teresa, who will discuss our business unit performance.

I’m pleased to give you an update on our operations.
In the second quarter, we maintained solid operating performance and continued to make progress on our goal to improve our top-line trends with all three of the business units again reporting improved year-over-year comparisons.
Additionally, both consumer and small business reported improved trends.
Solid customer demands for strategic products are providing an increasing revenue contribution in each of the units.
Total strategic revenue grew 6% compared to the year ago quarter driven by 25% growth in enterprise IP services and migration to higher broadband speeds for consumers. This compares to 5% year-over-year in the first quarter.
We also continued to maintain a disciplined focus on the bottom lines and adjusted EBITDA held steady compared to the prior year, while operating income increased 4%.
I will begin the discussion of our individual business unit performance with the business market segment on slide nine.
Business markets reported second quarter revenues of $1 billion. This was flat with both the prior year quarter and sequentially. Recurring revenue was down 1% year-over-year and flat sequentially.
In the enterprise space, we continue to see encouraging signs in customer activity. Monthly sales levels have improved and we expect to stay in this momentum. This is in part driven by a streamline quote to contract process and improved sales rep productivity.
Strategic revenues within business markets increased 9% compared to the second quarter of 2009. This is driven by strong demand for our MPLS and high capacity IP services. Strategic revenues represent over 42% of total business revenue compared to 39% a year ago. The growth in strategic revenue is offset by declines in Legacy data and local voice services.
During the quarter, we added new software as service capabilities to our suite of manage services. This portal based tool enables business customers to create and manage automated contact management applications.
In the second quarter, business market segment income of $389 million declined 2% year-over-year and 3% from the first quarter.
Segment margin for the quarter is 38.8%. Excluding the impact of one-time legal settlement, segment income and margin are in line with both the first quarter and year ago period.
In summary, we remain committed to growing the enterprise top-line and we continue to expect revenues will start to pickup as economic conditions improved. We have been very disciplined in our pursuit of profitable revenue growth and you should expect us to maintain that discipline in the quarter’s ahead.
Results for our wholesale segment are summarized on slide 10.
Segment revenue for the quarter totaled $659 million, a decline of 10% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Wholesale results also reflect an improved strategic product mix. In fact, strategic revenue now represents nearly half of total wholesale revenue at 48%. Strategic revenues grew 4% compared with the prior year, an improvement from 1% year-over-year in the first quarter.
This growth was offset by lower demand for Legacy Voice Services, including a 31% annual decline in long distance revenues. The decline was due in large part to proactively managing long distance possibility last year. The reduction of this lower margin services and strong improvements in network facility cost resulted in a 590-basis point increased in margins to 67.5%.
Our wholesale group continues to make significant progress in delivering fiber-based back call services for wireless carrier. We complete construction on fiber services for more than 600 sites and expect this to grow to approximately 2,000 sites by year end.
As a reminder, we will have modest revenues from this program this year and this initiative is expected to begin to mitigate wholesale revenue pressures over the next several quarters. Over the long run, this provides an avenue for strategic revenue growth.
Now, we’ll turn to mass markets result on slide 11. This unit achieved its first consecutive quarter of improved year-over-year revenue trends, while delivering a strong margin in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the wireless reseller transition that we completed last year, mass markets revenue for the quarter declined 6% year-over-year, and 2% sequentially.
Strategic revenues improved 6% year-over-year, while Legacy revenue declined 11% due to continued pressure on traditional local voice services. In the quarter, strategic revenue was 32% of total mass markets revenue compared to 27% a year ago.
In the second quarter, we continue to see encouraging signs in our small business unit, which reported improved revenue and access line trends. We are seeing a good take rate from our bundled services and we have plans in this channel to increase our partner distribution.
As a reminder, the small business represents about 20% of mass markets total revenue or a little more than 900 million annually. Mass market segments income of $622 million declined 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Segment margin of 53.5% improved 250 basis points compared to second quarter of last year and 50 basis points sequentially.
In the quarter, total expense has declined 13% from the second quarter of 2009, driven by fewer employees, lower bad debt and reduced wireless cost.
Our quarterly subscriber results are shown on slide 12. As expected, access line losses and broadband additions were partially impacted by seasonally in the second quarter. The 11.7% rate of access line loss is consistent with the first quarter. The absolute number of net disconnects improved by 13% compared to second quarter of 2009.
We continue to grow the revenues from customers we retain. Consumer ARPU improved during the quarter to more than $62, up 7% compared to second quarter of 2009.
We also continue to expand our Fiber to the Node footprint. Services are now available to more than 4 million residential households. In the quarter, we added 52,000 new subscribers on fiber services and we now serve more than 500,000 broadband cyber subscribers.
Fiber to the Node additions was offset by a decline in Legacy DSL. With the no DSL footprint, we are retaining existing customers at a better pace than a year ago and loss of existing customers to competition is modestly improved from a year ago. However, growth additions in our DSL footprint areas have been soft and that’s where we are focused.
We have launched a new promotional campaign with stronger introductory pricing. The campaign is focused on a full internet service, including wireless, security and technical support. Since the launch, call volumes and orders have increased measurably. It’s still early, but we are also seeing increased activity in our online ordering through Qwest.com. Our expectation is to deliver improved high-speed internet subscriber additions in the third quarter.
In the quarter, video subscriber based was flat. The seasonal influences, such as the NFL package, we expect to resume growth in the second quarter.
Our wireless business had strong performance in the quarter and reached nearly 1 million subscribers.
We increased the number of Qwest bills, Verizon wireless users by 60,000.
In closing, I am pleased with our financial results in the quarter and I believe we have the right plans in place to stimulate the growth drivers of the business. I continue to be highly confident that we will deliver improved revenue comparisons in the second half. I look forward to updating you on the next call.
Now, I’ll turn it over to Joe.

I’m pleased that we delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. The top-line trend is encouraging and we are on track to meet our revenue improvement goal in 2010.
Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion accelerated from the first quarter.
Our free cash flow generation was strong in the quarter and we continued to improve our financial flexibility.
Now, let’s start by turning to the income statement on slide 14. In the second quarter, consolidate net operating revenues of $2.9 billion declined 5% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the wireless transitions, revenues declined 4%. As Teresa noted, the improved year-over-year comparison is due to stronger results in each segment.
Second quarter revenue declined 1% sequentially. Consolidated strategic services revenue grew 6% compared to the year ago quarter. Strategic services are a larger contributor in each of our segments as we shift to fiber-based initiatives and IP solutions.
In the quarter, strategic revenue grew to 38% of total revenue, from 34% a year ago. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to the bottom line.
Total operating expenses declined 7% from the prior year. The improved operating costs are driven by our ongoing efforts to increase operating efficiency through workforce optimization, declines in facility cost volumes, reduction in bad debt and process improvement. Operating expenses increased 1% sequentially. The increase in the quarter was due to a merger related cost of 27 million.
Adjusted EBITDA was 1.1 billion for the quarter, which was flat from a year ago and down 3% from the first quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 37.3% expanded 200 basis points year-over-year. This is an improvement from the 180-basis point increase in the first quarter.
Moving on to slide 15, we continue to strengthen the balance sheet in the second quarter and improve our financial flexibility. We ended the second quarter with net debt of 11.3 billion. This is an improvement of a $1 billion from the second quarter of 2009 and nearly 400 million from first quarter.
Cash plus short-term investments held steady at 1.8 billion.
Net debt to annualize adjusted EBITDA was 2.6 times at the end of the quarter. This is the lowest leverage ratio for the company since 1999.
Last month, we launch a tender offer for 1.3 billion in convertible notes, which is scheduled to expire on August 12.
On slide 16, you will see that we have achieved 2 billion of our 3.5 billion debt reduction objective, which expect to complete in the first quarter of 2011. In total, the $3.5 billion reduction will lower our annual interest expense by 200 million and represent a 12 to 13% improvement to annual free cash flow. This also equates to $0.07 per diluted share in annual earnings or approximately 20% of our 12-month trailing EPS.
Now, let’s turn to slide 17, which shows details on adjusted free cash flow and capital expenditures. A focus on profitable revenues and diligence in re-expense management produced strong adjusted free cash flow of 609 million in the quarter. We continue to focus our capital spending on funding key broadband initiatives.
Capital expenditures were 330 million compared to 348 million in the second quarter of 2009, and 387 million last quarter.
In the quarter, DFOs improved slightly year-over-year to 38.3 days. Our collections staff continues to exceed expectations, and we saw another sequential improvement in bad debt expense.
Before I close with a discussion of our outlook, I would like to update you on our returns on invested capital on slide 18. Cumulative return on invested capital for the last 12 months improved 60 basis points compared to the previous 12 months. This reflects steady net operating profit after tax, while our asset-based declined. In fact, net TP&E is down 700 million year over year.
Now, let’s turn to our guidance on slide 19. For the near term, we continue to see a stable outlook for business markets. Revenue could begin to improve in the second half of the year, if we see improvements in the economy.
In wholesale, our goal is to continue to report improving year-over-year rates of decline. In the short run, mass markets revenue will continue to follow access line trends that are partially offset by increased ARPU from growth and high-speed Internet subscribers.
Mass markets are expected to report better revenue comparisons over the course of the year due to the declining impact from the wireless transition. And as a reminder, we will be past the comparison issues on wireless when we get to the fourth quarter.
Our goal continues to be to reduce reported year-over-year consolidated revenue declines to a low to mid-single digit rate by the fourth quarter of this year.
We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 4.3 to 4.4 billion. We expect steady to improving margins in 2010 compared to 2009. And as a reminder, we do have some seasonality in our EBITDA results due to increase network spending in warmer months.
The outlook for capital investment is 1.7 billion or less. We may use lease financing in 2010 for some portion of this capital spending as we did in 2009. Our capital spending program reflects our opportunity in fiber to the node and our continued investment in fiber to node on an integrated basis. We will maintain a keen focus on both improvement the top-line and mining operating efficiencies while balancing investment in the business to produce adjusted free cash flow of 1.5 to 1.6 billion for the full year of 2010.
As we stated last quarter, we do not expect to make any funding contributions to the pension plan in 2010. And our current expectation is that we will not have any required funding in 2011 as well. We continue to expect to pay cash taxes of approximately 2% this year.
As we noted in the CenturyLink merger announcement, it is our current expectation that we will continue to pay a quarterly dividend of 0.08 per share through the close of the transaction. The merger agreement requires the company to coordinate with CenturyLink on the dividend dates. As a result, the timing of future dividends may deviate from past dates due to this requirement.
In closing, I would like to reiterate how pleased I am with our results this quarter. We are confident that we will come continue this momentum throughout the year.
With that I’ll turn the call back over to the operator and we’ll open the line for questions.

While our broadband, for the FTTN footprint is doing very well. So, we’re very pleased with how that continues to grow, the penetration is growing there and that’s where you see the price increases, right, because as you move up in the speed, you pay more per month.
The other area that we’re having success is what we call the value add services. So, one example is the product we have called Qwest@Ease, which provides the different levels of technical support for your - in that services. We also do off-line storage for pictures or files, and so we continue to push that ARPU up by moving customers to higher speeds as well as adding value-added services onto their platform, their internet platform.

And there’s a couple of theories around that, are people going for wireless, are they just slapping broadband completely for economic reasons, but clearly in the second quarter of this year compared to last year, the moving activity is up and there’s where you see a lot of movement between all the companies, either people don’t connect to them right away - they go through a period of nothing, having no service at all or that’s where the cable companies and ourselves battle out who gets there first. So, a lot of moving activity, that’s what I would attribute that to.
As far as the FGTM (ph) footprint, you are correct. We are aggressively fighting the competition there. We plan to keep doing that. We do have some promotional short-term pricing in the market right now. But more importantly we’re really focused on expanding what you get from our internet service.

We appreciate your time and interest in what is probably going to be a very busy day for many of you. We'll begin today's call with a few comments on the quarter from Ed Mueller, our Chairman and CEO. Ed will be followed by Teresa Taylor, our COO, who will review segment results. And then Joe Euteneuer, our CFO, will conclude the prepared remarks with a discussion of our consolidated financial results and outlook. We'll then open it up for your questions.
As we begin our call, let me point you to Slide 3 and remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail in our periodic filings with the SEC, and I strongly encourage you to thoroughly review our filings. I also want to point out that we do not adopt analyst estimates, nor do we necessarily commit to updating any forward-looking statements that we will be making this morning. 
To supplement the reporting of our financial information, on our call today, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow and net debt. A full reconciliation of these measures is available on our website.
Now we'll move on to Slide 4 to touch on EPS and some special items that impacted EPS in the quarter. Our reported earnings per share for the quarter was $0.09, and that compares to $0.12 in the second quarter of 2009. Our adjusted net income this quarter also rounded to $0.09 per share. The current quarter's earnings includes a little under $0.02 charge for merger and severance expenses. This was offset by a little over $0.01 per share gain related to the change in fair value of the company's convertible debt option. 
Under the terms of our merger agreement with CenturyLink, we have committed to redeem our convertible debt and the intrinsic value of the associated option for cash. Therefore, we have reclassified the option component of the note from equity to a liability, and that's now included in the accrued expenses noted. The value of this liability at the end of the quarter was $145 million after initially being valued at $166 million at the date of the merger announcement.
Future stock price movements are likely to cause us to recognize periodic gains or losses through the redemption of the notes. These gains or losses will have no tax impact, and as a result, there could also be some variability in our effective tax rate as we go forward. Reported in adjusted earnings include dilution from non-cash pension and OPEB expenses. In the current quarter, this dilution was $0.01 per share, and in the year-ago period, we had an impact of $0.02 per share. Now I'm going to turn it over to Ed."

I want to begin by saying I'm very pleased with our continued execution and performance in the quarter. In light of continued challenging market conditions, we reported expanded margins and improved year-over-year revenue trends across all segments, and we generated strong cash flow. Our performance in the quarter is a demonstration of the sharp focus we have on our key strategies to drive the top line while maintaining disciplined expense management to improve operating efficiencies. We delivered on key initiatives and continue to see solid growth in our strategic revenues while we aggressively pursue broadband-based services. 
In the quarter, Qwest further strengthened its financial flexibility by improving the balance sheet. We launched a tender offer for our convertible debt, and we are well on our way to achieving our stated debt reduction objectives.
In addition, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making toward completion of our merger with CenturyLink. The senior leadership team for the combined company has been named, and activities are underway in the planning process for the integration of the two companies. Each of the named leaders is appointed an integration lead who will focus on the planning process for every functional organization. There are 10 integration leads in total. 
To ensure input and insights are captured from both companies, about half of the leads are from Qwest, and about half were from CenturyLink. We have reached several key milestones in the approval process with various agencies and commissions required to review the transaction. We have received approvals in six states. In addition to the FCC [Federal Communications Commission], we have 16 states remaining to review and approve the transaction. In July, we received clearance from the Department of Justice, and CenturyLink filed the final joint proxy statement with the SEC. The special meeting to vote on the transaction will be held on August 24.
To sum up, we had solid execution in the quarter despite a soft economy and highly competitive markets. Our results over the past several quarters demonstrate our ability to overcome these challenges. I'm very confident that we are on track to deliver on our key strategies throughout the remainder of the year. We will continue to drive top line results while increasing cost efficiency and productivity. 
I'm excited about the prospects that will arise from the combination of Qwest and CenturyLink. In addition to owning a stake in a stronger competitor, Qwest shareholders will benefit from significant synergies of substantial increase in dividends, accelerating deleveraging of the balance sheet, a strong management team and a talented employee base. I am convinced this transaction will further bolster our results and drive superior shareholder value.
Now I'll hand it off to Teresa who will discuss our business unit performance."
339972,108918124,72113,"Qwest Communications International Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-04-2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Qwest Communications International, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to give you an update on our operations. In the second quarter, we maintained solid operating performance and continued to make progress on our goal to improve our top line trends, with all three of t",1197,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to give you an update on our operations. In the second quarter, we maintained solid operating performance and continued to make progress on our goal to improve our top line trends, with all three of the business units again reporting improved year-over-year comparisons. Additionally, both consumer and small business reported improved trends. 
Solid customer demand for strategic products is providing an increasing revenue contribution in each of the units. Total strategic revenue grew 6% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by 25% growth in enterprise IP services and migration to higher broadband speeds for consumers. This compares to 5% year-over-year growth in the first quarter. We also continue to maintain a disciplined focus on the bottom line, and adjusted EBITDA held steady compared to the prior year while operating income increased 4%.
I will begin the discussion of our individual business unit performance with the Business Markets segment on Slide 9. Business Markets reported second quarter revenues of $1 billion. This was flat with both the prior-year quarter and sequentially. Recurring revenue was down 1% year-over-year and flat sequentially. In the enterprise space, we continue to see encouraging signs in customer activity. Monthly sales levels have improved, and we expect to sustain this momentum. This is in part driven by a streamlined quote-to-contract process and improved sales rep productivity. 
Strategic revenues within Business Markets increased 9% compared to the second quarter of 2009. This was driven by strong demand for our MPLS and high-capacity IP services. Strategic revenues represent over 42% of total business revenue compared to 39% a year ago. The growth in strategic revenues was offset by declines in legacy data and local voice services. 
During the quarter, we added a new software to service capability to our suite of managed services. This portal-based tool enables business customers to create and manage automated contact management applications. In the second quarter, Business Markets segment income of $389 million declined 2% year-over-year and 3% from the first quarter. Segment margin for the quarter is 38.8%. Excluding the impact of a one-time legal settlement, segment income and margin are in line with both the first quarter and year-ago period. 
In summary, we remain committed to growing the enterprise top line, and we continue to expect revenues will start to pick up as economic conditions improve. We have been very disciplined in our pursuit of profitable revenue growth, and you should expect us to maintain that discipline in the quarters ahead.
Results for our Wholesale segment are summarized on Slide 10. Segment revenue for the quarter totaled $659 million, a decline of 10% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Wholesale results also reflect an improved strategic product mix. In fact, strategic revenue now represents nearly half of total Wholesale revenue at 48%. Strategic revenues grew 4% compared with the prior year, an improvement from 1% year-over-year growth in the first quarter. 
This growth was offset by lower demand for legacy voice services, including a 31% annual decline in long-distance revenues. The decline was due in large part to proactively managing long-distance profitability last year. The reduction of these lower margin services and strong improvements in network facility costs resulted in a 590-basis-point increase in margin to 67.5%. 
Our Wholesale group continues to make significant progress in delivering fiber-based backhaul services for wireless carriers. We complete construction of fiber services for more than 600 sites and expect this to grow to approximately 2,000 sites by year end. As a reminder, we will have modest revenues from this program this year, and this initiative is expected to begin to mitigate Wholesale revenue pressures over the next several quarters. Over the long run, this provides an avenue for strategic revenue growth.
Now, we'll turn to Mass Markets results on Slide 11. This unit achieved its third consecutive quarter of improved year-over-year revenue trends while delivering a strong margin in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the wireless reseller transition we completed last year, Mass Markets revenue for the quarter declined 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Strategic revenues improved 6% year-over-year while legacy revenue declined 11% due to continued pressure on traditional local voice services. In the quarter, strategic revenue was 32% of total Mass Markets revenue compared to 27% a year ago.
In the second quarter, we continued to see encouraging signs in our Small Business unit, which reported improved revenue and access line trends. We are seeing a good take rate from our bundled services, and we have plans in this channel to increase our partner distribution. As a reminder, Small Business represents about 20% of Mass Markets total revenue or a little more than $900 million annually.
Mass Markets segment income of $622 million declined 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Segment margin of 53.5% improved 250 basis points compared to second quarter last year and 50 basis points sequentially. In the quarter, total expenses declined 13% from the second quarter of 2009, driven by fewer employees, lower bad debt and reduced wireless costs.
Our quarterly subscriber results are shown on Slide 12. As expected, access line losses and broadband additions were partially impacted by seasonality in the second quarter. The 11.7% rate of access line loss is consistent with the first quarter. The absolute number of net disconnects improved by 13% compared to second quarter of 2009. We continue to grow the revenues from customers we retain. Consumer ARPU improved during the quarter to more than $62, up 7% compared to second quarter of 2009. 
We also continue to expand our Fiber-to-the-Node footprint. Services are now available to more than 4 million residential households. In the quarter, we added 52,000 new subscribers on fiber services, and we now serve more than 500,000 broadband fiber subscribers. Fiber-to-the-Node additions were offset by a decline in legacy DSL. Within our DSL footprint, we are retaining existing customers at a better pace than a year ago, and loss of existing customers to competition is modestly improved from a year ago. However, gross additions in our DSL footprint areas have been soft, and that's where we are focused.
We have launched a new promotional campaign with stronger introductory pricing. The campaign is focused on a full Internet service, including wireless, security and technical support. Since the launch, call volumes and orders have increased measurably. It's still early, but we are also seeing increased activity in our online ordering through qwest.com. Our expectation is to deliver improved High-Speed Internet subscriber additions in the third quarter.
In the quarter, video subscriber base was flat. The seasonal influences, such as the NFL package, we expect to resume growth in the second quarter. 
Our Wireless business had strong performance in the quarter and reached nearly 1 million subscribers. We increased the number of Qwest-billed Verizon wireless users by 60,000.
In closing, I'm pleased with our financial results in the quarter, and I believe we have the right plans in place to stimulate the growth drivers of the business. I continue to be highly confident that we will deliver improved revenue comparisons in the second half. I look forward to updating you on the next call. Now I'll turn it over to Joe."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased that we delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. The top line trend is encouraging, and we are on track to meet our revenue improvement goal in 2010.",1085,"Thanks, Teresa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased that we delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. The top line trend is encouraging, and we are on track to meet our revenue improvement goal in 2010. Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion accelerated from the first quarter. Our free cash flow generation was strong in the quarter, and we continued to improve our financial flexibility. 
Now let's start by turning to the income statement on Slide 14. In the second quarter, consolidated net operating revenues of $2.9 billion declined 5% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the wireless transition, revenues declined 4%. 
As Teresa noted, the improved year-over-year comparison is due to stronger results in each segment. Second quarter revenue declined 1% sequentially. Consolidated strategic services revenue grew 6% compared to the year-ago quarter. Strategic services are a larger contributor in each of our segments as we shift to fiber-based initiatives and IP solutions. In the quarter, strategic revenue grew to 38% of total revenue from 34% a year ago.
We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to the bottom line. Total operating expenses declined 7% from the prior year. The improved operating costs are driven by our ongoing efforts to increase operating efficiency through workforce optimization, declines in facility cost volumes, reductions in bad debt and process improvements. Operating expenses increased 1% sequentially. The increase in the quarter was due to a merger-related cost of $27 million.
Adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion for the quarter, which was flat from a year ago and down 3% from the first quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 37.3% expanded 200 basis points year-over-year. This is an improvement from the 180-basis-point increase in the first quarter.
Moving on to Slide 15, we continued to strengthen the balance sheet in the second quarter and improved our financial flexibility. We ended the second quarter with net debt of $11.3 billion. This is an improvement of $1 billion from the second quarter of 2009 and nearly $400 million from the first quarter. Cash plus short-term investments held steady at $1.8 billion. Net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA was 2.6x at the end of the quarter. This is the lowest leverage ratio for the company since 1999. Last month, we launched a tender offer for $1.3 billion in convertible notes, which is scheduled to expire on August 12.
On Slide 16, you will see that we have achieved $2 billion of our $3.5 billion debt reduction objective, which we expect to complete in the first quarter of 2011. In total, the $3.5 billion reduction will lower our annual interest expense by $200 million and represent a 12% to 13% improvement to annual free cash flow. This also equates to $0.07 per diluted share in annual earnings or approximately 20% of our 12-month trailing EPS.
Now let's turn to Slide 17, which shows details on adjusted free cash flow and capital expenditures. Our focus on profitable revenues and diligence in expense management produced strong adjusted free cash flow of $609 million in the quarter. We continue to focus our capital spending on funding key broadband initiatives. Capital expenditures were $330 million compared to $348 million in the second quarter of 2009 and $387 million last quarter. In the quarter, DSOs improved slightly year-over-year to 38.3 days. Our collection staff continues to exceed expectations, and we saw another sequential improvement in bad debt expense.
Before I close with a discussion of our outlook, I would like to update you on our returns on invested capital on Slide 18. Cumulative return on invested capital for the last 12 months improved 60 basis points compared to the previous 12 months. This reflects steady net operating profit after tax while our asset base declined. In fact, net PP&E is down $700 million year-over-year.
Now let's turn to our guidance on Slide 19. For the near term, we continue to see a stable outlook for Business Markets. Revenue could begin to improve in the second half of the year if we see improvements in the economy. In Wholesale, our goal is to continue to report improving year-over-year rates of decline. In the short run, Mass Markets revenue will continue to follow access line trends that are partially offset by increased ARPU from growth in High-Speed Internet subscribers. Mass Markets is expected to report better revenue comparisons over the course of the year due to the declining impact from the wireless transition. And as a reminder, we will be past the comparison issues on wireless when we get to the fourth quarter. 
Our goal continues to be to reduce reported year-over-year consolidated revenue declines to a low- to mid-single-digit rate by the fourth quarter of this year. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion. We expect steady to improving margins in 2010 compared to 2009. And as a reminder, we do have some seasonality in our EBITDA results due to increased network spending in warmer months.
The outlook for capital investment is $1.7 billion or less. We may use lease financing in 2010 for some portion of this capital spending as we did in 2009. Our capital spending program reflects our opportunity in Fiber-to-the-Cell and our continued investment in Fiber-to-the-Node on an integrated basis. We will maintain a keen focus on both improving the top line and mining operating efficiencies while balancing investment in the business to produce adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion for the full year of 2010. 
As we stated last quarter, we do not expect to make any funding contributions to the pension plan in 2010. And our current expectation is that we will not have any required funding in 2011 as well. We continue to expect to pay cash taxes of approximately 2% this year. 
As we noted in the CenturyLink merger announcement, it is our current expectation that we will continue to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share through the close of the transaction. The merger agreement requires the company to coordinate with CenturyLink on the dividend dates. As a result, the timing of future dividends may deviate from past dates due to this requirement.
In closing, I'd like to reiterate how pleased I am with our results this quarter. We are confident that we will continue this momentum throughout the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll open the line for questions."

While our broadband, for the FTTN footprint, is doing very well. So we're very pleased with how that continues to grow. The penetration is growing there, and that's where you see the price increases, right? Because if you move up in the speed, you're paying more per month. The other area that we're having success is what we call the value-added services. So one example is the product we have called Qwest @Ease, which provides you different levels of technical support for your Internet services. We also do offline storage for pictures and files.

And that's where you see a lot of movement between all the companies, because people don't connect the damn right away. They go through a period of nothing, having no service at all, or that's for the cable companies and ourselves, battle it up to who gets there first. So a lot of moving activities that I would attribute that to. As far as the FTTN footprint, you are correct. We are aggressively fighting the competition, and we plan to keep doing that. We do have some promotional short-term pricing in the market right now. But more importantly, we're really focused on expanding what you get from our Internet service.

And if you look at the top line results, our churn performance is some of the best we've ever had, and it's really focused now on trying to get that next new customer while we continue to try to grow the ARPU of the existing customers."

And then Joe Euteneuer, our CFO, will conclude the prepared remarks with the discussion of our consolidated financial results and outlook. We will then open it up for your questions.
I want to point you to Slide 3 and remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail in our periodic filings with the SEC, and I strongly encourage you to thoroughly review our filings. I also want to note that we do not adopt analyst estimates, nor do we necessarily commit to updating any forward-looking statements that we will be making this morning.
To supplement the reporting of our financial information, on our call today, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow and net debt. A full reconciliation of these measures is available on our website.
Now we'll move on to Slide 4 and touch on EPS and some special items that impacted EPS in the quarter. Our reported loss per share for the quarter was $0.05, and that compares to earnings per share of $0.08 in the third quarter of 2009. The current quarter includes a $0.13 charge related to the option on the convertible notes, a $0.02 charge for severance and realignment expense and a $0.01 charge for a one-time adjustment related to USF [Universal Service Fund] fees. 
Excluding special items, earnings per share were $0.11 in the third quarter, that's a 22% improvement compared to $0.09 in the year ago quarter, as well as the second quarter of this year. Reported in adjusted earnings include dilution from non-cash pension OPEB expense. In the current quarter, the dilution was $0.01 and in the year ago period, we had an impact of $0.02. 
As a reminder, under the terms of the merger agreement with CenturyLink, we have committed to redeem our convertible debt and the value of the associated conversion rights for cash. Therefore, we previously reclassified the option component of the note from equity to a liability, which is included in accrued expense and other. The value of this liability at the end of the quarter was $349 million after initially being valued at $165 million on the date of the merger announcement. 
As a result of strong stock price appreciation during the third quarter, we reported a pre- and post-tax charge in the current period of $229 million to recognize the higher value of the option component of the convert. We have continued to see strong price appreciation in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we may have another charge when we report fourth quarter earnings. We'll be paying off the convertible principal and the value of the option in the fourth quarter.
With that, I'll now going to turn it over to Ed."

I want to begin by saying, I'm very pleased with our execution and results we delivered in the quarter despite continued market challenges. We reported improved sequential and year-over-year revenue trends, expanded margins and we generated strong cash flow.
In addition, we reported a number of significant achievements for the company this quarter, including record-high margins and record-low debt levels. I'm also very proud of the recognition we received during the quarter for customer service awards in both the enterprise and the wholesale units. Our performance is a strong evidence of the focus we have on our strategies to drive the top line while maintaining disciplined expense management to improving operating efficiencies.
We continue to see strong growth in our strategic revenues while we aggressively pursue fiber-based broadband services. We experienced a rebound to growth in subscriber additions, driven by demand for high-speed services, launch of a new marketing campaign and seasonal benefits. We also continued to strengthen our financial flexibility by improving the balance sheet. Our progress was recognized by a rating agency upgrade in August to investment grade. 
During the quarter, we announced plans to call our convertible debt, which totals $1.1 billion in principal and are well on the path to achieve our stated debt reduction goals. In addition, I'm very happy with the progress we're making toward the completion of our merger with CenturyLink. The senior leadership team for the combined company has been named. The second-tier team was also recently announced. Activities are well underway in the planning process for the integration of the two companies. We have reached several key milestones in the approval process, including overwhelming support from both company shareholders.
Last month, our unions agreed that the merger is in the public interest, and withdrew all opposition. We continue to make progress with various agencies and commissions required to review the transaction. To date, we've received approvals in 12 states. In addition to the SEC, we have 10 states remaining to review and approve the transaction.
To sum up, we've had a solid execution in the quarter, and we're well on the path to achieve our stated objectives. We are confident we will continue to execute for the remainder of the year. As a result, we are raising our revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow outlook to the top end of the 2010 guidance. Joe will provide you with the details.
We continue to expect our merger with CenturyLink to close in the first half of 2011. We're excited about the prospects that will rise from the combination of our two companies. Our respective shareholders have already benefited from the operating and stock performance of the two companies since our announcement.
Looking ahead, Qwest shareholders will benefit from significant synergies, a nearly 50% increase in dividends from today's level, accelerated deleveraging of balance sheet, a strong management team and a talented employee base. I remain firmly convinced this transaction will further bolster our results and drive superior shareholder value. 
Now I'll hand it off to Teresa, who will discuss our business unit performance."

I'm very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Under challenging market conditions, we continue to deliver on our goal to improve the top line trend. In the quarter, all three segments again reported",1304,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Under challenging market conditions, we continue to deliver on our goal to improve the top line trend. In the quarter, all three segments again reported improved revenue trends on both the sequential and year-over-year basis. We achieved solid subscriber additions on our fiber-to-the-node network, maintained steady performance in Business Markets and improved top line trends in Wholesale.
Solid customer demand for strategic products continue to provide an increasing revenue contribution in each of the units. Total strategic revenue grew 8% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by 24% growth in enterprise IP services and growth in residential fiber-based services. This compares to 6% year-over-year growth in the second quarter.
Legacy revenue losses improved substantially in the quarter as well. Sequentially, legacy revenue was down 1% in the quarter compared with 4% last quarter.
We also continue to maintain a disciplined focus on the bottom line. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income both increased nearly 3% compared to the prior year. And we'll begin the discussion of our individual business unit performance with the Business Market segment on Slide 9. 
Business Markets reported third quarter revenues of $1 million. This is flat with the prior year quarter and up 2% sequentially. Recurring revenue held steady in the quarter, both annually and sequentially. Similar to the 2009 trend, we did see sequential growth in data integration in the quarter.
In the Enterprise space, we continue to see encouraging signs in customer activity and steadily increasing sales level. This segment also benefited from improved sales rep productivity and strong customer retention. Strategic revenue in Business Markets now exceed the legacy revenue for the first time since we began reporting this mix. Strategic revenues increased 9% compared to the third quarter of 2009. This was driven by a continued strong demand for our MPLS [Multiprotocol Label Switching] and high-capacity IP services. The growth in strategic revenues was offset by a 7% decline in legacy data and local voice services.
During the quarter, Qwest was a recipient for the third consecutive year of the prestigious Nemertes PilotHouse Award and cited top provider of carrier Internet services. Qwest outperformed every other market challenger in most categories, achieving top ratings for customer service and overall value. 
In the third quarter, Business Markets segment income of $415 million increased 4% year-over-year and 7% from the second quarter. The improvement in the quarter is driven by improved sales productivity and a one-time legal settlement in the second quarter. Segment margin for the quarter expanded 140 basis points annually and 190 basis points sequentially to 40.7%.
In summary, we are encouraged by the increased activity and positive new sales momentum. We continue to expect revenues will start to pick up as economic conditions improve. 
Results for our Wholesale segment are summarized on Slide 10. During the quarter, our Wholesale unit also received strong honors. For the 10th consecutive time, Atlantic-ACM recognized Qwest for best-in-class customer service, provisioning, network performance and billing in the ILEC [Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier] category, as well as best in class across all carriers for data value.
For the first time in more than three years, Wholesale revenue held steady sequentially. Wholesale segment revenue for the quarter totaled $661 million, a decline of 8% year-over-year. Wholesale is benefiting from an improved strategic product mix that now represents 49% of total segment revenue. 
Strategic revenues grew 6% compared with the prior year and 2% in the second quarter. This growth is being offset by declines in legacy voice services. However, legacy voice losses improved in the quarter as we saw less intense pressure in long distance and grooming efforts. Legacy revenues were down 1% sequentially, which is a marked improvement from the 8% decline last quarter. The improved mix and demand for strategic services resulted in a 480 basis point increase in margin to 67.8%. 
Our Wholesale group continues to make significant progress in delivering fiber-based backhaul services for wireless carriers. We have completed construction and began billing on fiber services for more than 1,000 sites, and we continue to expect this to grow to about 2,000 sites by year end. 
As a reminder, we will have modest revenues from this program this year, and this initiative is expected to help mitigate Wholesale revenue pressures over the next several quarters. For the long run, this provides an avenue for strategic revenue growth. 
Now let's turn to Mass Markets results on Slide 11. This unit achieved its fourth consecutive quarter of improved year-over-year revenue trend. Excluding the impact of the wireless reseller transition that was completed last year, Mass Markets revenue for the quarter declined 3% year-over-year and held steady sequentially. Within Mass Markets, strategic revenues increased to 33% of segment revenue compared to 28% a year ago. Strategic revenues improved 10% year-over-year while legacy revenue declined 9% due to continued pressure on traditional local voice services.
Consumer voice revenue now represents less than 20% of total consolidated revenue. In the third quarter, the company's High-Speed Internet marketing campaign achieved good success. We also experienced a stronger contribution from our Small business unit, which reported improved revenue trends, driven mainly by pricing action. As a reminder, Small Business represents about 20% of Mass Markets' total revenue or a little more than $900 million annually. 
In the quarter, total expenses declined 9% in the third quarter of 2009 due to fewer employees, reduced wireless costs and lower sales and marketing expense. Mass Markets segment income of $617 million declined 1% year-over-year and sequentially. Segment margin of 53% improved to 190 basis points compared to the third quarter last year and declined 50 basis points sequentially. 
Our quarterly subscribers results are shown on Slide 12. The number and rate of consumer and small business voice access line loss in the quarter improved on a year-over-year basis and held steady with the second quarter. We continue to grow the revenues from customers we retained. Consumer ARPU improved during the quarter to $65, up 10% compared to the third quarter of 2009. The improvement was driven by growth in broadband, wireless and video users. And a higher speed mix was in our broadband customer base. 
We continue to expand our fiber-to-the-node footprint. Services are now available to approximately 4.5 million residential households. In the quarter, we added 92,000 new subscribers on fiber services. And we now serve 620,000 broadband fiber subscribers. At the end of the quarter in 2009, fiber-based customers numbered just 330,000. Fiber-to-the-node additions in the quarter were offset by a 52,000 subscriber decline in traditional ATM-based DSL. 
As I mentioned, we are pleased with the response we are seeing from the launch of our new High-Speed Internet promotional campaign during the quarter. The campaign is focused on full Internet service and includes wireless, security, and technical support. Following the launch, call volumes of orders increased measurably. We also saw increased activity in online ordering through qwest.com. And finally, we benefited sequentially from positive seasonal influences in the third quarter.
In the quarter, video subscribers increased 12,000 to 963,000. This growth was also aided by seasonal influences such as the NFL package. Our Wireless business continued to have a strong performance in the quarter and now exceeds 1 million subscribers. The increase in number of Qwest-billed Verizon Wireless users by 62,000. 
In closing, I'm pleased with the momentum we saw in the third quarter. We delivered solid operational results and improved top line performance across all segments. We achieved this while maintaining a sharp focus on expense management and disciplined investments. I am confident we will continue to deliver solid results as we complete the remainder of the year. I look forward to updating you on our next call.
And now I'll turn it over to Joe."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In third quarter, we again delivered another quarter of strong operating and financial performance. We met our goal of reducing the rate of loss of revenue to a low-single digi",1190,"Thank you, Teresa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In third quarter, we again delivered another quarter of strong operating and financial performance. We met our goal of reducing the rate of loss of revenue to a low-single digit rate of decline, a quarter ahead of schedule.
Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 38.2%. This represents another record margin for Qwest. We generated strong free cash flow in the quarter, and we continued to improve our financial flexibility.
Now let's start by turning to the income statement on Slide 14. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues of $2.9 billion were flat sequentially for the first time in eight quarters and declined 4% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the wireless transition, revenues only declined 3% versus the prior year. As Teresa noted, the improved year-over-year comparison is due to stronger results in each segment. Consolidated strategic services revenue grew 8% compared to the year ago quarter. Strategic services are a larger contributor in each of our segments, mainly due to higher demand for fiber-based broadband services and IP solutions. In the quarter, strategic revenue grew to 39% of total revenue from 34% a year ago.
In addition to revenue performance improvements, we continue to maintain a disciplined focus on the bottom line. Total operating expenses improved 5% from the prior year. The improved operating costs are driven by our ongoing efforts to increase operating efficiency and productivity through balancing work force to workload, process improvements and reductions in network facility costs. 
Operating expenses increased 1% sequentially. The increase in the quarter was primarily due to realignment and severance cost of $51 million and a one-time adjustment related to USF fees of $15 million. Without the special items, expenses improved 1% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion for the quarter increased 3% from the year ago period and nearly 3% from the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 38.2% expanded 240 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially.
Moving on to Slide 15. We continued to strengthen the balance sheet in the third quarter and improve our financial flexibility. We ended the third quarter with net debt of $11 billion. This is a decline of $1 billion from the third quarter of 2009 and nearly $300 million from the second quarter. Cash increased in the quarter to $2 billion. Net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA was 2.5x at the end of the quarter. This is another significant achievement and the lowest leverage ratio for the company since 1999.
Last month, we announced plans to redeem all of the company's convertible notes. Approximately $1.1 billion in principal is outstanding after tendering for $147 million in August. We are well down the path to achieve our $3.5 billion stated debt reduction by February 2011.
Now let's turn to Slide 16, which shows the details on adjusted free cash flow and capital expenditures. An improved revenue mix and continued diligence on expenses produced strong adjusted free cash flow of $554 million in the quarter. We continue to focus our capital spending on funding key fiber-based broadband initiatives. Capital expenditures were $373 million compared with $340 million in the third quarter of 2009 and $330 million last quarter.
In the quarter, our DSO of 38.6 days improved one full day compared to the year ago period. Our collections staff continues to execute very well. We achieved a 14% year-over-year improvement in bad debt expense, and bad debt is now less than 1% of total revenue.
Before I close with the discussion of our outlook, I would like to update you on our returns on invested capital on Slide 17. Cumulative return on invested capital for the last 12 months improved 60 basis points compared to the previous 12 months. This reflects steady net operating profit after tax while our asset base declined. In fact, net PP&E is down $570 million year-over-year. With our current returns, we are earning above our internal estimate for our cost of capital and as you can see, the gap is improving.
Now let's turn to our guidance on Slide 18. For the near term, we continue to see a stable outlook for Business Markets. We expect to see enterprise revenue improve as the economy recovers. In Wholesale, we are pleased with the steady top line trends in the quarter. Our goal is to continue to stabilize the top line sequentially and to report improving year-over-year rates of decline. In the fourth quarter, we expect Mass Markets to report a low-single digit sequential decline. As Ed mentioned, we are raising our outlook overall for the year. We now expect consolidated revenues to decline at a low-single digit annual rate of decline in the fourth quarter, similar to what we achieved this quarter, one quarter ahead of schedule.
We also expect adjusted EBITDA to be at the high end of the range for the year of approximately $4.4 billion. We continue to expect capital investment of approximately $1.7 billion, with about $115 million of the investment to be financed by leasing. Our capital spending program reflects our focus on Fiber-to-the-Cell opportunities and our continued investment in fiber-to-the-node on an integrated basis.
Free cash flow for the year is now expected to be $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion with the benefit of the capital leasing activities. Without the benefit of the capital leasing activities, free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion.
As we stated last quarter regarding the pension, we do not expect to make any funding contributions to the pension plan in 2010. And our current expectation is that we will not have any required funding in 2011 as well.
Regarding taxes, we continue to expect to pay cash taxes of approximately 2% this year. As I mentioned, we will redeem our convert in the fourth quarter. In addition, we plan to make a cash payment for the premium over the option strike price. The amount of this payment will depend on the future stock price. If you were to assume all holders convert with a stock price of $6.67, which was yesterday's close, this value would be approximately $450 million.
Returning value to shareholders remains a priority, and we made a dividend payment of $0.08 per share or $139 million in the third quarter. And on October 21, the company announced an $0.08 per share dividend to be paid in the fourth quarter as well.
As we noted in the CenturyLink merger announcement, it is our current expectation that we will continue to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share through the close of the transaction. The merger agreement requires the company to coordinate with CenturyLink on dividend dates. As a result, the timing of future dividends may deviate from past dates due to this requirement.
In closing, I'd like to reiterate how pleased I am with our results this quarter. We are confident that we will continue this momentum as we close out the year. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll open the lines for questions."

And given the results that you guys have put up, is this something we should expect maybe an accelerated pace of build-outs heading into 2011?"

We look to what additional homes we can get, et cetera. So we're far more cost effective in the deployment of our capital than we've ever been before, and the good news is we did get a few extra homes out of it. But we will continue our disciplined approach of approximately 1 million homes a year and stay on that schedule. So if we are able to get a few more homes as a result of the employment of Fiber-to-the-Cell, we'll take advantage of it. In regards to your EBITDA question, remember, going into the fourth quarter, we have sort of the seasonal decline. As you're coming off, Business Markets sales start closing up for the November and December point. Some of the seasonal expenses we get out of our repairs and maintenance maybe pushing a little bit into the fourth quarter. But overall, we are still very much on track to deliver the high end of that range and have a consistent performance without any bumps in the night."

And then in the wholesale space, we're really just -- that grooming thing seems to slowdown. We've reached the point where all the carriers are where they want to be on their private line.

Good morning everybody and welcome to our call. We’re going to begin the call today with comments on the quarter from Ed Mueller, our Chairman and CEO, and then Ed will be followed by Teresa Taylor, our COO, who will review segment results, and then Joe Euteneuer, our CFO, will conclude the prepared remarks with a discussion of our consolidated financial results and outlook. We’ll then open it up for your questions.
I want to point you to slide #3 and remind everyone that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail in our periodic filings with the SEC, and I strongly encourage you to thoroughly review our filings.
I also want to note that we do not adopt analyst estimates, nor do we necessarily commit to updating any forward-looking statements that we will be making this morning.
To supplement the reporting of our financial information, on our call today, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow and net debt. A full reconciliation of these measures is available on our Web site.
Now, we’ll move on to slide four and touch on EPS and some special items that impacted EPS in the quarter. Our reported loss per share for the quarter was $0.05 and that compares to earnings per share of $0.08 in the third quarter of 2009. The current quarter includes a $0.13 charge related to the option on the convertible notes, a $0.02 charge for severance and realignment expense and $0.01 charge for one-time adjustment related to USF fees.
Excluding special items, earnings per share were $0.11 in the third quarter and that’s a 22% improvement compared to $0.09 in the year ago quarter as well as the second quarter of this year. Reported and adjusted earnings include dilution from non-cash pension and OPEB expense. In the current quarter, the dilution was $0.01, and in the year-ago period, we had an impact of $0.02.
As a reminder, under the terms of the merger agreement with CenturyLink, we have committed to redeem our convertible debt and the value of the associated conversion rights for cash.
Therefore, we previously reclassified the option component of the note from equity to a liability, which is included in accrued expenses and other. The value of this liability at the end of the quarter was $349 million after initially being valued at $165 million on the date of the merger announcement.
As a result of strong stock price appreciation during the third quarter, we reported a pre and post-tax charge in the current period of $229 million to recognize the higher value of the option component of the convert.
We continue to see strong price appreciation in the fourth quarter, and as a result, we may have another charge when we report fourth quarter earnings. We’ll be paying-off the convertible principal and to value of the option in the fourth quarter.
With that, I’m now going to turn it over to Ed.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I want to begin by saying I’m very pleased with our execution and the results we delivered in the quarter despite continued market challenges.
We reported improved sequential and year-over-year revenue trends, expanded margins, and we generated strong cash flow. In addition, we reported a number of significant achievements for the company this quarter, including record high margins and record low debt levels.
I’m also very proud of the recognition we received during the quarter for customer service awards in both the enterprise and wholesale units. Our performance is strong evidence of the focus we have on our strategies to drive the top line while maintaining disciplined expense management to improving operating efficiencies.
We continue to see strong growth in our strategic revenues while we aggressively pursue fiber-based broadband services. We experienced a rebound to growth and subscriber additions, driven by demand for high-speed services, the launch of a new marketing campaign and seasonal benefits.
We also continue to strengthen our financial flexibility by improving the balance sheet. Our progress was recognized by a rating agency upgrade in August to investment grade. During the quarter, we announced plans to call our convertible debt which totals $1.1 billion in principal and are well on the path to achieve our stated debt reduction goals.
In addition, I’m very happy with the progress we are making towards the completion of our merger with CenturyLink. The senior leadership team for the combined company has been named. The second tier team was also recently announced. Activities are well underway in the planning process for the integration of the two companies.
We have reached several key milestones in the approval process, including overwhelming support from both companies’ shareholders. Last month, our unions agreed that the merger is in the public interest and withdrew all opposition.
We continue to make progress with various agencies and commissions required to review the transaction. To-date, we have received approvals in 12 states. In addition to the SEC, we have 10 states remaining to review and to approve the transaction.
To sum up, we have had a solid execution in the quarter and we are well on the path to achieve our stated objectives. We are confident we will continue to execute for the remainder of the year. As a result, we are raising our revenue EBITDA and free cash flow outlook at the top end of the 2010 guidance. Joe, will provide you with the details.
We continue to expect our merger with CenturyLink to close in the first half of 2011. We are excited about the prospects that will rise from the combination of our two companies. Our respected shareholders have already benefited from the operating and stock performance of the two companies since our announcement.
Looking ahead, Qwest shareholders will benefit from significant synergies and nearly 50% increase in dividends from today’s level accelerated deleveraging the balance sheet, a strong management team and a talented employee base. I remain firmly convinced this transaction will further bolster our results and drive superior shareholder value.
Now, I’ll hand it off to Teresa, who will discuss our business unit performance.

I am very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Under challenging market conditions, we continue to deliver on our goal to improve the top line trend. In the quarter, all three segments again reporte",1285,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I am very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Under challenging market conditions, we continue to deliver on our goal to improve the top line trend. In the quarter, all three segments again reported improved revenue trends on both the sequential and year-over-year bases.
We achieved solid subscriber additions on our fiber-to-the-node network, maintained steady performance in business markets and improved top line trends in Wholesale.
Solid customer demand for strategic products continued to provide an increasing revenue contribution in each of the unit. Total strategic revenue grew 8% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by 24% growth in enterprise IP services and growth in residential fiber-based services. This compares to 6% year-over-year growth in the second quarter.
Legacy revenue losses improved substantially in the quarter as well. Sequentially, legacy revenue was down 1% in the quarter compared with 4% last quarter. We also continue to maintain a disciplined focus on the bottom line. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income both increased nearly 3% compared to the prior year.
I will begin the discussion of our individual business unit performance with the Business Markets segment on Slide #9. Business Markets reported third quarter revenues of $1 billion. This was flat with the prior year quarter and up 2% sequentially.
Recurring revenue held steady in the quarter both annually and sequentially. Similar to the 2009 trend, we did see sequential growth in data integration in the quarter.
In the enterprise space, we continue to see encouraging signs in customer activity and steadily increasing sales level. This segment also benefited from improved sales rep productivity and strong customer retention.
Strategic revenues in Business Markets now exceed legacy revenues for the first time since we began reported this mix. Strategic revenues increased 9% compared to the third quarter of 2009. This was driven by continued strong demand for our MPLS and high-capacity IP services. The growth in strategic revenues was offset by a 7% decline in legacy data and local voice services.
During the quarter, Qwest was a recipient for the third consecutive year of the prestigious Nemertes, PilotHouse Award and cited as Top Provider of Carrier Ethernet Services. Qwest outperformed every other market challenger in most categories achieving top ratings for customer service and overall value.
In the third quarter, Business Markets segment income of $415 million increased 4% year-over-year and 7% from the second quarter. The improvement in the quarter is driven by improved sales productivity and one-time legal settlements in the second quarter. Segment margin for the quarter expanded 140 basis points annually and 190 basis points sequentially to 40.7%.
In summary, we are encouraged by the increased activity and positive new sales momentum. We continue to expect revenues will start to pick up with economic conditions improve.
Results for our Wholesale segment are summarized on Slide #10. During the quarter, our Wholesale unit also received strong honor. For the 10th consecutive time, ATLANTIC-ACM recognized Qwest for best-in-class customer service, provisioning, network performance and billing in the ILEC categories as well as best-in-class across all carriers for data value.
For the first time in more than three years, Wholesale revenue held steady sequentially. Wholesale segment revenue for the quarter totaled $661 million, a decline of 8% year-over-year. Wholesale is benefiting from an improved strategic product mix that now represents 49% of total segment revenue.
Strategic revenues grew 6% compared with the prior year and 2% in the second quarter. This growth has been offset by declines in legacy voice services. However, legacy voice losses improved in the quarter as we saw less intense pressure in long distance grooming efforts.
Legacy revenues were down 1% sequentially which is a marked improvement from the 8% decline last quarter. The improved mix and demand for strategic services resulted in a 480 basis point increase in margins to 67.8%.
Our Wholesale Group continues to make significant progress in delivering fiber-based backhaul services for wireless carriers. We have completed construction and begun billing on fiber services for more than 1,000 sites and we continue to expect this to grow to about 2,000 sites by year-end.
As a reminder, we will have modest revenues from this program this year, and this initiative is expected to help mitigate wholesale revenue pressures over the next several quarters. Over the long run, this provides an avenue for strategic revenue growth.
Now, let’s turn to Mass Markets result on slide #11. This unit achieved its fourth consecutive quarter of improved year-over-year revenue trends. Excluding the impact of the wireless reseller transition that was completed last year, Mass Markets’ revenue for the quarter declined 3% year-over-year and held steady sequentially.
Within Mass Markets, strategic revenues increased to 33% of segment revenue compared to 28% a year-ago. Strategic revenues improved 10% year-over-year while legacy revenue declined 9% due to continued pressure on traditional local voice services.
Consumer voice revenue now represents less than 20% of total consolidated revenue. In the third quarter, the company’s high-speed Internet marketing campaign achieved good success.
We also experienced a stronger contribution from our small business units which reported improved revenue trends driven mainly by pricing actions. As a reminder, small business represents about 20% of Mass Markets’ total revenue or a little more than $900 million annually.
In the quarter, total expenses declined 9% from the third quarter of 2009, due to fewer employees, reduced wireless cost and lower sales and marketing expense. Mass Market segment income of $617 million declined 1% year-over-year and sequentially. Segment margin of 53% improved 190 basis points compared to the third quarter last year and declined 50 basis points sequentially.
Our quarterly subscriber results are shown slide 12. The number and rate of consumer and small business voice access line loss in the quarter improved on a year-over-year basis and held steady with the second quarter.
We continue to grow the revenues from customers we retained. Consumer ARPU improved during the quarter to $65, up 10% compared to the third quarter of 2009. The improvement was driven by growth in broadband, wireless and video users, and a higher speed mix within our broadband customer base.
We continue to expand our fiber-to-the-node footprint. Services are now available to approximately 4.5 million residential households. In the quarter, we added 92,000 new subscribers on fiber services and we now serve 620,000 broadband fiber subscribers.
At the end of the quarter in 2009, fiber-based customers numbered just 330,000. Fiber-to-the-node additions in the quarter were offset by a 52,000 subscriber decline in traditional ATM-based DSL.
As I mentioned, we are pleased with response we are seeing from launch of our high-speed internet promotional campaign during the quarter. The campaign is focused on full internet service and includes wireless, security and technical support.
Following the launch, call volumes and orders increased measurably. We also saw increased activity in online ordering through qwest.com, and finally, we benefited sequentially from positive seasonal influences in the third quarter.
In the quarter, video subscribers increased 12,000 to 963,000. This growth was also aided by seasonal influences such as the NFL package. Our wireless business continued to have strong performance in the quarter and now exceeds 1 million subscribers. We increased the number of Qwest-billed Verizon wireless users by 62,000.
In closing, I am pleased with the momentum we saw in the third quarter. We delivered solid operational results and improved top line performance across all segments. We achieved this while maintaining a sharp focus on expense management and disciplined investment.
I am confident we will continue to deliver solid results as we complete the remainder of the year. I look forward to updating you on our next call and now I’ll turn it over to Joe.

In the third quarter, we again delivered another quarter of strong operating and financial performance. We met our goal of reducing the rate of loss of revenue to a low single-digit rate of decline a quarter ahead of schedule.
Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 38.2%. This represents another record margin for Qwest. We generated strong free cash flow in the quarter and we continued to improve our financial flexibility.
Now, let’s start by turning to the income statement on slide 14. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues of $2.9 billion were flat sequentially for the first time in eight quarters and declined 4% compared to the prior year.
Excluding the impact of the wireless transition, revenues only declined 3% versus the prior year. As Teresa noted, the improved year-over-year comparison is due to stronger results in each segment.
Consolidated strategic services revenue grew 8% compared to the year ago quarter. Strategic services are larger contributor in each of our segments, mainly due to higher demand for fiber-based broadband services and IP solutions. In the quarter, strategic revenue grew to 39% of total revenue from 34% a year ago.
In addition to revenue performance improvements, we continue to maintain a disciplined focus on the bottom line. Total operating expenses improved 5% from the prior year. The improved operating costs are driven by our ongoing efforts to increase operating efficiency and productivity through balancing workforce to workload, process improvements and reductions in network facility cost.
Operating expenses increased 1% sequentially. The increase in the quarter was primarily due to realignment and severance cost of $51 million and a one-time adjustment related to USF fees of $15 million. Without the special items, expenses improved 1% sequentially.
Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion for the quarter increased 3% from the year ago period and nearly 3% from the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 38.2% expanded 240 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially.
Moving on to Slide 15, we continue to strengthen the balance sheet in the third quarter and improve our financial flexibility. We ended the third quarter with net debt of $11 billion. This is a decline of $1 billion from the third quarter of 2009 and nearly $300 million from the second quarter.
Cash increased in the quarter to $2 billion. Net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA was 2.5 times at the end of the quarter. This is another significant achievement and the lowest leverage ratio for the company since 1999.
Last month, we announced plans to redeem all of the company’s convertible notes. Approximately $1.1 billion in principal was outstanding after tendering for a $147 million in August. We are well down the path to achieve our $3.5 billion stated debt reduction by February 2011.
Now, let’s turn to Slide 16, which shows the details on adjusted free cash flow and capital expenditures. An improved revenue mix and continued diligent on expenses produce strong adjusted free cash flow, up $554 million in the quarter.
We continue to focus our capital spending on funding key fiber-based broadband initiatives. Capital expenditures were $373 million compared with $340 million in the third quarter of 2009 and $330 million last quarter.
In the quarter, our DSO of 38.6 days improved one full day compared to the year ago period. Our collection staff continues to execute very well. We achieved a 14% year-over-year improvement in bad debt expense, and bad debt is now less than 1% of total revenue.
Before I close with the discussion of our outlook, I would like to update you on our returns on invested capital on Slide 17. Cumulative return on invested capital for the last 12 months improved 60 basis points compared to the previous 12 months. This reflects steady net operating profit after-tax, while our asset base declined.
In fact, net PP&E is down $570 million year-over-year. With our current returns, we are earning above our internal estimate for our cost of capital, and as you can see the GAAP is improving.
Now, let’s turn to our guidance on Slide #18. For the near-term, we continue to see a stable outlook for Business Markets. We expect to see enterprise revenue improve as the economy recovers.
In Wholesale, we are pleased with the steady top line trends in the quarter. Our goal is to continue to stabilize the top line sequentially and to report improving year-over-year rates of decline. In the fourth quarter, we expect Mass Markets to report a low single-digit sequential decline.
As Ed mentioned, we are raising our outlook overall for the year. We now expect consolidated revenues to decline at a low single-digit annual rate of decline in the fourth quarter similar to what we achieved this quarter one quarter ahead of schedule.
We also expect adjusted EBITDA to be at the high end of the range for the year of approximately $4.4 billion. We continue to expect capital investment of approximately $1.7 billion with about a $115 million of the investment to be financed by leasing. Our capital spending program reflects our focus on fiber-to-the-cell opportunities and our continued investment in fiber-to-the-node on an integrated basis.
Free cash flow for the year is now expected to be $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion with the benefit of the capital leasing activities. Without the benefit of the capital leasing activities, free cash flow was expected to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion.
As we stated last quarter regarding the pension, we do not expect to make any funding contributions to the pension plan in 2010 and our current expectation is that we will not have any required funding in 2011 as well.
Regarding taxes, we continue to expect to pay cash taxes of approximately 2% this year. As I mentioned, we will redeem our convert in the fourth quarter. In addition, we plan to make cash payment for the premium over the option strike price. The amount of this payment will depend on the future stock price. If you were to assume all holders convert with a stock price of $6.67, which was yesterday’s close, this value would be approximately $450 million.
Returning value to shareholders remains a priority and we made a dividend payment of $0.08 per share or $139 million in the third quarter, and on October 21, the company announced a $0.08 per share dividend to be paid in the fourth quarter as well.
As we noted in the CenturyLink merger announcement, it is our current expectation that we will continue to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share through the close of the transaction. The merger agreement requires the company to coordinate with CenturyLink on dividend dates. As a result, the timing of future dividends may deviate from past dates due to this requirement.
In closing, I’d like to reiterate how pleased I am with our results this quarter. We are confident that we will continue this momentum as we close out the year.
With that, I’ll turn the call back over to the operator and we’ll open the lines for questions.

And then second, I think you guys have continued to mention that you don’t have a cash contribution requirement for pensions this and next year, but I think you guys do end up showing up on a lot of screens in terms of pension liabilities relative to earnings power and market caps.

So if you remember back in February when we talked, we were talking about continuing to get down to this low single-digit rate to decline of revenue to at some point over the next coming year trying to hit that inflection point. To hit that inflection point, you do need the economy to improve and the ability of our business market to get better growth than what we’ve been achieving to-date. So we’re close to the inflection point. We’ll continue to drive and reduce that rate of decline, but we’d love to see some help from the economy.
In regards to the cash pension, you’re exactly right, we have no cash funding requirements for ‘10 or ‘11, our liability you can see stated in the financial statements. If you were to cut things off today and revalued everything, you’d probably have a bookkeeping charge going into 2011 and increase, but because you’re only measuring it once a year, you just look at what happens to the marketplace by year end.

Second question on Wholesale, I guess I read into the commentary by Joe is that the grooming, the price increases that you’ve implemented in Wholesale to get your customers to self-select, that phase is largely over and now the top line should remain relatively stable. Is that how should I read your comments there and what are the implications for margins I assume that I mean in wholesale margins will remain stable going forward as well?

And then on Wholesale, you are correct, we are through the phase where we were raising prices for long distance and where is the self-collection process, but Wholesale is still challenging and its local access is always a delicate area and we are getting good news in the private line area where the grooming has stopped a little bit and of course fiber-to-the-cell is giving us a way to offset some of those declines. So we see promising signs of wholesale, but this seems to be stabilizing out, but the local access site is still very tentative in how that market operates quarter-to-quarter.

But we will continue our disciplined approach of approximately 1 million homes a year and stay on that schedule. So, if we are able to get a few more homes as a result of deployment of fiber-to-the-cell, we’ll take advantage of it.
In regards to the EBITDA question, remember, going into the fourth quarter you have sort of the seasonal declines as you’re coming off business market sale start closing up for the November and December point. Some of the seasonal expenses we get out of our repairs and maintenance did maybe push in a little bit into the fourth quarter.

And then in the Wholesale space, that grooming seems to have slowed down, that we’ve reached the point where all the carriers are where they want to be on their private line. It will be great if AT&T and Verizon had an uptick in their enterprise sales because that would benefit us on the wholesale side. But this seems stable. I would use that word right now on the legacy side. In the BMG space, we are aggressively trying to move our customers into the IP space.

And then Joe Euteneuer, our CFO, will conclude the prepared remarks with a discussion of our consolidated financial results and outlook. We will then open it up for your questions.
I want to point you to Slide 3 and remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail in our periodic filings with the SEC, and I strongly encourage you to thoroughly review our filings. I also want to note that we do not adopt analyst estimates, nor do we necessarily commit to updating any forward-looking statements that we will be making this morning.
To supplement the reporting of our financial information, on our call today, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow and net debt. A full reconciliation of these measures is available on our website.
Now we'll move on to Slide 4 and touch on EPS and some special items that impacted EPS in the quarter. Our reported loss per share for the quarter was $0.05, and that compares to earnings per share of $0.08 in the third quarter of 2009. The current quarter includes a $0.13 charge related to the option on the convertible notes, a $0.02 charge for severance and realignment expense and a $0.01 charge for a one-time adjustment related to USF [Universal Service Fund] fees. 
Excluding special items, earnings per share were $0.11 in the third quarter.  That's a 22% improvement compared to $0.09 in the year ago quarter, as well as the second quarter of this year. Reported and adjusted earnings include dilution from non-cash pension OPEB expense. In the current quarter, the dilution was $0.01 and in the year ago period, we had an impact of $0.02. 
As a reminder, under the terms of the merger agreement with CenturyLink, we have committed to redeem our convertible debt and the value of the associated conversion rights for cash. Therefore, we previously reclassified the option component of the note from equity to a liability, which is included in accrued expense and other. The value of this liability at the end of the quarter was $349 million after initially being valued at $165 million on the date of the merger announcement. 
As a result of strong stock price appreciation during the third quarter, we reported a pre- and post-tax charge in the current period of $229 million to recognize the higher value of the option component of the convert. We have continued to see strong price appreciation in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we may have another charge when we report fourth quarter earnings. We'll be paying off the convertible principal and the value of the option in the fourth quarter.
With that, I'll now going to turn it over to Ed."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I want to begin by saying, I'm very pleased with our execution and results we delivered in the quarter despite continued market challenges. We reported improved sequential and year-",524,"Thanks, Kurt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I want to begin by saying, I'm very pleased with our execution and results we delivered in the quarter despite continued market challenges. We reported improved sequential and year-over-year revenue trends, expanded margins and we generated strong cash flow.
In addition, we reported a number of significant achievements for the company this quarter, including record-high margins and record-low debt levels. I'm also very proud of the recognition we received during the quarter for customer service awards in both the enterprise and the wholesale units. Our performance is a strong evidence of the focus we have on our strategies to drive the top line while maintaining disciplined expense management to improving operating efficiencies.
We continue to see strong growth in our strategic revenues while we aggressively pursue fiber-based broadband services. We experienced a rebound to growth in subscriber additions, driven by demand for high-speed services, launch of a new marketing campaign and seasonal benefits. We also continued to strengthen our financial flexibility by improving the balance sheet. Our progress was recognized by a rating agency upgrade in August to investment grade. 
During the quarter, we announced plans to call our convertible debt, which totals $1.1 billion in principal, and are well on the path to achieve our stated debt reduction goals. In addition, I'm very happy with the progress we're making toward the completion of our merger with CenturyLink. The senior leadership team for the combined company has been named. The second-tier team was also recently announced. Activities are well underway in the planning process for the integration of the two companies. We have reached several key milestones in the approval process, including overwhelming support from both company shareholders.
Last month, our unions agreed that the merger is in the public interest, and withdrew all opposition. We continue to make progress with various agencies and commissions required to review the transaction. To date, we've received approvals in 12 states. In addition to the FCC, we have 10 states remaining to review and approve the transaction.
To sum up, we've had a solid execution in the quarter, and we're well on the path to achieve our stated objectives. We are confident we will continue to execute for the remainder of the year. As a result, we are raising our revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow outlook to the top end of the 2010 guidance. Joe will provide you with the details.
We continue to expect our merger with CenturyLink to close in the first half of 2011. We're excited about the prospects that will arise from the combination of our two companies. Our respective shareholders have already benefited from the operating and stock performance of the two companies since our announcement.
Looking ahead, Qwest shareholders will benefit from significant synergies, a nearly 50% increase in dividends from today's level, accelerated deleveraging of the balance sheet, a strong management team and a talented employee base. I remain firmly convinced this transaction will further bolster our results and drive superior shareholder value. 
Now I'll hand it off to Teresa, who will discuss our business unit performance."
339972,113042346,84797,"Qwest Communications International Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov-03-2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Qwest Communications International, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Under challenging market conditions, we continue to deliver on our goal to improve the top line trend. In the quarter, all three segments again reported",1301,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Under challenging market conditions, we continue to deliver on our goal to improve the top line trend. In the quarter, all three segments again reported improved revenue trends on both the sequential and year-over-year basis. We achieved solid subscriber additions on our fiber-to-the-node network, maintained steady performance in Business Markets and improved top line trends in Wholesale.
Solid customer demand for strategic products continue to provide an increasing revenue contribution in each of the units. Total strategic revenue grew 8% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by 24% growth in enterprise IP services and growth in residential fiber-based services. This compares to 6% year-over-year growth in the second quarter.
Legacy revenue losses improved substantially in the quarter as well. Sequentially, legacy revenue was down 1% in the quarter compared with 4% last quarter.
We also continue to maintain a disciplined focus on the bottom line. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income both increased nearly 3% compared to the prior year. And we'll begin the discussion of our individual business unit performance with the Business Market segment on Slide 9. 
Business Markets reported third quarter revenues of $1 million. This is flat with the prior year quarter and up 2% sequentially. Recurring revenue held steady in the quarter, both annually and sequentially. Similar to the 2009 trend, we did see sequential growth in data integration in the quarter.
In the Enterprise space, we continue to see encouraging signs in customer activity and steadily increasing sales levels. This segment also benefited from improved sales rep productivity and strong customer retention. Strategic revenue in Business Markets now exceed the legacy revenue for the first time since we began reporting this mix. Strategic revenues increased 9% compared to the third quarter of 2009. This was driven by a continued strong demand for our MPLS [Multiprotocol Label Switching] and high-capacity IP services. The growth in strategic revenues was offset by a 7% decline in legacy data and local voice services.
During the quarter, Qwest was a recipient for the third consecutive year of the prestigious Nemertes PilotHouse Award and cited top provider of carrier Internet services. Qwest outperformed every other market challenger in most categories, achieving top ratings for customer service and overall value. 
In the third quarter, Business Markets segment income of $415 million increased 4% year-over-year and 7% from the second quarter. The improvement in the quarter is driven by improved sales productivity and a one-time legal settlement in the second quarter. Segment margin for the quarter expanded 140 basis points annually and 190 basis points sequentially to 40.7%.
In summary, we are encouraged by the increased activity and positive new sales momentum. We continue to expect revenues will start to pick up as economic conditions improve. 
Results for our Wholesale segment are summarized on Slide 10. During the quarter, our Wholesale unit also received strong honors. For the 10th consecutive time, Atlantic-ACM recognized Qwest for best-in-class customer service, provisioning, network performance and billing in the ILEC [Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier] category, as well as best in class across all carriers for data value.
For the first time in more than three years, Wholesale revenue held steady sequentially. Wholesale segment revenue for the quarter totaled $661 million, a decline of 8% year-over-year. Wholesale is benefiting from an improved strategic product mix that now represents 49% of total segment revenue. 
Strategic revenues grew 6% compared with the prior year and 2% in the second quarter. This growth is being offset by declines in legacy voice services. However, legacy voice losses improved in the quarter as we saw less intense pressure in long distance and grooming efforts. Legacy revenues were down 1% sequentially, which is a marked improvement from the 8% decline last quarter. The improved mix and demand for strategic services resulted in a 480-basis-point increase in margin to 67.8%. 
Our Wholesale group continues to make significant progress in delivering fiber-based backhaul services for wireless carriers. We have completed construction and began billing on fiber services for more than 1,000 sites, and we continue to expect this to grow to about 2,000 sites by year end. 
As a reminder, we will have modest revenues from this program this year, and this initiative is expected to help mitigate Wholesale revenue pressures over the next several quarters. For the long run, this provides an avenue for strategic revenue growth. 
Now let's turn to Mass Markets results on Slide 11. This unit achieved its fourth consecutive quarter of improved year-over-year revenue trend. Excluding the impact of the wireless reseller transition that was completed last year, Mass Markets revenue for the quarter declined 3% year-over-year and held steady sequentially. Within Mass Markets, strategic revenues increased to 33% of segment revenue compared to 28% a year ago. Strategic revenues improved 10% year-over-year while legacy revenue declined 9% due to continued pressure on traditional local voice services.
Consumer voice revenue now represents less than 20% of total consolidated revenue. In the third quarter, the company's High-Speed Internet marketing campaign achieved good success. We also experienced a stronger contribution from our Small business unit, which reported improved revenue trends, driven mainly by pricing action. As a reminder, Small Business represents about 20% of Mass Markets' total revenue, or a little more than $900 million annually. 
In the quarter, total expenses declined 9% in the third quarter of 2009 due to fewer employees, reduced wireless costs and lower sales and marketing expense. Mass Markets segment income of $617 million declined 1% year-over-year and sequentially. Segment margin of 53% improved to 190 basis points compared to the third quarter last year and declined 50 basis points sequentially. 
Our quarterly subscribers results are shown on Slide 12. The number and rate of consumer and small business voice access line loss in the quarter improved on a year-over-year basis and held steady with the second quarter. We continue to grow the revenues from customers we retained. Consumer ARPU improved during the quarter to $65, up 10% compared to the third quarter of 2009. The improvement was driven by growth in broadband, wireless and video users. And a higher speed mix was in our broadband customer base. 
We continue to expand our fiber-to-the-node footprint. Services are now available to approximately 4.5 million residential households. In the quarter, we added 92,000 new subscribers on fiber services. And we now serve 620,000 broadband fiber subscribers. At the end of the quarter in 2009, fiber-based customers numbered just 330,000. Fiber-to-the-node additions in the quarter were offset by a 52,000-subscriber decline in traditional ATM-based DSL. 
As I mentioned, we are pleased with the response we are seeing from the launch of our new High-Speed Internet promotional campaign during the quarter. The campaign is focused on full Internet service and includes wireless, security, and technical support. Following the launch, call volumes of orders increased measurably. We also saw increased activity in online ordering through qwest.com. And finally, we benefited sequentially from positive seasonal influences in the third quarter.
In the quarter, video subscribers increased 12,000 to 963,000. This growth was also aided by seasonal influences such as the NFL package. Our Wireless business continued to have a strong performance in the quarter and now exceeds 1 million subscribers. The increase in number of Qwest-billed Verizon Wireless users by 62,000. 
In closing, I'm pleased with the momentum we saw in the third quarter. We delivered solid operational results and improved top line performance across all segments. We achieved this while maintaining a sharp focus on expense management and disciplined investments. I am confident we will continue to deliver solid results as we complete the remainder of the year. I look forward to updating you on our next call.
And now I'll turn it over to Joe."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In third quarter, we again delivered another quarter of strong operating and financial performance. We met our goal of reducing the rate of loss of revenue to a low-single digi",1187,"Thank you, Teresa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In third quarter, we again delivered another quarter of strong operating and financial performance. We met our goal of reducing the rate of loss of revenue to a low-single digit rate of decline a quarter ahead of schedule.
Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 38.2%. This represents another record margin for Qwest. We generated strong free cash flow in the quarter, and we continued to improve our financial flexibility.
Now let's start by turning to the income statement on Slide 14. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues of $2.9 billion were flat sequentially for the first time in eight quarters and declined 4% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the wireless transition, revenues only declined 3% versus the prior year. As Teresa noted, the improved year-over-year comparison is due to stronger results in each segment. Consolidated strategic services revenue grew 8% compared to the year ago quarter. Strategic services are a larger contributor in each of our segments, mainly due to higher demand for fiber-based broadband services and IP solutions. In the quarter, strategic revenue grew to 39% of total revenue from 34% a year ago.
In addition to revenue performance improvements, we continue to maintain a disciplined focus on the bottom line. Total operating expenses improved 5% from the prior year. The improved operating costs are driven by our ongoing efforts to increase operating efficiency and productivity through balancing workforce to workload, process improvements and reductions in network facility costs. 
Operating expenses increased 1% sequentially. The increase in the quarter was primarily due to realignment and severance cost of $51 million and a one-time adjustment related to USF fees of $15 million. Without the special items, expenses improved 1% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion for the quarter increased 3% from the year ago period and nearly 3% from the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 38.2% expanded 240 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially.
Moving on to Slide 15. We continued to strengthen the balance sheet in the third quarter and improve our financial flexibility. We ended the third quarter with net debt of $11 billion. This is a decline of $1 billion from the third quarter of 2009 and nearly $300 million from the second quarter. Cash increased in the quarter to $2 billion. Net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA was 2.5x at the end of the quarter. This is another significant achievement and the lowest leverage ratio for the company since 1999.
Last month, we announced plans to redeem all of the company's convertible notes. Approximately $1.1 billion in principal is outstanding after tendering for $147 million in August. We are well down the path to achieve our $3.5 billion stated debt reduction by February 2011.
Now let's turn to Slide 16, which shows the details on adjusted free cash flow and capital expenditures. An improved revenue mix and continued diligence on expenses produced strong adjusted free cash flow of $554 million in the quarter. We continue to focus our capital spending on funding key fiber-based broadband initiatives. Capital expenditures were $373 million compared with $340 million in the third quarter of 2009 and $330 million last quarter.
In the quarter, our DSO of 38.6 days improved one full day compared to the year ago period. Our collections staff continues to execute very well. We achieved a 14% year-over-year improvement in bad debt expense, and bad debt is now less than 1% of total revenue.
Before I close with the discussion of our outlook, I would like to update you on our returns on invested capital on Slide 17. Cumulative return on invested capital for the last 12 months improved 60 basis points compared to the previous 12 months. This reflects steady net operating profit after tax while our asset base declined. In fact, net PP&E is down $570 million year-over-year. With our current returns, we are earning above our internal estimate for our cost of capital, and as you can see, the gap is improving.
Now let's turn to our guidance on Slide 18. For the near term, we continue to see a stable outlook for Business Markets. We expect to see enterprise revenue improve as the economy recovers. In Wholesale, we are pleased with the steady top line trends in the quarter. Our goal is to continue to stabilize the top line sequentially and to report improving year-over-year rates of decline. In the fourth quarter, we expect Mass Markets to report a low-single digit sequential decline. As Ed mentioned, we are raising our outlook overall for the year. We now expect consolidated revenues to decline at a low-single digit annual rate of decline in the fourth quarter, similar to what we achieved this quarter, one quarter ahead of schedule.
We also expect adjusted EBITDA to be at the high end of the range for the year of approximately $4.4 billion. We continue to expect capital investment of approximately $1.7 billion, with about $150 million of the investment to be financed by leasing. Our capital spending program reflects our focus on Fiber-to-the-Cell opportunities and our continued investment in fiber-to-the-node on an integrated basis.
Free cash flow for the year is now expected to be $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion with the benefit of the capital leasing activities. Without the benefit of the capital leasing activities, free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion.
As we stated last quarter regarding the pension, we do not expect to make any funding contributions to the pension plan in 2010. And our current expectation is that we will not have any required funding in 2011 as well.
Regarding taxes, we continue to expect to pay cash taxes of approximately 2% this year. As I mentioned, we will redeem our convert in the fourth quarter. In addition, we plan to make a cash payment for the premium over the option strike price. The amount of this payment will depend on the future stock price. If you were to assume all holders convert with a stock price of $6.67, which was yesterday's close, this value would be approximately $450 million.
Returning value to shareholders remains a priority, and we made a dividend payment of $0.08 per share or $139 million in the third quarter. And on October 21, the company announced an $0.08-per-share dividend to be paid in the fourth quarter as well.
As we noted in the CenturyLink merger announcement, it is our current expectation that we will continue to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share through the close of the transaction. The merger agreement requires the company to coordinate with CenturyLink on dividend dates. As a result, the timing of future dividends may deviate from past dates due to this requirement.
In closing, I'd like to reiterate how pleased I am with our results this quarter. We are confident that we will continue this momentum as we close out the year. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the Operator, and we'll open the lines for questions."

And given the results that you guys have put up, is this something we should expect maybe an accelerated pace of build-outs heading into 2011?"

We look to what additional homes we can get, et cetera. So we're far more cost effective in the deployment of our capital than we've ever been before, and the good news is we did get a few extra homes out of it. But we will continue our disciplined approach of approximately 1 million homes a year and stay on that schedule. So if we are able to get a few more homes as a result of the employment of Fiber-to-the-Cell, we'll take advantage of it. In regards to your EBITDA question, remember, going into the fourth quarter, we have sort of the seasonal decline. As you're coming off, Business Markets sales start closing up for the November and December point. Some of the seasonal expenses we get out of our repairs and maintenance maybe pushing a little bit into the fourth quarter. But overall, we are still very much on track to deliver the high end of that range and have a consistent performance without any bumps in the night."

And then in the wholesale space, we're really just -- that grooming thing seems to slow down. We've reached the point where all the carriers are where they want to be on their private line.
