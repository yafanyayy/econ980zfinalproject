As we exited last fiscal year, we were cautious in our outlook for fiscal '10. We have just experienced the largest and most rapid yearly revenue decline in my history with Rockwell Automation, and we were just beginning to see stabilization in the macro environment and in our order rates. Fast-forward three months, and we now believe we are seeing the signs of recovery, reflected by continued improvement in key global economic indicators, like industrial production and PMI and by our performance in the first quarter. I'll talk more about our outlook later, but first, let me give you some highlights for the first quarter.Revenue in the first quarter was better than our expectations, particularly in our Product businesses in December. And even though we think product revenue in the quarter benefited from some unusual year-end budget consumption by our customers, it still exceeded our expectations. In our Solutions businesses, revenue declined sequentially in Q1 as expected. But we did see improvement in order rates for the first time since the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Favorable revenue mix, along with the benefit of previous cost-reduction actions contributed to sequential margin improvements in the quarter, even after adjusting for the restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of last year. The results in the quarter and an improved outlook for the year cost us to reverse our temporary pay and benefit cuts in January, a quarter earlier than we originally expected. We believe this was the appropriate timing, but it will create some additional sequential headwinds to margins for the remainder of the year. And the first quarter was another very strong quarter for cash generation, over $100 million. I want to thank our customers, employees and partners for a great start to the fiscal year. Let me set the stage for our outlook for the remainder of the year. While key indicators such as industrial production and PMI are improving, we remain concerned about other factors such as continued high unemployment, historically low levels of capacity utilization and a very cautious capital spending outlook. It now seems that the recovery has started, but the shape of the recovery remains uncertain. Absent some unexpected shock to the global economy, we believe demand will trend flat to up from here. With this backdrop and using our Q1 results as a new baseline, we are providing a revised outlook for fiscal 2010 full-year revenue of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion, compared to our previous range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion. As in our previous guidance, to achieve the high end of the range, we need to have meaningful second-half over first-half growth. At these new revenue levels, we do expect to incur some additional expense from restoration of temporary actions and higher incentive compensation in 2010. And we expect to begin to make some incremental investments to support growth. So with these factors in mind, we are raising our earnings-per-share guidance. Our new range is $2 to $2.40. This revised guidance reflects the strong earnings leverage that we would expect on incremental volumes, especially with respect to our Product businesses. Before I turn this over to Ted, let me highlight a few key developments in the quarter, and then I'll wrap up my comments.We talked at the November investor conference about our growth accelerators in the next cycle: Process control, OEMs, safety, information, emerging markets and sustainability. And we continue to see progress in the first quarter. We had another strong showing in the 2010 Control Magazine Reader's Choice Awards, a survey of process control engineers. We placed first in 26 industry categories, almost three times the number of firsts of any other global automation company and a net gain of three positions from last year. In all categories, we increased our first-place finishes from 11 in 2007 to 36 in 2010. This further validates that Rockwell Automation is a DCS provider in the eyes of our process control customers. Regarding our OEM business, we received a $10 million order from a European packaging machine builder for machines to be exported to China. We received the first order for our new scalable process safety product advance from a national oil company in Latin America. This product enables us to serve a broader range of process industry applications. Emerging Asia grew over 9% in the quarter. And in our Information Software business, we received a $1 million order for production management system at a Chinese automotive company. So in closing, we believe that we are at the early stage of a recovery. We will continue to effectively manage our cost structure, while appropriately investing in key technologies and growth opportunities. We are well-positioned to take advantage of the recovery, and we are ready to serve our customers' needs when their automation spend increases. Now I'll turn it over to Ted."

We have posted charts through our website and my comments will reference to those charts, so starting with Chart 1, Q1 results summary.Revenue in the quarter was $1,067,000,000, down 10% from Q1 last year, an org",1147,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. We have posted charts through our website and my comments will reference to those charts, so starting with Chart 1, Q1 results summary.Revenue in the quarter was $1,067,000,000, down 10% from Q1 last year, an organic sales decline of 15.5% offset in part by favorable currency impact of 4.4 points and contribution from acquisitions of about one point. Sequentially, sales declined by 1%. In all, a very good first quarter and a stronger-than-expected start to the year in our Product businesses.Segment operating earnings were $137 million, down from $178 million in Q1 last year. General Corporate net was $19.5 million compared to $18.1 million a year ago. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 20%, a point below the low end of our projected range for the full year. EPS from continuing operations was $0.54, down from $0.81 in the first quarter of last year, and we recognized a small environmental charge in discontinued operations. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $143.8 million, and we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter.Moving to Chart 2, Q1 results, Rockwell Automation, as noted previously, sales for Q1 declined 10% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Q1 sales are typically lower than quarter four, but 1% was a smaller-than-expected sequential decline. We had expected a significant sequential drop in solutions, and we expected product sales about flat to Q4 run rates. Solution sales actually declined more than expected, but we saw a significant sequential growth in products. We believe a portion of that sequential products growth may have been due to some unusual year-end consumption of customers' operating expense budgets. However, even adjusting for that, product sales were stronger than expected.Moving to the earnings side of the chart, operating earnings declined 23% year-over-year, primarily due to the volume drop, offset in part by cost reductions. Operating margin for the quarter was 12.8%, down about 2.1 points compared to last year, but up considerably from the trough margins experienced in fiscal '09. Looking at the earnings chart, there's an obvious large sequential earnings improvement on the 1% lower sequential sales. Sequentially, operating margin increased by 5.4 points. You may recall, we incurred some significant restructuring charges in Q4, but excluding those charges, operating margin increased sequentially by 2.3 points. That improvement reflects significantly richer product versus solutions mix in the quarter.We're very pleased with the margin results in Q1, but this might be a somewhat overstated base for sequential quarterly comparisons, as we proceed into the balance of the year. As I mentioned, Q1 saw a very favorable mix of products versus solutions, probably in part due to some unusual year-end customer spending. Additionally, Q1 will be the only quarter this year where we see a year-over-year benefit of some of our temporary actions. We restored pay cuts and the 401(k) match beginning in January. And within improving outlook, we are planning to allow some increased spending, and that didn't get started in time to impact Q1. On the other hand, we believe we're well-positioned for good leverage as volume increases, and you'll see that reflected in guidance. Although not displayed on the chart, our trailing fourth quarter return on investment capital was 9.5%, that's down from 22.3% last year, primarily due to the earnings decline.Now please turn to Chart 3, which summarizes the first quarter results of the Architecture & Software segment. Looking at the left side of this chart, a strong sales results for Architecture & Software in Q1 with the third consecutive quarter of increasing sales. Sales were down 7% compared to the same quarter last year, with about a five-point benefit from currency. Sequentially, sales were up 11%. Operating margin for the quarter was 21.1%, one-half point below the first quarter of last year despite lower sales. That reflects the impact of our cost reductions of last year. Excluding restructuring charges from Q4, operating margin improved sequentially by 7.3 points. That sequential margin performance is primarily due to the significant volume leverage we generate in this higher-margin segment.Chart 4 covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in Q1 were down 12% compared to last year, with a four-point benefit from currency and two points of growth from acquisitions. Sales were down 8%, sequentially. We experienced sequential growth in the Products business of Control Products & Solutions. But that was more than offset by the larger-than-expected decline in the Solutions business. Segment operating earnings were down 44%, year-over-year and operating margin contracted by 3.7 points, consistent with the lower volume. Excluding restructuring charges in quarter four, operating margin was lower sequentially by two points, also due primarily to lower volume.The next chart, Chart 5, provides a geographic breakdown of sales in the quarter. In the center column, you'll see the overall growth rates by region. The far right column shows growth rates excluding the effects of currency translation. This is the first quarter since the fourth quarter of fiscal year '08 in which currently made a positive contribution. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, excluding currency effects. In the U.S., sales were down 18% year-over-year, but up 3% sequentially. The U.S. was the only region with sequential growth, and really, all of that due to strength in the Product businesses, particularly Architecture & Software. Canadian sales declined by 8% compared to prior year, but that compares in benefits from an acquisition made last year. Excluding that, the year-over-year decline was about the same as in the U.S. In EMEA, sales declined 16% compared to Q1 last year, and Asia-Pacific was the only region that demonstrated year-over-year growth at 5%. Emerging Asia including China, saw over 9% growth year-over-year. Latin America was down 19% year-over-year, with the largest declines in the Solutions businesses.Turn to Chart 6, free cash flow. For the quarter, free cash flow was $108 billion, a very good start for the year, and that's just a little less than 140% conversion. And that brings us to the next slide, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '10.As Keith mentioned, we're revising guidance. We have increased the range of full-year sales to $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion to reflect the higher baseline based on Q1 performance. Excluding currency effects for the full year, that revenue range represents a decline of 2% at the low end to growth of 3% at the high end. We expect currency to contribute about four points to year-over-year growth, one point more than in our November guidance. And we've adjusted our estimate of segment operating margin to 12% to 13%. We've increased our fiscal 2010 EPS guidance to a range of $2 to $2.40. We now expect the full-year tax rate of 19% to 23%. And we continue to expect free cash flow conversion above 100%. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rondi to begin the Q&A session."

And it's one of the reasons sometimes Q2 can actually be lower than Q1. We really don't know the continued strength until we get into the mid-February end-of-the-quarter time period because obviously, most of the companies are resetting their budgets for a new year and it takes a while for that to work through the system.

I believe, and this is more of a broad statement than we talked to a handful of customers, but what we normally see as December unfolds is a normal start. And then about midway through, it starts tailing off. And then certainly, as you get between the holidays, it's pretty slow, normally. And so obviously, that's certainly what we were expecting this year. Because if you remember last year, basically everybody shut down and there was really zero going on, which is obviously worse than normal. But it was a very reduced level last year. And so we thought we'd get back to a normal seasonality at the end, and what we saw was a continued acceleration in the product businesses through the month. As we went through our normal series of reviews in January, getting ready for this call and obviously the remainder-of-the-year outlook, we got a significant feedback from the various regions and verticals that certainly, there was an increased spending thrust as they approached the end of the year. And certainly, a portion of that -- we believe there are a couple of other factors behind that. One, there had been such a reduction, what I would call just normal operating spending in our second and third quarters and into the fourth, that because industrial production picked up. There's just what I would say a natural rebound there, as well as supply chains were pretty well down and people had reduced their maintenance, storing rooms and other spending to a point where there was probably a little higher-than-average replacement. But then also, because that spending was decreased for such a long period of time, we do believe there was some end-of-the-year spending bubble that was why we called it unusual. And so that kind of gives you a little, well, maybe a lot of color around that question."

I mean, I believe we're seeing two things at this point in time, that we didn't see when we gave our initial guidance. And that is a sustained pickup of our product revenues. And obviously, we thought that we would have a closer to flat to Q4 during our Q1 and it grew. And as I said earlier, it grew throughout the quarter, which was unusual. The other aspect is our Solutions business where we definitely expected it to continue to decline in sales. But quite frankly, we were a little surprised that we saw sequential order improvement. And the last time we had talked, we were still going down in our Solutions business. And so we believe that we now probably have seen the bottom of the Solutions business. And we have more certainty that we have seen the bottom in our Products businesses. Although obviously, the shape, as we've mentioned, of the recovery is still very difficult. But we think, with respect to the magnitude of the change, that we're trying to go right down the middle of the fairway with what we see today. And I think traditionally, that's the approach we've taken, to tell you what we know, when we know it, and try to make sure we're as credible as possible on both of the sides of the range. So I think we have a little more confidence in the stability than we did previously. And certainly, we believe that, unlike last year where products were going down at a much faster rate than solutions and therefore we saw all the decremental margin impact, we now fully expect products to lead solutions. And therefore, you're seeing some of these higher incremental margins going the opposite way. So I think it's that, plus obviously, the macroeconomic indicators. We've got another quarter of looking at those. While there not have been significant change, they've all stayed, certainly the PMIs have stayed above 50 for a significant number of months and industrial production on a global basis continues to show, while not large, certainly some improvement. And I think it's that total combination, including talking to customers. And while they may not be increasing their spending dramatically, they're talking about and they're looking for more quotations. They believe, they feel they will be releasing projects later in the year. And that's why we talked about a meaningful second half over first half growth. So a number of those aspects that caused us to have probably a little different perspective than we did three months ago."

With respect to process, there we do have more confidence. And we do know that we are gaining our share in process and we're gaining it through a number of vehicles. Obviously, the most important reason for process improvement is the fact that our plant-wide control strategy and differentiation that we have as a company with our technology continues to resonate with our customers. And that story is getting stronger and louder and gaining a lot of traction. The second reason is because of the activity that we have started, probably a little over a year now, two years probably, since our acquisition of ICST, which is a process safety supplier. That, in combination with Logix, we now have an integrated safety and control system that is a very solid platform in particular for oil and gas and other heavy-process industries. So we got moving, we started to focus on the batch hybrid space. But now in process, we're moving more and more into the heavy industries and continuous process. And so that would be the other area that we are able to achieve share growth.

At our last earnings release, I said that we believe we were seeing the signs of the start of a recovery. Our performance in Q1 had exceeded our expectations, particularly in our product businesses, and we significantly increased our revenue and earnings guidance in January. 
Our second quarter provided more good news. It appears that an industrial recovery has taken hold as evidenced by continued improvement in key global and economic indicators like industrial production and PMI, as well as our strong sequential growth in the quarter. I'll talk more about our second half outlook later but first, let me give you my thoughts on the quarter. And as always, Ted will be discussing the numbers in greater detail in his remarks. 
This quarter marked the return to year-over-year organic growth for the first time since Q4 of fiscal 2008. Product revenue in the quarter was once again better than our expectations. We think restocking in our channel benefited Q2 sales by about three points. And we suspect that some of the strength in Product business that we have seen in both Q1 and Q2 was due to pent-up MRO demand. In our solutions and services businesses, revenue declined year-over-year as expected. But the book-to-bill was above one again this quarter. 
Growing volume leverage in the quarter resulted in a seven-point, year-over-year margin improvement and a two-point sequential margin improvement in spite of the incremental cost in the quarter from reversing our temporary cost reductions and some other items that Ted will provide more detail on. And we have continued to deliver very strong free cash flow with careful management of both working capital and capital spending. 
There are some other positive developments in the quarter: Over 13% sequential growth in the U.S. and Canada with continued strength in automotive; strong growth in emerging Asia with 24% year-over-year growth in India and 15% in China; multiple process industry wins against entrenched competitors, especially in water/wastewater and oil and gas; OEM conversions started to bear fruit, validating our focus on these important customers during the downturn. And this impact will become more important as market conditions improve. 
Finally, I want to thank our talented and dedicated employees and partners whose unwavering commitment to our customers enabled these great results. And I'm very pleased to announce that we are now able to implement a pay increase across our global employee base. 
Let me set the stage for our outlook for the second half of the year. While the recovery is underway, the shape of that recovery remains uncertain. The strength in our Product business through Q2 has been largely based on strong MRO demand and smaller projects with some contribution from channel restocking. Even the improvement we have seen in OEM business has been more about machine-level investment and production line level. And we have yet to see any significant improvement in large capital project spending, and it's difficult to know when that might kick in.
So for Products, we believe the second half could range from flat to moderately up compared to the Q2 run rate. To get to the higher end of our revised revenue guidance, we need to see improvement in that large capital project business relatively early in the second half. 
For solutions and services, we do expect significant sequential revenue growth in the second half given the order's performance in Q1 and Q2. With this backdrop and with two quarters of solid performance under our belt, we are providing a revised outlook for fiscal 2010 full year revenues of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion, compared to our previous range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion. As in our previous guidance, to achieve the high end of the range, we need to have meaningful second half over first half revenue growth. 
At these new revenue levels, we do expect to incur some additional compensation expense. And we will increase spending to support growth, particularly in technology, domain expertise and customer-facing resources in emerging markets. We are also raising our earnings per share guidance, the $2.60, to $2.90.
Before I turn this over to Ted, let me provide a few closing comments. The early part of this recovery has been surprisingly strong, and we are now solidly on a year-over-year growth path. As I mentioned earlier, sequential growth rates in the Product business will likely moderate in the second half of the year. But our long-term growth prospects are bright. I am excited by the new opportunities we are seeing everyday, particularly in the areas of process control, OEMs and emerging markets. The entire organization is energized and committed to serving our customers' needs as the recovery progresses. And we know that this commitment to our customer success has provided superior long-term returns for our shareholders in the past, and I believe that this will continue to be the case. 
Now let me turn it over to Ted."
300504,100777487,58417,"Rockwell Automation Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Keith, and good morning to everybody on the call. We've posted charts to our website and my comments will reference those charts. Now building on some of Keith's comments, this was a very good quarter for the company with strong results in sales",1687,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning to everybody on the call. We've posted charts to our website and my comments will reference those charts. 
Now building on some of Keith's comments, this was a very good quarter for the company with strong results in sales, earnings and cash flow. And I'll start the briefing on Chart 1, which is, ""Q2 Results: Summary"". Revenue in the quarter was $1,164,000,000, up 10% from Q2 last year with currency contributing five points to the increase. As Keith noted, Q2 represents a return to year-over-year growth and provides evidence of a continued recovery in market conditions. 
Total segment operating earnings were $177 million, up from $86 million in Q2 last year, very strong earnings conversion. I'll discuss that further on the next slide. General Corporate net expense was $23.6 million compared to $14.7 million a year ago. That's a significant year-over-year increase and primarily due to performance-based compensation, where we reversed accruals in Q2 last year and incurred above average expense this year. We also made a contribution to our charitable corporation in Q2 this year.
General Corporate net was about $3 million to $4 million higher in Q2 than our expected quarterly run rate. The $4 million of income shown as a special item in Q2 last year was the reversal of previous restructuring accruals. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 16%. That's considerably below our previous guidance range for the full year estimated rate. We experienced about a five-point benefit in the quarter related to the favorable settlement of a prior-year tax matter. 
EPS from continuing operations was $0.77, up from $0.29 in the second quarter of last year. The tax settlement I referred to contributed about $0.05 in this quarter's results.
We recognized income from discontinued operations of $25 million in quarter 2 or $0.18 per share, primarily due to the favorable resolution of tax matters related to the sale of our Power Systems business in fiscal year 2007. So in total, earnings per share for the quarter was $0.95. 
Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $144.4 million, and we resumed share repurchases during Q2 and repurchased approximately 463,000 shares for $25.5 million. We have $596 million remaining under our existing $1 billion repurchase authorization.
Now if you would please turn to Chart 2, ""Q2 Results: Rockwell Automation Total"". On the left side of this slide, you can see the 10% year-over-year sales increase. Sales were up 9% sequentially. We experienced robust growth in our product businesses, year-over-year and sequentially. Solutions and Service business revenues declined year-over-year but improved somewhat sequentially. 
Moving to the earnings side of the chart, operating earnings increased by 106% compared to Q2 last year. And you can also see here a significant sequential earnings increase. Operating margin for the quarter was 15.2%, up 7.1 points compared to last year and up 2.4 points sequentially.
The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to higher margins in the Architecture & Software segment, but in total for the company reflects strong volume leverage, improved mix and the impact of our cost-reduction actions from last year. This favorable margin performance in Q2 was realized despite some significant expense increases in the quarter, primarily related to employee compensation. 
As we discussed in the last earnings release, we restored pay cuts and 401(k) match effective on January 1. In addition, we have decided to implement wage and salary increases for employees globally. It will take us a few months to implement this pay increase but we intend to make a payment at implementation to catch up back to January 1. And performance-based compensation expense increased significantly compared to Q2 last year. 
In total, these three items increased expense year-over-year by $42 million in Q2. As a partial offset to these incremental expenses, there were no restructuring costs in Q2 this year compared to a $20 million restructuring charge in last year's second quarter. Obviously, a lot of puts and takes in the quarter with respect to operating earnings and margins are taking all of that into accounts to a very strong earnings conversion.
In January on our earnings call, I mentioned that we intended to begin the increased spending in Q2, and as Keith noted, particularly in the areas of technology, domain expertise and commercial facing resources and emerging markets. Frankly, other than the compensation items I just covered, we didn't see much other spending increase in Q2. After clamping down so tightly last year, spending in these other areas is ramping more slowly than we expected. But we do expect to see increased spending, principally in the targeted areas, in the balance of the year and that's reflected in our revised guidance. We continue to believe we are well-positioned to deliver exceptional year-over-year earnings conversion for the full year, and you'll see that as well reflected in our guidance. 
Although not displayed on the chart, our trailing four-quarter return on invested capital was 13.2%. That's down from 18.7% last year but up from 9.5% last quarter. Through the balance of the year, we expect return on invested capital to steadily improve as we continue to see favorable year-over-year earnings comparisons.
If you would turn to Chart 3, this Chart summarizes the quarter 2 results of the Architecture & Software segment. Looking at the left side of this Chart, you'll see very strong sales performance in our Architecture & Software segment for the quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of increased sales. Sales were up 31% compared to the same quarter last year, including a six-point contribution from currency. Sequentially, sales increased 10%. Operating margin for the quarter was 23.8%, that's 15.4 points higher than the second quarter of last year and predominantly due to volume leverage. Operating margin improved 2.7 points sequentially. 
Chart 4 covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in Q2 were down 2% compared to last year, an organic decline of 7%, offset by a four-point benefit from currency and one point of growth from acquisitions. Sales in Control Products & Solutions increased 8% sequentially. In the product businesses of the Control Products & Solutions segment, sales increased both year-over-year and sequentially at rates similar to the Architecture & Software segment. 
In the solutions and services businesses of CPNS, sales were down in the mid-teens compared to Q2 last year but increased about 3% sequentially. Solutions and service orders have continued to improve with the book-to-bill for Q2 just slightly higher than the 1.15 that we experienced in Q1. Segment operating earnings and operating margin were up slightly from last year on lower sales but better mix. 
On the right side of the slide, you can see a significant sequential operating earnings improvement in Q2 and segment operating margins expanded by 2.1 points sequentially.
Turning to the next chart, Chart 5 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales for Q2. The center column displays overall growth rates by region. The far right column shows growth rates excluding the effects of which currency translation. I'll focus my comments on the far right column. In the U.S., sales were up 10% year-over-year, up 13% sequentially. Canadian sales increased 12% compared to prior year, but that includes the effect of an acquisition made last year. Excluding sales from the acquisition, the year-over-year increase was about 4%. Sequentially, Canadian sales increased by 18%. In EMEA, sales declined by 7% compared to Q2 last year, but increased 3% sequentially. Asia-Pacific increased by 12% compared to last year and 1% sequentially, and emerging Asia, including China saw 15% growth year-over-year. As Keith mentioned, we had a standout order for India with year-over-year growth of 24%.
Latin America was down 4% year-over-year with improved product revenues offset by declines in the Solutions and Services business. You may recall last year, Latin America held up well through Q2 and then fell off. So compared to the other regions, a relatively more difficult year-over-year comparison for Latin America. Sequentially, Latin America sales increased by 8%.
Now please turn to Chart 6, ""Free Cash Flow"". We're continuing to see strong cash generation and conversion on net income. Free cash flow for the quarter was $167 million. That's despite some increased working capital to support higher sales levels. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $275 million, which represents about 145% conversion. 
Our balance sheet also remains very strong. Related to that, during the quarter, we renewed our 364-day credit facility. The expiring facility was $267.5 million. The new facility is $300 million. There were no difficulties renewing, and we experienced strong interest from the banking community. We have a separate $267.5 million facility expiring on March 15, 2012. So the total amount available under the two facilities is now $567.5 million.
And that brings us to the last chart, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '10. As Keith mentioned, we're revising our full year guidance. We've increased the range of full year sales from the previous guidance of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion to a new guidance range of $4.65 billion to $4.8 billion. Excluding currency effects, the new revenue range represents year-over-year growth of between 4% and 8%. We expect currency to contribute about three points to year-over-year growth. That's one point lower than our January guidance. We've increased our estimate of segment operating margin to a range of 13.5% to 14.5%. As I mentioned earlier, there are a lot of puts and takes in the year-over-year margin comparisons. But overall, throughout the guidance range, we're expecting segment operating earnings conversion of about 60%.
We've increased our fiscal 2010 EPS guidance to a range of $2.60 to $2.90, that compares to our previous EPS guidance range of $2 to $2.40. We now expect the full year tax rate of 19% to 21%, which is basically the lower end of our previous tax rate guidance. Given that we are halfway through the year, as you can see, we have somewhat narrowed both the sales and the earnings guidance range, and we continue to expect free cash flow conversion above 100%.
And now I'll turn it over to Rondi to begin Q&A."

Ford continued to invest throughout the period, and I would say we probably won't see a significant delta there. But the comments I made about large CapEx spending having to pick up in the second half of the year for our products to grow, we do expect at probably in our fourth quarter that we'll see a pickup in automotive project spending, and therefore, some improvement in our product sales from that.

And then also, we would be expecting it to grow or need it to grow, I should say, in the oil and gas sector later in our fiscal year. And with mining, we're expecting that to probably not pick up a lot in -- that we'll see the revenue, but we do expect projects that will improve next year's large capital spending in that vertical. So it's a mixture of across what I would say more of the heavy process industries and then new lines in, what I would call, the consumer transportation types of industries as to what we mean when we say the larger capital projects."

If you remember, we star",630,"I would say there's a lot of pieces there. So let me try to parse it a little and try to get the gist of your question. If you talk about our manufacturing footprint, we believe most of that spending is done at this point in time. If you remember, we started that probably about two years ago and made a significant transformation of our operating footprint into emerging markets. And in particular, at that point, we talked about China; we talked about Singapore; we talked about Latin America, in particular Mexico, to a smaller degree, Brazil; and then Eastern Europe and in particular, Poland. And the strategy was to grow that business, grow that footprint to be able to absorb the growth that we were anticipating at that point, in particular, in the emerging markets. With the significant decline that we had, we accelerated some of those moves to be able to absorb that capacity quicker while we do see our footprint in the higher-cost, mature markets. So that's been going on, and our team has done a great job of moving, I'll just say, in that direction. So I think from an operation standpoint and a manufacturing capacity, obviously, we have to add machines or a line or maybe a ship. But as far as a significant investments, I believe those are behind us at this point in time. The one area that we do have to continue spending in is the evolution of our business systems outside of the United States. And that's something that is still probably a couple of years of investments in our new business system. We're getting close to completion of that from the core functionality. But as far as moving it into Europe, into Latin America and into Asia-Pacific, we still have that in front of us. But I do not believe that will be an incremental spend that we have to take. It's a, I'll just say, a reallocation of our current spending from more North American and more function to more regional activities, so that's that piece of the spending. Where we will see and need to increase spending is in our core technology, in particular, Logix. We are increasing and will continue to increase over the next two years, spending to continue to expand the scalability of that platform and also to increase the functionality and performance of the platform. And that's something, now, that we've been talking about with the community, the financial community, for the last couple of quarters for sure, and that's what Ted mentioned. We didn't ramp up very much in the second quarter, but we know that's in front of us and certainly, is an important dimension of our portfolio. And therefore, we need to continue to improve the investments in that technology. The other area where we will have to continue to incrementally spend, and it's another point that Ted made, is in customer phasing, resources and domain expertise. And what that means is salespeople and Application Engineering or our Solutions businesses that deliver the automation and/or information projects. And obviously, they were expecting the greatest growth in emerging markets, so that's where you will see us putting more spending. It's an area that we try to protect as best we could because, as you know, we made significant investments, particularly in Asia a couple of years ago. And we did not want to take any of that out in the downturn. And now we are in a position and have started adding to that. So investments in emerging markets will be important. And investments in the growth accelerators, that we've outlined at our Analyst Day, would be the areas that you're going to see us putting our next incremental investments into."

There is no question that given the increases that we've seen, we are stretching the supply chain, and we're stretching it quite dramatically. In particular, we have issues on electronic component, isolated issues on electronic components because of the growth in, I'll just call it, the high-tech industries. And in particular, consumer electronics has put a number of those parts on allocation. And Rockwell really is being not treated differently than other manufacturers who are demanding the same parts based upon the increase, and so we're managing through that. The impact has been the greatest in a couple of our Product lines, in our Small Controller business, the MicroLogix business in particular, and some isolated input-output devices. And really, in the rest of our portfolio, we've been able to deal with it. And that's one of the advantages of having a great channel. They're our first line of defense and they've been working very hard and very diligently to help us get through a difficult period, driven by a very quick increase in volume. And obviously, when the supply chain shrunk last year, it shrunk dramatically and people took capacity out, and now they're hesitant to bring it back. So we are experiencing some issues, they're isolated. We're managing those across the portfolios with our channel, with our sales organization. And we believe the increases that we'll see in the second half will not create a bigger problem than we currently have. We think the backlog, if you will, has stabilized. And we expect, over the third quarter, to work this out and to be able to put that behind us, once again, given the current delivery commitments on these parts. So we think we're past the most difficult period, and that we'll work our way through the remainder, over the course of Q3 and certainly, by the end of Q4, be in a very, very solid position."

That includes the cost of the pay increase that we talked about and increased performance-based compensation, and it's split roughly equally between those two.

So that is the way to be thinking about the MRO. It leaves going in, then it kind of stabilizes at a slower growth run rate. And that's the phenomenon that you're seeing in the second half of our year, and it's a normal phenomenon. So I don't think there's anything here that we're surprised at. The surprise was how fast it came, not the fact that it's going to be slowing down as the recovery continues to progress. But we certainly saw such a steep reduction in both CapEx and OpEx second half of last year, that spending just had to come as production picked up. And so as IP, Industrial Production numbers picked up, people had to support that with investments, and that's what drove the MRO strength.

At our last earnings release, I said that we believe we were seeing the signs of the start of a recovery. Our performance in Q1 had exceeded our expectations, particularly in our product businesses, and we significantly increased our revenue and earnings guidance in January. 
Our second quarter provided more good news. It appears that an industrial recovery has taken hold as evidenced by continued improvement in key global and economic indicators like industrial production and PMI, as well as our strong sequential growth in the quarter. I'll talk more about our second half outlook later but first, let me give you my thoughts on the quarter. And as always, Ted will be discussing the numbers in greater detail in his remarks. 
This quarter marked the return to year-over-year organic growth for the first time since Q4 of fiscal 2008. Product revenue in the quarter was once again better than our expectations. We think restocking in our channel benefited Q2 sales by about three points. And we suspect that some of the strength in Product business that we have seen in both Q1 and Q2 was due to pent-up MRO demand. In our solutions and services businesses, revenue declined year-over-year as expected. But the book-to-bill was above one again this quarter. 
Growing volume leverage in the quarter resulted in a seven-point, year-over-year margin improvement and a two-point sequential margin improvement in spite of the incremental cost in the quarter from reversing our temporary cost reductions and some other items that Ted will provide more detail on. And we have continued to deliver very strong free cash flow with careful management of both working capital and capital spending. 
There are some other positive developments in the quarter: Over 13% sequential growth in the U.S. and Canada with continued strength in automotive; strong growth in emerging Asia with 24% year-over-year growth in India and 15% in China; multiple process industry wins against entrenched competitors, especially in water/wastewater and oil and gas; OEM conversions started to bear fruit, validating our focus on these important customers during the downturn. And this impact will become more important as market conditions improve. 
Finally, I want to thank our talented and dedicated employees and partners whose unwavering commitment to our customers enabled these great results. And I'm very pleased to announce that we are now able to implement a pay increase across our global employee base. 
Let me set the stage for our outlook for the second half of the year. While the recovery is underway, the shape of that recovery remains uncertain. The strength in our Product business through Q2 has been largely based on strong MRO demand and smaller projects with some contribution from channel restocking. Even the improvement we have seen in OEM business has been more about machine-level investment and production line level. And we have yet to see any significant improvement in large capital project spending, and it's difficult to know when that might kick in.
So for Products, we believe the second half could range from flat to moderately up compared to the Q2 run rate. To get to the higher end of our revised revenue guidance, we need to see improvement in that large capital project business relatively early in the second half. 
For solutions and services, we do expect significant sequential revenue growth in the second half given the order's performance in Q1 and Q2. With this backdrop and with two quarters of solid performance under our belt, we are providing a revised outlook for fiscal 2010 full year revenues of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion, compared to our previous range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion. As in our previous guidance, to achieve the high end of the range, we need to have meaningful second half over first half revenue growth. 
At these new revenue levels, we do expect to incur some additional compensation expense. And we will increase spending to support growth, particularly in technology, domain expertise and customer-facing resources in emerging markets. We are also raising our earnings per share guidance, the $2.60, to $2.90.
Before I turn this over to Ted, let me provide a few closing comments. The early part of this recovery has been surprisingly strong, and we are now solidly on a year-over-year growth path. As I mentioned earlier, sequential growth rates in the Product business will likely moderate in the second half of the year. But our long-term growth prospects are bright. I am excited by the new opportunities we are seeing everyday, particularly in the areas of process control, OEMs and emerging markets. The entire organization is energized and committed to serving our customers' needs as the recovery progresses. And we know that this commitment to our customer success has provided superior long-term returns for our shareholders in the past, and I believe that this will continue to be the case. 
Now let me turn it over to Ted."
300504,100777487,58605,"Rockwell Automation Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Keith, and good morning to everybody on the call. We've posted charts to our website and my comments will reference those charts. Now building on some of Keith's comments, this was a very good quarter for the company with strong results in sales",1686,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning to everybody on the call. We've posted charts to our website and my comments will reference those charts. 
Now building on some of Keith's comments, this was a very good quarter for the company with strong results in sales, earnings and cash flow. And I'll start the briefing on Chart 1, which is Q2 Results: Summary. Revenue in the quarter was $1,164,000,000, up 10% from Q2 last year with currency contributing five points to the increase. As Keith noted, Q2 represents a return to year-over-year growth and provides evidence of the continued recovery in market conditions. 
Total segment operating earnings were $177 million, up from $86 million in Q2 last year, very strong earnings conversion. I'll discuss that further on the next slide. General Corporate net expense was $23.6 million compared to $14.7 million a year ago. That's a significant year-over-year increase and primarily due to performance-based compensation, where we reversed accruals in Q2 last year and incurred above average expense this year. We also made a contribution to our charitable corporation in Q2 this year.
General Corporate net was about $3 million to $4 million higher in Q2 than our expected quarterly run rate. The $4 million of income shown as a special item in Q2 last year was the reversal of previous restructuring accruals. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 16%. That's considerably below our previous guidance range for the full year estimated rate. We experienced about a five-point benefit in the quarter related to the favorable settlement of a prior-year tax matter. 
EPS from continuing operations was $0.77, up from $0.29 in the second quarter of last year. The tax settlement I referred to contributed about $0.05 in this quarter's results.
We recognized income from discontinued operations of $25 million in quarter two, or $0.18 per share, primarily due to the favorable resolution of tax matters related to the sale of our Power Systems business in fiscal year 2007. So in total, earnings per share for the quarter was $0.95. 
Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $144.4 million, and we resumed share repurchases during Q2 and repurchased approximately 463,000 shares for $25.5 million. We have $596 million remaining under our existing $1 billion repurchase authorization.
Now if you would please turn to Chart 2, Q2 Results: Rockwell Automation Total. On the left side of this slide, you can see the 10% year-over-year sales increase. Sales were up 9% sequentially. We experienced robust growth in our product businesses, year-over-year and sequentially. Solutions and Service business revenues declined year-over-year, but improved somewhat sequentially. 
Moving to the earnings side of the chart. Operating earnings increased by 106% compared to Q2 last year. And you can also see here a significant sequential earnings increase. Operating margin for the quarter was 15.2%, up 7.1 points compared to last year and up 2.4 points sequentially.
The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to higher margins in the Architecture & Software segment, but in total for the company reflects strong volume leverage, improved mix and the impact of our cost-reduction actions from last year. This favorable margin performance in Q2 was realized despite some significant expense increases in the quarter, primarily related to employee compensation. 
As we discussed in the last earnings release, we restored pay cuts and 401(k) match effective on January 1. In addition, we have decided to implement wage and salary increases for employees globally. It will take us a few months to implement this pay increase but we intend to make a payment at implementation to catch up back to January 1. And performance-based compensation expense increased significantly compared to Q2 last year. 
In total, these three items increased expense year-over-year by $42 million in Q2. As a partial offset to these incremental expenses, there were no restructuring costs in Q2 this year compared to a $20 million restructuring charge in last year's second quarter. Obviously, a lot of puts and takes in the quarter with respect to operating earnings and margins are taking all of that into accounts to a very strong earnings conversion.
In January on our earnings call, I mentioned that we intended to begin the increased spending in Q2, and as Keith noted, particularly in the areas of technology, domain expertise and commercial facing resources and emerging markets. Frankly, other than the compensation items I just covered, we didn't see much other spending increase in Q2. After clamping down so tightly last year, spending in these other areas is ramping more slowly than we expected. But we do expect to see increased spending, principally in the targeted areas, in the balance of the year and that's reflected in our revised guidance. We continue to believe we are well-positioned to deliver exceptional year-over-year earnings conversion for the full year, and you'll see that as well reflected in our guidance. 
Although not displayed on the chart, our trailing four-quarter return on invested capital was 13.2%. That's down from 18.7% last year but up from 9.5% last quarter. Through the balance of the year, we expect return on invested capital to steadily improve as we continue to see favorable year-over-year earnings comparisons.
If you would turn to Chart 3, this Chart summarizes the quarter two results of the Architecture & Software segment. Looking at the left side of this Chart, you'll see very strong sales performance in our Architecture & Software segment for the quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of increased sales. Sales were up 31% compared to the same quarter last year, including a six-point contribution from currency. Sequentially, sales increased 10%. Operating margin for the quarter was 23.8%, that's 15.4 points higher than the second quarter of last year and predominantly due to volume leverage. Operating margin improved 2.7 points sequentially. 
Chart 4 covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in Q2 were down 2% compared to last year, an organic decline of 7%, offset by a four-point benefit from currency and one point of growth from acquisitions. Sales in Control Products & Solutions increased 8% sequentially. In the Product businesses of the Control Products & Solutions segment, sales increased both year-over-year and sequentially at rates similar to the Architecture & Software segment. 
In the Solutions and Services businesses of CP&S, sales were down in the mid-teens compared to Q2 last year, but increased about 3% sequentially. Solutions and Service orders have continued to improve with the book-to-bill for Q2 just slightly higher than the 1.15 that we experienced in Q1. Segment operating earnings and operating margin were up slightly from last year on lower sales but better mix. 
On the right side of the slide, you can see a significant sequential operating earnings improvement in Q2 and segment operating margins expanded by 2.1 points sequentially.
Turning to the next chart, Chart 5 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales for Q2. The center column displays overall growth rates by region. The far right column shows growth rates excluding the effects of currency translation. I'll focus my comments on the far right column. In the U.S., sales were up 10% year-over-year, up 13% sequentially. Canadian sales increased 12% compared to prior year, but that includes the effect of an acquisition made last year. Excluding sales from the acquisition, the year-over-year increase was about 4%. Sequentially, Canadian sales increased by 18%. 
In EMEA, sales declined by 7% compared to Q2 last year, but increased 3% sequentially. Asia-Pacific increased by 12% compared to last year and 1% sequentially, an emerging Asia, including China saw 15% growth year-over-year. As Keith mentioned, we had a standout order for India with year-over-year growth of 24%.
Latin America was down 4% year-over-year with improved product revenues offset by declines in the Solutions and Services business. You may recall last year, Latin America held up well through Q2 and then fell off. So compared to the other regions, a relatively more difficult year-over-year comparison for Latin America. Sequentially, Latin America sales increased by 8%.
Now please turn to Chart 6, Free Cash Flow. We're continuing to see strong cash generation and conversion on net income. Free cash flow for the quarter was $167 million, that's despite some increased working capital to support higher sales levels. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $275 million, which represents about 145% conversion. 
Our balance sheet also remains very strong. Related to that, during the quarter, we renewed our 364-day credit facility. The expiring facility was $267.5 million. The new facility is $300 million. There were no difficulties renewing, and we experienced strong interest from the banking community. We have a separate $267.5 million facility expiring on March 15, 2012, so the total amount available under the two facilities is now $567.5 million.
And that brings us to the last chart, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '10. As Keith mentioned, we're revising our full year guidance. We've increased the range of full year sales from the previous guidance of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion to a new guidance range of $4.65 billion to $4.8 billion. 
Excluding currency effects, the new revenue range represents year-over-year growth of between 4% and 8%. We expect currency to contribute about three points to year-over-year growth, that's one point lower than our January guidance. We've increased our estimate of segment operating margin to a range of 13.5% to 14.5%. 
As I mentioned earlier, there are a lot of puts and takes in the year-over-year margin comparisons. But overall, throughout the guidance range, we're expecting segment operating earnings conversion of about 60%.
We've increased our fiscal 2010 EPS guidance to a range of $2.60 to $2.90, that compares to our previous EPS guidance range of $2 to $2.40. We now expect a full year tax rate of 19% to 21%, which is basically the lower end of our previous tax rate guidance. Given that we are halfway through the year, as you can see, we have somewhat narrowed both the sales and the earnings guidance range, and we continue to expect free cash flow conversion above 100%.
And now I'll turn it over to Rondi to begin Q&A."

And, you're right, it has not been largely driven yet by the new platforms, particularly the new platforms at Chrysler and at General Motors. Ford continued to invest throughout the period, and I would say we probably won't see a significant delta there. But the comments I made about large CapEx spending having to pick up in the second half of the year for our products to grow, we do expect at probably in our fourth quarter that we'll see a pickup in automotive project spending, and therefore, some improvement in our product sales from that.

And then also, we would be expecting it to grow or need it to grow, I should say, in the oil and gas sector later in our fiscal year. And with mining, we're expecting that to probably not pick up a lot in -- that we'll see the revenue, but we do expect projects that will improve next year's large capital spending in that vertical. So it's a mixture of across what I would say more of the heavy process industries and then new lines in, what I would call, the consumer transportation types of industries as to what we mean when we say the larger capital projects."

If you talk about our manufacturing footprint, we believe most of that spending is done at this point in time. If you remember, we started that probably about two years ago and made a significant transformation of our operating footprint into emerging markets. And in particular, at that point, we talked about China; we talked about Singapore; we talked about Latin America, in particular Mexico, to a smaller degree, Brazil; and then Eastern Europe and in particular, Poland. And the strategy was to grow that business, grow that footprint to be able to absorb the growth that we were anticipating at that point, in particular, in the emerging markets. With the significant decline that we had, we accelerated some of those moves to be able to absorb that capacity quicker while we do see our footprint in the higher-cost, mature markets. So that's been going on, and our team has done a great job of moving, I'll just say, in that direction. So I think from an operation standpoint and a manufacturing capacity, obviously, we have to add machines or a line or maybe a ship. But as far as a significant investments, I believe those are behind us at this point in time. The one area that we do have to continue spending in is the evolution of our business systems outside of the United States. And that's something that is still probably a couple of years of investments in our new business system. We're getting close to completion of that from the core functionality. But as far as moving it into Europe, into Latin America and into Asia-Pacific, we still have that in front of us. But I do not believe that will be an incremental spend that we have to take. It's a, I'll just say, a reallocation of our current spending from more North American and more function to more regional activities, so that's that piece of the spending. Where we will see and need to increase spending is in our core technology, in particular, Logix. We are increasing and will continue to increase over the next two years, spending to continue to expand the scalability of that platform and also to increase the functionality and performance of the platform. And that's something, now, that we've been talking about with the community, the financial community, for the last couple of quarters for sure, and that's what Ted mentioned. We didn't ramp up very much in the second quarter, but we know that's in front of us and certainly, is an important dimension of our portfolio. And therefore, we need to continue to improve the investments in that technology. The other area where we will have to continue to incrementally spend, and it's another point that Ted made, is in customer phasing, resources and domain expertise. And what that means is salespeople and Application Engineering or our Solutions businesses that deliver the automation and/or information projects. And obviously, they were expecting the greatest growth in emerging markets, so that's where you will see us putting more spending. It's an area that we try to protect as best we could because, as you know, we made significant investments, particularly in Asia a couple of years ago. And we did not want to take any of that out in the downturn. And now we are in a position and have started adding to that. So investments in emerging markets will be important. And investments in the growth accelerators, that we've outlined at our Analyst Day, would be the areas that you're going to see us putting our next incremental investments into."

It was probably the most significant contributor to growth, was the OEM improvements. So we are seeing the growth, Bob, and in particular, CompactLogix' growth in the quarter was up into the high 30s on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So we are seeing that pickup. And we would expect that to continue, in particular, as the volume of those machines, where we made the conversions on over the last year, starts to grow more revenue for the machine builders. So we're very pleased with where we're at, and that's on a global basis. We have very strong OEM programs in Europe, in the U.S. and in Asia-Pacific, in particular, China, and to some degree, the smaller markets in Latin America, both Mexico and Brazil. So we are seeing the growth, I guess, would be my comment, Bob, to your question."

There is no question that given the increases that we've seen, that we are stretching the supply chain, and we're stretching it quite dramatically. In particular, we have issues on electronic component, isolated issues on electronic components because of the growth in, I'll just call it, the high-tech industries. And in particular, consumer electronics has put a number of those parts on allocation. And Rockwell really is being not treated differently than other manufacturers, who are demanding the same parts based upon the increase and so we're managing through that. The impact has been the greatest in a couple of our Product lines, in our Small Controller business, the MicroLogix business, in particular, and some isolated input/output devices. And really, in the rest of our portfolio, we've been able to deal with it. And that's one of the advantages of having a great channel. They're our first line of defense and they've been working very hard and very diligently to help us get through a difficult period, driven by a very quick increase in volume. And obviously, when the supply chain shrunk last year, it shrunk dramatically and people took capacity out, and now they're hesitant to bring it back. So we are experiencing some issues, they're isolated. We're managing those across the portfolios with our channel, with our sales organization. And we believe the increases that we'll see in the second half will not create a bigger problem than we currently have. We think the backlog, if you will, has stabilized. And we expect, over the third quarter, to work this out and to be able to put that behind us, once again, given the current delivery commitments on these parts. So we think we're past the most difficult period, and that we'll work our way through the remainder, over the course of Q3 and certainly, by the end of Q4, be in a very, very solid position."

That includes the cost of the pay increase that we talked about and increased performance-based compensation, and it's split roughly equally between those two. As it relates to performance-based compensation, the one thing I would remind you of is when we talk about that, that is a very broad-based, performance-based compensation plan that kind of works across all of our salaried and hourly employees.

So that is the way to be thinking about the MRO. It leads going in, then it kind of stabilizes at a slower growth run rate. And that's the phenomenon that you're seeing in the second half of our year, and it's a normal phenomenon. So I don't think there's anything here that we're surprised at. The surprise was how fast it came, not the fact that it's going to be slowing down as the recovery continues to progress. But we certainly saw such a steep reduction in both CapEx and OpEx second half of last year, that the spending just had to come as production picked up. And so as IP, Industrial Production numbers picked up, people had to support that with investments, and that's what drove the MRO strength.

At our last earnings release, I said that we believe we were seeing the signs of the start of a recovery. Our performance in Q1 had exceeded our expectations, particularly in our product businesses, and we significantly increased our revenue and earnings guidance in January. 
Our second quarter provided more good news. It appears that an industrial recovery has taken hold as evidenced by continued improvement in key global and economic indicators like industrial production and PMI, as well as our strong sequential growth in the quarter. I'll talk more about our second half outlook later, but first, let me give you my thoughts on the quarter. And as always, Ted will be discussing the numbers in greater detail in his remarks. 
This quarter marked the return to year-over-year organic growth for the first time since Q4 of fiscal 2008. Product revenue in the quarter was once again better than our expectations. We think restocking in our channel benefited Q2 sales by about three points. And we suspect that some of the strength in Product business that we have seen in both Q1 and Q2 was due to pent-up MRO demand. In our Solutions and Services businesses, revenue declined year-over-year as expected. But the book-to-bill was above one again this quarter. 
Growing volume leverage in the quarter resulted in a seven-point, year-over-year margin improvement and a two-point sequential margin improvement in spite of the incremental cost in the quarter from reversing our temporary cost reductions and some other items that Ted will provide more detail on. And we have continued to deliver very strong free cash flow with careful management of both working capital and capital spending. 
There are some other positive developments in the quarter: Over 13% sequential growth in the U.S. and Canada with continued strength in automotive; strong growth in emerging Asia, with 24% year-over-year growth in India and 15% in China; multiple process industry wins against entrenched competitors, especially in water/wastewater and oil and gas. OEM conversions started to bear fruit, validating our focus on these important customers during the downturn, and this impact will become more important as market conditions improve. 
Finally, I want to thank our talented and dedicated employees and partners whose unwavering commitment to our customers enabled these great results. And I'm very pleased to announce that we are now able to implement a pay increase across our global employee base. 
Let me set the stage for our outlook for the second half of the year. While the recovery is underway, the shape of the recovery remains uncertain. The strength in our Product business through Q2 has been largely based on strong MRO demand and smaller projects with some contribution from channel restocking. Even the improvement we have seen in OEM business has been more about machine-level investment and production line level, and we have yet to see any significant improvement in large capital project spending and it's difficult to know when that might kick in.
So for Products, we believe the second half could range from flat to moderately up compared to the Q2 run rate. To get to the higher end of our revised revenue guidance, we need to see improvement in that large capital project business relatively early in the second half. 
For Solutions and Services, we do expect significant sequential revenue growth in the second half given the order's performance in Q1 and Q2. With this backdrop and with two quarters of solid performance under our belt, we are providing a revised outlook for fiscal 2010 full year revenues of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion compared to our previous range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion. As in our previous guidance, to achieve the high end of the range, we need to have meaningful second half over first half revenue growth. 
At these new revenue levels, we do expect to incur some additional compensation expense. And we will increase spending to support growth, particularly in technology, domain expertise and customer-facing resources in emerging markets. We are also raising our earnings per share guidance to $2.60 to $2.90.
Before I turn this over to Ted, let me provide a few closing comments. The early part of this recovery has been surprisingly strong and we are now solidly on a year-over-year growth path. As I mentioned earlier, sequential growth rates in the Product business will likely moderate in the second half of the year. But our long-term growth prospects are bright. I'm excited by the new opportunities we are seeing everyday, particularly in the areas of process control, OEMs and emerging markets. The entire organization is energized and committed to serving our customers' needs as the recovery progresses. And we know that this commitment to our customer success has provided superior long-term returns for our shareholders in the past and I believe that this will continue to be the case. Now let me turn it over to Ted."
300504,100777487,66853,"Rockwell Automation Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Keith, and good morning to everybody on the call. We've posted charts to our website and my comments will reference those charts. Now building on some of Keith's comments, this was a very good quarter for the company with strong results in sales",1686,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning to everybody on the call. We've posted charts to our website and my comments will reference those charts. 
Now building on some of Keith's comments, this was a very good quarter for the company with strong results in sales, earnings and cash flow. And I'll start the briefing on Chart 1, which is, Q2 Results: Summary. Revenue in the quarter was $1,164,000,000, up 10% from Q2 last year with currency contributing five points to the increase. As Keith noted, Q2 represents a return to year-over-year growth and provides evidence of a continued recovery in market conditions. 
Total segment operating earnings were $177 million, up from $86 million in Q2 last year, very strong earnings conversion. I'll discuss that further on the next slide. General Corporate net expense was $23.6 million compared to $14.7 million a year ago. That's a significant year-over-year increase and primarily due to performance-based compensation where we reversed accruals in Q2 last year and incurred above-average expense this year. We also made a contribution to our charitable corporation in Q2 this year.
General Corporate net was about $3 million to $4 million higher in Q2 than our expected quarterly run rate. The $4 million of income shown as a special item in Q2 last year was the reversal of previous restructuring accruals. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 16%. That's considerably below our previous guidance range for the full year estimated rate. We experienced about a five-point benefit in the quarter related to the favorable settlement of a prior-year tax matter. EPS from continuing operations was $0.77, up from $0.29 in the second quarter of last year. The tax settlement I referred to contributed about $0.05 in this quarter's results.
We recognized income from discontinued operations of $25 million in quarter two, or $0.18 per share, primarily due to the favorable resolution of tax matters related to the sale of our Power Systems business in fiscal year 2007. So in total, earnings per share for the quarter was $0.95. 
Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $144.4 million, and we resumed share repurchases during Q2 and repurchased approximately 463,000 shares for $25.5 million. We have $596 million remaining under our existing $1 billion repurchase authorization.
Now if you would please turn to Chart 2, Q2 Results: Rockwell Automation Total. On the left side of this slide, you can see the 10% year-over-year sales increase. Sales were up 9% sequentially. We experienced robust growth in our product businesses, year-over-year and sequentially. Solutions and Service business revenues declined year-over-year, but improved somewhat sequentially. 
Moving to the earnings side of the chart. Operating earnings increased by 106% compared to Q2 last year. And you can also see here a significant sequential earnings increase. Operating margin for the quarter was 15.2%, up 7.1 points compared to last year and up 2.4 points sequentially.
The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to higher margins in the Architecture & Software segment, but in total for the company reflects strong volume leverage, improved mix and the impact of our cost-reduction actions from last year. This favorable margin performance in Q2 was realized despite some significant expense increases in the quarter, primarily related to employee compensation. 
As we discussed in the last earnings release, we restored pay cuts and 401(k) match effective on January 1. In addition, we have decided to implement wage and salary increases for employees globally. It will take us a few months to implement this pay increase but we intend to make a payment at implementation to catch up back to January 1. And performance-based compensation expense increased significantly compared to Q2 last year. 
In total, these three items increased expense year-over-year by $42 million in Q2. As a partial offset to these incremental expenses, there were no restructuring costs in Q2 this year compared to a $20 million restructuring charge in last year's second quarter. Obviously, a lot of puts and takes in the quarter with respect to operating earnings and margins are taking all of that into accounts to a very strong earnings conversion.
In January on our earnings call, I mentioned that we intended to begin the increased spending in Q2, and as Keith noted, particularly in the areas of technology, domain expertise and commercial facing resources and emerging markets. Frankly, other than the compensation items I just covered, we didn't see much other spending increase in Q2. After clamping down so tightly last year, spending in these other areas is ramping more slowly than we expected. But we do expect to see increased spending, principally in the targeted areas, in the balance of the year and that's reflected in our revised guidance. We continue to believe we are well positioned to deliver exceptional year-over-year earnings conversion for the full year, and you'll see that as well reflected in our guidance. 
Although not displayed on the chart, our trailing four-quarter return on invested capital was 13.2%. That's down from 18.7% last year but up from 9.5% last quarter. Through the balance of the year, we expect return on invested capital to steadily improve as we continue to see favorable year-over-year earnings comparisons.
If you would turn to Chart 3, this chart summarizes the quarter two results of the Architecture & Software segment. Looking at the left side of this Chart, you'll see very strong sales performance in our Architecture & Software segment for the quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of increased sales. Sales were up 31% compared to the same quarter last year, including a six-point contribution from currency. Sequentially, sales increased 10%. Operating margin for the quarter was 23.8%, that's 15.4 points higher than the second quarter of last year and predominantly due to volume leverage. Operating margin improved 2.7 points sequentially. 
Chart 4 covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in Q2 were down 2% compared to last year, an organic decline of 7%, offset by a four-point benefit from currency and one point of growth from acquisitions. Sales in Control Products & Solutions increased 8% sequentially. In the Product businesses of the Control Products & Solutions segment, sales increased both year-over-year and sequentially at rates similar to the Architecture & Software segment. 
In the Solutions and Services businesses of CP&S, sales were down in the mid-teens compared to Q2 last year, but increased about 3% sequentially. Solutions and Service orders have continued to improve with the book-to-bill for Q2 just slightly higher than the 1.15 that we experienced in Q1. Segment operating earnings and operating margin were up slightly from last year on lower sales but better mix. 
On the right side of the slide, you can see a significant sequential operating earnings improvement in Q2 and segment operating margins expanded by 2.1 points sequentially.
Turning to the next chart, Chart 5 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales for' Q2. The center column displays overall growth rates by region. The far right column shows growth rates excluding the effects of currency translation. I'll focus my comments on the far right column. In the U.S., sales were up 10% year-over-year, up 13% sequentially. Canadian sales increased 12% compared to prior year, but that includes the effect of an acquisition made last year. Excluding sales from the acquisition, the year-over-year increase was about 4%. Sequentially, Canadian sales increased by 18%. 
In EMEA, sales declined by 7% compared to Q2 last year, but increased 3% sequentially. Asia-Pacific increased by 12% compared to last year and 1% sequentially, an emerging Asia, including China saw 15% growth year-over-year. As Keith mentioned, we had a standout order for India with year-over-year growth of 24%.
Latin America was down 4% year-over-year with improved product revenues offset by declines in the Solutions and Services business. You may recall last year, Latin America held up well through Q2 and then fell off. So compared to the other regions, a relatively more difficult year-over-year comparison for Latin America. Sequentially, Latin America sales increased by 8%.
Now please turn to Chart 6, Free Cash Flow. We're continuing to see strong cash generation and conversion on net income. Free cash flow for the quarter was $167 million, that's despite some increased working capital to support higher sales levels. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $275 million, which represents about 145% conversion. 
Our balance sheet also remains very strong. Related to that, during the quarter, we renewed our 364-day credit facility. The expiring facility was $267.5 million. The new facility is $300 million. There were no difficulties renewing, and we experienced strong interest from the banking community. We have a separate $267.5 million facility expiring on March 15, 2012, so the total amount available under the two facilities is now $567.5 million.
And that brings us to the last chart, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '10. As Keith mentioned, we're revising our full year guidance. We've increased the range of full year sales from the previous guidance of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion to a new guidance range of $4.65 billion to $4.8 billion. 
Excluding currency effects, the new revenue range represents year-over-year growth of between 4% and 8%. We expect currency to contribute about three points to year-over-year growth, that's one point lower than our January guidance. We've increased our estimate of segment operating margin to a range of 13.5% to 14.5%. 
As I mentioned earlier, there are a lot of puts and takes in the year-over-year margin comparisons. But overall, throughout the guidance range, we're expecting segment operating earnings conversion of about 60%.
We've increased our fiscal 2010 EPS guidance to a range of $2.60 to $2.90, that compares to our previous EPS guidance range of $2 to $2.40. We now expect a full year tax rate of 19% to 21%, which is basically the lower end of our previous tax rate guidance. Given that we are halfway through the year, as you can see, we have somewhat narrowed both the sales and the earnings guidance range, and we continue to expect free cash flow conversion above 100%. And now I'll turn it over to Rondi to begin Q&A."

And you're right, it has not been largely driven yet by the new platforms, particularly the new platforms at Chrysler and at General Motors. Ford continued to invest throughout the period, and I would say we probably won't see a significant delta there. But the comments I made about large CapEx spending having to pick up in the second half of the year for our products to grow, we do expect, probably in our fourth quarter that we'll see a pickup in automotive project spending, and therefore, some improvement in our product sales from that.

And then also, we would be expecting it to grow or need it to grow, I should say, in the Oil and Gas sector later in our fiscal year. And with mining, we're expecting that to probably not pick up a lot in -- that we'll see the revenue, but we do expect projects that will improve next year's large capital spending in that vertical. So it's a mixture of across what I would say more of the heavy process industry and then new lines in what I would call the consumer-transportation types of industries as to what we mean when we say the larger capital projects."

If you talk about our manufacturing footprint, we believe most of that spending is done at this point in time. If you remember, we started that probably about two years ago and made a significant transformation of our operating footprint into emerging markets. And in particular, at that point, we talked about China, we talked about Singapore, we talked about Latin America, in particular Mexico, to a smaller degree, Brazil and then Eastern Europe and in particular, Poland. And the strategy was to grow that business, grow that footprint to be able to absorb the growth that we were anticipating at that point, in particular, in the emerging markets. With the significant decline that we had, we accelerated some of those moves to be able to absorb that capacity quicker while reducing our footprint in the higher-cost, mature markets. So that's been going on, and our team has done a great job of moving, I'll just say, in that direction. So I think from an operations standpoint and a manufacturing capacity, obviously, we have to add machines or a line or maybe a ship. But as far as significant investments, I believe, those are behind us at this point in time. The one area that we do have to continue spending in is the evolution of our business systems outside of the United States. And that's something that is still probably a couple of years of investments in our new business system. We're getting close to completion of that from the core functionality. But as far as moving it into Europe, into Latin America and into Asia-Pacific, we still have that in front of us. But I do not believe that will be an incremental spend that we have to take. It's a, I'll just say, a reallocation of our current spending from more North American and more function to more regional activities, so that's that piece of the spending. Where we will see and need to increase spending is in our core technology, in particular, Logix. We are increasing and will continue to increase over the next two years, spending to continue to expand the scalability of that platform and also to increase functionality and performance of the platform. And that's something, now, that we've been talking about with the community, the financial community for the last couple of quarters for sure, and that's what Ted mentioned. We didn't ramp up very much in the second quarter, but we know that's in front of us and certainly is an important dimension of our portfolio. And therefore, we need to continue to improve the investments in that technology. The other area where we will have to continue to incrementally spend, and it's another point that Ted made, is in customer phasing, resources and domain expertise, and what that means is salespeople and Application Engineering or our Solutions businesses that deliver the automation and/or information project. And obviously, there, we're expecting the greatest growth in emerging markets, so that's where you will see us putting more spending. It's an area that we try to protect as best we could because, as you know, we made significant investments, particularly in Asia, a couple of years ago and we did not want to take any of that out in the downturn. And now we are in a position and have started adding to that. So investments in emerging markets will be important. And investments in the growth accelerators that we've outlined at our Analysts Day would be the areas that you're going to see us putting our next incremental investments into."

There is no question that given the increases that we've seen, that we are stretching the supply chain, and we're stretching it quite dramatically. In particular, we have issues on electronic component, isolated issues on electronic components because of the growth in, I'll just call it, the high-tech industries. And in particular, consumer electronics has put a number of those parts on allocation. And Rockwell really is being not treated differently than other manufacturers, who are demanding the same parts based upon the increase and so we're managing through that. The impact has been the greatest in a couple of our Product lines, in our Small Controller business, the MicroLogix business, in particular, and some isolated input/output devices. And really, in the rest of our portfolio, we've been able to deal with it, and that's one of the advantages of having a great channel. They're our first line of defense and they've been working very hard and very diligently to help us get through a difficult period driven by a very quick increase in volume. And obviously, when the supply chain shrunk last year, it shrunk dramatically and people took capacity out and now they're hesitant to bring it back. So we are experiencing some issues, they're isolated. We're managing those across the portfolios with our channel, with our sales organization, and we believe the increases that we'll see in the second half will not create a bigger problem than we currently have. We think the backlog, if you will, has stabilized. And we expect over the third quarter to work this out and to be able to put that behind us once again, given the current delivery commitments on these parts. So we think we're past the most difficult period, and that we'll work our way through the remainder over the course of Q3 and certainly, by the end of Q4, be in a very, very solid position."

That includes the cost of the pay increase that we talked about and increased performance-based compensation and it's split roughly equally between those two.

So thank you for the question. And one of the reason, we do expect that, that pent-up demand does taper off to some degree, and that's why we have a little slower growth in the second half of the year in our Products business, because it has to come from new projects as opposed to just the MRO piece of it. So that is the way to be thinking about the MRO. It leads going in, then it kind of stabilizes at a slower growth run rate. And that's the phenomenon that you're seeing in the second half of our year, and it's a normal phenomenon. So I don't think there's anything here that we're surprised at. The surprise was how fast it came, not the fact that it's going to be slowing down as the recovery continues to progress. But we certainly saw such a steep reduction in both CapEx and OpEx second half of last year, that the spending just had to come as production picked up. And so as IP, Industrial Production numbers picked up, people had to support that with investments, and that's what drove the MRO strength. So a natural phenomenon, very solid, very steep at the start because of the drop, and now starting to flatten out in the second half."

And then in terms of the restocking, it just seems that as you look at the second half of the year, I know there's some mix changes in the growth rate relative to this last quarter, may not be as significant. But it just seems like there's some potential for some more restocking based on kind of your bigger picture outlook. And so should we think of it as three points this quarter, it was one point in the fiscal first quarter. I mean, it sounds like you still see some restocking taking place in the second half."

And as Keith mentioned, on the Product side, our guidance says, at the low end, it would be rather flat to the Q2 run rate and at the high end, we're up mid-single digits to the Q2 run rate. I mean, if we're up, if we hit closer to the high end, there will be some natural restocking. I think our message is, we don't think that's a big number. It's not going to be another 3% per quarter going forward, even at the high end, it might be 1%."

And we would expect to have similar numbers that you've seen this quarter on a year-over-year basis. So we've made great inroads in China, particularly at OEM. And also with the stimulus spending that has been going on in China, that has driven a lot of our business, and the automotive activities are also very positive there. So we see the continued evolution to a more consumer-based economy, and we think that bodes well for us in addition to the OEM activities and the pickup of our ability to address a broader perspective. A broader suite of oil and gas industry applications in China are opportunities for us to continue to drive that higher growth rate."
