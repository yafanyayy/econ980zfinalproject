We're pleased with our first quarter performance, which was better than last year's due, in part, to improved advertising and affiliate revenue at our Media Networks and better attendance in our Parks and Resorts. At",803,"Thank you, Lowell, and good afternoon. We're pleased with our first quarter performance, which was better than last year's due, in part, to improved advertising and affiliate revenue at our Media Networks and better attendance in our Parks and Resorts. At this point, we have limited visibility regarding the economy and its impact on our businesses. And, thus, we will continue to focus on controlling costs, while creating great content and experiences in building our brands. We're also maintaining our focus on long-term growth strategies and a world of rapid technological change and evolving consumer behavior. Our Movie Studio, under its new leadership, is focused on improving its creative performance through high-quality branded films, Disney, Pixar and Marvel. The Studio is also restructured its organization to produce market and distribute movies more efficiently in light of the challenges the Movie business is facing. This will help reduce costs and better position the Studio with regard to the timing, pricing and distribution of its films.Through our long-term commitment to 3D, we, and the others in the film industry, have proved that a better experience can draw more people to the theater and increase box office. We're excited about our upcoming live-action slate, including Alice in Wonderland; Prince of Persia; Sorcerer's Apprentice; and Iron Man 2, the first Marvel film to be released since we completed our acquisition. Tron, our December live-action release, is looking very promising. And we're about to start production on Pirates 4 [Pirates Of The Caribbean 4], which will be released in May of 2011.On the animation side, we're thrilled with Toy Story 3, which is not only a terrific film from a creative perspective, but represents the essence of our franchise strategy. With a great new story filled with beloved characters, this highly-anticipated film has been embraced by the creative teams across Disney, who would develop new merchandise, video games and experiences at our Parks and Resorts.The second installment of Cars, another strong franchise for the company, will hit theaters in the summer of 2011. And speaking of great Pixar animation, I'd like to congratulate Pete Docter and the team that created UP, which last week received five Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Animated Picture. I'd also like to congratulate the animation team at Disney behind The Princes and the Frog, which also received the Best Animated Picture nomination, as well as two others. We wish them all our best for March 7, when the Academy Awards air on ABC.At Media Networks, we've been pleased with the success of our Wednesday night ABC comedy block of The Middle, Modern Family and Cougar Town and the strength shown by such returning dramas as Grey's Anatomy, Castle and, particularly, Lost, which delivered terrific ratings in its final season premiere last week. We're also benefiting from the growing international strength of Disney Channel and the record ratings performance of ESPN. It's clear that ESPN's investment in programming and production values is delivering great results, while their innovative use of new technology platforms is allowing them to serve fans in new ways to reach more people and to build their brand worldwide. At Parks and Resorts, we've continued to invest in enhancing the guest experience, as well as increasing our scope of attractions and destinations. Over the last few weeks, we've started to work on significant expansion projects at Hong Kong Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom at Disney World. Construction is also well underway at our Aulani Resort in Hawaii, which will open late next year. This summer, our expansion and improvement of California venture begins to roll out with a magnificent new experience world of color, while next January, the Disney Dream, the first of our two new cruise ships, will set sale on its maiden voyage.It's now five weeks since we closed the Marvel deal, and there's a great deal of enthusiasm and a lot of work going on to pursue opportunities in the Content, Development and Licensing businesses worldwide. The prospect of growing the Marvel brand and expanding the presence of its characters and stories on our media platforms at our Disney stores and through our worldwide retail presence is really exciting.In closing, we believe our consistent strategic focus, our innovative use of technology and our growing range of high-quality branded content puts us in a good competitive position to deliver long-term growth. And now I'd like to introduce our new CFO, Jay Rasulo. Jay has done a fantastic job for us at Parks and Resorts and has been with the company since the 80s. He is committed to our focus on return on invested capital, strong free cash flow, improving economic profit and growing the company. I think you're all going to really enjoy getting to know him in the coming months. And here he is, Jay Rasulo."

I'm excited to be here. In my comments this afternoon, I'm going to address three important topics: First, the drivers of our Q1 results; second, some of the key swing factors that will influence our performance",1059,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm excited to be here. In my comments this afternoon, I'm going to address three important topics: First, the drivers of our Q1 results; second, some of the key swing factors that will influence our performance for the remainder of the year; and last, though visibility remains limited across our businesses, I'm going to talk a little bit about the trends that we're currently seeing in the marketplace. I'll begin with Studio Entertainment.Operating income improved over the prior year, driven by domestic Home Entertainment, while our marketing, distribution and packaging costs, in addition to decreased amortization expense, were the main reasons for this improvement.  Results in the quarter were reduced somewhat by higher film write-downs and lower music album sales compared to the prior year. Bob talked about our important upcoming theatrical releases. I'm sure it's obvious that the performances of these films will be a key swing factor in our full-year financial results.At our Media Networks, higher affiliate revenue at Disney Channel worldwide contributed to increased profits for the segment. Additionally, ESPN delivered higher affiliate and advertising revenue in Q1, which more than offset increases in programming costs due to College Football, Premier League football in the U.K. and the NFL [National Football League].Ad revenues for ESPN came in mid-single-digit percentage points above the prior year, Q1. Notably, ESPN enjoyed record ratings in Q1, up over 7% from prior year, driven by Monday Night Football and College Football. We recorded lower income in Q1 from our equity networks due to higher programming expenses in addition to restructuring costs.Broadcasting operating income was higher compared to prior year, largely as a result of the bad debt expense associated with the Tribune bankruptcy filing that was incurred in last year's first quarter. ABC Studios enjoyed a higher revenue from sales of its shows, particularly, Criminal Minds. ABC Network advertising revenue, excluding Sports, declined in the quarter due to lower prime time ratings and lower average pricing, even the scatter CPMs came in more than 20% above upfront levels. Advertising at our TV stations was 5% lower than last quarter when there were strong political ad sales. So far in Q2, scatter pricing for ABC Network is running almost 30% above upfront levels. Ad sale phasing to the ESPN are up mid-single digits from prior year. However, advertisers continue to make their purchases very close to air dates, limiting our ability to read longer-term trends.Our Interactive Media segment reported lower revenue because we released fewer video game titles in the quarter. Operating loses were trimmed through lower marketing and other costs at Disney Interactive Studios. At Disney Online, Club Penguin saw a strong growth in paid subscriptions, contributing to better results. At Consumer Products, lower licensing revenue impacted our results. Earned revenue decreased by 18% compared to prior Q1 when we benefited from strong sales of Hannah Montana and High School Musical merchandise. For the remainder of the year, results at both Interactive Media and Consumer Products segment will be heavily influenced by the success of their respective initiatives tied to the theatrical release, Toy Story 3.At Parks and Resorts, domestic attendance came in 9% higher than prior years. These results benefited from the calendar shift of the New Year's holiday into Q1 this year and the second quarter of the prior year. We estimate that without this shift, combined domestic attendance was up approximately 4%, with Disneyland, up 15%, and Walt Disney, down by one percentage point.Segment operating income came in 2% below prior Q1 as higher results at our domestic operations did not fully offset lower results at Disneyland Paris. Performance of Disneyland Paris decreased due to lower attendance and hotel occupancy. Domestically, our promotional activities helped to maintain the high levels of attendance during the quarters, but contributed to lower average guest spending and ticket pricing. Per capita guest spending decreased by 4%. Occupancy in Orlando came in four percentage points lower than in the prior year at 81%, while occupancy in Anaheim was down seven percentage points at 78%. Average room spending at our hotels was up slightly, with strength at Walt Disney World resorts, offsetting a decrease at our hotels at Disneyland.The costs at our domestic operations improved over the first quarter when our results were impacted by a roughly $40 million in mark-to-market adjustment for fuel hedges. Costs also benefited from lower volume-driven expenses, as well as productivity savings. Together, these factors helped to offset higher pension, postretirement medical and labor inflation costs.More broadly, consumers remain tentative. Room reservations for Q2 are currently running 10% behind last year, while guests continue to book their vacations closer to their anticipated travel date. There are several other swing factors that I'd like to mention. I'll remind you that we expect our pension and postretirement medical expenses to increase by approximately $270 million this fiscal year over last year's level. Roughly half of this increase hits the Parks and Resorts segment. It's also worth noting that our fiscal calendar makes quarterly year-over-year comparisons difficult. Let me go through the changes.Unlike last year, Q2 results will not include the New Year's holiday, which fell in Q1 this fiscal year. Q2 will include one week of the two-week Easter holiday, both weeks of which fell in Q3 last year. Additionally, results in fiscal 2009 benefited from a 53rd week, whereas our fiscal 2010 calendar has only 52 weeks. During Q1, we purchased only a moderate number of shares given the constraints imposed by our then pending acquisition of Marvel. We intend to buy back the shares we issued for the acquisition by the end of fiscal 2010, and we expect the deal to be dilutive to our reported EPS by mid-single-digit percentages in fiscal 2010.While we're pleased with our Q1 results, I'd again caution that both advertisers and consumers are making their buying decisions at the last minute, and we expect the operating environment to remain challenging in the coming quarters. We've maintained financial discipline since the economic downturn began. We plan to continue that focus going forward. At the same time, we will build our business for the future by investing in high-quality branded content and experiences that we believe will allow us to drive long-term growth and value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Lowell for Q&A."

I just wanted to check and see if there weren't anything meaningfully positive or negative year-on-year on the affiliate fee side. And then on the Parks, you took a lot of action last year in terms of headcount and rationalizing the cost structure. Some of that seem to flow through this quarter. I wonder if you could help sort of size that up for us as we think about 2010 versus 2009. And then just a bigger picture question, Bob, if you could talk about how you're thinking about ESPN as you start to enter in some renegotiations on affiliate fees. I think from talking with investors, a lot of the concerns around Disney, as a stock, and ESPN, as a business, is whether there is a significant upside to the affiliate fees that are currently generating in the U.S. Could you sort of talk philosophically about how you think about approaching those negotiations and positioning the business as you look for potential increases on the fee front?"

There is nothing material in the first quarter that we need to talk about. Relative to Parks' costs, I talked about some specifics. The mark-to-market on the fuel hedge from last year is about $40 million of the savings. And then there's a group of savings that are simply related to the volume declines, particularly Walt Disney World where I mentioned a 1% of volume decline and, of course, there are direct costs that go directly with those. Coming to the last part of your question about pulling forward the cost savings from 2009, so far, the team has done an excellent job at pulling those savings forward. So you know we took a restructuring charge last year, and we talked about the reduction in headcount that we did. And so far, those costs seem to be well-managed and continue to carry us forward for this year."

And as you'd expect, I wouldn't attempt to, and any way, predict certainly publicly where future negotiations may go. I will say that as evidenced by the fantastic ratings performance of ESPN in the quarter that we just announced, clearly, our investment in its programming and its brand are paying off. And with that, we're delivering more value to advertisers and more value to distributors, while the consumer is clearly paying heed as well, as I said, is evidenced by the great ratings. So we think that our position for ESPN going into a new round of negotiations is actually quite solid because of the value that we're generating. I also want to point out that the distributors do quite well with ESPN, not just because of the overall value that we deliver, but the adds that they sell at a local basis are worth considerable amount to the individual distributors, and ESPN generates more advertising revenue than any other channel in the cable universe."

It's pretty clear that the higher end console games are a little bit more challenged in a world where not only they more costly to produce end market, but there's just much more competition from casual games and games on platforms like the iPhone, iTouch platform. We also learned that the typical game that we set out to make, which I'll call a Disney branded game, seems to perform better on the Nintendo Wii and DS platforms and on the platforms, basically, that are not to the high end console games. And so while we're going to continue to make games for the high end, we'll be very, very judicious in how many and which ones we choose. We're looking forward to our Toy Story 3 game, which will come out basically on all platforms. We're looking forward to the one that we are in development on for Mickey Mouse. We're looking forward to Tron. And then we have another really, really interesting racing game that also comes out relatively soon, called Split/Second, by the way, which got a fair amount of attention when it was first brought out at E3. But I'd say that our focus is going to be a little bit more diverse and a little bit less reliant on the highest end console games. We'll still maintain a similar mix of roughly 80% that would be Disney branded. I want to also mention, by the way, that we think we have some interesting opportunities with Marvel and that would be a brand that we think would do extremely well on the higher-end consoles. And at the same time, we're looking to be a little bit more judicious in that area. We are looking to step up our efforts on the casual games front and on the Apple platforms, including the iPad. Since this might come up later, we're already talking about, and, in fact, developing a product for ABC; for Disney, including a pretty cool digital books product; for ESPN, which would probably be an even better version of their ScoreCenter app; and also for Marvel."

As I say, we restructured all areas, but if you're going to look at one that I will consider the most important, it would be on the creative front and that starts really with the change that was made at the top with Rich Ross, because the number one priority of the Studio is to improve the quality of their output. And I would say that you really won't see real results of that until 2011, although I will say that Rich is applying its considerable creative talent to making sure that the films they inherited that were not finished are finished in a quality level that we're really excited about. And we are, in fact, quite excited about the films that are coming up: Alice in Wonderland, which is our March title; Toy Story 3, of course, this summer; Prince of Persia; Sorcerer's Apprentice; and Tron. And on the other side of the reorganization, we've also consolidated a fair amount in terms of our approach to distributing and marketing our product. We had separate groups that were doing those things for the theatrical window and then for the home video window.

And we know that there are stations, in some cases, our affiliates who have been compensated for retransmission consent, and we feel that we should be compensated as well. It clearly, would not be your preference to see that our signal was taken down and we'll do whatever we possibly can through negotiation to avoid that. But we also believe that we have an obligation to derive value from the great investment that we make in these programs, whether they're local in nature or whether they are national in nature. We have every, every intention of doing just that. On the digital front, clearly, it's still evolving. Although I took note that, how our digital revenues as a company had nicely exceeded $2 billion in 2009. Some of that is commerce and some of that comes from the distribution of our, what I'll call film entertainment. We find that the iPad has a lot of potential. We think it's a really compelling device. We think it could be a game changer in terms of enabling us to create essentially, new forms of content. Obviously, it will be a great device to play games on and to watch videos because of the quality of the screen. But the interactivity that it will allow on a portable device with such a high quality screen, is going to enable us to really start developing product that is different than the product that you typically see on the an internet connected computer or on a television set. And the digital reader that we're talking about, we've put in the marketplace, a digi-books product through our Disney publishing group just recently. We haven't really market it in earnest because, while it's not really in beta, but we're still working through some of the issues that you deal with when you launch a new product like that. And we were developing it primarily for the computer screen, and we started developing it for the iTunes, I should say for the iPhone, iTouch platform, and suddenly, this device comes along and provides us with an even more robust technological  platform, that makes the interactivity that we are going to provide. Things like read-alongs, simple animation, music to just sort of come to life. And that's just one example. When you think about ABC, you think about a program like Lost, and not just being able to watch the program, but all the other things that viewers like to do with that program. ABC News, another great example; ESPN ScoreCenter, which is a great app on the iPhone and provides relatively, rudimentary information, scores basically. Suddenly, we have an opportunity with a platform where you can really make the scores come to life. So we're thinking about it in those terms. And we think that digital media, while clearly it's significant, it's still evolving. If I'm to say, it's still the beginning of the beginning and that's how we look at it."

By the way, I don't think that the discounting ever got up as high as what you mentioned, 45%. I think it never, in my recollection got above the 30s. But anyway, you could already see this year, it's both reflected in the numbers, as well as in what is offered in the market. About half of the room inventory at Walt Disney World we went from a four plus three, buy four and get three free to buy five and get two free. And we also reduced the pre-dining option for value rooms. And at Disneyland, we saw a similar decrease in gift cards and whatnot. So they are clearly starting to moderate discounts already, but I will tell you that it's not crystal clear looking forward, what the best tactics will be to eventually make our way out of discounting, which I think is not only probable, and possible, but we will see in the coming quarters. So we look at every quarter as we can and gauge response from consumers and act accordingly. So yes, it probably won't be flipping the switch off, it will be a gradual buildup out of it."

I don't like to look at the DVD business on a quarter-to-quarter basis because it often is an apples-to-oranges comparison given the nature of the releases. What we're generally seeing in the DVD market is continued pressure, and that's due to a number of factors. Clearly, the economy is one factor. Another factor is more secular in nature, there's more competition in the marketplace for people's time, particularly time spent on entertainment. And I think that piracy, at least in some markets, not necessarily just the United States, but some markets internationally, is also taking its toll. And so we really feel that we need to be cautious in terms of the movie business overall because of the pressure on that very, very important window. And that's why, by the way, we've been in discussions about windowing with the exhibitors, because we feel that it's really important for us to maintain a very healthy business on the exhibition side, and 3D is definitely contributing to that. And a very healthy business on the home video side, which we think is actually the best interest of the theater owners. A healthy movie business is good for them. They want us investing in innovation, investing in higher quality content. And so mindful of what's going on in the home video side, we feel that it's time on a case-by-case basis, movie-by-movie to really take a look at how we're windowing the home video product into the marketplace."

I think that in Q1, I would call our volume, our total volume domestically was up. I would call our volume at World, flat. And so I don't think there's, either any change in the strategy and tactics that we're using. Frankly, there isn't any change in the results either other than the fact that Disneyland attendance was much higher for the quarter."

So you maintain pricing, meaning higher pricing to a point. And if the marketplace doesn't respond to that, then that's when you judiciously roll out your promotional strategy. And some of that, by the way, is just a matter of timing. I'm pretty confident that we're going to be able to deliver as Jay said, the volume that we need over the course of this year. The question is, how much will we have to discount to get it, and with visibility being relatively limited it's difficult for us to predict exactly what that will be. Our goal of course, is to slowly wean our guests of discounting. Because we don't believe that we're dealing with an economy right now, that enables us to shut off the discounting immediately."

We have a relatively decent mix of inventory to go. There is not that much inventory left in the prime time marketplace though. Our information suggests that our competitors are extremely well sold, I'm not going to compare how much is left to go in scatter in terms of the amount of inventory but there's still a fair amount to sell. And as I said, we've got a good mix. And with scatter pricing the way it is, we feel pretty good about it. I should also add that scatter had been strong earlier in the quarter they we're currently in, and then it slowed slightly and then we've just seen a fairly new and robust wave of spending again which is actually a good indication.

Let me start off by saying how thrilled we are with the global success of Iron Man 2, which to date has grossed $334 million in global box office. It makes me even more enthusiastic about the great things Marvel and Disney can do together to build the value of the Marvel brand, its array of great characters and about our upcoming Marvel movies, Thor and Captain America. 
Our strong second quarter performance was driven in part by Disney's Alice in Wonderland. This visually stunning and highly entertaining motion picture has, to date, grossed over $962 million in global box office, making it Disney's second highest performing film ever, both U.S. and worldwide, and the number seven movie of all time. And we're excited, too, about our upcoming summer slate, which includes Prince of Persia, Toy Story 3 and Sorcerer's Apprentice. 
Under the new studio leadership, a focus on franchise films, such as Toy Story 3, is an important part of our growth strategy. And as we've discussed before, when a franchise film is successful at Disney, many of our businesses benefit, driving superior returns.
With sequels of Cars, Pirates and Monsters, Inc. arriving over the next two fiscal years, the opportunities to create additional value from these properties are tremendous. At our Media Networks, we're continuing to build on our strengths. ESPN has invested in the world's most exciting sports events and presents them in an integrated and engaging way. The NBA Finals are a great example of how ESPN weaves live sports, great reporting and up-to-the-minute stats into a compelling, cross-platform package that serves both consumers and advertisers. We're planning the same for the upcoming FIFA World Cup in South Africa. ESPN's innovation and emphasis on quality continue to drive strong ratings, and I'm particularly proud of the work ESPN has done in digital media. 
We are just a week away from the announcement of ABC's fall primetime schedule. I'm confident in the team's long-term track record and its ability to develop great new shows, like the current Wednesday night comedy block, and to generate new excitement along around long-standing series such as Dancing with the Stars, Grey's Anatomy and The Bachelor. With the scatter market strong, we are anticipating a very good upfront market. 
We're also pleased with the creative strengths of Disney Channel and ABC Family, which continue to perform exceptionally well with great original programming. Disney Channel has new hits in Phineas and Ferb and Good Luck Charlie, while Disney XD is building share among its target audience of boys. Both are international presence that's bringing the Disney brand into people's homes throughout the world. 
We're also developing a Marvel block of programs for our XD channel. For its part, ABC family is doing an excellent job of winning over Millennials, a particularly sought-after demographic. At our Parks and Resorts, over the next two years, a magnificent new resort will open in Hawaii, two new cruise ships will set sail and expansion of Disneyland Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland are coming along nicely.
The rollout of our additions and improvements to Disney's California Adventure begins next month with World of Color, an exciting nighttime spectacular.  The Disney Dream, the first of our new ships, will embark on its maiden voyage in the early part of calendar 2011. Together, these investments and our continuing emphasis on providing guests distinctive, high-quality experiences should serve Disney well as the economy improves, allowing a return to more normal pricing. Jay will elaborate later.
Our strategy is to create the best in branded entertainment; to use technology, both to make that entertainment more compelling and to reach more people; and to expand Disney's presence and promising global markets. But we've also taken steps to improve our operational agility and to challenge long-standing business models in order to better serve consumers. 
The creation of exciting new devices like the iPad, the growth of social media platforms and the choice demanded by consumers in how and when they enjoy their entertainment, offers incredible opportunities for companies like Disney strong brands, quality creative content and a willingness to be innovative and aggressive in the way content is created, marketed and distributed.
As the economy improves, I'm pleased the approach we've taken continues to be paying off. We were resilient during the downturn and laid the groundwork for future growth through our acquisition of Marvel and our continued investments in media and at our Parks and Resorts. Success rests on our continued ability to create quality content, to manage costs carefully and to be disciplined in our strategy and nimble in our execution. 
And with that, I'd like to turn things over to Jay."
191564,98931756,60956,"Walt Disney Co., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, May-11-2010",2010-05-11,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid Q2 results with growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. The economy continues to improve, and this is benefiting our businesses to varying degrees. Studio Entertainment was",884,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid Q2 results with growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. The economy continues to improve, and this is benefiting our businesses to varying degrees. Studio Entertainment was the largest driver of our year-over-year increase in operating income in Q2. Our theatrical releases, particularly Alice in Wonderland, strongly outperformed last year's slate, contributing to higher results. In addition to Iron Man 2, as Bob mentioned, our summer releases, including Prince of Persia, Toy Story 3 and Sorcerer's Apprentice, will obviously be key drivers of our performance for the remainder of the year.
Results at Media Networks came in flat to last year's Q2. At Cable Networks, higher affiliate and advertising revenue at ESPN more than offset an increase in costs coming primarily from sports rights for premier league football in the U.K., college basketball and the NBA. ESPN's ad revenues were up by mid-single-digit percentage points in the quarter. Due to a shift in our fiscal calendar, 12 college ballgames that were in Q2 last year moved to Q1 this year. We estimate that if these college ballgames had aired in Q2 this year, ESPN's ad revenue would have been a few percentage points higher. 
At ESPN, recognition of a portion of our affiliate revenue is dependent on when we deliver a certain quantity of sports programming. You may recall that last year, we achieved some of these programming commitments during our fourth fiscal quarter. This year, we expect to reach more programming commitments in the third quarter. As a result, we currently expect we'll have a year-over-year increase in net affiliate revenue recognition of at least $155 million in Q3. 
At Broadcasting, softer primetime ratings and higher programming costs at the ABC Network impacted Q2 results. We also incurred higher production cost amortization related to sales of ABC shows. Scatter pricing came in more than 35% above upfront levels. Ad revenue at our own TV stations came in 20% above prior Q2, led by increases primarily in automotive, political and retail categories. Thus far in Q3, scatter pricing for the ABC Network is running 30% above upfront levels. Ad sales at both ESPN and our TV stations are pacing up by double digits versus prior year. 
At Parks and Resorts, operating income came in 12% below prior Q2. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, we've been reducing the depth of our promotional offers. We have done this with the expectation that we will make near-term trade-offs between rate and volume. In Q2, we saw an improvement in both guest and per-room spending but a decline in occupied rooms. Attendance at our domestic parks came in 4% lower than prior-year levels, with Walt Disney World down 6% and Disneyland flat. 
As we mentioned previously, Q2 had shifts in two holiday weeks in the fiscal year. New Year's week moved from Q2 to Q1 and one week of Easter holiday moved into Q2 from Q3. We estimate that without these calendar shifts, combined attendance was nearly flat to the prior year. Per capita guest spending was up by 5%.
Occupancy at our Orlando hotels came in eight percentage points lower than prior-year levels at 81%, while Anaheim occupancy was down two percentage point at 67%. Per-room spending at our hotels came in 8% above prior-year levels, with an increase at Walt Disney World and a decline at our Disneyland resorts. 
Results at our Cruise Line were affected by increased fuel costs and higher promotional activities. For the segment as a whole, savings from lower volume-related expenses and cost mitigation activities help to partially offset higher expenses from inflation and pension and post-retirement medical costs. Q3 hotel reservations on the books are pacing 10% behind prior year. Again, we are not surprised by this since we are beginning to return to more normalized pricing levels. During fiscal 2011, we expect to no longer widely offer the deep discounts we've had in the market over the last 18 months.
At Consumer Products, the increase in operating income was driven by higher results at licensing, publishing and the Disney stores. Licensing revenue benefited from strong retailer response to Toy Story merchandise. Marvel properties added to segment licensing revenue, but this gain was largely offset by cost of sales and amortization of intangible assets related to Marvel. Earned licensing revenue grew by 4% on a comparable basis. The increase of publishing reflects growth from Marvel properties. At Disney Stores North America, we saw an improvement in comparable store sales.
Given our strong balance sheet and cash flow, we remain committed to buying back the shares we issued for the Marvel acquisition by the end of fiscal 2010. So far this fiscal year, we've repurchased over 11 million shares or roughly $370 million. We are pleased with the results we delivered in the first half of the year. They reflect not only the financial discipline we've maintained through the downturn but also the steps we've taken to become more efficient and position our businesses for long-term growth. 
More importantly, we've done this while maintaining our focus on creating high-quality branded entertainment and investing in key growth initiatives that we believe will position us to continue to deliver shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Lowell."

And with that, they've taken substantial costs out, Spencer, in a variety of different ways including the substantial reduction in people. The chatter that you referred to about CNN is interesting in that we explored with CNN a few years ago a joint venture. We were unable to conclude an agreement with them. We're not in discussions with them now about something similar. To the question you asked about costs, we are not looking to outsource news at the ABC Television Network.

On the theme park's front, though, we said when we acquired Marvel that there were encumbrances in the United States and in Japan, notably between Marvel and Universal, deals that were done a long time ago. And so Marvel presence in our parks, at least in the short-term, is likely to be somewhat limited in nature. However, in all the other businesses, there's quite a lot of activity. On the games front and in digital media in general, there's been a fair amount of development and discussion. And in fact, as you know, we've gone into the self-publishing business at least on the console side of that business. And we are starting to develop some Marvel properties that will be published by us. We're looking for other opportunities on the games front as well. It's obviously a much more diverse business than just the console business. We're also discussing with Marvel a variety of other digital media strategies, including social networking opportunities, as well as things like mobile apps, and in fact, Marvel launched a great app for the iPad just last month. Licensing is probably where most of the activity is coming. Marvel had a very successful global licensing operation, as do we. There's a significant amount of integration going on, not just in the U.S., but in markets all around the world. Marvel working with Disney teams in places like India and China looking for opportunities in Japan, looking how to both reduce costs and grow licensing revenue in Europe and Latin America. So I'd say that's where the most activity and where the most opportunity is. There's also an opportunity to sell Marvel goods on Disney platforms. You can go to Disney.com to the store, and you'll see that we're selling Iron Man merchandise there. We're looking also for the opportunity to potentially sell Marvel merchandise at our parks. I mentioned in my remarks, we're developing a Marvel block of television programming for Disney XD, and we have two series in production and/or development, and we hope that, that will expand significantly over the next few years. So we think we have a big opportunity in terms of television. And then of course, once the Paramount distribution deal is fulfilled, it's our intention for the Disney Studio to step in and become the global distributor of Marvel's motion pictures and videos. Great opportunity as we cited when we announced the acquisition. I've said a number of times that we're impressed with the Marvel team. And if anything, since the acquisition, I think our enthusiasm has increased because of the quality of their people and the quality of the product and you opportunity to take that product, particularly in a world where technology is more friend than foe and distribute it more readily and in more compelling ways is pretty exciting."

Until we choose the programs for the fall and determine how many will be bought, it's difficult to predict what ABC's expense line will be. But there doesn't seem to be any real forces in the marketplace that would suggest that the costs are going to go up. On the ESPN front, as we've said in the past, international growth while continuing, is still relatively difficult to achieve, mostly because in order to really grow a sports platform or channel in these international markets, you have to spend very, very heavily on the most popular sports in each market. And in most cases, in the big markets, you have an embedded platform owner, Sky in the U.K. is a great example of this, that is going after the same rights in order to grow subscriptions to their overall platform. Since we do not own a distribution platform, we actually enter the sports rights market at a relative disadvantage to those that own platforms. So while we're pleased with the growth of ESPN internationally from what had been, basically, a losing business some 5 to 10 years ago to a profitable business, we do not believe that international growth for ESPN can rival that of other U.S.-based cable programs services that either can leverage the programming that they buy in the United States globally or by programs under less competitive circumstances in international markets."

We are not forcing sequels though into the system unless we've got directors and storytellers that have good ideas for those sequels. Because we feel that we’ll do more damage either to the franchise or to our business if we just put sequels out there for the sake of making sequels. I think you'll see when Toy Story 3 comes out exactly what we mean. We had a director and a group of storytellers that had a great story to tell and a real passion for telling it. And therefore, we put it into production. The same thing is true with Cars 2 and the same thing with Monsters. We didn't mandate a sequel to any of those.

And when applied, we think 3D should be applied well and not done in a last-minute sort of paste-it-on kind of approach. Because we think that if, one, we make films in 3D that don't really benefit from them being in 3D, that's not necessarily good. And if 3D is used badly either by us or the industry, that’s not good. We obviously have something good going here particularly when you look at the premium that the industry is getting from ticket price perspective, and if we go to the well too often or in the wrong ways, we're going to kill the goose that laid the golden egg. On the Alice front, we're very excited about the film overall and about its prospects in home video. As you know, we worked out arrangements on a global basis to bring this into the marketplace some 12 to 13 weeks after release. So that enables us to put the DVD out on June 1, instead of having to either wait ’til the middle of the summer, which wouldn't have been optimal, or to put it out when the market in effect recovers after the summer. That would have been in September, when we felt it would have been old. So we now go into the marketplace, one, at a good time to sell DVDs, the first week in June; two, with a title that feels very, very fresh. And we think that, that bodes really well for this title. And we know that this was kind of a hard-fought victory of sorts, but it's one that I think the industry will benefit from significantly, and obviously we’ll benefit from that. 
Lastly, Disney XD. We rebranded channel in the U.S. It was called Jetix. And we're in the process of rebranding a number of channels globally that were either Jetix channels or the former Fox Kids channel that we bought way back with the Fox Family acquisition. So far, the programming results, meaning the effect on ratings, have been quite good for the overall channel. And we feel that, that not only bodes well for advertising, but it bodes well for our ability to increase rates down the road with a channel that's just viewed as more viable and more attractive to distributors and to consumers. The only programming that I mentioned in the call was that we are working to create a Marvel block of programming on this channel. We are already licensing Marvel product for the channel and we're stepping up that activity both as a means of growing ratings for the channel, and thus growing advertising and distribution, but also as a means of helping to use the channel to strengthen the Marvel brand and to put a real spotlight on it."

And Jay, in fact, talked about how some of that revenue is going to move from the fourth quarter to the third when you compare those quarters to last year. So operating leverage actually improves as we recognize more revenue as we fulfill the program covenants. I think ESPN is a business that's kind of difficult to compare on a quarter-to-quarter basis because first of all, there are timing issues that are at stake in terms what Jay talked about ball games shifting out of a quarter, sometimes they’re apples to oranges comparisons just in terms of how far certain series go, whether they go four games or whether they go seven games. You'll see some fluctuation there, particularly in the basketball season. What we say about ESPN, which is pretty clear, is that we continue to grow its subscription revenues and we’re entering into some negotiations that are critical in that regard and that ad pacings at ESPN have generally been quite strong. And in fact, they feel extremely bullish about their upfront that's coming up. They’ve seen extraordinary growth in a robust marketplace with automotives and consumer electronics and men's grooming products, and they feel really good about that product. They're continuing to invest in their digital platforms and, to some extent, internationally, so there are costs associated with that this last quarter. And by the way, on the digital front, their digital revenue was up 30% over where it was a year ago, which is pretty remarkable. And they're getting real demand for things like iPad apps and for homepages in the ESPN.com world. So I think again, we don’t really look at ESPN on a quarter-to-quarter basis. It's just not how we manage it. Particularly given all the timing issues and the fact that there are a variety of different ins and outs in terms of how revenue is recognized, how sports events are scheduled, and their outcome."

Joining me in Burbank for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob's going to lead off, followed by Jay. And then we'll be happy to take your questions.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob, and we'll get started.

Let me start off by saying how thrilled we are with the global success of Iron Man 2, which to date has grossed $334 million in global box office.

Let me start off by saying how thrilled we are with the global success of Iron Man 2, which to date has grossed $334 million in global box office. It makes me even more enthusiastic about the great things Marvel and Disney can do together to build the value of the Marvel brand, its array of great characters and about our upcoming Marvel movies, Thor and Captain America. 
Our strong second quarter performance was driven in part by Disney's Alice in Wonderland. This visually stunning and highly entertaining motion picture has, to date, grossed over $962 million in global box office, making it Disney's second highest performing film ever, both U.S. and worldwide, and the number seven movie of all time. And we're excited, too, about our upcoming summer slate, which includes Prince of Persia, Toy Story 3 and Sorcerer's Apprentice. 
Under the new studio leadership, a focus on franchise films, such as Toy Story 3, is an important part of our growth strategy. And as we've discussed before, when a franchise film is successful at Disney, many of our businesses benefit, driving superior returns.
With sequels of Cars, Pirates and Monsters, Inc. arriving over the next two fiscal years, the opportunities to create additional value from these properties are tremendous. At our Media Networks, we're continuing to build on our strengths. ESPN has invested in the world's most exciting sports events and presents them in an integrated and engaging way. The NBA Finals are a great example of how ESPN weaves live sports, great reporting and up-to-the-minute stats into a compelling, cross-platform package that serves both consumers and advertisers. We're planning the same for the upcoming FIFA World Cup in South Africa. ESPN's innovation and emphasis on quality continue to drive strong ratings, and I'm particularly proud of the work ESPN has done in digital media. 
We are just a week away from the announcement of ABC's fall primetime schedule. I'm confident in the team's long-term track record and its ability to develop great new shows, like the current Wednesday night comedy block, and to generate new excitement along around long-standing series such as Dancing with the Stars, Grey's Anatomy and The Bachelor. With the scatter market strong, we are anticipating a very good upfront market. 
We're also pleased with the creative strengths of Disney Channel and ABC Family, which continue to perform exceptionally well with great original programming. Disney Channel has new hits in Phineas and Ferb and Good Luck Charlie, while Disney XD is building share among its target audience of boys. Both are international presence that's bringing the Disney brand into people's homes throughout the world. 
We're also developing a Marvel block of programs for our XD channel. For its part, ABC family is doing an excellent job of winning over Millennials, a particularly sought-after demographic. At our Parks and Resorts, over the next two years, a magnificent new resort will open in Hawaii, two new cruise ships will set sail and expansion of Disneyland Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland are coming along nicely.
The rollout of our additions and improvements to Disney's California Adventure begins next month with World of Color, an exciting nighttime spectacular.  The Disney Dream, the first of our new ships, will embark on its maiden voyage in the early part of calendar 2011. Together, these investments and our continuing emphasis on providing guests distinctive, high-quality experiences should serve Disney well as the economy improves, allowing a return to more normal pricing. Jay will elaborate later.
Our strategy is to create the best in branded entertainment; to use technology, both to make that entertainment more compelling and to reach more people; and to expand Disney's presence and promising global markets. But we've also taken steps to improve our operational agility and to challenge long-standing business models in order to better serve consumers. 
The creation of exciting new devices like the iPad, the growth of social media platforms and the choice demanded by consumers in how and when they enjoy their entertainment, offers incredible opportunities for companies like Disney strong brands, quality creative content and a willingness to be innovative and aggressive in the way content is created, marketed and distributed.
As the economy improves, I'm pleased the approach we've taken continues to be paying off. We were resilient during the downturn and laid the groundwork for future growth through our acquisition of Marvel and our continued investments in media and at our Parks and Resorts. Success rests on our continued ability to create quality content, to manage costs carefully and to be disciplined in our strategy and nimble in our execution. 
And with that, I'd like to turn things over to Jay.

We delivered solid Q2 results with growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. The economy continues to improve, and this is benefiting our businesses to varying degrees. Studio Entertainment was",884,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid Q2 results with growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. The economy continues to improve, and this is benefiting our businesses to varying degrees. Studio Entertainment was the largest driver of our year-over-year increase in operating income in Q2. Our theatrical releases, particularly Alice in Wonderland, strongly outperformed last year's slate, contributing to higher results. In addition to Iron Man 2, as Bob mentioned, our summer releases, including Prince of Persia, Toy Story 3 and Sorcerer's Apprentice, will obviously be key drivers of our performance for the remainder of the year.
Results at Media Networks came in flat to last year's Q2. At Cable Networks, higher affiliate and advertising revenue at ESPN more than offset an increase in costs coming primarily from sports rights for premier league football in the U.K., college basketball and the NBA. ESPN's ad revenues were up by mid-single-digit percentage points in the quarter. Due to a shift in our fiscal calendar, 12 college ballgames that were in Q2 last year moved to Q1 this year. We estimate that if these college ballgames had aired in Q2 this year, ESPN's ad revenue would have been a few percentage points higher. 
At ESPN, recognition of a portion of our affiliate revenue is dependent on when we deliver a certain quantity of sports programming. You may recall that last year, we achieved some of these programming commitments during our fourth fiscal quarter. This year, we expect to reach more programming commitments in the third quarter. As a result, we currently expect we'll have a year-over-year increase in net affiliate revenue recognition of at least $155 million in Q3. 
At Broadcasting, softer primetime ratings and higher programming costs at the ABC Network impacted Q2 results. We also incurred higher production cost amortization related to sales of ABC shows. Scatter pricing came in more than 35% above upfront levels. Ad revenue at our own TV stations came in 20% above prior Q2, led by increases primarily in automotive, political and retail categories. Thus far in Q3, scatter pricing for the ABC Network is running 30% above upfront levels. Ad sales at both ESPN and our TV stations are pacing up by double digits versus prior year. 
At Parks and Resorts, operating income came in 12% below prior Q2. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, we've been reducing the depth of our promotional offers. We have done this with the expectation that we will make near-term trade-offs between rate and volume. In Q2, we saw an improvement in both guest and per-room spending but a decline in occupied rooms. Attendance at our domestic parks came in 4% lower than prior-year levels, with Walt Disney World down 6% and Disneyland flat. 
As we mentioned previously, Q2 had shifts in two holiday weeks in the fiscal year. New Year's week moved from Q2 to Q1 and one week of Easter holiday moved into Q2 from Q3. We estimate that without these calendar shifts, combined attendance was nearly flat to the prior year. Per capita guest spending was up by 5%.
Occupancy at our Orlando hotels came in eight percentage points lower than prior-year levels at 81%, while Anaheim occupancy was down two percentage point at 67%. Per-room spending at our hotels came in 8% above prior-year levels, with an increase at Walt Disney World and a decline at our Disneyland resorts. 
Results at our Cruise Line were affected by increased fuel costs and higher promotional activities. For the segment as a whole, savings from lower volume-related expenses and cost mitigation activities help to partially offset higher expenses from inflation and pension and post-retirement medical costs. Q3 hotel reservations on the books are pacing 10% behind prior year. Again, we are not surprised by this since we are beginning to return to more normalized pricing levels. During fiscal 2011, we expect to no longer widely offer the deep discounts we've had in the market over the last 18 months.
At Consumer Products, the increase in operating income was driven by higher results at licensing, publishing and the Disney stores. Licensing revenue benefited from strong retailer response to Toy Story merchandise. Marvel properties added to segment licensing revenue, but this gain was largely offset by cost of sales and amortization of intangible assets related to Marvel. Earned licensing revenue grew by 4% on a comparable basis. The increase of publishing reflects growth from Marvel properties. At Disney Stores North America, we saw an improvement in comparable store sales.
Given our strong balance sheet and cash flow, we remain committed to buying back the shares we issued for the Marvel acquisition by the end of fiscal 2010. So far this fiscal year, we've repurchased over 11 million shares or roughly $370 million. We are pleased with the results we delivered in the first half of the year. They reflect not only the financial discipline we've maintained through the downturn but also the steps we've taken to become more efficient and position our businesses for long-term growth. 
More importantly, we've done this while maintaining our focus on creating high-quality branded entertainment and investing in key growth initiatives that we believe will position us to continue to deliver shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Lowell.

As for the cost structure of ESPN, we don't specify just how that will grow, in part because there are contracts that expire over the next few years with certain sports organizations. And until those are negotiated or until it's determined just whether we will negotiate extensions of those deals, we really can't predict just what the cost structure will be. The big deals with the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball and NASCAR all run through 2013 to 2016. And you can expect that there are increases in all of those contracts.

On the theme park's front, though, we said when we acquired Marvel that there were encumbrances in the United States and in Japan, notably between Marvel and Universal, deals that were done a long time ago. And so Marvel presence in our parks, at least in the short-term, is likely to be somewhat limited in nature. However, in all the other businesses, there's quite a lot of activity. On the games front and in digital media in general, there's been a fair amount of development and discussion. And in fact, as you know, we've gone into the self-publishing business at least on the console side of that business. And we are starting to develop some Marvel properties that will be published by us. We're looking for other opportunities on the games front as well. It's obviously a much more diverse business than just the console business. We're also discussing with Marvel a variety of other digital media strategies, including social networking opportunities, as well as things like mobile apps, and in fact, Marvel launched a great app for the iPad just last month. Licensing is probably where most of the activity is coming. Marvel had a very successful global licensing operation, as do we. There's a significant amount of integration going on, not just in the U.S., but in markets all around the world. Marvel working with Disney teams in places like India and China looking for opportunities in Japan, looking how to both reduce costs and grow licensing revenue in Europe and Latin America. So I'd say that's where the most activity and where the most opportunity is. There's also an opportunity to sell Marvel goods on Disney platforms. You can go to Disney.com to the store, and you'll see that we're selling Iron Man merchandise there. We're looking also for the opportunity to potentially sell Marvel merchandise at our parks. I mentioned in my remarks, we're developing a Marvel block of television programming for Disney XD, and we have two series in production and/or development, and we hope that, that will expand significantly over the next few years. So we think we have a big opportunity in terms of television. And then of course, once the Paramount distribution deal is fulfilled, it's our intention for the Disney Studio to step in and become the global distributor of Marvel's motion pictures and videos. Great opportunity as we cited when we announced the acquisition. I've said a number of times that we're impressed with the Marvel team. And if anything, since the acquisition, I think our enthusiasm has increased because of the quality of their people and the quality of the product and you opportunity to take that product, particularly in a world where technology is more friend than foe and distribute it more readily and in more compelling ways is pretty exciting.

Until we choose the programs for the fall and determine how many will be bought, it's difficult to predict what ABC's expense line will be. But there doesn't seem to be any real forces in the marketplace that would suggest that the costs are going to go up. On the ESPN front, as we've said in the past, international growth while continuing, is still relatively difficult to achieve, mostly because in order to really grow a sports platform or channel in these international markets, you have to spend very, very heavily on the most popular sports in each market. And in most cases, in the big markets, you have an embedded platform owner, Sky in the U.K. is a great example of this, that is going after the same rights in order to grow subscriptions to their overall platform. Since we do not own a distribution platform, we actually enter the sports rights market at a relative disadvantage to those that own platforms. So while we're pleased with the growth of ESPN internationally from what had been, basically, a losing business some 5 to 10 years ago to a profitable business, we do not believe that international growth for ESPN can rival that of other U.S.-based cable programs services that either can leverage the programming that they buy in the United States globally or by programs under less competitive circumstances in international markets.

I'm just wondering in your research have you noticed a tie between the business customer and your consumer at the Parks? And is there any way that we as analysts can assume that a rebound in attendance for your clientele can in anyway predictably follow a rebound that we actually are seeing in other pockets for the business consumer?

First of all, the leisure traveler usually has a much longer booking cycle than the business traveler. So when you feel good enough to take a vacation -- good enough I mean economically to take a vacation -- then you’ve got to decide, ""Okay, where am I going and when am I going?"" And quite often for us, of course, that aligns itself with school schedules and people’s available time. And so we would at the very least be a lagger to business travel, which is usually more close-in and immediate in terms of booking. Of course, we do run a sizable group of business, group and convention business, that has a lot of business meetings and we have seen a lift in that business in the second quarter, unmistakable relative to last year. So to that extent, and of course, we see the Starwood and other's numbers as well as you do, but we don't share a huge customer base. Most of those changes you see reporting are primarily business traveler-focused. And I don't think there is a link, but of course, they need leisure travelers for a lot of their weekend business. So as their results improve, quite often you see ours improving as well. But I don't think there's a huge link there.

And the goal all along was to essentially ramp up output, but do so very carefully. I can't speak for where Pixar was before the acquisition, but since the acquisition, and we've talked about a blend of both original movies and movies and sequels or movies derived from movies that have already been made. We are not forcing sequels though into the system unless we've got directors and storytellers that have good ideas for those sequels. Because we feel that we’ll do more damage either to the franchise or to our business if we just put sequels out there for the sake of making sequels. I think you'll see when Toy Story 3 comes out exactly what we mean. We had a director and a group of storytellers that had a great story to tell and a real passion for telling it. And therefore, we put it into production. The same thing is true with Cars 2 and the same thing with Monsters. We didn't mandate a sequel to any of those. We just obviously said that we're open to it and certainly encouraged it but only when there was a good idea. So other than the fact that there is a slight ramp up in capacity, there's been real no change in philosophy since the acquisition was announced. And again, your blend over the next certainly five years of sequels and original films.

I’ve almost lost track of what we announced is in 3D and what isn't. But you can assume that there’s a lot under consideration. What we've announced is Toy Story 3, which is just coming up; Step Up, which is a Touchstone film; Tangle",600,"First of all, 3D. I’ve almost lost track of what we announced is in 3D and what isn't. But you can assume that there’s a lot under consideration. What we've announced is Toy Story 3, which is just coming up; Step Up, which is a Touchstone film; Tangled, which is a re-titled Rapunzel; Tron, the end of the year; Mars Needs Moms and Cars 2 will all be in 3D. We’ve not made announcements about other future live-action films, but we're in discussions on a number of them. Our overall feeling about 3D is that it’s obviously a valuable technology both to the movie industry and for the viewer. It's one that we’ve taken advantage of for a long time, and one that we really believe in. But we don't believe every film should be in 3D. And when applied, we think 3D should be applied well and not done in a last-minute sort of paste-it-on kind of approach. Because we think that if, one, we make films in 3D that don't really benefit from them being in 3D, that's not necessarily good. And if 3D is used badly either by us or the industry, that’s not good. We obviously have something good going here particularly when you look at the premium that the industry is getting from ticket price perspective, and if we go to the well too often or in the wrong ways, we're going to kill the goose that laid the golden egg. On the Alice front, we're very excited about the film overall and about its prospects in home video. As you know, we worked out arrangements on a global basis to bring this into the marketplace some 12 to 13 weeks after release. So that enables us to put the DVD out on June 1, instead of having to either wait ’til the middle of the summer, which wouldn't have been optimal, or to put it out when the market in effect recovers after the summer. That would have been in September, when we felt it would have been old. So we now go into the marketplace, one, at a good time to sell DVDs, the first week in June; two, with a title that feels very, very fresh. And we think that, that bodes really well for this title. And we know that this was kind of a hard-fought victory of sorts, but it's one that I think the industry will benefit from significantly, and obviously we’ll benefit from that. 
Lastly, Disney XD. We rebranded channel in the U.S. It was called Jetix. And we're in the process of rebranding a number of channels globally that were either Jetix channels or the former Fox Kids channel that we bought way back with the Fox Family acquisition. So far, the programming results, meaning the effect on ratings, have been quite good for the overall channel. And we feel that, that not only bodes well for advertising, but it bodes well for our ability to increase rates down the road with a channel that's just viewed as more viable and more attractive to distributors and to consumers. The only programming that I mentioned in the call was that we are working to create a Marvel block of programming on this channel. We are already licensing Marvel product for the channel and we're stepping up that activity both as a means of growing ratings for the channel, and thus growing advertising and distribution, but also as a means of helping to use the channel to strengthen the Marvel brand and to put a real spotlight on it.

And Jay, in fact, talked about how some of that revenue is going to move from the fourth quarter to the third when you compare those quarters to last year. So operating leverage actually improves as we recognize more revenue as we fulfill the program covenants. I think ESPN is a business that's kind of difficult to compare on a quarter-to-quarter basis because first of all, there are timing issues that are at stake in terms what Jay talked about ball games shifting out of a quarter, sometimes they’re apples to oranges comparisons just in terms of how far certain series go, whether they go four games or whether they go seven games. You'll see some fluctuation there, particularly in the basketball season. What we say about ESPN, which is pretty clear, is that we continue to grow its subscription revenues and we’re entering into some negotiations that are critical in that regard and that ad pacings at ESPN have generally been quite strong. And in fact, they feel extremely bullish about their upfront that's coming up. They’ve seen extraordinary growth in a robust marketplace with automotives and consumer electronics and men's grooming products, and they feel really good about that product. They're continuing to invest in their digital platforms and, to some extent, internationally, so there are costs associated with that this last quarter. And by the way, on the digital front, their digital revenue was up 30% over where it was a year ago, which is pretty remarkable. And they're getting real demand for things like iPad apps and for homepages in the ESPN.com world. So I think again, we don’t really look at ESPN on a quarter-to-quarter basis. It's just not how we manage it. Particularly given all the timing issues and the fact that there are a variety of different ins and outs in terms of how revenue is recognized, how sports events are scheduled, and their outcome.

Let me start off by saying how thrilled we are with the global success of Iron Man 2, which to date has grossed $334 million in global box office. It makes me even more enthusiastic about the great things Marvel and Disney can do together to build the value of the Marvel brand, its array of great characters and about our upcoming Marvel movies, Thor and Captain America. 
Our strong second quarter performance was driven in part by Disney's Alice in Wonderland. This visually stunning and highly entertaining motion picture has, to date, grossed over $962 million in global box office, making it Disney's second highest performing film ever, both U.S. and worldwide, and the number seven movie of all time. And we're excited, too, about our upcoming summer slate, which includes Prince of Persia, Toy Story 3 and Sorcerer's Apprentice. 
Under the new studio leadership, a focus on franchise films, such as Toy Story 3, is an important part of our growth strategy. And as we've discussed before, when a franchise film is successful at Disney, many of our businesses benefit, driving superior returns.
With sequels of Cars, Pirates and Monsters, Inc. arriving over the next two fiscal years, the opportunities to create additional value from these properties are tremendous. At our Media Networks, we're continuing to build on our strengths. ESPN has invested in the world's most exciting sports events and presents them in an integrated and engaging way. The NBA Finals are a great example of how ESPN weaves live sports, great reporting and up-to-the-minute stats into a compelling, cross-platform package that serves both consumers and advertisers. We're planning the same for the upcoming FIFA World Cup in South Africa. ESPN's innovation and emphasis on quality continue to drive strong ratings, and I'm particularly proud of the work ESPN has done in digital media. 
We are just a week away from the announcement of ABC's fall primetime schedule. I'm confident in the team's long-term track record and its ability to develop great new shows, like the current Wednesday night comedy block, and to generate new excitement along around long-standing series such as Dancing with the Stars, Grey's Anatomy and The Bachelor. With the scatter market strong, we are anticipating a very good upfront market. 
We're also pleased with the creative strengths of Disney Channel and ABC Family, which continue to perform exceptionally well with great original programming. Disney Channel has new hits in Phineas and Ferb and Good Luck Charlie, while Disney XD is building share among its target audience of boys. Both are foraging a broad international presence that's bringing the Disney brand into people's homes throughout the world. 
We're also developing a Marvel block of programs for our XD channel. For its part, ABC family is doing an excellent job of winning over Millennials, a particularly sought-after demographic. At our Parks and Resorts, over the next two years, a magnificent new resort will open in Hawaii, two new cruise ships will set sail and expansion of Disneyland Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland are coming along nicely.
The rollout of our additions and improvements to Disney's California Adventure begins next month with World of Color, an exciting nighttime spectacular.  The Disney Dream, the first of our new ships, will embark on its maiden voyage in the early part of calendar 2011. Together, these investments and our continuing emphasis on providing guests distinctive, high-quality experiences should serve Disney well as the economy improves, allowing a return to more normal pricing. Jay will elaborate later.
Our strategy is to create the best in branded entertainment; to use technology, both to make that entertainment more compelling and to reach more people; and to expand Disney's presence and promising global markets. But we've also taken steps to improve our operational agility and to challenge long-standing business models in order to better serve consumers. 
The creation of exciting new devices like the iPad, the growth of social media platforms and the choice demanded by consumers in how and when they enjoy their entertainment, offers incredible opportunities for companies like Disney with strong brands, quality creative content and a willingness to be innovative and aggressive in the way content is created, marketed and distributed.
As the economy improves, I'm pleased the approach we've taken continues to be paying off. We were resilient during the downturn and laid the groundwork for future growth through our acquisition of Marvel and our continued investments in media and at our Parks and Resorts. Success rests on our continued ability to create quality content, to manage costs carefully and to be disciplined in our strategy and nimble in our execution. 
And with that, I'd like to turn things over to Jay."
191564,98931756,62555,"Walt Disney Co., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, May-11-2010",2010-05-11,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid Q2 results with growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. The economy continues to improve, and this is benefiting our businesses to varying degrees. Studio Entertainment was",885,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid Q2 results with growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. The economy continues to improve, and this is benefiting our businesses to varying degrees. Studio Entertainment was the largest driver of our year-over-year increase in operating income in Q2. Our theatrical releases, particularly Alice in Wonderland, strongly outperformed last year's slate, contributing to higher results. In addition to Iron Man 2, as Bob mentioned, our summer releases, including Prince of Persia, Toy Story 3 and Sorcerer's Apprentice, will obviously be key drivers of our performance for the remainder of the year.
Results at Media Networks came in flat to last year's Q2. At Cable Networks, higher affiliate and advertising revenue at ESPN more than offset an increase in costs coming primarily from sports rights for premier league football in the U.K., college basketball and the NBA. ESPN's ad revenues were up by mid single-digit percentage points in the quarter. Due to a shift in our fiscal calendar, 12 college ballgames that were in Q2 last year moved to Q1 this year. We estimate that if these college ballgames had aired in Q2 this year, ESPN's ad revenue would have been a few percentage points higher. 
At ESPN, recognition of a portion of our affiliate revenue is dependent on when we deliver a certain quantity of sports programming. You may recall that last year, we achieved some of these programming commitments during our fourth fiscal quarter. This year, we expect to reach more programming commitments in the third quarter. As a result, we currently expect we'll have a year-over-year increase in net affiliate revenue recognition of at least $155 million in Q3. 
At Broadcasting, softer primetime ratings and higher programming costs at the ABC Network impacted Q2 results. We also incurred higher production cost amortization related to sales of ABC shows. Scatter pricing came in more than 35% above upfront levels. Ad revenue at our own TV stations came in 20% above prior Q2, led by increases primarily in automotive, political and retail categories. Thus far in Q3, scatter pricing for the ABC Network is running 30% above upfront levels. Ad sales at both ESPN and our TV stations are pacing up by double digits versus prior year. 
At Parks and Resorts, operating income came in 12% below prior Q2. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, we've been reducing the depth of our promotional offers. We have done this with the expectation that we will make near-term trade-offs between rate and volume. In Q2, we saw an improvement in both guest and per-room spending but a decline in occupied rooms. Attendance at our domestic parks came in 4% lower than prior-year levels, with Walt Disney World down 6% and Disneyland flat. 
As we mentioned previously, Q2 had shifts in two holiday weeks in the fiscal year. New Year's week moved from Q2 to Q1 and one week of Easter holiday moved into Q2 from Q3. We estimate that without these calendar shifts, combined attendance was nearly flat to the prior year. Per capita guest spending was up by 5%.
Occupancy at our Orlando hotels came in eight percentage points lower than prior-year levels at 81%, while Anaheim occupancy was down two percentage point at 67%. Per-room spending at our hotels came in 8% above prior-year levels, with an increase at Walt Disney World and a decline at our Disneyland resorts. 
Results at our Cruise Line were affected by increased fuel costs and higher promotional activities. For the segment as a whole, savings from lower volume-related expenses and cost mitigation activities help to partially offset higher expenses from inflation and pension and post-retirement medical costs. Q3 hotel reservations on the books are pacing 10% behind prior year. Again, we are not surprised by this since we are beginning to return to more normalized pricing levels. During fiscal 2011, we expect to no longer widely offer the deep discounts we've had in the market over the last 18 months.
At Consumer Products, the increase in operating income was driven by higher results at licensing, publishing and the Disney stores. Licensing revenue benefited from strong retailer response to Toy Story merchandise. Marvel properties added to segment licensing revenue, but this gain was largely offset by cost of sales and amortization of intangible assets related to Marvel. Earned licensing revenue grew by 4% on a comparable basis. The increase of publishing reflects growth from Marvel properties. At Disney Stores North America, we saw an improvement in comparable store sales.
Given our strong balance sheet and cash flow, we remain committed to buying back the shares we issued for the Marvel acquisition by the end of fiscal 2010. So far this fiscal year, we've repurchased over 11 million shares or roughly $370 million. We are pleased with the results we delivered in the first half of the year. They reflect not only the financial discipline we've maintained through the downturn but also the steps we've taken to become more efficient and position our businesses for long-term growth. 
More importantly, we've done this while maintaining our focus on creating high-quality branded entertainment and investing in key growth initiatives that we believe will position us to continue to deliver shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Lowell."

On the theme park's front, though, we said when we acquired Marvel that there were encumbrances in the United States and in Japan, notably between Marvel and Universal, deals that were done a long time ago. And so Marvel presence in our parks, at least in the short-term, is likely to be somewhat limited in nature. However, in all the other businesses, there's quite a lot of activity. On the games front and in digital media in general, there's been a fair amount of development and discussion. And in fact, as you know, we've gone into the self-publishing business at least on the console side of that business. And we are starting to develop some Marvel properties that will be published by us. We're looking for other opportunities on the games front as well. It's obviously a much more diverse business than just the console business. We're also discussing with Marvel a variety of other digital media strategies, including social networking opportunities, as well as things like mobile apps, and in fact, Marvel launched a great app for the iPad just last month. Licensing is probably where most of the activity is coming. Marvel had a very successful global licensing operation, as do we. There's a significant amount of integration going on, not just in the U.S., but in markets all around the world. Marvel working with Disney teams in places like India and China looking for opportunities in Japan, looking how to both reduce costs and grow licensing revenue in Europe and Latin America. So I'd say that's where the most activity and where the most opportunity is. There's also an opportunity to sell Marvel goods on Disney platforms. You can go to Disney.com to the store, and you'll see that we're selling Iron Man merchandise there. We're looking also for the opportunity to potentially sell Marvel merchandise at our parks. I mentioned in my remarks, we're developing a Marvel block of television programming for Disney XD, and we have two series in production and/or development, and we hope that, that will expand significantly over the next few years. So we think we have a big opportunity in terms of television. And then of course, once the Paramount distribution deal is fulfilled, it's our intention for the Disney Studio to step in and become the global distributor of Marvel's motion pictures and videos. Great opportunity as we cited when we announced the acquisition. I've said a number of times that we're impressed with the Marvel team. And if anything, since the acquisition, I think our enthusiasm has increased because of the quality of their people and the quality of the product and you opportunity to take that product, particularly in a world where technology is more friend than foe and distribute it more readily and in more compelling ways is pretty exciting."

Until we choose the programs for the fall and determine how many will be bought, it's difficult to predict what ABC's expense line will be. But there doesn't seem to be any real forces in the marketplace that would suggest that the costs are going to go up. On the ESPN front, as we've said in the past, international growth while continuing, is still relatively difficult to achieve, mostly because in order to really grow a sports platform or channel in these international markets, you have to spend very, very heavily on the most popular sports in each market. And in most cases, in the big markets, you have an embedded platform owner, Sky in the U.K. is a great example of this, that is going after the same rights in order to grow subscriptions to their overall platform. Since we do not own a distribution platform, we actually enter the sports rights market at a relative disadvantage to those that own platforms. So while we're pleased with the growth of ESPN internationally from what had been, basically, a losing business some 5 to 10 years ago to a profitable business, we do not believe that international growth for ESPN can rival that of other U.S.-based cable programs services that either can leverage the programming that they buy in the United States globally or by programs under less competitive circumstances in international markets."

I can't speak for where Pixar was before the acquisition, but since the acquisition, and we've talked about a blend of both original movies, and movies and sequels or movies derived from movies that have already been made. We are not forcing sequels though into the system unless we've got directors and storytellers that have good ideas for those sequels. Because we feel they will do more damage either to the franchise or to our business if we just put sequels out there for the sake of making sequels. I think you'll see when Toy Story 3 comes out exactly what we mean. We had a director and a group of storytellers that had a great story to tell and a real passion for telling it. And therefore, we put it into production. The same thing is true with Cars 2 and the same thing with Monsters. We didn't mandate a sequel to any of those. We just obviously said that we're open to it and certainly encouraged it but only when there was a good idea. So other than the fact that there is a slight ramp up in capacity, there's been real no change in philosophy since the acquisition was announced.

I’ve almost lost track of what we announced is in 3D and what isn't. But you can assume that there’s a lot under consideration. What we've announced is Toy Story 3, which is just coming up; Step Up, which is a Touchstone film; Tangle",600,"First of all, 3D. I’ve almost lost track of what we announced is in 3D and what isn't. But you can assume that there’s a lot under consideration. What we've announced is Toy Story 3, which is just coming up; Step Up, which is a Touchstone film; Tangled, which is a re-titled Rapunzel; Tron, the end of the year; Mars Needs Moms and Cars 2 will all be in 3D. We’ve not made announcements about other future live-action films, but we're in discussions on a number of them. 
Our overall feeling about 3D is that it’s obviously a valuable technology both to the movie industry and for the viewer. It's one that we’ve taken advantage of for a long time, and one that we really believe in. But we don't believe every film should be in 3D. And when applied, we think 3D should be applied well and not done in a last-minute sort of paste-it-on kind of approach. Because we think that if, one, we make films in 3D that don't really benefit from them being in 3D, that's not necessarily good. And if 3D is used badly either by us or the industry, that’s not good. We obviously have something good going here particularly when you look at the premium that the industry is getting from ticket price perspective, and if we go to the well too often or in the wrong ways, we're going to kill the goose that laid the golden egg. 
On the Alice front, we're very excited about the film overall and about its prospects in home video. As you know, we worked out arrangements on a global basis to bring this into the marketplace some 12 to 13 weeks after release. So that enables us to put the DVD out on June 1, instead of having to either wait ’til the middle of the summer, which wouldn't have been optimal, or to put it out when the market in effect recovers after the summer. That would have been in September, when we felt it would have been old. So we now go into the marketplace, one, at a good time to sell DVDs, the first week in June; two, with a title that feels very, very fresh. And we think that, that bodes really well for this title. And we know that this was kind of a hard-fought victory of sorts, but it's one that I think the industry will benefit from significantly, and obviously we’ll benefit from that. 
Lastly, Disney XD. We rebranded channel in the U.S. It was called Jetix. And we're in the process of rebranding a number of channels globally that were either Jetix channels or the former Fox Kids channel that we bought way back with the Fox Family acquisition. So far, the programming results, meaning the effect on ratings, have been quite good for the overall channel. And we feel that, that not only bodes well for advertising, but it bodes well for our ability to increase rates down the road with a channel that's just viewed as more viable and more attractive to distributors and to consumers. The only programming that I mentioned in the call was that we are working to create a Marvel block of programming on this channel. We are already licensing Marvel product for the channel and we're stepping up that activity both as a means of growing ratings for the channel, and thus growing advertising and distribution, but also as a means of helping to use the channel to strengthen the Marvel brand and to put a real spotlight on it."

And Jay, in fact, talked about how some of that revenue is going to move from the fourth quarter to the third when you compare those quarters to last year. So operating leverage actually improves as we recognize more revenue as we fulfill the program covenants. I think ESPN is a business that's kind of difficult to compare on a quarter-to-quarter basis because first of all, there are timing issues that are at stake in terms what Jay talked about ball games shifting out of a quarter, sometimes they’re apples to oranges comparisons just in terms of how far certain series go, whether they go four games or whether they go seven games. You'll see some fluctuation there, particularly in the basketball season. What we say about ESPN, which is pretty clear, is that we continue to grow its subscription revenues and we’re entering into some negotiations that are critical in that regard and that ad pacings at ESPN have generally been quite strong. And in fact, they feel extremely bullish about their upfront that's coming up. They’ve seen extraordinary growth in a robust marketplace with automotives and consumer electronics and men's grooming products, and they feel really good about that product. They're continuing to invest in their digital platforms and, to some extent, internationally, so there are costs associated with that this last quarter. And by the way, on the digital front, their digital revenue was up 30% over where it was a year ago, which is pretty remarkable. And they're getting real demand for things like iPad apps and for homepages in the ESPN.com world. So I think again, we don’t really look at ESPN on a quarter-to-quarter basis. It's just not how we manage it. Particularly given all the timing issues and the fact that there are a variety of different ins and outs in terms of how revenue is recognized, how sports events are scheduled, and their outcome."

We're very pleased with our strong third quarter performance. We grew revenue substantially and improved profitability across the majority of our businesses.

We grew revenue substantially and improved profitability across the majority of our businesses. Over the last five years, we've focused on building our creative capabilities and strengthening our portfolio of core brands. We've also aggressively sought growth opportunities, both on newly emerging platforms and in promising international markets, while at the same time divesting non-core businesses. 
Our focus on high-quality branded entertainment had a big impact on the results of our Studio segment, which has delivered three of the top five global and the top three U.S. films so far this year. Disney's Alice in Wonderland, Pixar's Toy Story 3 and Marvel's Iron Man 2. These films are both creatively and financially successful, and have been leveraged across many of our businesses. Toy Story merchandise sales reached new heights as consumers responded to a fresh line of well-designed products available globally, and this bodes well for Pixar's next feature film, Cars 2, opening in June of 2011. 
At Media Networks, ESPN had a fantastic quarter, creatively and commercially. What ESPN did with and for the FIFA World Cup was nothing short of spectacular. The month-long event was a ratings, revenue and brand-building success, while ESPN's high-quality multi-platform coverage significantly raised the World Cup's U.S. profile. It's worth noting that about one quarter of ESPN's total revenue from the event came from non-linear platforms, including ESPN3, apps for the iPhone and iPad, ESPN Mobile TV, ESPN.com and Radio [ESPN Radio].
In addition to the World Cup programming, the NBA also delivered great results, with one of the most thrilling finals in a long time. ESPN, with ABC really rose to the occasion and the finals were the most viewed series in a decade.
Our other cable channels also performed well during the quarter. Disney Channel continues to command high ratings, with successful shows including Phineas and Ferb and Good Luck Charlie. The channel also has continued to expand its international presence. And ABC Family has been on an extraordinary run, with Millennial audience favorites like Secret Life of the American Teenager and a new hit in Pretty Little Liars.
A few days ago, we announced that ABC Family's Paul Lee will assume the role of President, ABC Entertainment Group. With six years at ABC Family, Paul is a proven leader, showing great commercial instincts and a skill at developing distinctive shows that really put ABC Family on the map as an identifiable brand. And we're pleased to have him in his new, very important role.
At Parks and Resorts, earlier this summer, we unveiled World of Color, an amazing new attraction that's been bringing record crowds to Disney California Adventure. It shows once again that when our imagineers blend smart storytelling, technological innovation and brilliant execution, they create something truly special. The World of Color is the first of our next generation of attractions at California Adventure and its early success is a promising sign for our investments there.
I'd like to turn now to our acquisition of Playdom and to update you on our overall game strategy. We're all aware of the rapid growth of social networks and the huge popularity of the games available on them. In fact, the Nielsen study published last week shows that in the U.S., social gaming has overtaken personal e-mail as the number two activity on the web, and we expect social gaming to grow at a compounded rate of more than 30% annually. Game playing on social networks is already a mainstream experience, attracting a broad diverse customer base. We feel its essential for us to have a robust presence in social networks and to do so in the right way. In Playdom, we bought a successful company, notable for its creative abilities and its potential to leverage our brands in this fast-growing market that's already engaged millions of consumers worldwide. Playdom brings us the talent, technical expertise and market know-how vital to rapid success in this space. 
With the acquisition of Playdom and of Tapulous, a developer that specializes in mobile games and apps, we now have a diversified multifaceted games business, capable of creating a wide range of experiences to meet evolving consumer interests. We will remain in console games with Disney branded titles. We'll also devote resources to the creation of social games, mobile games and apps. Our successful virtual worlds like Club Penguin continue to grow domestically and internationally, and we'll continue to launch new ones like the highly anticipated World of Cars, which debuts tomorrow. We believe that having this kind of breadth and depth of both development skills and product offerings is important to achieving real and lasting growth in the games arena. As is the case with Pixar, Club Penguin and Marvel, the talented people at Playdom and Tapulous will benefit from access to our content, brands and financial resources while operating in an environment that led to their initial success.
In sum, our strong third quarter performance underscores the value of sticking to a smart strategy even in tough times, of investing in the right people and are focusing relentlessly on quality and innovation to drive growth and shareholder value. I'm very proud of what we've been able to do and really excited about where we're going. 
And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay."

Starting with Media Networks, it was the largest driver of our year-over-year increase in operating income, driven primarily by ESPN. At Cable Networks, higher affiliate and advertising revenue at ESPN more than offset an increase in sports rights and production costs for the World Cup and ESPN U.K. On our Q2 call, I said that we expected a year-over-year increase in net affiliate revenue recognition of at least $155 million in Q3. ESPN ended up reaching more programming commitment than expected in Q3. As such, ESPN benefited from the recognition of approximately $380 million more in net deferred affiliate revenue in Q3 this year compared to prior year or $225 million more than we expected. Although this timing shift does not impact our full year results, we do expect ESPN to recognize about $355 million less in net deferred affiliate revenue in Q4 than in the prior year. Excluding the impact of earlier affiliate revenue recognition, Q3 operating income at Cable Networks was still up by 16%.
ESPN's ad revenue was up 31% in the quarter. ESPN benefited from the World Cup programming and two additional NBA Finals games compared to prior Q3. After adjusting for these events, we estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up by 17%. 
At Broadcasting, higher advertising revenues at our local stations and sales of ABC own shows more than offset an increase in programming cost at the ABC Network. Ad revenue at our owned TV stations came in 32% above prior year, led by increases in the automotive, political and electronics categories. At the ABC Network, scatter pricing came in 33% above upfront levels.
Thus far in Q4, ABC Network scatter pricing is running almost 20% above upfront levels. Ad sales at both ESPN and our TV stations are pacing up by double digits versus prior year. While the advertising market is currently quite strong, visibility remains somewhat limited. We are pleased with our upfront results across our media properties, including ABC, ESPN and ABC Family.
Our Studio Entertainment segment delivered strong results in Q3, driven by the theatrical performance of Toy Story 3, Alice in Wonderland and Iron Man 2. Results also benefited from lower home video costs and increased TV distribution sales in international markets, but were impacted by higher costs incurred from film cost write-downs.
Turning to Parks and Resorts, while revenues were up 3% in the quarter, operating income came in 8% below prior Q3. Several items impacted margins at the Parks segment. Due to a calendar shift, Q3 results included one less week of the Easter holiday compared to prior year. Our domestic parks also incurred costs associated with new entertainment offerings, including World of Color at California Adventure. Our Cruise Line business had increased costs related to the upcoming launch of our new ship, the Disney Dream. In addition, the segment continues to be impacted by labor cost inflation and higher pension and postretirement medical costs. As we've said previously, we've been reducing the level of discounting in our promotional offers since the beginning of fiscal 2010, with the expectation that we would make near-term trade-offs between rate and volume. Similar to last quarter, per capita guest spending was up by 5%. Attendance at our domestic parks came in 3% lower than prior year levels, with Walt Disney World down 2% and Disneyland down 4%. When adjusting for the calendar shift of one Easter holiday week, we estimate that combined attendance was down by only one percentage point compared to prior year.
At our domestic hotels, average room spending was up, while occupancy was lower than in the prior year. Room spending at our hotels was 4% above prior year levels, with an increase at Walt Disney World and a decline at Disneyland.
Occupancy at our Orlando hotels was about eight percentage points lower than prior year levels at 83%, while Anaheim occupancy was down three percentage points at 80%. 
Results at our Cruise Line were lower than in the prior year, driven by some softness in European itineraries, increased expenses for our new ship launch, which I mentioned earlier, and higher fuel costs.
At our international parks, guest spending improved at both Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland. Attendance was up 1% in Paris and also up 35% in Hong Kong, which was driven by higher guest visitation from mainland China and international markets. Real estate operations in Disneyland Paris also benefited from a large transaction in the quarter. 
So far this quarter, domestic hotel reservations on the books are pacing 9% behind prior year. However, as you may recall, last year's fiscal Q4 included an extra week due to our accounting calendar. Excluding the impact of the extra week, Q4 bookings so far this year are running just 1% behind last year.
At Consumer Products, we were very pleased with Toy Story merchandise sales in the quarter. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue grew by 18%. Licensing revenue from Marvel properties was offset by higher costs, primarily from the amortization of intangible assets related to the Marvel acquisition. The increase in operating income was driven by lower costs at our North American Disney stores and by publishing revenue from Marvel properties.
As I mentioned earlier, our fiscal 2009 year included an extra week. So results in this year's fourth quarter will therefore reflect one fewer week of operations compared to prior year. On a separate note, a jury recently returned the verdict against ABC in our ongoing litigation with Celador regarding Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. We believe that the verdict was an error and we intend to vigorously seek to have it reversed. Based on our assessment of the merits of our position, we have not recorded a charge for this matter.
We continuously assess whether our portfolio of assets enables us to maximize shareholder value and aligns with our strategic priorities. Our pending sale of Miramax for approximately $660 million reflects our focus on maximizing the value of our assets and on directing our resources towards branded entertainment with strong franchise potential. We expect that the Miramax transaction, once completed, will have minimal impact on earnings moving forward.
Bob earlier referred to our Playdom acquisition. We're acquiring the company for total consideration of approximately $563 million, with the potential for an additional earn-out payments of up to $200 million at the end of calendar 2012. The deal is structured such that our projected return would be higher if the earn outs are achieved. We expect the deal to be modestly dilutive to earnings for the next several years. The dilution is driven in part by both the amortization of intangibles and the treatment of a portion of the purchase price that will be paid over the next several years as compensation expense for accounting purposes. We also expect to continue returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. We have completed buying back the shares we issued from Marvel. As of today, we have repurchased over 61 million shares for approximately $2 billion in the fiscal year. 
We're pleased with the results we delivered so far this year. Looking forward, we plan to continue to closely manage costs. At the same time, we will continue to make prudent investments to position our businesses for long-term growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Lowell for Q&A."

And as we look at the sector, we see a diversity of platforms and basically of experiences from the console games, which we will remain in, to the social games, which we've just bought into, as well as mobile apps and casual games online and virtual worlds like Club Penguin. So we're going to continue to make console games. They will primarily be Disney branded, not all Disney branded. And they will, in most cases, be derivative of product that's been made for other segments of the company like our Motion Pictures. So I guess as you look at our strategy, you see a blend of investment and some reallocation of investment from the console side to basically its multifaceted side. Also, it became pretty clear to us that game playing in social networks is really here to stay. I mean, there are obviously a multitude of people that are already playing. There are about half a billion people who are members of Facebook already. About 40% of those people participate in game playing. I mentioned in my remarks that the customer base is pretty diverse from 18 to post 50. It's dual gender, meaning it's not -- it doesn't skew just in the men's direction, which we know a lot of other games do. It seemed tailor-made for not only Disney branded games, but Marvel and ESPN, and we really like the opportunity. The other thing that was really interesting to us is that we now have over 50 million people who are members of various Disney, ESPN, ABC groups on Facebook. So we begin with a very, very solid base of people to market to and when you add to that the over 40 million people who are playing Playdom games already, that seemed pretty compelling to us."

We think we're just really at the beginning of a pretty significant migration in terms of consumption and distribution of digital media. And therefore, we've laid down a lot of bets, some relatively small or inexpensive, and some substantially larger. We watch with great interest, obviously, significant growth in consumption. Just look at what's happened in the past few months since the iPad was released as for an instance. And we feel that in order for us not only to be relevant but in order for us to grow our business, we have to be in the space. We believe long-term that monetization will occur in compelling ways. We think it'll be diverse in terms of how it is delivered from micropayments. We'll see for instance on the social games front to subscriptions, which we'll see from places like Hulu and obviously, on the social games front, to advertising, to varying forms of Pay-Per-View. We're pretty pleased with how we've entered the market as broad as diverse as it is. It's clear that our audiences for our various brands are using digital media more and more, and we feel good about where we are. And very specifically, just look at some of the trends I mentioned, basically of network viewing of the World Cup on ESPN and how significant that was. If you just look at their growth in digital advertising, which is expected to be well over 40% this year, that's also rather significant. So we like the trends. We think we also like being there first because we like to learn quickly. In some cases, it is a trial and error experience as well. And generally speaking, as I think our actions have indicated, we're bullish about the future of digital media."

We basically are trying to reduce the amount of discounting, promotional discounting that we've been doing in the depth of the recession, to maintain our volumes and carefully playing off our rates with our volumes. That strategy evidenced itself in Q3 in some of the numbers that I talked about with some volume declines, but also rate increases and we will continue to do that through the fourth quarter, and hope -- and I've stated before that hope to be back to sort of a normal level of promotional activity in fiscal 2011. I would say that the economy continues to characterize itself as a fairly uncertain place, so I think it would be imprudent to give a timetable for when our Park business would return to what we've come to know as more normalized margins. But at the same time, we don't see any structural reason why that can't happen."

Clearly, the addition of Facebook currency, I think while it's in some cases can be viewed as Facebook acting like a gatekeeper, the existence of that currency I think will enable more people to spend money in their games experience. So I think it's mutually beneficial. The other thing that I think has to be considered is that these games exist in multiple platforms and we're going to take a platform agnostic approach to the distribution of these games. Not only to other social networks, but just to other platforms. There's no reason why you can't play some of these games on what I'll call traditional dot-com sites or in mobile devices, and we intend to distribute rather broadly, particularly as we move our IT through Playdom into the system."

I would call our Q3 spending quite modest, but probably by the time we launch the Disney Dream ultimately, we'll be looking in the area of tens of millions of dollars of advertising and prelaunch spending in addition to the training that have to take place with the crew and all the other prelaunch and preopening activities. Relative to the size of the business, it's extremely modest.

And in one case, Lost is now off the schedule because it has finale-d this past season. And therefore, the focus at ABC was basically adding to the schedule and building essentially up another foundation. While some of those shows, Grey's and Desperate [Desperate Housewives] is still on the air. You still have Dancing with the Stars, which is relatively popular. And then last season, they were able to add Modern Family and Castle to the schedule, and those results, pretty obvious, both did extremely well and both were viewed as both commercial and critical successes. So I think the ABC schedule was in a relatively decent shape, not to suggest that it doesn't need some strengthening, but we were pleased in general, with some of the recent developments, and we feel that the schedule they put together for the fall was a good solid schedule. Those shows, those new shows in particular are all in production. So it's premature to really project the outcome of those. But I think in general, ABC in terms of its primetime programming, was heading in a right direction, and in Paul Lee, as I mentioned, I think generously and for the right reason in my remarks, we put an executive in, who has a proven track record in primetime television, ABC Family has had great success under his six-year tenure, and has really strong shows and a schedule. And I think he brings to ABC, not only an experienced and a proven track record, but a great sensibility in terms of commercial instincts, and feel great about the fact that we were able to put Paul in that position."

I really don't want to get into the specifics on the premium VOD window.

And we think that the time is over, that we both need to do that and want to do that and clearly, want to start moving our way towards what we would see as more steady-state growth. We have a lot of investment underway in our theme parks, as I'm sure you are aware that comes online. Substantially, in 2012, what starts to make its way in, in 2011 on both posts. And clearly, the idea there is to continue to grow our business and continue to solidify our strong position and resulting revenue growth in margins will follow suit. Your other question about international trends versus domestic, frankly there's not a lot to talk about in the third quarter about that. There hasn't actually been a lot to talk about in this fiscal year. The two have kind of moved in tandem. There's no great movement and international visitation as a total percentage of our Parks business, is not out of line with what it's been historically.

So I don't know that you need to take too much out of this, but I think that, that number, the fact there we're only 1% down on bookings at this time, is very encouraging. Because as you know, in prior quarters at this time, we've been close to 10% down in bookings versus where we were a year ago, with essentially a lower discount. So we're in the market now with a discount that's definitely lower than it was a year ago. Backing out that week, we're only 1% down. That suggests an improvement.

And while we don't agree on everything, we certainly are in agreement on the fact that devices like the iPad not only are game changers, but they probably offer us more opportunities than they threaten us. And our strategy for putting product on the iPad is to do so in a way that respects and values, the obviously successful and extraordinarily profitable multichannel business that we're in. And I realized this leads to the TV Everywhere question, so I might as well bring it up. Our belief on that is that we need to do a few things. One, we need to serve the consumer with new ways to access our product, basically make ourselves more convenient and more accessible, and be mindful of a strong price to value relationship. While at the same time, protecting, which is very, very important, a business that has enabled us to really grow our company and our shareholder value, not just through ESPN, but Disney Channel, ABC Family and soon through retransmission consent, our broadcasting assets. And we basically feel that there is a way for there to be peaceful coexistence or coexistence I should say. I don't know whether it will necessarily be peaceful. What ABC has done with its iPad app for instance, we think gives its customers an ability to access ABC shows that they may have missed on network or maybe they didn't get a chance to DVR it, but we actually like the product because it gives us an opportunity to basically expand our eyeballs and monetize in a broader way. To what extent it cannibalizes the initial business, we're not 100% certain but our gut is that it's relatively negligible, and that people still watch most of their TV on what I'll call big screen connected experiences."

Again, we look at licensing versus buying or basically self-publishing on a lot of different directions. And while the Licensing business is obviously one that's important to us, one, consumer products is a great example of that, this is one case where we felt that bringing that great talent at Playdom into the company, and using that expertise to expand the company's awareness of, knowledge of, and business in social games in particular, social networking and digital media, had real value."

We are very pleased with our strong third quarter performance. We grew revenues substantially and improved profitability across the majority of our businesses.
Over the last five years we’ve focused on building our creative capabilities and strengthening our portfolio of core brands. We’ve also aggressively sought growth opportunities, both on newly emerging platforms and in promising international markets, while at the same time divesting non-core businesses.
Our focus on high-quality, branded entertainment had a big impact on the results of our Studio segment which has delivered three of the top five global and the top three U.S. films so far this year. Disney’s Alice in Wonderland, Pixar’s Toy Story 3 and Marvel’s, Iron Man 2. These films are both creatively and financially successful and have been leveraged across many of our businesses.
Toy Story merchandise sales reached new heights as consumers responded to a fresh line of well-designed products available globally, and this bodes well for Pixar’s next feature film, Cars 2 opening in June of 2011.
At Media Networks, ESPN had a fantastic quarter, creatively and commercially. What ESPN did with and for the FIFA World Cup was nothing short of spectacular. The month-long event was a ratings, revenue and brand-building success, while ESPN’s high-quality multi-platform coverage significantly raised the World Cup’s U.S. profile.
It’s worth noting that about one quarter of ESPN’s total revenue from the event came from non-linear platforms, including ESPN3, apps free iPhone and iPad, ESPN Mobile TV, espn.com and radio.
In addition to the World Cup programming, the NBA also delivered great results with one of the most thrilling finals in a long time. ESPN with ABC really rose to the occasion and the finals were the most viewed series in a decade.
Our other cable channels also performed well during the quarter Disney Channel continues to command high ratings with successful shows including Phineas and Ferb and Good Luck Charlie. The channel also has continued to expand its international presence.
ABC Family has been on an extraordinary run with millennial audience favorites like Secret Life Of An American Teenager and the new hit in Pretty Little Liars.
Few days ago, we announced that ABC Family’s Paul Lee will assume the role of President ABC Entertainment Group. With six years at ABC Family Paul is a proven leader showing great commercial instincts and a skill of developing distinctive shows that really put ABC Family on the map as an identifiable brand, and we’re pleased to have him in his new very important roles.
At parks and resorts earlier this summer we unveiled World of Color an amazing new attraction that’s been bringing record crowds to Disney California Adventure, it shows once again that when our imaginers (inaudible) storytelling, technological innovation and brilliant execution, they create something truly special. World of Color is the first of our next generation of attractions at California Adventure and its early success is a promising sign for our investments there.
I’d like to turn now to our acquisition of Playdom and to update you on our overall game strategy. We’re all aware of the rapid growth of social networks and the huge popularity of the games available on them.
In fact, a Nielsen study published last week shows that in the U.S. social gaming has overtaken personal e-mails as the number 2 activity on the web. And we expect social gaming to grow at a compounded rate of more than 30% annually.
Game playing on social networks is already a mainstream experience attracting a broad diverse customer base. We feel it’s essential for us to have a robust presence in social networks and to do so in a right way.
In Playdom, we bought a successful company notable for its creative abilities and its potential to leverage our brands in this fast growing market that’s already engaged millions of consumers worldwide. Playdom brings us the talent, technical expertise, and market know how vital to rapid success in this space.
With the acquisition of Playdom and Tapulous, a developer that specializes in mobile games and apps, we now have a diversified multifaceted games business capable of creating a wide range of experiences to meet evolving consumer interests.
We will remain in console games with Disney branded titles. We will also devote resources to creation of social games, mobile games and apps.
Our successful virtual worlds like Club Penguin continue to grow domestically and internationally and we’ll continue to launch new ones like the highly anticipated World of Cars, which debuts tomorrow.
We believe that having this kind of breadth and depth of both development skills and product offerings is important to achieving real and lasting growth in the games arena.
As is the case with Pixar, Club Penguin and Marvel, the talented people at Playdom and Tapulous will benefit from access to our content, brands and financial resources while operating in an environment that led to their initial success.
In sum, our strong third quarter performance underscores the value of sticking to a smart strategy, even in tough times of investing in the right people and focusing relentlessly on quality and innovation to drive growth and shareholder value.
I am very proud of what we’ve been able to do and really excited about where we are going and with that, I’ll turn things over to Jay.

The strong results we delivered in Q3 reflect in part improvement in the business environment, but also our continued focus on managing with financial discipline even as we invest in the future growth of our company.
Starting with Media Networks, it was largest driver of our year-over-year increase in operating income driven primarily by ESPN. At Cable Networks, higher affiliate and advertising revenue at ESPN more than offset an increase in sports rights and production costs for the World Cup and ESPN U.K.
On our Q2 call, I said that we expected a year-over-year increase in net affiliate revenue recognition of at least $155 million in Q3. ESPN ended up reaching more programming commitments than expected in Q3.
As such, ESPN benefited from the recognition of approximately $380 million more in net deferred affiliate revenue in Q3 this year, compared to prior year or $225 million more than we expected.
Although this timing shift does not impact our full year results, we do expect ESPN to recognize about $355 million less in net deferred affiliate revenue in Q4 than in the prior year.
Excluding the impact of earlier affiliate revenue recognition, Q3 operating income at Cable Networks was still up by 16%. ESPN’s ad revenue was up 31% in the quarter. ESPN benefited from the World Cup programming and two additional NBA Finals games compared to prior Q3. After adjusting for these events, we estimate that ESPN’s ad revenue was up by 17%.
At Broadcasting, higher advertising revenues at our local stations and sales of ABC-owned shows more than offset an increase in programming costs at the ABC Network.
Ad revenue at our owned TV stations came in 32% above prior year, led by increases in the automotive, political and electronics categories. At the ABC Network, scatter pricing came in 33% above upfront levels. Thus far in Q4, ABC Network’s scatter pricing is running almost 20% above upfront levels.
Ad sales at both ESPN and our TV stations are pacing up by double-digits versus prior year. While the advertising market is currently quite strong, visibility remains somewhat limited. We are pleased with our upfront results across our media properties, including ABC, ESPN, and ABC Family.
Our Studio Entertainment segment delivered strong results in Q3, driven by the theatrical performance of Toy Story 3, Alice in Wonderland and Iron Man 2. Results also benefited from lower home video costs and increased TV distribution sales in international markets, but were impacted by higher costs incurred from film cost write-downs.
Turning to Parks and Resorts, while revenues were up 3% in the quarter, operating income came in 8% below prior Q3. Several items impacted margins at the Parks segment. Due to a calendar shift, Q3 results included one less week of the Easter holiday compared to prior year. Our domestic parks also incurred cost associated with new entertainment offerings including World of Color at California Adventure.
Our Cruise Line business had increased costs related to the upcoming launch of our new ship, The Disney Dream. In addition, this segment continues to be impacted by labor cost inflation and higher pension and post-retirement medical costs.
As we’ve said previously, we’ve been reducing the level of discounting in our promotional offers since the beginning of fiscal 2010 with the expectation that we would make near-term trade-offs between rate and volume.
Similar to last quarter per capita guest spending was up by 5%. Attendance at our domestic parks came in 3% lower than prior year levels with Walt Disney World down 2% and Disneyland down 4%. When adjusting for the calendar shift of one Easter holiday week, we estimate that combined attendance was down by only 1 percentage point compared to prior year.
At our domestic hotels average room spending was up, while occupancy was lower than in the prior year. Per room spending at our hotels was 4% above prior year levels with an increase at Walt Disney World and a decline at Disneyland. Occupancy at our Orlando hotels was about 8 percentage points lower than prior year levels at 83%, while Anaheim occupancy was down 3 percentage points at 80%.
Results at our cruise line were lower than in the prior year, driven by some softness in European itineraries, increased expenses for our new ship launch which I mentioned earlier, and higher fuel costs.
At our international parks, guest spending improved at both Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland. Attendance was up 1% in Paris and also up 35% in Hong Kong, which was driven by higher guest visitation from mainland China and international markets.
Real estate operations in Disneyland Paris also benefited from a large transaction in the quarter. So far, this quarter domestic hotel reservations on the books are pacing 9% behind prior year. However, as you may recall last year’s fiscal Q4 included an extra week due to our accounting calendar. Excluding the impact of the extra week, Q4 booking so far this year are running just 1% behind last year.
At consumer products we are very pleased with Toy Story merchandise sales in the quarter. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue grew by 18%. Licensing revenue from Marvel properties was offset by higher costs primarily from the amortization of intangible assets related to the Marvel acquisition. The increase in operating income was driven by lower cost sat our North American Disney stores and by publishing revenue from Marvel properties.
As I mentioned earlier, our fiscal 2009 year included an extra week. So results in this year’s fourth quarter will therefore reflect one fewer week of operations compared to prior year.
On a separate note, a jury recently returned to verdict against ABC and our ongoing litigation with Celador regarding Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. We believe that the verdict was an error and we intend to vigorously seek to have it reversed. Based on our assessment of the merits of our position, we have not recorded a charge for this matter.
We continuously assess whether our portfolio of assets enables us to maximize shareholder value and aligns with our strategic priorities. Our pending sale of Miramax for approximately $660 million reflects our focus on maximizing the value of our assets and on directing our resources towards branded entertainment with strong franchise potential. We expect that the Miramax transaction once completed will have minimal impact on earnings moving forward.
Bob earlier referred to our Playdom acquisition. We are acquiring the company for total consideration of approximately $563 million with the potential for an additional earn out payments of up to $200 million at the end of calendar 2012.
The deal was structured such that our projected return will be higher if the earn-outs are achieved. We expect the deal to be modestly dilutive to earnings for the next several years. The dilution is driven in part by both the amortization of intangibles and the treatment of a portion of the purchase price that will be paid over the next several years as compensation expense for accounting purposes.
We also expect to continue returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. We have completed buying back the shares we issued for Marvel. As of today, we have repurchased over 61 million shares for approximately $2 billion in the fiscal year.
We’re pleased with the results we delivered so far this year. Looking forward, we plan to continue to closely manage costs. At the same time, we will continue to make prude investments to position our businesses for long-term growth.
With that, I’ll turn the call back to Lowell for Q&A.

So, we’re going to continue to console games. They will primarily be Disney-branded, not all Disney-branded, and they will in most cases be derivative of product that’s been made for other segments of the company, like our motion pictures.
So I guess, as you look at our strategy, you’d see a blend of investment and some reallocation of investment from the console side to basically this multifaceted side. Also, it became pretty clear to us that game playing and social networks is real, here to stay. Obviously, the multitude of people that are already playing, they’re about 0.5 billion people who are members of Facebook already. About 40% of those people participate in game playing.
I mentioned in my remarks that the customer base is pretty diverse from 18 to post 50. It’s dual-gender, meaning it doesn’t skew just in the men’s direction, which we know a lot of other games do. It seemed tailor-made for not only Disney-branded games, but Marvel and ESPN, and we really like the opportunity.
The other thing that was really interesting to us is that we now have over 50 million people, who are members of various Disney, ESPN, and ABC Groups on Facebook. So, we began with a very, very solid base of people to market to and when you add to that the over 40 million people, who are playing Playdom games already, that seemed pretty compelling to us.

And then second for Jay, coming out of the last recession on theme parks, Disney gave us at least a rough time table to when we could see the domestic park margins back at 20%. I was wondering if you could do the same or if it's too early to tell right now?

We think we’re just really at the beginning of pretty significant migration in terms of consumption and distribution of digital media, and therefore, we’ve laid down a lot of bets, some relatively small or inexpensive and some substantially larger.

Just looking at what’s happened in the past few months since the iPad was released as for instance, and we feel that in order for us not only to be relevant, but in order for us grow our business we have to be in this space.
We believe long-term that monetization will occur in compelling ways, we think it will be diverse in terms of how it is delivered from micro payments, we will see for instance on the social games front to subscriptions, which will see from places like Hulu and obviously, on the social games front to advertising to varying forms of pay-per-view. We’re pretty pleased with how we’ve entered the market as broad and diverse as it is.
It's clear that our audiences for our various brands are using digital media more and more, and we feel good about where we are. Very specifically, just look at some of the trends I mentioned basically off-network viewing of the World Cup on ESPN, and how significantly that was. If you just look at their growth in digital advertising, which is expected to be well over 40% this year, that’s also rather significant.
So we like the trends, we also like being there first, because we like to learn quickly. In some cases, there is a trial-and-error experience as well, and generally speaking as I think our actions have indicated, we’re bullish about the future of digital media.

We basically are trying to reduce the amount of discounting, promotional discounting that we’ve been doing in the depth of the recession to maintain our volumes and carefully playing off our rates with our volumes. That strategy evidenced itself in Q3 in some of the numbers that I talked about with some volume declines, but also rate increases and we will continue to do that through the fourth quarter and I have stated before that hope to be back to sort of a normal level of promotional activity in fiscal 2011.
I would say that the economy continues to characterize itself as a fairly uncertain play, so I think it would be imprudent to give a timetable for when our Parks business would return to what we come to know as more normalized margins.

Clearly, the addition of Facebook currency, while in some cases can be viewed as Facebook acting like a gatekeeper, the existence of that currency I think will enable more people to spend money in their games experience. So I think it's mutually beneficial.
The other thing that I think as to be considered is that these games exist on multiple platforms and we’re going to take a platform agnostic approach to the distribution of these games, not only to other social networks but just to other platform. There is no reason why you can’t play some of these games on, what I’ll call traditional dot com sites or on mobile devices and we intent to distribute rather broadly, particularly as we move our IP through Playdom into the system.

I would call our Q3 spending quite modest, but probably by the time we launch The Disney Dream ultimately, we’ll be looking in the area of tens of millions of dollars of advertising and pre-launch spending in addition to the training that have to take place with the crew and all the other pre-launch and pre-opening activities. Relative to the size of the business, it’s extremely modest. I don’t think you’re going to see a big spike in our overall spending in theme parks, but it was a contributing factor to obviously decline in the operating income this quarter and we just thought we pointed out.

Not upside frankly the normal course of business because there is a lot of commercial development that goes on at that resort. And the magnitude was about $30 million of OI on a sale price of about $60 million in the sales price of the land.
Second question on advertising, the ABC Networks advertising revenue was flat, we talked about higher pricing on the advertising which was somewhat offset by ratings and on average little up but relatively flat. And ESPN I think I said was up 31% in their advertising revenue.

Therefore, the focus at ABC was basically adding to the schedule and building essentially up another foundation, while some of those shows, Grey’s and Desperate is still on the air. You still have Dancing with the Stars which is relatively popular, and then last season they were able to add Modern Family and Castle to the schedule and those results pretty obvious, both did extremely well and both were viewed as both commercial and critical successes.
So, I think the ABC schedule was in relatively decent shape, not to suggest that it doesn’t need some strengthening, but we were pleased in general with some of the recent developments, and we feel that the schedule they put together for the fall was a good solid schedule; those new shows in particularly are all in production, so it’s premature to really predict the outcome of those. But I think in general ABC, in terms of its prime-time programming was heading in a right direction and Paul Lee, as I mentioned, I think generously and for the right reason in my remarks, we’ve put an executive in who has a proven track record in primetime television.
ABC Family has had great success under his six-year tenure, and had some really strong shows and on schedule, and I think he brings to ABC, not only an experienced and a proven track record but a great sensibility in terms of commercial instincts and feel great about the fact that we were able to put Paul in that position.

One, when you look the margins, you grew revenues in the quarter, such if you take out the one-time gain in land obviously margins get even worse, I’m just wondering, you talked about an improving trend in theme parks from a visitation standpoint even with the reduced discounting, but what type of revenue growth do you think you need to do in order to start seeing margins reaccelerate, because obviously 3% didn’t do it, I’m just wondering kind of how long it takes to get to a revenue growth rate where you can start to expand those margins again. I realized you are not going to comment on peak margins, but just wondering where we’re going to start to turn the corner.
And then if you could just give us a sense on visitation trends, where are we in terms of U.S. versus foreign travel to Orlando drive traffic, whatever type of data you can give us on trends would be helpful. And then lastly just on Hawaii, I think you begun star selling that property. Did that hit in fiscal Q3 or that’s a fiscal Q4 when it starts to flow into results?

I am not going to be very explicit obviously about what kind of revenue growth we would satisfy your question relative to margins. But obviously, I think we’ve been crystal clear about where we’re heading here. We believed that we had a very strong strategy in maintaining volumes relative to an aggressive promotional strategy that started in the end of calendar ‘08 into ‘09 and we think that time is over that we both need to do that and want to do that.
And clearly, want to start moving our way towards what we would see as more steady state growth. We have a lot of investment underway in our themes parks, as I am sure you are aware, that comes online substantially in 2012 but starts to make its way in 2011 on both post and clearly the idea there is to.
Your other question about international trends versus domestic, frankly there is not a lot to talk about in the third quarter about that, there hasn’t actually been lot to talk about in this fiscal year the two have kind of moved in tandem there is no great movement, and international visitation as a total percentage of our parks business is not outlined with what it’s been historically. There has been some switching around by different parts of the world, but so minor that not worth talking about.

Jay mentioned this in his comment when you back out the extra week in the fourth quarter right now we’re running about 1% behind in bookings that are domestic theme parks and I want to emphasize that visibility is still relatively limited and you’re dealing with an economy that I think is certainly fragile. So I don’t know that you need to take too much out of this, but I think that that number, in fact we’re only 1% down in bookings at this time, is very encouraging because as you know, in prior quarters at this time we’ve been close to 10% in bookings versus where we were a year ago with essentially a lower discount.
So we are in a market now where the discount is definitely lower than it was a year ago, backing out that week, we are only 1% down. That suggests an improvement. There are though, as you know and as Jay said, additional costs for basically new projects that are coming on line or that are in development.
On Hawaii front, we did start selling Hawaii in the third quarter, the numbers from a revenue perspective are virtually non existent and so they will be in the fourth quarter and we’re selling Hawaii, both domestically and outside of Japan, where we established the sales center at Tokyo Disneyland, and we’re reasonably encouraged with the reaction so far to that property.

We’ve been working our way through on the international front, a change in our approach to licensing away from third-party agents and bringing the licensing in-house and that’s been an ongoing process. There has been some real progress when it comes to developing television properties, and you will see those results on Disney XD in roughly I think a year, where there will be one show coming online and then ultimately we will add to that.
We are doing a fair amount of work on the publishing front, not on the comic book area, but in basically non-comic book publishing. We feel good about that. We are developing console game. There has been a deal made between Marvel and Playdom for a social game based on Marvel character.
So there is a lot of activity in the space and we feel great about it. We feel that those assets are strong and have huge potential, Thor and Captain America, both are in production, will come out next May and next July and then a year later, Avengers hits and we feel really encouraged by what we’ve seen already on the creative front there, so all good news.
On the games front, we believe fully in the space, obviously given our investments, and we believe that overall games will be profitable for us, and particularly social games will be profitable, and we’re not giving you a timeline as to when we’ll achieve that.

The truth, Steve and I talk about a lot of things as it relates to digital media, and while we don’t agree on everything, we certainly are in agreement on the fact that devices like the iPad not only are game changers, but they probably offer us more opportunity than they threaten us. And our strategy for putting product on the iPad is to do so in a way that respects and values obviously, successful and extraordinarily profitable multichannel business that we’re in. And I realize this leads to the TV-everywhere question, so I might as well bring it up. Our belief on that is that, we need to do a few things.
One, we need to serve the consumer with new to serve the consumer with new ways to access our product basically make ourselves more convenient and more accessible and remindful of a strong price to value relationship. While at the same time protecting which is very, very important a business that has enabled us to really grow our company and our shareholder value not just through ESPN but Disney Channel, ABC Family and soon through retransmission consent or our broadcasting assets. We basically feel that there is a way for there to be peaceful co-existence or co-existence, I should say, I don’t know whether it will necessarily be peaceful.
What ABC has done with its iPad out, for instance, we think gives its customers an ability to access ABC shows that they may have missed on network or maybe they didn’t get a chance to DVR but we actually like the product because it gives us an opportunity to basically expand our eye balls and monetize in a broader way. To what extent it cannibalizes the initial business, we’re not 100% certain, but our gut is that it’s relatively negligible and that people still watch most of their TV on what I’ll call big screen connected experiences.

We grew revenue substantially and improved profitability across the majority of our businesses. Over the last five years, we've focused on building our creative capabilities and strengthening our portfolio of core brands. We've also aggressively sought growth opportunities, both on newly emerging platforms and in promising international markets, while at the same time divesting non-core businesses. 
Our focus on high-quality branded entertainment had a big impact on the results of our Studio segment, which has delivered three of the top five global and the top three U.S. films so far this year. Disney's Alice in Wonderland, Pixar's Toy Story 3 and Marvel's Iron Man 2. These films are both creatively and financially successful, and have been leveraged across many of our businesses. Toy Story merchandise sales reached new heights as consumers responded to a fresh line of well-designed products available globally, and this bodes well for Pixar's next feature film, Cars 2, opening in June of 2011. 
At Media Networks, ESPN had a fantastic quarter, creatively and commercially. What ESPN did with and for the FIFA World Cup was nothing short of spectacular. The month-long event was a ratings, revenue and brand-building success, while ESPN's high-quality multi-platform coverage significantly raised the World Cup's U.S. profile. It's worth noting that about one quarter of ESPN's total revenue from the event came from non-linear platforms, including ESPN3, apps for the iPhone and iPad, ESPN Mobile TV, ESPN.com and Radio [ESPN Radio].
In addition to the World Cup programming, the NBA also delivered great results, with one of the most thrilling finals in a long time. ESPN, with ABC really rose to the occasion and the finals were the most viewed series in a decade.
Our other cable channels also performed well during the quarter. Disney Channel continues to command high ratings, with successful shows including Phineas and Ferb and Good Luck Charlie. The channel also has continued to expand its international presence. And ABC Family has been on an extraordinary run, with Millennial audience favorites like Secret Life of the American Teenager and a new hit in Pretty Little Liars.
A few days ago, we announced that ABC Family's Paul Lee will assume the role of President, ABC Entertainment Group. With six years at ABC Family, Paul is a proven leader, showing great commercial instincts and a skill at developing distinctive shows that really put ABC Family on the map as an identifiable brand. And we're pleased to have him in his new, very important role.
At Parks and Resorts, earlier this summer, we unveiled World of Color, an amazing new attraction that's been bringing record crowds to Disney California Adventure. It shows once again that when our imagineers blend smart storytelling, technological innovation and brilliant execution, they create something truly special. The World of Color is the first of our next generation of attractions at California Adventure and its early success is a promising sign for our investments there.
I'd like to turn now to our acquisition of Playdom and to update you on our overall game strategy. We're all aware of the rapid growth of social networks and the huge popularity of the games available on them. In fact, the Nielsen study published last week shows that in the U.S., social gaming has overtaken personal e-mail as the number two activity on the web, and we expect social gaming to grow at a compounded rate of more than 30% annually. Game playing on social networks is already a mainstream experience, attracting a broad diverse customer base. We feel its essential for us to have a robust presence in social networks and to do so in the right way. In Playdom, we bought a successful company, notable for its creative abilities and its potential to leverage our brands in this fast-growing market that's already engaged millions of consumers worldwide. Playdom brings us the talent, technical expertise and market know-how vital to rapid success in this space. 
With the acquisition of Playdom and of Tapulous, a developer that specializes in mobile games and apps, we now have a diversified multifaceted games business, capable of creating a wide range of experiences to meet evolving consumer interests. We will remain in console games with Disney branded titles. We'll also devote resources to the creation of social games, mobile games and apps. Our successful virtual worlds like Club Penguin continue to grow domestically and internationally, and we'll continue to launch new ones like the highly anticipated World of Cars, which debuts tomorrow. We believe that having this kind of breadth and depth of both development skills and product offerings is important to achieving real and lasting growth in the games arena. As is the case with Pixar, Club Penguin and Marvel, the talented people at Playdom and Tapulous will benefit from access to our content, brands and financial resources while operating in an environment that led to their initial success.
In sum, our strong third quarter performance underscores the value of sticking to a smart strategy even in tough times, of investing in the right people and are focusing relentlessly on quality and innovation to drive growth and shareholder value. I'm very proud of what we've been able to do and really excited about where we're going. 
And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay."

The strong results we delivered in Q3 reflect in part improvement in the business environment, but also our continued focus on managing the financial discipline even as we invest in the future growth of our company.
Starting with Media Networks, it was the largest driver of our year-over-year increase in operating income, driven primarily by ESPN. At Cable Networks, higher affiliate and advertising revenue at ESPN more than offset an increase in sports rights and production costs for the World Cup and ESPN U.K. On our Q2 call, I said that we expected a year-over-year increase in net affiliate revenue recognition of at least $155 million in Q3. ESPN ended up reaching more programming commitment than expected in Q3. As such, ESPN benefited from the recognition of approximately $380 million more in net deferred affiliate revenue in Q3 this year compared to prior year or $225 million more than we expected. Although this timing shift does not impact our full year results, we do expect ESPN to recognize about $355 million less in net deferred affiliate revenue in Q4 than in the prior year. Excluding the impact of earlier affiliate revenue recognition, Q3 operating income at Cable Networks was still up by 16%.
ESPN's ad revenue was up 31% in the quarter. ESPN benefited from the World Cup programming and two additional NBA Finals games compared to prior Q3. After adjusting for these events, we estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up by 17%. 
At Broadcasting, higher advertising revenues at our local stations and sales of ABC own shows more than offset an increase in programming cost at the ABC Network. Ad revenue at our owned TV stations came in 32% above prior year, led by increases in the automotive, political and electronics categories. At the ABC Network, scatter pricing came in 33% above upfront levels.
Thus far in Q4, ABC Network scatter pricing is running almost 20% above upfront levels. Ad sales at both ESPN and our TV stations are pacing up by double digits versus prior year. While the advertising market is currently quite strong, visibility remains somewhat limited. We are pleased with our upfront results across our media properties, including ABC, ESPN and ABC Family.
Our Studio Entertainment segment delivered strong results in Q3, driven by the theatrical performance of Toy Story 3, Alice in Wonderland and Iron Man 2. Results also benefited from lower home video costs and increased TV distribution sales in international markets, but were impacted by higher costs incurred from film cost write-downs.
Turning to Parks and Resorts, while revenues were up 3% in the quarter, operating income came in 8% below prior Q3. Several items impacted margins at the Parks segment. Due to a calendar shift, Q3 results included one less week of the Easter holiday compared to prior year. Our domestic parks also incurred costs associated with new entertainment offerings, including World of Color at California Adventure. Our Cruise Line business had increased costs related to the upcoming launch of our new ship, the Disney Dream. In addition, the segment continues to be impacted by labor cost inflation and higher pension and postretirement medical costs. As we've said previously, we've been reducing the level of discounting in our promotional offers since the beginning of fiscal 2010, with the expectation that we would make near-term trade-offs between rate and volume. Similar to last quarter, per capita guest spending was up by 5%. Attendance at our domestic parks came in 3% lower than prior year levels, with Walt Disney World down 2% and Disneyland down 4%. When adjusting for the calendar shift of one Easter holiday week, we estimate that combined attendance was down by only one percentage point compared to prior year.
At our domestic hotels, average room spending was up, while occupancy was lower than in the prior year. Room spending at our hotels was 4% above prior year levels, with an increase at Walt Disney World and a decline at Disneyland.
Occupancy at our Orlando hotels was about eight percentage points lower than prior year levels at 83%, while Anaheim occupancy was down three percentage points at 80%. 
Results at our Cruise Line were lower than in the prior year, driven by some softness in European itineraries, increased expenses for our new ship launch, which I mentioned earlier, and higher fuel costs.
At our international parks, guest spending improved at both Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland. Attendance was up 1% in Paris and also up 35% in Hong Kong, which was driven by higher guest visitation from mainland China and international markets. Real estate operations in Disneyland Paris also benefited from a large transaction in the quarter. 
So far this quarter, domestic hotel reservations on the books are pacing 9% behind prior year. However, as you may recall, last year's fiscal Q4 included an extra week due to our accounting calendar. Excluding the impact of the extra week, Q4 bookings so far this year are running just 1% behind last year.
At Consumer Products, we were very pleased with Toy Story merchandise sales in the quarter. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue grew by 18%. Licensing revenue from Marvel properties was offset by higher costs, primarily from the amortization of intangible assets related to the Marvel acquisition. The increase in operating income was driven by lower costs at our North American Disney stores and by publishing revenue from Marvel properties.
As I mentioned earlier, our fiscal 2009 year included an extra week. So results in this year's fourth quarter will therefore reflect one fewer week of operations compared to prior year. On a separate note, a jury recently returned the verdict against ABC in our ongoing litigation with Celador regarding Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. We believe that the verdict was an error and we intend to vigorously seek to have it reversed. Based on our assessment of the merits of our position, we have not recorded a charge for this matter.
We continuously assess whether our portfolio of assets enables us to maximize shareholder value and aligns with our strategic priorities. Our pending sale of Miramax for approximately $660 million reflects our focus on maximizing the value of our assets and on directing our resources towards branded entertainment with strong franchise potential. We expect that the Miramax transaction, once completed, will have minimal impact on earnings moving forward.
Bob earlier referred to our Playdom acquisition. We are acquiring the company for total consideration of approximately $563 million, with the potential for an additional earn-out payments of up to $200 million at the end of calendar 2012. The deal is structured such that our projected return would be higher if the earn outs are achieved. We expect the deal to be modestly dilutive to earnings for the next several years. The dilution is driven in part by both the amortization of intangibles and the treatment of a portion of the purchase price that will be paid over the next several years as compensation expense for accounting purposes. We also expect to continue returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. We have completed buying back the shares we issued from Marvel. As of today, we have repurchased over 61 million shares for approximately $2 billion in the fiscal year. 
We're pleased with the results we delivered so far this year. Looking forward, we plan to continue to closely manage costs. At the same time, we will continue to make prudent investments to position our businesses for long-term growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Lowell for Q&A."

And as we look at the sector, we see a diversity of platforms and basically of experiences from the console games, which we will remain in, to the social games, which we've just bought into, as well as mobile apps and casual games online and virtual worlds like Club Penguin. So we're going to continue to make console games. They will primarily be Disney branded, not all Disney branded. And they will, in most cases, be derivative of product that's been made for other segments of the company like our Motion Pictures. So I guess as you look at our strategy, you see a blend of investment and some reallocation of investment from the console side to basically this multifaceted side. Also, it became pretty clear to us that game playing in social networks is real, here to stay. I mean, there are obviously a multitude of people that are already playing. There are about half a billion people who are members of Facebook already. About 40% of those people participate in game playing. I mentioned in my remarks that the customer base is pretty diverse from 18 to post 50. It's dual gender, meaning it's not -- it doesn't skew just in the men's direction, which we know a lot of other games do. It seemed tailor-made for not only Disney branded games, but Marvel and ESPN, and we really like the opportunity. The other thing that was really interesting to us is that we now have over 50 million people who are members of various Disney, ESPN, ABC groups on Facebook. So we begin with a very, very solid base of people to market to and when you add to that the over 40 million people who are playing Playdom games already, that seemed pretty compelling to us."

We think we're just really at the beginning of a pretty significant migration in terms of consumption and distribution of digital media.

Just look at what's happened in the past few months since the iPad was released as a for an instance. And we feel that in order for us not only to be relevant but in order for us to grow our business, we have to be in this space. We believe long-term that monetization will occur in compelling ways. We think it'll be diverse in terms of how it is delivered from micropayments. We'll see for instance on the social games front to subscriptions, which we'll see from places like Hulu and obviously, on the social games front, to advertising, to varying forms of Pay-Per-View. We're pretty pleased with how we've entered the market. As broad and as diverse as it is, it's clear that our audiences for our various brands are using digital media more and more, and we feel good about where we are. And very specifically, just look at some of the trends I mentioned, basically off network viewing of the World Cup on ESPN and how significant that was. If you just look at their growth in digital advertising, which is expected to be well over 40% this year, that's also rather significant. So we like the trends. We think we also like being there first because we like to learn quickly. In some cases, it is a trial and error experience as well. And generally speaking, as I think our actions have indicated, we're bullish about the future of digital media."

We basically are trying to reduce the amount of discounting, promotional discounting that we've been doing in the depth of the recession, to maintain our volumes and carefully playing off our rates with our volumes. That strategy evidenced itself in Q3 in some of the numbers that I talked about with some volume declines, but also rate increases and we will continue to do that through the fourth quarter, and hope -- and I've stated before that hope to be back to sort of a normal level of promotional activity in fiscal 2011. I would say that the economy continues to characterize itself as a fairly uncertain place, so I think it would be imprudent to give a timetable for when our Park business would return to what we've come to know as more normalized margins. But at the same time, we don't see any structural reason why that can't happen."

Clearly, the addition of Facebook currency, I think while it's in some cases can be viewed as Facebook acting like a gatekeeper, the existence of that currency I think will enable more people to spend money in their games experience. So I think it's mutually beneficial. The other thing that I think has to be considered is that these games exist in multiple platforms and we're going to take a platform agnostic approach to the distribution of these games. Not only to other social networks, but just to other platforms. There's no reason why you can't play some of these games on what I'll call traditional dot-com sites or in mobile devices, and we intend to distribute rather broadly, particularly as we move our IP through Playdom into the system."

I would call our Q3 spending quite modest, but probably by the time we launch the Disney Dream ultimately, we'll be looking in the area of tens of millions of dollars of advertising and prelaunch spending in addition to the training that have to take place with the crew and all the other prelaunch and preopening activities. Relative to the size of the business, it's extremely modest.

While some of those shows, Grey's and Desperate [Desperate Housewives] is still on the air. You still have Dancing with the Stars, which is relatively popular. And then last season, they were able to add Modern Family and Castle to the schedule, and those results, pretty obvious, both did extremely well and both were viewed as both commercial and critical successes.

Those shows, those new shows in particular are all in production. So it's premature to really project the outcome of those. But I think in general, ABC in terms of its primetime programming, was heading in a right direction, and in Paul Lee, as I mentioned, I think generously and for the right reason in my remarks, we put an executive in, who has a proven track record in primetime television, ABC Family has had great success under his six-year tenure, and has really strong shows and a schedule.

Starz in turn, with our endorsement at this point, as part of our deal, is the ability and is in fact streaming or making our films available stream through Netflix. And I mentioned, I think in a prior call or some prior public event, that we actually could benefit from Netflix's growth through that deal. And I won't get too specific, but basically if Netflix reaches certain thresholds, then there's more revenue that will flow to us through the Starz deal. I really don't want to get into the specifics on the premium VOD window. You're going to see not just by Disney, but I think a lot of companies in the space, a fair amount of experimentation as new technology platforms emerge, as more consumers gravitate in that direction and as the business gets just more competitive and more challenging.

I really -- if you're not going to comment on peak margins, but just wondering where we're going to start to turn the corner? And then if you could just give us a sense on visitation trends, where are we in terms of U.S. versus foreign travel to Orlando drive traffic?

We believe that we had a very strong strategy in maintaining volumes, relative to an aggressive promotional strategy that started in the end of calendar '08 and into '09. And we think that the time is over, that we both need to do that and want to do that and clearly, want to start moving our way towards what we would see as more steady-state growth. We have a lot of investment underway in our theme parks, as I'm sure you are aware that comes online. Substantially, in 2012, what starts to make its way in, in 2011 on both posts. And clearly, the idea there is to continue to grow our business and continue to solidify our strong position and resulting revenue growth in margins will follow suit. Your other question about international trends versus domestic, frankly there's not a lot to talk about in the third quarter about that. There hasn't actually been a lot to talk about in this fiscal year. The two have kind of moved in tandem. There's no great movement and international visitation as a total percentage of our Parks business, is not out of line with what it's been historically. There's been some switching around by different parts of the world, but so minor that not worth talking about."

And I want to emphasize that visibility is still relatively limited and you're dealing with an economy that I think is certainly fragile. So I don't know that you need to take too much out of this, but I think that, that number, the fact there we're only 1% down on bookings at this time, is very encouraging. Because as you know, in prior quarters at this time, we've been close to 10% down in bookings versus where we were a year ago, with essentially a lower discount. So we're in the market now with a discount that's definitely lower than it was a year ago. Backing out that week, we're only 1% down. That suggests an improvement. There are though, as you know and as Jay said, additional costs for basically new projects that are coming online or that are in development.

And while we don't agree on everything, we certainly are in agreement on the fact that devices like the iPad not only are game changers, but they probably offer us more opportunities than they threaten us. And our strategy for putting product on the iPad is to do so in a way that respects and values, the obviously successful and extraordinarily profitable multichannel business that we're in. And I realized this leads to the TV Everywhere question, so I might as well bring it up. Our belief on that is that we need to do a few things. One, we need to serve the consumer with new ways to access our product, basically make ourselves more convenient and more accessible, and be mindful of a strong price to value relationship. While at the same time, protecting, which is very, very important, a business that has enabled us to really grow our company and our shareholder value, not just through ESPN, but Disney Channel, ABC Family and soon through retransmission consent, our broadcasting assets. And we basically feel that there is a way for there to be peaceful coexistence or coexistence I should say. I don't know whether it will necessarily be peaceful. What ABC has done with its iPad app for instance, we think gives its customers an ability to access ABC shows that they may have missed on network or maybe they didn't get a chance to DVR it, but we actually like the product because it gives us an opportunity to basically expand our eyeballs and monetize in a broader way. To what extent it cannibalizes the initial business, we're not 100% certain but our gut is that it's relatively negligible, and that people still watch most of their TV on what I'll call big screen connected experiences."

We grew revenue substantially and improved profitability across the majority of our businesses. Over the last five years, we've focused on building our creative capabilities and strengthening our portfolio of core brands. We've also aggressively sought growth opportunities, both on newly emerging platforms and in promising international markets, while at the same time divesting non-core businesses. 
Our focus on high-quality branded entertainment had a big impact on the results of our Studio segment, which has delivered three of the top five global and the top three U.S. films so far this year. Disney's Alice in Wonderland, Pixar's Toy Story 3 and Marvel's Iron Man 2. These films are both creatively and financially successful, and have been leveraged across many of our businesses. Toy Story merchandise sales reached new heights as consumers responded to a fresh line of well-designed products available globally, and this bodes well for Pixar's next feature film, Cars 2, opening in June of 2011. 
At Media Networks, ESPN had a fantastic quarter, creatively and commercially. What ESPN did with and for the FIFA World Cup was nothing short of spectacular. The month-long event was a ratings, revenue and brand-building success, while ESPN's high-quality multi-platform coverage significantly raised the World Cup's U.S. profile. It's worth noting that about one quarter of ESPN's total revenue from the event came from non-linear platforms, including ESPN3, apps for the iPhone and iPad, ESPN Mobile TV, ESPN.com and Radio [ESPN Radio].
In addition to the World Cup programming, the NBA also delivered great results, with one of the most thrilling finals in a long time. ESPN, with ABC really rose to the occasion and the finals were the most viewed series in a decade.
Our other cable channels also performed well during the quarter. Disney Channel continues to command high ratings, with successful shows including Phineas and Ferb and Good Luck Charlie. The channel also has continued to expand its international presence. And ABC Family has been on an extraordinary run, with Millennial audience favorites like Secret Life of the American Teenager and a new hit in Pretty Little Liars.
A few days ago, we announced that ABC Family's Paul Lee will assume the role of President, ABC Entertainment Group. With six years at ABC Family, Paul is a proven leader, showing great commercial instincts and a skill at developing distinctive shows that really put ABC Family on the map as an identifiable brand. And we're pleased to have him in his new, very important role.
At Parks and Resorts, earlier this summer, we unveiled World of Color, an amazing new attraction that's been bringing record crowds to Disney California Adventure. It shows once again that when our imagineers blend smart storytelling, technological innovation and brilliant execution, they create something truly special. The World of Color is the first of our next generation of attractions at California Adventure and its early success is a promising sign for our investments there.
I'd like to turn now to our acquisition of Playdom and to update you on our overall game strategy. We're all aware of the rapid growth of social networks and the huge popularity of the games available on them. In fact, the Nielsen study published last week shows that in the U.S., social gaming has overtaken personal e-mail as the number two activity on the web, and we expect social gaming to grow at a compounded rate of more than 30% annually. Game playing on social networks is already a mainstream experience, attracting a broad diverse customer base. We feel its essential for us to have a robust presence in social networks and to do so in the right way. In Playdom, we bought a successful company, notable for its creative abilities and its potential to leverage our brands in this fast-growing market that's already engaged millions of consumers worldwide. Playdom brings us the talent, technical expertise and market know-how vital to rapid success in this space. 
With the acquisition of Playdom and of Tapulous, a developer that specializes in mobile games and apps, we now have a diversified multifaceted games business, capable of creating a wide range of experiences to meet evolving consumer interests. We will remain in console games with Disney branded titles. We'll also devote resources to the creation of social games, mobile games and apps. Our successful virtual worlds like Club Penguin continue to grow domestically and internationally, and we'll continue to launch new ones like the highly anticipated World of Cars, which debuts tomorrow. We believe that having this kind of breadth and depth of both development skills and product offerings is important to achieving real and lasting growth in the games arena. As is the case with Pixar, Club Penguin and Marvel, the talented people at Playdom and Tapulous will benefit from access to our content, brands and financial resources while operating in an environment that led to their initial success.
In sum, our strong third quarter performance underscores the value of sticking to a smart strategy even in tough times, of investing in the right people and are focusing relentlessly on quality and innovation to drive growth and shareholder value. I'm very proud of what we've been able to do and really excited about where we're going. 
And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay."

The strong results we delivered in Q3 reflect in part improvement in the business environment, but also our continued focus on managing the financial discipline even as we invest in the future growth of our company.
Starting with Media Networks, it was the largest driver of our year-over-year increase in operating income, driven primarily by ESPN. At Cable Networks, higher affiliate and advertising revenue at ESPN more than offset an increase in sports rights and production costs for the World Cup and ESPN U.K. On our Q2 call, I said that we expected a year-over-year increase in net affiliate revenue recognition of at least $155 million in Q3. ESPN ended up reaching more programming commitment than expected in Q3. As such, ESPN benefited from the recognition of approximately $380 million more in net deferred affiliate revenue in Q3 this year compared to prior year or $225 million more than we expected. Although this timing shift does not impact our full year results, we do expect ESPN to recognize about $355 million less in net deferred affiliate revenue in Q4 than in the prior year. Excluding the impact of earlier affiliate revenue recognition, Q3 operating income at Cable Networks was still up by 16%.
ESPN's ad revenue was up 31% in the quarter. ESPN benefited from the World Cup programming and two additional NBA Finals games compared to prior Q3. After adjusting for these events, we estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up by 17%. 
At Broadcasting, higher advertising revenues at our local stations and sales of ABC own shows more than offset an increase in programming cost at the ABC Network. Ad revenue at our owned TV stations came in 32% above prior year, led by increases in the automotive, political and electronics categories. At the ABC Network, scatter pricing came in 33% above upfront levels.
Thus far in Q4, ABC Network scatter pricing is running almost 20% above upfront levels. Ad sales at both ESPN and our TV stations are pacing up by double digits versus prior year. While the advertising market is currently quite strong, visibility remains somewhat limited. We are pleased with our upfront results across our media properties, including ABC, ESPN and ABC Family.
Our Studio Entertainment segment delivered strong results in Q3, driven by the theatrical performance of Toy Story 3, Alice in Wonderland and Iron Man 2. Results also benefited from lower home video costs and increased TV distribution sales in international markets, but were impacted by higher costs incurred from film cost write-downs.
Turning to Parks and Resorts, while revenues were up 3% in the quarter, operating income came in 8% below prior Q3. Several items impacted margins at the Parks segment. Due to a calendar shift, Q3 results included one less week of the Easter holiday compared to prior year. Our domestic parks also incurred costs associated with new entertainment offerings, including World of Color at California Adventure. Our Cruise Line business had increased costs related to the upcoming launch of our new ship, the Disney Dream. In addition, the segment continues to be impacted by labor cost inflation and higher pension and postretirement medical costs. As we've said previously, we've been reducing the level of discounting in our promotional offers since the beginning of fiscal 2010, with the expectation that we would make near-term trade-offs between rate and volume. Similar to last quarter, per capita guest spending was up by 5%. Attendance at our domestic parks came in 3% lower than prior year levels, with Walt Disney World down 2% and Disneyland down 4%. When adjusting for the calendar shift of one Easter holiday week, we estimate that combined attendance was down by only one percentage point compared to prior year.
At our domestic hotels, average room spending was up, while occupancy was lower than in the prior year. Room spending at our hotels was 4% above prior year levels, with an increase at Walt Disney World and a decline at Disneyland.
Occupancy at our Orlando hotels was about eight percentage points lower than prior year levels at 83%, while Anaheim occupancy was down three percentage points at 80%. 
Results at our Cruise Line were lower than in the prior year, driven by some softness in European itineraries, increased expenses for our new ship launch, which I mentioned earlier, and higher fuel costs.
At our international parks, guest spending improved at both Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland. Attendance was up 1% in Paris and also up 35% in Hong Kong, which was driven by higher guest visitation from mainland China and international markets. Real estate operations in Disneyland Paris also benefited from a large transaction in the quarter. 
So far this quarter, domestic hotel reservations on the books are pacing 9% behind prior year. However, as you may recall, last year's fiscal Q4 included an extra week due to our accounting calendar. Excluding the impact of the extra week, Q4 bookings so far this year are running just 1% behind last year.
At Consumer Products, we were very pleased with Toy Story merchandise sales in the quarter. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue grew by 18%. Licensing revenue from Marvel properties was offset by higher costs, primarily from the amortization of intangible assets related to the Marvel acquisition. The increase in operating income was driven by lower costs at our North American Disney stores and by publishing revenue from Marvel properties.
As I mentioned earlier, our fiscal 2009 year included an extra week. So results in this year's fourth quarter will therefore reflect one fewer week of operations compared to prior year. On a separate note, a jury recently returned the verdict against ABC in our ongoing litigation with Celador regarding Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. We believe that the verdict was an error and we intend to vigorously seek to have it reversed. Based on our assessment of the merits of our position, we have not recorded a charge for this matter.
We continuously assess whether our portfolio of assets enables us to maximize shareholder value and aligns with our strategic priorities. Our pending sale of Miramax for approximately $660 million reflects our focus on maximizing the value of our assets and on directing our resources towards branded entertainment with strong franchise potential. We expect that the Miramax transaction, once completed, will have minimal impact on earnings moving forward.
Bob earlier referred to our Playdom acquisition. We are acquiring the company for total consideration of approximately $563 million, with the potential for an additional earn-out payments of up to $200 million at the end of calendar 2012. The deal is structured such that our projected return would be higher if the earn outs are achieved. We expect the deal to be modestly dilutive to earnings for the next several years. The dilution is driven in part by both the amortization of intangibles and the treatment of a portion of the purchase price that will be paid over the next several years as compensation expense for accounting purposes. We also expect to continue returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. We have completed buying back the shares we issued from Marvel. As of today, we have repurchased over 61 million shares for approximately $2 billion in the fiscal year. 
We're pleased with the results we delivered so far this year. Looking forward, we plan to continue to closely manage costs. At the same time, we will continue to make prudent investments to position our businesses for long-term growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Lowell for Q&A."

And as we look at the sector, we see a diversity of platforms and basically of experiences from the console games, which we will remain in, to the social games, which we've just bought into, as well as mobile apps and casual games online and virtual worlds like Club Penguin. So we're going to continue to make console games. They will primarily be Disney branded, not all Disney branded. And they will, in most cases, be derivative of product that's been made for other segments of the company like our Motion Pictures. So I guess as you look at our strategy, you see a blend of investment and some reallocation of investment from the console side to basically this multifaceted side. Also, it became pretty clear to us that game playing in social networks is real, here to stay. I mean, there are obviously a multitude of people that are already playing. There are about half a billion people who are members of Facebook already. About 40% of those people participate in game playing. I mentioned in my remarks that the customer base is pretty diverse from 18 to post 50. It's dual gender, meaning it's not -- it doesn't skew just in the men's direction, which we know a lot of other games do. It seemed tailor-made for not only Disney branded games, but Marvel and ESPN, and we really like the opportunity. The other thing that was really interesting to us is that we now have over 50 million people who are members of various Disney, ESPN, ABC groups on Facebook. So we begin with a very, very solid base of people to market to and when you add to that the over 40 million people who are playing Playdom games already, that seemed pretty compelling to us."

So if you could just update us on how you're approaching that, that'd be great.

We think we're just really at the beginning of a pretty significant migration in terms of consumption and distribution of digital media. And therefore, we've laid down a lot of bets, some relatively small or inexpensive, and some substantially larger. We watch with great interest, obviously, significant growth in consumption. Just look at what's happened in the past few months since the iPad was released as a for an instance. And we feel that in order for us not only to be relevant but in order for us to grow our business, we have to be in this space. We believe long-term that monetization will occur in compelling ways. We think it'll be diverse in terms of how it is delivered from micropayments. We'll see for instance on the social games front to subscriptions, which we'll see from places like Hulu and obviously, on the social games front, to advertising, to varying forms of Pay-Per-View. We're pretty pleased with how we've entered the market. As broad and as diverse as it is, it's clear that our audiences for our various brands are using digital media more and more, and we feel good about where we are. And very specifically, just look at some of the trends I mentioned, basically off network viewing of the World Cup on ESPN and how significant that was. If you just look at their growth in digital advertising, which is expected to be well over 40% this year, that's also rather significant. So we like the trends. We think we also like being there first because we like to learn quickly. In some cases, it is a trial and error experience as well. And generally speaking, as I think our actions have indicated, we're bullish about the future of digital media."

We basically are trying to reduce the amount of discounting, promotional discounting that we've been doing in the depth of the recession, to maintain our volumes and carefully playing off our rates with our volumes. That strategy evidenced itself in Q3 in some of the numbers that I talked about with some volume declines, but also rate increases and we will continue to do that through the fourth quarter, and hope -- and I've stated before that hope to be back to sort of a normal level of promotional activity in fiscal 2011. I would say that the economy continues to characterize itself as a fairly uncertain place, so I think it would be imprudent to give a timetable for when our Park business would return to what we've come to know as more normalized margins. But at the same time, we don't see any structural reason why that can't happen."

Clearly, the addition of Facebook currency, I think while it's in some cases can be viewed as Facebook acting like a gatekeeper, the existence of that currency I think will enable more people to spend money in their games experience. So I think it's mutually beneficial. The other thing that I think has to be considered is that these games exist in multiple platforms and we're going to take a platform agnostic approach to the distribution of these games. Not only to other social networks, but just to other platforms. There's no reason why you can't play some of these games on what I'll call traditional dot-com sites or in mobile devices, and we intend to distribute rather broadly, particularly as we move our IP through Playdom into the system."

I would call our Q3 spending quite modest, but probably by the time we launch the Disney Dream ultimately, we'll be looking in the area of tens of millions of dollars of advertising and prelaunch spending in addition to the training that have to take place with the crew and all the other prelaunch and preopening activities. Relative to the size of the business, it's extremely modest.

We launched what we hope, and has every indications is going to be a great title for us with Toy Story 3, which we launched concurrent with the movie. And getting out and marketing that and making sure that it hits the street with momentum, is basically the offset to the revenue that we experienced in this quarter for DIMG. And in general of course, we're still in the building stages in that space. The write-downs. So there were a couple of film titles first at the studio, a couple of film titles that did not perform to our expectations in the quarter. And obviously, we take the write-down in the quarter they released based on -- and actually if they're before our earnings announcement, based on the shortfall and what we see in the ultimate, and that was the vast majority of that. Our TV write-downs, normal part of the business. Pilots and things that we develop and movies that we develop for the network that don't live up to their perspective.

And in one case, Lost is now off the schedule because it has finale-d this past season. And therefore, the focus at ABC was basically adding to the schedule and building essentially up another foundation. While some of those shows, Grey's and Desperate [Desperate Housewives] is still on the air. You still have Dancing with the Stars, which is relatively popular. And then last season, they were able to add Modern Family and Castle to the schedule, and those results, pretty obvious, both did extremely well and both were viewed as both commercial and critical successes. So I think the ABC schedule was in a relatively decent shape, not to suggest that it doesn't need some strengthening, but we were pleased in general, with some of the recent developments, and we feel that the schedule they put together for the fall was a good solid schedule. Those shows, those new shows in particular are all in production. So it's premature to really project the outcome of those. But I think in general, ABC in terms of its primetime programming, was heading in a right direction, and in Paul Lee, as I mentioned, I think generously and for the right reason in my remarks, we put an executive in, who has a proven track record in primetime television, ABC Family has had great success under his six-year tenure, and has really strong shows and a schedule. And I think he brings to ABC, not only an experienced and a proven track record, but a great sensibility in terms of commercial instincts, and feel great about the fact that we were able to put Paul in that position."

I really don't want to get into the specifics on the premium VOD window. You're going to see not just by Disney, but I think a lot of companies in the space, a fair amount of experimentation as new technology platforms emerge, as more consumers gravitate in that direction and as the business gets just more competitive and more challenging.

And we think that the time is over, that we both need to do that and want to do that and clearly, want to start moving our way towards what we would see as more steady-state growth. We have a lot of investment underway in our theme parks, as I'm sure you are aware that comes online. Substantially, in 2012, what starts to make its way in, in 2011 on both posts. And clearly, the idea there is to continue to grow our business and continue to solidify our strong position and resulting revenue growth in margins will follow suit. Your other question about international trends versus domestic, frankly there's not a lot to talk about in the third quarter about that. There hasn't actually been a lot to talk about in this fiscal year. The two have kind of moved in tandem. There's no great movement and international visitation as a total percentage of our Parks business, is not out of line with what it's been historically.

Because as you know, in prior quarters at this time, we've been close to 10% down in bookings versus where we were a year ago, with essentially a lower discount. So we're in the market now with a discount that's definitely lower than it was a year ago. Backing out that week, we're only 1% down. That suggests an improvement.

And while we don't agree on everything, we certainly are in agreement on the fact that devices like the iPad not only are game changers, but they probably offer us more opportunities than they threaten us. And our strategy for putting product on the iPad is to do so in a way that respects and values, the obviously successful and extraordinarily profitable multichannel business that we're in. And I realized this leads to the TV Everywhere question, so I might as well bring it up. Our belief on that is that we need to do a few things. One, we need to serve the consumer with new ways to access our product, basically make ourselves more convenient and more accessible, and be mindful of a strong price to value relationship. While at the same time, protecting, which is very, very important, a business that has enabled us to really grow our company and our shareholder value, not just through ESPN, but Disney Channel, ABC Family and soon through retransmission consent, our broadcasting assets. And we basically feel that there is a way for there to be peaceful coexistence or coexistence I should say. I don't know whether it will necessarily be peaceful. What ABC has done with its iPad app for instance, we think gives its customers an ability to access ABC shows that they may have missed on network or maybe they didn't get a chance to DVR it, but we actually like the product because it gives us an opportunity to basically expand our eyeballs and monetize in a broader way. To what extent it cannibalizes the initial business, we're not 100% certain but our gut is that it's relatively negligible, and that people still watch most of their TV on what I'll call big screen connected experiences."

And while the Licensing business is obviously one that's important to us, one, consumer products is a great example of that, this is one case where we felt that bringing that great talent at Playdom into the company, and using that expertise to expand the company's awareness of, knowledge of, and business in social games in particular, social networking and digital media, had real value."

191564,112889447,87771,"Walt Disney Co., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 11, 2010",2010-11-11,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thank you, Lowell. Good afternoon, everyone. The 2010 fiscal year was a good one financially and strategically for our company. Performance was driven by strong branded content and the effective use of it across our businesses, resulting in a 20% jump in",1196,"Thank you, Lowell. Good afternoon, everyone. The 2010 fiscal year was a good one financially and strategically for our company. Performance was driven by strong branded content and the effective use of it across our businesses, resulting in a 20% jump in net income on a 5% rise in revenue.
Our fourth quarter earnings grew solidly after factoring out a programming write-off at one of our equity networks, the timing of ESPN revenue recognition and the effect of one fewer week of operations this year than last. Jay will provide details in a few minutes.
Over the last year, we took several important steps to position Disney for strong growth. We appointed new leaders at our movie studio, ABC Entertainment and Internet group strengthening our management team.
We continued to invest in major new attractions and experiences at our Parks and Resorts segment, and just last week we took a significant step toward final approval of Shanghai Disneyland.
We also made two significant acquisitions Marvel Entertainment and a social game publisher, Playdom. Marvel and Playdom strengthened the range of quality entertainment we offer, and provide us new and innovative ways to deliver that entertainment to consumers. They fit strategically with our brands and with our global marketing and distribution networks, benefit a wide range of our existing businesses and offer the potential of attractive returns on investments.
There’s no better example of what a successful acquisition can do for Disney than Toy Story 3, the number one animated movie in history, the best reviewed movie of the year, and a strong contender for best picture at Oscar.
On top of $1 billion in global box office it generated, Toy Story 3 drove significant business for our Consumer Products, Interactive Media, and Parks segments. Its success speaks volumes about our Pixar acquisition and our ability to maximize the value of great creative content across a broad range of markets.
We’re incredibly excited about the release next summer of Cars 2, another great Pixar adventure, whose characters already constitute one of our biggest and most robust Consumer Products franchises.
With the film to be followed by the 2012 opening of our largest ever new attraction, Cars Land at Disney’s California Adventure, we believe this great animated property can drive substantial shareholder value for years to come.
Our creative pipeline is strong and our movie studios, Tangled, TRON. Legacy and the latest chapter of our highly successful Pirates franchise are coming in fiscal 2011, as are two new Marvel epics Thor and Captain America The First Avenger.
Our Parks and Resorts segment is also unveiling compelling new attractions and experiences. Since it opened last summer World of Color, an amazing night time spectacular at California Adventure, has driven a 20% increase in attendance at that park.
Once our Little Mermaid attraction and Cars Land open in the next couple of years, the new California Adventure will stand proudly alongside Disneyland making our Anaheim resort an even more attractive family destination. Our cruise business has delivered double digit returns and has enhanced our reputation for delivering unparalleled family travel experiences.
It’s notable that Disney Cruise Line was just named the best in the world by the readers of Condé Nast Traveler. That’s before the first of our two magnificent new ships the Disney Dream, makes its maiden voyage in January, taking our cruise offering to a whole new level and new exciting destinations.
ESPN is another great example of our strategic commitment to create quality branded content and used technology to enhance that content and deliver it to consumers in new ways and the ways they want it.
ESPN has a simple and powerful mission to serve sports fans wherever sports are watched, listened to, discussed, debated, read about, or played, and that’s exactly what it does. It’s coverage and presentation of basketball, baseball, soccer, football, NASCAR, you name it is gold standard, and it has taken full advantage of technological change to provide the fans with multi-platform experience that makes ESPN the number one sports media brand.
Even as ESPN has expanded its digital reach, it posted its highest television ratings ever in 2010 fiscal year. The same holds true for ABC Family and Disney Channel, both of which also recorded their highest ever ratings in the last fiscal year.
The overall quality and innovation shown by our Media Networks, ESPN, Disney Channel, ABC Family and ABC was recognized through the multi-year agreement we signed earlier this year with Time Warner Cable. The deal acknowledges the great value of our programs and brands, while at the same time creating new products and services for the benefit of Disney, Time Warner, and consumers.
Organic growth remains our focus, but as I remarked earlier, we’ve seen the strategic additions to our business portfolio can be beneficial. When we bought Club Penguin in 2007, Disney acquired new skills in delivering compelling brand appropriate stories in an entirely new way to our core audience of kids.
We expect the acquisition to generate significant value to Disney, well in excess of the price we paid. And since the purchase, Club Penguin has more than doubled paying subscribers, expanded globally, and spun successful merchandise and package games.
While Club Penguin gave us a foothold and expertise in virtual world for kids, Playdom is doing the same in social games, an incredibly fast growing area of digital entertainment. Playdom brings strategic, operational, and analytical capabilities to Disney, while we provide them the well-known content and brands to compete even more effectively.
With the acquisition of Playdom and of Tapulous, a developer of mobile games and apps, we now have a diversified multi-faceted game business that can deliver the full range of experiences consumers want, and that allows us to continue innovating to meet their expectations. Our first game with Playdom, ESPNU College Town is off to a good start.
Marvel provides our company with a rich portfolio of characters and stories, a talented team that has extended the reach of those characters across the publishing, licensing, and movie business, and a passionate fan base not unlike Disney’s.
In addition to the two big movies coming this summer, Marvel has launched a new series on Disney XD, with more to come, and is developing several series for ABC and ABC Family. We bought back the marketing and distribution rights for Iron Man 3 and The Avengers, and are incorporating Marvel’s licensing businesses into our global sales and marketing networks to help spawn growth.
Together, these acquisitions help bolster Disney in important ways. They have given us great stories to work with and the right technology and analytical skills to bring those stories to consumers in new ways.
The acquisitions fortify the Disney brand portfolio and our ranks of talented artists, engineers, and business people, and they give us new ways to build upon our unique capacity to leverage hit properties across many businesses quickly and effectively.
The brand and franchise portfolio of the Walt Disney Company is stronger than it has ever been, and I am confident of our direction and of our ability to deliver superior returns.
With that, I’ll turn things over to Jay. Jay?

As I mentioned last quarter, results in our Q4 fiscal 2010 reflect one l",1051,"Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon, everybody. I’d like to briefly review the key drivers for Q4 and highlight some of the factors that are likely to influence our results in fiscal 2011. As I mentioned last quarter, results in our Q4 fiscal 2010 reflect one less week of operations than our Q4 fiscal 2009 results. Overall, we’re encouraged by many of the trends we’re seeing in our businesses.
At our Media segment, results of cable networks decreased year-over-year due to the timing of affiliate revenue recognition at ESPN, the impact of having one less week of operations versus last Q4 and lower equity income.
As we said on our last call, ESPN ended up reaching most of its programming commitments in Q3 this year versus Q4 last year. As a result, ESPN recognized $354 million less in net deferred affiliate revenue in Q4 than in the prior year.
At ESPN, advertising revenue was up 19%, driven by increases in the automotive, telecommunications, and financial categories. Adjusting for the impact of the extra week in last year’s Q4, as well as the relative timing of major sports events, we estimate that ESPN’s ad revenue was up by 22%.
Operating income at cable networks was also impacted by programming write-offs at Lifetime Network, our share of which was approximately $60 million, or roughly $0.02 of earnings per share.
At broadcasting, while revenue was down due to lower sales of ABC produced shows compared to prior Q4, operating income was up strongly year-over-year. Results benefited from lower cost mix for ABC Network’s prime time schedule, cost savings measures in day time and news production, and decreased sports programming costs.
Operating income also benefited from higher advertising revenues at our owned TV stations. Advertising revenue at our stations came in 15% above prior year, led by increases in the automotive, political and financial categories.
Adjusted for the 53rd week, we estimate that TV stations ad revenue was up 26%. Adjusted for the 53rd week, advertising revenues at the network were also up strongly driven by improved ratings.
Network scatter pricing came in 23% above upfront levels. Thus far in Q1, ABC Network’s scatter pricing is running 22% above upfront levels. Ad sales at both ESPN and our TV stations are pacing up by double-digits versus prior year.
Turning to Studio Entertainment, the tremendous success of Toy Story 3 in international markets drove impressive growth for this segment in the fourth quarter. Studio results were impacted in the quarter by a write-off of approximately $100 million related to our film inventory at our motion capture venture, IMD.
At Parks and Resorts, margins were impacted by higher costs at our domestic parks and by lower revenue at Disney Vacation Club. The increase in domestic costs was driven by labor cost inflations and higher pension and post retirement medical expenses.
Lower revenue at Disney Vacation Club reflected lower sales, as well as percentage of completion accounting. Results were also impacted by having one less week of operations compared to last year’s Q4.
Q4 attendance at our domestic parks came in 6% lower than prior year, but when adjusting for the impact of the extra week, we estimate that the attendance was up 1%. Per capita guest spending was up 6% driven by higher admissions pricing and food and beverage spending.
Average room spending at our domestic hotels was 5% above prior year levels with a solid increase at Walt Disney World and a slight decrease at Disneyland. Occupancy at our Orlando hotels came in one percentage point below prior year levels at 83%, and Anaheim occupancy remains steady at 84%. So far this quarter, domestic hotel reservations on the books are pacing 5% ahead of prior year.
Results at our international parks benefited from higher attendance in guest spending at both Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland Paris. Attendance was up 3% in Paris, and up 26% in Hong Kong.
At Consumer Products, our licensing business performed well on the strength of our franchises, particularly Toy Story. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue grew 12%.
Increase in the segment operating income was also driven by improved performance at our Disney stores in North America and Europe, as well as by publishing and licensing revenue from Marvel properties. We believe that our core franchises including Toy Story and Cars position us well for growth in our licensing business in fiscal 2011.
At the Interactive Media segment, results benefited from higher revenue, up for our video games, particularly Toy Story 3, and from increased subscribers to our Japan mobile service. Results were impacted by purchase accounting arising from the inclusion of Playdom.
We’re pleased with the results we delivered in fiscal 2010. The strength of our businesses and our continued focus on managing with financial discipline enable us to deliver strong cash flow, even as we invest in initiatives that position us for the long-term.
Turning to fiscal 2011, I’d like to highlight a few things that will likely influence our results. On the cost side, we expect our pension and post retirement medical expenses to increase by approximately $100 million versus fiscal 2010, due predominantly to a further reduction in the discount rate. Approximately, half of this amount will impact our Parks and Resorts segment.
In addition, we expect that overall capital expenditures will increase by at least $1 billion as several of our expansion initiatives at Parks and Resorts will meet key milestones in fiscal 2011. These include the launch of our first new cruise ship, The Disney Dream, in late January, along with a variety of projects in our different parks and resorts across the globe. We are excited about these new assets and believe they will help position Disney for long term success.
In addition to internal investments, we expect to continue returning capital to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase. During fiscal 2010, we repurchased almost 80 million shares for approximately $2.7 billion. Thus far in fiscal 2011, we’ve repurchased a little over 11 million shares for about $392 million.
As you’ve seen in our results the current trends in our businesses are encouraging. We are also optimistic about our creative pipeline, thus we believe we are well positioned to deliver strong results in 2011.
With that I’ll turn the call back to Lowell for Q&A.

On the Time Warner side, Jessica, we don’t give details. It was a deal that I think was very good not only for both sides, but also for consumers. We created a lot of compelling new products for subscriber of Time Warner Cable including authentication of ESPN and enabling Time Warner subscribers to in fact consume ESPN on a best available screen basis and also putting to the marketplace a few specific new products for ESPN like the Red Zone, which we think strengthened the relationship with Time Warner and strengthened the overall multichannel package that consumers will offer.
Obviously, the deal reflects as I said in my remarks, the considerable value that we provide not only to Time Warner Cable, but to its customers with ABC and ABC stations in retransmission consent, ABC Family, Disney Channel, and the array of ESPN Networks many of which had record ratings in 2010.

That said the studio made a number of changes to address a variety of different issues, including the cost structure of the overall business. So, if the changes that they made are to show up in results in 2011 and beyond, it would largely be due to some efficiencies, that they’ve created by streamlining their organization.
On top of that, when we looked at the business carefully, we noted a lot of things that we thought were no longer reflected the way that we were distributing our product into the global marketplace in all windows, theatrically, and what I’ll call a home video window, which is now home video and digital, and then in subsequent television windows around the world. We tried to create an organization both on the distribution side and the marketing side that reflected how buyers and distributors are now accessing this product.
For instance, we had multiple marketing organizations marketing this product to the sort of different layers or different platforms or windows that the product went into the marketplace and that seemed inefficient to us. We also felt that in creating one distribution organization, that in effect had responsibility over all windows, that they would make decisions that would be in the best interest of the property and the company overall instead of advantaging one window over another one in effect taking competition out of our internal structure that might have gotten in the way of maximizing value, particularly as consumer behavior changes and technology changes the way product is windowed and distributed to the world and we did this on a global basis.
I just was in London and the changes that were made in the structure of the company in London are particularly reflective of changes that we’re seeing in the overall marketplace and the opportunity to basically look at both, not only those changes but each product in a much more holistic way rather than in a siloed way that the old structure allowed.

So maybe I should just put some of that in perspective. I don’t think I am going to address Google TV directly. We’ve not announced the deal with them at this point and I am not going to say anything more specific about them.
We’ve been offering product into new services and new platforms and devices from almost the beginning I guess where we led the way, because we feel and we felt then and we still feel that it’s important to serve consumers on these new platforms primarily to grow revenue and to take advantage of with some pretty exciting new technologies. We also think it’s important to make legitimate product available in the market place on a well-time well-price basis to fight piracy which we don’t monetize at all.
So in essence, we’ve looked at these new opportunities as incremental to revenue that we generate for these properties as well as keeping us relevant and generally fighting piracy. What I said earlier about ESPN in best available screen, this is something that we’re looking at more and more across our businesses. It’s essentially saying to consumers that they should be able to watch our product on the best available screen to them and how we do that is I think pretty important in terms of our potential to create more value for these properties whether we’re distributing it to multichannel providers like Time Warner or whether we’re going directly to consumer or whether we’re doing it through services like Apple TV.
On the multichannel front, we’ve had conversations with a few multichannel providers very recently and we know that their concerns about code cutting and the impact of all this digital distribution on their business and the sense that we get is that the trends they’ve seen very recently which is a slight decrease in subscription and subscribers is due mostly to the economy and the fact they went to the marketplace a year ago with some pretty slow price to offer both to address to mostly address the economy and as those have expired, some of those consumers or subscribers have sort of fallen by the wayside.
The sense that we get is that, no one has any evidence at least currently of code cutting but I still think that it’s in the best interest of the company to see to it that the multichannel business remain robust. It continues to flourish because obviously it creates so much value for us.
So, we’re looking at basically the multichannel business in a bullish way but we feel that we have to very carefully balance that business with our interest as a company to grow revenue on new platforms. And creating new product like the one I described for ESPN and authenticated ESPN and these other services like Buzzer Beater and Red Zone as one way to help the multichannel providers do that.
So, we’re going to continue to look for opportunities on new devices because we think it improves monetization, but we’re also going to look for opportunities to strengthen our relationship with the multichannel providers and create product that is beneficial to us, to them, and to their consumers.

I think we’ve gone through a lot of the rationale, but I’ll just quickly talk about it a little bit more as it relates to return on invested capital, which is a metric that we follow very closely and in fact is a key metric in determining compensation of the company as well.
On the cruise ship side, you know that our returns on invested capital in that business have been stellar, in the mid-teens, and it’s our goal to continue those returns in the new ships. Obviously, it takes a little bit of time.
We’re launching The Dream in January, there are some additional costs leading up to launch, for instance, but revenue doesn’t start flowing until we set sail with paying passengers. I don’t know how much detail Jay went into, but the bookings for that ship have been extremely strong and we feel it’s a gorgeous ship and we feel quite good about not only the potential of that ship to deliver strong return on invested capital in the Caribbean, but it’s going to give us the ability and the flexibility for us to put the other ships eventually into new itineraries and new destinations, which we think will also be good.
California Adventure, I talk about, it was a bit of a brand withdrawal, as I said in a recent interview, in that it was not returning value to us at a level that we would expect or hope for. We also thought that there was a negative brand impact. So, we’re putting capital in to fix a problem that we’ve had for a long-time and to help grow the overall Disneyland Resort. The results so far have been great with World of Color, but we have a lot more to deliver between now and 2012, so the revenue will flow over time. It’s already started, but we won’t be seeing it in full until basically the latter part of 2012.
Hawaii was an investment that we made primarily to support the business. It’s also had great returns on invested capital and that is our Vacation Club or our timeshare business, where we thought that having the ability not only to sell those units directly to Disney timeshare customers, but to allow for current customers to trade points would help us continue to deliver good returns on invested capital on that business. I think I pretty much have covered the larger expenses. Jay and I have both talked about the fact that this is somewhat of a balloon in terms of capital expenses. There will be other projects.
We’re building Hong Kong out, which is relatively modest in nature and of course the one that will be sizable as Shanghai, but that’s longer term and we will have a partner. So we will not bear all of the costs. But we don’t see on the horizon anything of great significance that would cause our annual CapEx to go back up to a level that we’re looking at for 2011 for quite a while.

Also on the first question on the U.S., Jay, about affiliate revenue, which he said rent 10% for the year, obviously Time Warner is a large distributor and we did new deals for all of our services including adding retransmission consent. Now, I don’t know whether, we don’t factor that necessarily to affiliate fees, but you can expect that with ESPN’s services and ABC Family and the Disney Channel all being renewed for basically 2011 in its entirety that there will be increases in those rates from a large distributor.

I would say that, I don’t know that we’ve necessarily seen that pattern worsen. We haven’t seen anything that would reverse it or cause me to believe that I was wrong when I made that statement. It’s a title driven business, no question about it.
I mentioned Toy Story 3, which is out in the marketplace now. If ever there’s a title that would do well it would be Toy Story 3 particularly in the sell-through side because it’s a title that just makes a lot of sense for people who are going to let their kids watch it multiple times to own versus rent for instance. It will do quite well. I am not going to make predictions as to what it will do, but if you were to look at the numbers for Toy Story 3, which will be extremely strong versus what films did just three, four, five years ago, you’d be sobered by those numbers.
That said, there is a larger percentage of people with each title, or good tile that’s buying Blu-ray and in our case multiple copies. We’re out in the marketplace with Toy Story 3 with a premium product that is a Blu-ray DVD, a standard def DVD, a downloadable file, and a streamable file or a streamable code, that’s doing quite well. Actually it represents about 80% of Blu-ray sales meaning of the roughly 25% of units, Toy Story 3 that are Blu-ray with good pricing, about 80% of those are buying this multi-package.
So we’ve seen some pricing leverage or improvement because we’re out there offering more value to consumers. But it’s a business that I think meaning the movie business that we just have to watch very carefully, because even with a shift in a positive direction with the economy you’re going to see a big bounce back to what we used to see in terms of conversion rates, which is one of the reasons why we’ve taken a brand approach to our business with Pixar and Disney and Marvel, as we think we stand a chance of doing better than the industry average provided we make good movies.
On the interactive front, obviously we’re quite mindful of the losses that we’ve delivered in that business, which is basically a collection of businesses. Just about a month ago we restructured from a management perspective the business to accomplish a few things. One, we wanted to add more focus primarily so that we could both create and implement a strategy that was designed to deliver profitability because we don’t want to be in this business if we’re not going to be able to make money. So, we’re looking at it two ways. On one side we’ve got a collection of games businesses, and the other side we have a collection of largely dotcom businesses.
On the games front, we’ve seen a pretty big shift in games from console to what I’ll call multiplatform, everything from mobile apps to social networking games, and by putting John Pleasants in to run games, not only will be the focus on turning those businesses into profitability, but diversifying our presence in the business.
So, we’re not reliant on one platform that’s obviously facing challenges. It’s our goal not only to be profitable, but obviously to get there by shifting our investment and reducing our investment too. We probably will end up investing less on the console side than we have because of the shift we’re seeing in consumption and have a presence albeit with probably less investment in terms of game manufacturing on some of the newer platforms.
Consumers are obviously spending time playing games from casual games online to mobile apps to social networking to console, and we felt all along that we need to be where the consumer are and we know that our games work in a variety of places and we want to be there. We felt for a while that we should be both a licensor, which we do in some cases, but also a publisher. And I would say the shift that we’ve made in terms of personnel and ultimately in how we invest our money and how we distribute this product is going to continue to reflect that philosophy, but in a slightly different manner.
On the dotcom side, the key sites that we invest in, ESPN.com, Disney.com, ABC.com are designed to do a few things. One, they are marketing platforms, they’re brand building platforms, and they are revenue generating platforms. I’d like to get to the point where all three are run under profitable circumstances. I’d say that ESPN stands the best chance. I won’t get into specifics about ESPN’s profitability, but I can tell you that sales of things like ESPN.com home screen advertising are incredibly robust, and so that’s actually a good business for us.
On the Disney side, our goal is to create the ultimate Disney portal, not only to provide navigation, but to provide significant forms of entertainment, and that’s what Jimmy Pitaro, the new head of that business is going to do.
And then on the ABC front, we’ve got a business that’s designed to basically provide consumers with another screen experience and also help market ABC better. But I would be disappointed if we continue to lose significant amounts of money in those businesses, and if we do, I would imagine we will have to redirect in some form.

I just want to make sure that there is nothing else we should be aware of in terms of, if that’s one or the other, and it looks like $55 million of restricting and $3 million of impairment charges, and I think Bob also mentioned $100 million studio-related write-down. So, just trying to figure out what was the aggregate impact on net income and what was the adjusted earnings number for the quarter from an EPS standpoint?
Bob, you mentioned Toy Story 3 doing very well on DVD, and we’re just curious if you could talk to, it did probably 30%, 40% better domestically than Up and we’re just curious if you could give us a sense of whether you see it tracking notably higher than what Up did on DVD a year ago given that?

So the comparison is a little bit apples-to-oranges for the year ago and apples-to-apples with couple of years ago.
We continue to see real growth in Hong Kong visitation from local residents from Mainland China resident and then what I’ll call other Asia. Mainland China represents somewhere in the neighborhood of high 30s to 40% of visitation to Hong Kong Disneyland and we’re adding capacity for Hong Kong, which is not only exciting in terms of the creativity. In fact, one of them is Toy Story based it’s going to take a years for us to finish that project, but I think it’s well time to take advantage of some positive visitation trends and to also leverage our successful IP.

We didn’t get much buy-in from the industry on it, so we’re using it for our own films and we’ve rolled it out with Toy Story 3 through a relationship with Wal-Mart and their purchase of VUDU. So if you buy the multipack as I cited earlier of Toy Story 3, you have the ability to stream Toy Story 3 through VUDU, which is a form of interoperability, and you’ll see more of that as we roll out more titles. We are not inclined to or expect to enter a format war over this. I’ll quickly get out of my element if I start getting into more technological detail, but there’s actual a way that KeyChest can work with the UltraViolet platform.
Again, don’t ask me for specifics on that, but I’m sure there are others who can give you that detail, but it’s not our goal to create a format war. It’s our goal to create product and to implement technology that ultimately creates more value to the consumer, and obviously in doing so delivers more value to the distributor or the seller, whether a bricks and mortar retailer or a digital retailer, and obviously to the content owner.

They’re both real franchises and we felt for a while, mostly since we made the Marvel acquisition, that we would benefit from distributing ourselves. There’s just a big difference we believe, and this is not in any way meant to suggest criticism of the way Paramount handled it, but when everything is in-house, when it’s your product that you’re distributing and marketing and what is done is part of basically an overall franchise building strategy and brand building strategy for the company that you create more value.
I said from the beginning of the Marvel acquisition that we would be invested in growing and supporting the Marvel brand as for instance, that’s not necessarily something that was of interest to or value creation proposition to a third-party distributor like Paramount. They were in the business of distributing the film. We are in the business of distributing the film, building the franchise and growing the brand, and there was great value, although obviously, we were able to quantify it for ourselves, I’m not going to articulate all the ways that we did that. But there’s great long-term value for us in not only controlling the marketing and the distribution but of appreciating the kind of value that can be created when you do that.

The 2010 fiscal year was a good one financially and strategically for our company. Performance was driven by strong branded content and the effective use of it across our businesses resulting in a 20% jump in net income on a 5% rise in revenue. 
Our fourth quarter earnings grew solidly after factoring out a programming write-off in one of our equity networks. The timing of ESPN revenue recognition and the effective one pure week of operations this year than last. Jay will provide details in a few minutes.
Over the last year, we took several important steps to position Disney for strong growth. We appointed new leaders in our Movie Studio, ABC Entertainment and the Internet group, strengthening our management team. We continue to invest in major new attractions and experiences in our Parks and Resorts segment. 
And just last week, we took a significant step toward final approval of Shanghai Disneyland. We also made two significant acquisitions, Marvel Entertainment and the social game publisher Playdom. 
Marvel and Playdom strengthened the range of quality entertainment we offer and provide us new and innovative ways to deliver that entertainment to consumers. 
They fit strategically with our brands, and with our global marketing and distribution networks, benefit a wide range of our existing businesses and offer the potential of attractive returns on investment.
There is no better example of what a successful acquisition can do for Disney than Toy Story 3. The number one animated movie in history. The best reviewed movie of the year, and a strong contender for Best Picture Oscar. 
On top of the billion dollars in global box office it generated, Toy Story 3 drove significant business for our Consumer Products, Interactive Media and Parks segments. Its success speaks volumes about our Pixar acquisition and our ability to maximize the value of great creative content across a broad range of markets. 
We are incredibly excited about the release next summer of Cars 2, another great Pixar adventure, whose characters already constitute one of our biggest and robust Consumer Product franchises. With the film to be followed by the 2012 opening of our largest-ever new attraction, Cars Land, at Disney's California Adventure, we believe this great animated property can drive substantial shareholder value for years to come.
Our creative pipeline is strong. And our Movie Studio's Tangled, Tron: Legacy and the latest chapter of our highly successful Pirates franchise are coming in fiscal 2011 as our two new Marvel epics, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger. 
Our Parks and Resorts segment is also unveiling compelling new attractions and experiences. Since it opened last summer, World of Color, an amazing night time spectacular at California Adventure has driven a 20% increase in attendance of that park. Once our Little Mermaid attraction and Cars Land open in the next couple of years, the new California Adventure will stand proudly alongside Disneyland making our Anaheim resort an even more attractive family destination.
Our Cruise business has delivered double-digit returns and has enhanced our reputation for delivering unparalleled family travel experiences. It's notable that Disney Cruise Line was just named the best in the world by the readers of Condé Nast Traveler. And that's before the first of our two magnificent new ships, the Disney Dream makes it's maiden voyage in January taking our cruise offering to a whole new level and new exciting destinations. 
ESPN is another great example of our strategic commitment to create quality brand and content and use technology to enhance that content and deliver it to consumers in new ways and the ways they want it. ESPN has a simple and powerful mission to serve sports fans wherever sports are watched, listened to, discussed, debated, read about or played. And that's exactly what it does. Its coverage and presentation of basketball, baseball, soccer, football, NASCAR, you name it is gold standard, and is taking full advantage of technological change to provide fans a multi-platform experience that makes ESPN the number one sports media brand. Even though ESPN has expanded its digital reach, it posted its highest television ratings ever in 2010 fiscal year. 
The same holds true for ABC Family and Disney Channel, both of which also recorded their highest-ever ratings in the last fiscal year. The overall quality and innovation shown by our Media Networks, ESPN, Disney Channel, ABC Family and ABC was recognized through the multi-year agreement we signed earlier this year with Time Warner Cable. The deal acknowledges the great value of our programs and brands, while at the same time creating new products and services to the benefit of Disney, Time Warner and consumers. 
Organic growth remains our focus but as I remarked earlier, we've seen the strategic additions to our business portfolio can be beneficial. When we bought Club Penguin in 2007, Disney acquired new skills in delivering compelling brand and appropriate stories in an entirely new way to our core audience and kids. 
We expect the acquisition to generate significant value to Disney well in excess of the price we paid. And since the purchase, Club Penguin has more than doubled paying subscribers, expanded globally and spawned successful merchandise and packaged games. 
While Club Penguin gave us a foothold and expertise in virtual world for kids, Playdom is doing the same in social games, an incredibly fast growing area of digital entertainment. 
Playdom brings strategic, operational and analytical capabilities to Disney, while we provide them the well-known content and brands to compete even more effectively. With the acquisition of Playdom and of Tapulous, a developer of mobile games and apps, we now have a diversified multi-faceted game business that can deliver the full range of experiences consumers want, and then allows us to continue innovating to meet their expectations. Our first game with Playdom, ESPNU College Town is off to a good start. 
Marvel provides our company with a rich portfolio of characters and stories, a talented team that has extended the reach of those characters across the publishing, licensing and movie business, and a passionate fan base not unlike Disney's. 
In addition to the two big movies coming this summer, Marvel has launched a new series on Disney XD with more to come and is developing several series for ABC and ABC Family. We bought back the marketing and distribution rights for Iron Man 3 and The Avengers and are incorporating Marvel's licensing businesses into our global sales and marketing networks to help spawn growth. Together, this acquisition helps bolster Disney in important ways. They have given us great stories to work with and the right technology and analytical skills to bring those stories to consumers in new ways. The acquisitions fortify the Disney Brand portfolio and our ranks of talented artists, engineers and business people. And they give us new ways to build upon our unique capacity to leverage hip properties across many businesses quickly and effectively. 
The Brand and Franchise portfolio of the Walt Disney Company is stronger than it has ever been. And I'm confident of our direction and of our ability to deliver superior returns. And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay. Jay?"

I'd like to briefly review the key drivers for Q4 and highlight some of the factors that are likely to influence our results in fiscal 2011. 
As I mentioned last quarter, results in our Q4 fiscal 2010 reflect one less week of operations than our Q4 fiscal 2009 results. 
Overall, we're encouraged by many of the trends we're seeing in our businesses. At our Media segment, results of Cable Networks decreased year-over-year due to the timing of affiliate revenue recognition at ESPN, the impact of having one less week of operations versus last Q4 and lower equity income. 
As we said on our last call, ESPN ended up reaching most of its programming commitments in Q3 this year versus Q4 last year. As a result, ESPN recognized $354 million less in net deferred affiliate revenue in Q4 than in the prior year. 
At ESPN, advertising revenue was up 19% driven by increases in the automotive, telecommunications and financial categories. Adjusting for the impact of the extra week in last year's Q4, as well as the relative timing of major sports events, we estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up by 22%.
Operating income at Cable Networks was also impacted by programming write-offs at Lifetime Network. Our share of which was approximately $60 million or roughly $0.02 of earnings per share. 
At Broadcasting, while revenue was down due to lower sales of ABC-produced shows compared to prior Q4, operating income was up strongly year-over-year. Results benefited from a lower cost mix for ABC Network's prime time schedule, cost savings measures in daytime and news production and decreased sports programming costs. Operating income also benefited from higher advertising revenues at our own TV stations. Advertising revenue in our stations came in 15% above prior year, led by increases in the automotive, political and financial categories. 
Adjusted for the 53rd week, we estimate that TV stations' ad revenue was up 26%. Adjusted for the 53rd week, advertising revenues at the network were also up strongly driven by improved ratings. Network's scatter pricing came in 23% above upfront levels. 
Thus far in Q1, ABC network's scatter pricing is running 22% above upfront levels. Ad sales at both ESPN and our TV stations are pacing up by double digits versus prior year. 
Turning to Studio Entertainment. The tremendous success of Toy Story 3 in international markets drove impressive growth for the segment in the fourth quarter. Studio results were impacted in the quarter by a write-off of approximately $100  million related to our film inventory at our motion capture venture, IMD. 
At Parks and Resorts, margins were impacted by a higher costs at our domestic parks and by lower revenue at Disney Vacation Club. The increase in domestic costs was driven by labor costs inflations and higher pension and postretirement medical expenses. 
Lower revenue at Disney Vacation Club reflected lower sales as well as percentage of completion accounting. Results were also impacted by having one less week of operations compared to last year's Q4.
Q4 attendance at our domestic parks came in 6% lower than prior year. But when adjusted for the impact of the extra week, we estimate that the attendance was up 1%. 
Per capita guest spending was up 6% driven by higher admissions pricing and food and beverage spending. Average room spending at our domestic hotels was 5% above prior year levels with a solid increase at Walt Disney World and a slight decrease at Disneyland. 
Occupancy at our Orlando hotels came in 1 percentage point below prior year levels at 83%. And Anaheim occupancy remains steady at 84%. So for this quarter, domestic hotel reservations on the books are pacing 5% ahead of prior year. 
Results at our international parks benefited from higher attendance and guest spending at both Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland Paris. Attendance was up 3% in Paris and up 26% in Hong Kong. 
At Consumer Products, our licensing business performed well on the straight of our franchises particularly Toy Story. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue grew 12%. Increase in the segment operating income was also driven by improved performance at our Disney Stores in North America and Europe, as well as by publishing and licensing revenue from Marvel properties. We believe that our core franchises, including Toy Story and Cars, position us well for growth in our licensing business in fiscal 2011. 
At the Interactive Media segment, results benefited from higher revenue up for our video games particularly Toy Story 3, and from increased subscribers to our Japan mobile service. Results were impacted by purchase accounting arising from the inclusion of Playdom. 
We're pleased with the results we delivered in fiscal 2010. The strength of our businesses and our continued focus on managing with financial discipline enable us to deliver strong cash flow, even as we invest in initiatives that position us for the long term. 
Turning to fiscal 2011, I'd like to highlight a few things that will likely influence our results.
On the cost side, we expect our pension and postretirement medical expenses to increase by approximately $100 million versus fiscal 2010 due predominantly to a further reduction in the discount rate. Approximately half of this amount will impact our Parks and Resorts segment. 
In addition, we expect that overall capital expenditures will increase by at least $1 billion dollars, as several of our expansion initiatives at Parks and Resorts will meet key milestones in fiscal 2011. These include the launch of our first new cruise ship, the Disney Dream in late January, along with a variety of projects in our different parks and resorts across the globe. We are excited about these new assets and believe they will help position Disney for long term success.
In addition to internal investments, we expect to continue returning capital to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase. During fiscal 2010, we repurchased almost 80 million shares for approximately $2.7 billion. Thus far in fiscal 2011, we've repurchased a little over 11 million shares for about $392 million. 
As you've seen in our results, the current trends in our businesses are encouraging. We're also optimistic about our creative pipeline. Thus, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver strong results in 2011. With that, I'll turn the call back to Lowell for Q&A."

The details in terms of the nature of our ownership and other details about the project itself we're going to save it for the possibility of a formal announcement. On the Time Warner side, Jessica, we don't give details. It was a deal that I think was very good not only for both sides but also for consumers. We created a lot of compelling new products for the subscribers of Time Warner Cable, including authentication of ESPN and enabling Time Warner subscribers to, in effect, consume ESPN on the Best Available Screen basis and also put into the marketplace a few specific new products for ESPN like the Red Zone, which we think strengthen the relationship with Time Warner and strengthened the overall multichannel package that consumers will offer. Obviously the deal reflects, as I said in my remarks, the considerable value that we provide not only to Time Warner Cable but to its customers with ABC and ABC stations and retransmission consent, ABC Family, Disney Channel and the array of ESPN networks, many of which had record ratings in 2010."

But I think it starts with the fact that Pixar made a fantastic film. And getting whatever, we're over $1.60 billion in global box office and doing nicely with DVD sales is probably largely tied to quality than anything else. That said, the studio made a number of changes to address a variety of different issues including the cost structure of the overall business. So if the changes that they made are to show up in results in 2011 and beyond, it would largely be due to some efficiencies that they've created by streamlining their organization. On top of that, when we look at the business carefully, we know that a lot of things that we thought that were no longer reflecting the way that we were distributing our product in for the global marketplace in all windows, theatrically, in what I'll call a home video window, which is now home video in digital, and then in subsequent television windows around the world. And we tried to create an organization both on the distribution side and the marketing side that reflected how buyers and distributors are now accessing this product. For instance, we had multiple marketing organizations marketing this product to the sort of different layers or different platforms or windows that the product went into the marketplace. And that seemed inefficient to us. We also felt that in creating one distribution organization that in effect had responsibility over all windows that they would make decisions that would be in the best interest of the property and the company over all, instead of advantaging one window over another one. In effect, taking competition out of our internal structure that might have got in the way of maximizing value, particularly as consumer behavior changes and technology changes the way product is windowed and distributed to the world. And we did this on a global basis. I just was in London, and the changes that were made in the structure of the company in London are particularly reflective of changes that we're seeing in the overall marketplace and the opportunity to basically look at both, not only those changes but each product in a much more holistic way rather than in a siloed way that the old structure allowed."

I don't think I'm going to address Google TV directly. We've not announced a deal with them at this point and I'm not going to say anything more specific about them. But we've been offering products into new services and new platforms and devices from almost the beginning, I guess where we led the way. Because we feel, we felt then and we still feel that it's important to serve consumers on these new platforms primarily to grow revenue and to take advantage of what are some pretty exciting new technologies. We also think it's important to make legitimate product available in the marketplace on a well-timed, well-priced basis to fight piracy, which we don't monetize at all. So in essence, we've looked at the these new opportunities as incremental to revenue that we generate for these properties, as well as keeping us relevant and generally fighting piracy. And what I said earlier about ESPN and Best Available Screen, this is something that we're looking at more and more across our businesses. It's essentially saying to consumers that they should be able to watch our product on the best available screen to them. And how we do that is, I think, pretty important in terms of our potential to create more value for these properties whether we're distributing it to multichannel providers like Time Warner or whether we're going directly to the consumer or whether we're doing it through services like Apple TV. On a multichannel front, we've had conversations with a few multichannel providers very recently and we know their concerns about cord cutting and the impact of all this digital distribution on their business. And the sense that we get is that the trends they've seen very recently, which is a slight decrease in subscription and subscribers, is due mostly to the economy and the fact they went to the marketplace a year ago with some pretty low-priced offers both to mostly address the economy. And as of those who have expired, some of those consumers or subscribers have sort of fallen by the wayside. The sense that we got is that there's no one has any evidence, at least currently, of cord cutting. But I still think that it's -- and the best interest of this company is see to it that the multichannel business remain robust, continues to flourish because obviously it creates so much value for us. So we're looking at, basically, the multichannel business in a bullish way, but we feel that we have to very carefully balance that business with our interest as a company to grow revenue on new platforms and creating new product like the one I described for ESPN and authenticated ESPN and these other services like Buzzer Beater and Red Zone is one way to help the multichannel providers do that. And so we're going to continue to look for opportunities on new devices unless we think it improves monetization but we're also going to look for opportunities to strengthen our relationship with the multichannel providers and create product that is beneficial to us, for them and to their consumers."

And I think we've gone through a lot of the rationale, but I'll just quickly talk about it a little bit more as it relates to return on invested capital, which is a metric that we follow very closely, and in fact is a key metric in determining compensation of the company as well. On the Cruise Ship side, you know that our returns on invested capital in that business had been stellar. In the mid-teens and it's our goal to continue that. Those returns in the new ships, obviously, it takes a little bit of time, we're launching the Dream in January. There's some additional cost leading up to launch for instance but revenue doesn't stop flowing until we set sail with paying passengers. I don't know how much detail Jay went into, but the bookings for that ship had been extremely strong, and we feel it's a gorgeous ship. And we feel quite good about, not only the potential of that ship to deliver strong return on invested capital in the Caribbean, but it's going to give us the ability and the flexibility for us to put the other ships eventually into new itineraries and new destinations, which we think will also be good. California Adventure, I talked about it, it was a bit of a brand withdrawal as I said in a recent interview, and that it was not returning value to us at a level that we would expect or hope for. We also thought that there was a negative brand impact. So we're putting capital in to fix the problem that we've had for a long time with the health growth of the overall Disneyland Resort. The results so far have been great with the World of Color but we have a lot more to deliver between now and 2012. So the revenue will start, will flow over time, it's already started but we won't be seeing it in full until basically the latter part of 2012. Hawaii was an investment that we made primarily to support a business who's also had great returns on invested capital and that is our Vacation Club or our timeshare business, where we thought that having the ability to not only to sell those units directly to Disney timeshare customers but to allow for current customers to trade points would help us continue to deliver good returns on invested capital in that business. And I think I pretty much have covered the larger expenses. Jay and I have both talked about the fact this is a somewhat of a balloon in terms of capital expenses. There will be other projects. We're building Hong Kong out, which is relatively modest in nature. And of course the one that we sizable is Shanghai, but that's longer term and we will have a partner so we will not bear all of the costs. But we don't see on the horizon anything of great significance that would cost our annual CapEx to go back up to the level that we're looking out for 2011 for quite a while."

And we did new deals for all of our services including adding retransmission consent. Now, I don't know whether we -- we don't factor that necessarily to affiliate fees but you can expect that with ESPN's services and ABC Family and The Disney Channel all being renewed for basically 2011 in its entirety that there will be increases in those trades from a large distributor.

And I think, if you look at the industry, media industry is loosing around $750 million in that Digital business. So the big question is how should we think about the profitability of the business?

On secular versus cyclical and the overall question about DVD trends, I've been pretty vocal about that business suggesting that, while many believe that we are seeing cyclical trends, that we're due to the downturn that we thought that there were secular trends, they were also impacting the business due largely to just more competition for people's time more than anything else. And I would say that, well I don't know that we've necessarily seen that pattern worsen. I don't know, we haven't seen anything that would reverse it or force me to believe that I was wrong when I made that statement. It's a title-driven business, no question about it. I mentioned Toy Story 3, which is out in the marketplace now. If ever there's a title that would do well, it would be Toy Story 3, particularly in the sell-through side because it's a title that just makes a lot of sense for people who are going to let their kids watch it multiple times to own versus rent for instance. It will do quite well. I'm not going to make predictions as to what it will do. But if you were to look at the numbers for Toy Story 3, which will be extremely strong versus what films did just three, four, five years ago you'd be sobered by those numbers. That said, there's a larger percentage of people with each title, of good title, that's buying Blu-ray, and in our case multiple copies. We're out in the marketplace with Toy Story 3 with a premium product that is a Blu-ray DVD, a standard-def DVD, a downloadable file and stream-able file or stream-able code. And that's doing quite well. Actually it represents about 80% of Blu-ray sales, meaning of the roughly 25% of units, Toy Story 3 or Blu-ray with good pricing, that 80% of those are buying this multi-package. So we've seen some pricing leverage or improvement because we're out there offering more value to consumers. But it's a business that I think, meaning the movie business, that we just have to watch very carefully. Because I don't think we're -- even with a shift in the positive direction with the economy you're going to see a big bounce back to what we used to see in terms of conversion rates, which is one of the reasons why we've taken a brand approach to our business with Pixar and Disney and Marvel because we think we stand a chance of doing better than the industry average provided we make good movies. On the interactive front, obviously we're quite mindful of the losses that we've delivered in that business, which is basically a collection of businesses. And just about a month ago we restructured from a management perspective of the business to accomplish a few things. One, we wanted to add more focus primarily so that we could both create and implement a strategy that was designed to deliver profitability because we do want to be in this business if we're not going to be able to make money. So we're looking at it two ways. On one side we got a collection of games businesses and the other side we have a collection of largely dot com businesses. On the games front, we've seen a pretty big shift in games from console to what I call multi-platform, everything from mobile apps to social networking games. And by putting John Pleasants in to run games not only will he focus on turning that businesses into profitability but diversifying our presence in the business so we're not reliant on one platform that's obviously facing challenges. It's our goal, not only to be profitable, but obviously to get there by shifting our investment and reducing our investment, too. We probably will end up investing less on the console side than we have because of the shift we're seeing in consumption. And have a presence albeit with probably less investment in terms of game manufacturing on some of the newer platforms. Consumers are obviously spending time playing games from casual games online to mobile apps to social networking to console, and we felt all along that we need to be where the consumers are and we know that our games work in a variety of places and we want to be there. We felt for a while that we should be both as a licensor, which we do in some cases, but also a publisher. And I would say the shift that we have made in terms of personnel and ultimately in how we invest our money and how we distribute this product is going to continue to reflect that philosophy but in a slightly different manner. On the dot com side, the key sites that we invest in espn.com, disney.com, abc.com are designed to do a few things. One, they are marketing platforms, they're brand building platforms, and they're revenue-generating platforms. I'd like to get to the point where all three are run under profitable circumstances. I'd say that ESPN stands the best chance. I won't get into specifics about ESPN's profitability but I can tell you that sales of things like espn.com home screen advertising are incredibly robust. And so that's actually a good business for us. On the Disney side, our goal is to create the ultimate Disney portal, not only to provide navigation but to provide significant forms of entertainment. And that's what Jimmy Patero, the new head of that business, is going to do. And then on the ABC front, we've got a business that's designed to basically provide consumers with another screen experience and also help market ABC better. But I would be disappointed if we continue to lose significant amounts of money in those businesses. And if we do, I would imagine we will have to redirect in some form."

We're using the design as a platform to greatly improve the quality of the merchandise and the presentation. And we're also using it to improve location, which we've done quite well. The Times Square, I think, is a good example of that. But we look at specialty retail as a relatively challenging business. And with that in mind, we're going to be really careful and watch these results quite carefully. We designed a 18, 19 store range, I think, it's around 20. And we don't see going significantly higher fast. We're going to wait and see how these stores do before we make any decisions about roll out. It costs us slightly above $1 million a store for this new design. I think, we think we're probably closer to $1.4 million for the initial stores and that will trend down as we bring this design to more. But we're going to be careful about this. By the way, our comp store sales are up significantly across the chain not just with our new stores, but they're up significantly more with the redesign, which is interesting to us. Now a lot of that has to do with some unbelievably strong product in the marketplace. Toy Story is clearly leading the way but the Princess line continues to be strong. Cars is very strong, Fairies is strong. And we obviously have some great IP coming to support that, even more with the Tangled movie coming up and then Cars 2 and Pirates and Marvel."

We didn't get much volume from the industry on it, so we're using it for our own films and we've rolled that out with Toy Story 3 through a relationship with Walmart and their purchase of VUDU. So if you buy the multi-pack that I cited earlier of Toy Story 3, you have the ability to stream Toy Story 3 through VUDU, which is a form of inter-operability and you'll see more of that as we roll out more titles. We are not inclined to or expect to enter a format war over this.

They're both real franchises. And we felt for a while, mostly since we made the Marvel acquisition, that we would benefit from distributing ourselves. It's just the big difference, we believe. This is not in any way meant to suggest criticism of the way Paramount handled it. But when everything is in-house, when it's your product that you are distributing and marketing and when it's done as part of, basically, an overall franchise-building strategy and brand-building strategy for the company that you create more value. I said from the beginning of the Marvel acquisition that we would be invested in growing and supporting the Marvel brand, as a for instance. That's not necessarily something that was of interest to or value creation proposition to a third-party distributor like Paramount. They're in the business of distributing the film, we're in the business of distributing the film, building the franchise and growing the brand. And there was great value although that's, obviously we were able to quantify it for ourselves. I'm not going to articulate all the ways that we did that, but it's great long-term value for us in not only controlling the marketing and the distribution but of appreciating the kind of value that could be created when you do that."

The 2010 fiscal year was a good one financially and strategically. Performance was driven by strong branded content and the effective use of it across our businesses resulting in a 20% jump in net income on a 5% rise in revenue.
Our fourth quarter earnings grew solidly after factoring out a programming write-off in one of our equity networks. The timing of ESPN revenue recognition and the effective one pure week of operations this year than last. Jay will provide details in a few minutes.
Over the last year, we took several important steps to position Disney for strong growth. We appointed new leaders in our Movie Studio, ABC Entertainment and the Internet group, strengthening our management team. We continue to invest in major new attractions and experiences in our Parks and Resorts segment. 
And just last week, we took a significant step toward final approval of Shanghai Disneyland. We also made two significant acquisitions, Marvel Entertainment and the social game publisher Playdom.
Marvel and Playdom strengthened the range of quality entertainment we offer and provide us new and innovative ways to deliver that entertainment to consumers.
They fit strategically with our brands, and with our global marketing and distribution networks, benefit a wide range of our existing businesses and offer the potential of attractive returns on investment.
There is no better example of what a successful acquisition can do for Disney than Toy Story 3. The number one animated movie in history. The best reviewed movie of the year, and a strong contender for Best Picture Oscar.
On top of the billion dollars in global box office it generated, Toy Story 3 drove significant business for our Consumer Products, Interactive Media and Parks segments. Its success speaks volumes about our Pixar acquisition and our ability to maximize the value of great creative content across a broad range of markets.
We are incredibly excited about the release next summer of Cars 2, another great Pixar adventure, whose characters already constitute one of our biggest and robust Consumer Product franchises. With the film to be followed by the 2012 opening of our largest-ever new attraction, Cars Land, at Disney's California Adventure, we believe this great animated property can drive substantial shareholder value for years to come.
Our creative pipeline is strong. And our Movie Studio's Tangled, Tron: Legacy and the latest chapter of our highly successful Pirates franchise are coming in fiscal 2011 as our two new Marvel epics, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger.
Our Parks and Resorts segment is also unveiling compelling new attractions and experiences. Since it opened last summer, World of Color, an amazing night time spectacular at California Adventure has driven a 20% increase in attendance of that park. Once our Little Mermaid attraction and Cars Land open in the next couple of years, the new California Adventure will stand proudly alongside Disneyland making our Anaheim resort an even more attractive family destination.
Our Cruise business has delivered double-digit returns and has enhanced our reputation for delivering unparalleled family travel experiences. It's notable that Disney Cruise Line was just named the best in the world by the readers of Condé Nast Traveler. And that's before the first of our two magnificent new ships, the Disney Dream makes it's maiden voyage in January taking our cruise offering to a whole new level and new exciting destinations.
ESPN is another great example of our strategic commitment to create quality brand and content and use technology to enhance that content and deliver it to consumers in new ways and the ways they want it. ESPN has a simple and powerful mission to serve sports fans wherever sports are watched, listened to, discussed, debated, read about or played. And that's exactly what it does. Its coverage and presentation of basketball, baseball, soccer, football, NASCAR, you name it is gold standard, and is taking full advantage of technological change to provide fans a multi-platform experience that makes ESPN the number one sports media brand. Even though ESPN has expanded its digital reach, it posted its highest television ratings ever in 2010 fiscal year.
The same holds true for ABC Family and Disney Channel, both of which also recorded their highest-ever ratings in the last fiscal year. The overall quality and innovation shown by our Media Networks, ESPN, Disney Channel, ABC Family and ABC was recognized through the multi-year agreement we signed earlier this year with Time Warner Cable. The deal acknowledges the great value of our programs and brands, while at the same time creating new products and services to the benefit of Disney, Time Warner and consumers.
Organic growth remains our focus but as I remarked earlier, we've seen the strategic additions to our business portfolio can be beneficial. When we bought Club Penguin in 2007, Disney acquired new skills in delivering compelling brand and appropriate stories in an entirely new way to our core audience and kids.
We expect the acquisition to generate significant value to Disney well in excess of the price we paid. And since the purchase, Club Penguin has more than doubled paying subscribers, expanded globally and spawned successful merchandise and packaged games.
While Club Penguin gave us a foothold and expertise in virtual world for kids, Playdom is doing the same in social games, an incredibly fast growing area of digital entertainment.
Playdom brings strategic, operational and analytical capabilities to Disney, while we provide them the well-known content and brands to compete even more effectively. With the acquisition of Playdom and of Tapulous, a developer of mobile games and apps, we now have a diversified multi-faceted game business that can deliver the full range of experiences consumers want, and then allows us to continue innovating to meet their expectations. Our first game with Playdom, ESPNU College Town is off to a good start.
Marvel provides our company with a rich portfolio of characters and stories, a talented team that has extended the reach of those characters across the publishing, licensing and movie business, and a passionate fan base not unlike Disney's.
In addition to the two big movies coming this summer, Marvel has launched a new series on Disney XD with more to come and is developing several series for ABC and ABC Family. We bought back the marketing and distribution rights for Iron Man 3 and The Avengers and are incorporating Marvel's licensing businesses into our global sales and marketing networks to help spawn growth. Together, these acquisition helps bolster Disney in important ways. They have given us great stories to work with and the right technology and analytical skills to bring those stories to consumers in new ways. The acquisitions fortify the Disney Brand portfolio and our ranks of talented artists, engineers and business people. And they give us new ways to build upon our unique capacity to leverage hip properties across many businesses quickly and effectively.
The Brand and Franchise portfolio of the Walt Disney Company is stronger than it has ever been. And I'm confident of our direction and of our ability to deliver superior returns.
And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay. Jay?"

I'd like to briefly review the key drivers for Q4 and highlight some of the factors that are likely to influence our results in fiscal 2011.As I mentioned last quarter, results in our Q4 fiscal 2010 reflect one le",1049,"Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon, everybody. I'd like to briefly review the key drivers for Q4 and highlight some of the factors that are likely to influence our results in fiscal 2011.
As I mentioned last quarter, results in our Q4 fiscal 2010 reflect one less week of operations than our Q4 fiscal 2009 results.
Overall, we're encouraged by many of the trends we're seeing in our businesses. At our Media segment, results of Cable Networks decreased year-over-year due to the timing of affiliate revenue recognition at ESPN, the impact of having one less week of operations versus last Q4 and lower equity income.
As we said on our last call, ESPN ended up reaching most of its programming commitments in Q3 this year versus Q4 last year. As a result, ESPN recognized $354 million less in net deferred affiliate revenue in Q4 than in the prior year.
At ESPN, advertising revenue was up 19% driven by increases in the automotive, telecommunications and financial categories. Adjusting for the impact of the extra week in last year's Q4, as well as the relative timing of major sports events, we estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up by 22%.
Operating income at Cable Networks was also impacted by programming write-offs at Lifetime Network. Our share of which was approximately $60 million or roughly $0.02 of earnings per share.
At Broadcasting, while revenue was down due to lower sales of ABC-produced shows compared to prior Q4, operating income was up strongly year-over-year. Results benefited from a lower cost mix for ABC Network's prime time schedule, cost savings measures in daytime and news production and decreased sports programming costs. Operating income also benefited from higher advertising revenues at our own TV stations. Advertising revenue in our stations came in 15% above prior year, led by increases in the automotive, political and financial categories.
Adjusted for the 53rd week, we estimate that TV stations' ad revenue was up 26%. Adjusted for the 53rd week, advertising revenues at the network were also up strongly driven by improved ratings. Network's scatter pricing came in 23% above upfront levels.
Thus far in Q1, ABC network's scatter pricing is running 22% above upfront levels. Ad sales at both ESPN and our TV stations are pacing up by double digits versus prior year.
Turning to Studio Entertainment. The tremendous success of Toy Story 3 in international markets drove impressive growth for the segment in the fourth quarter. Studio results were impacted in the quarter by a write-off of approximately $100 million related to our film inventory at our motion capture venture, IMD.
At Parks and Resorts, margins were impacted by higher costs at our domestic parks and by lower revenue at Disney Vacation Club. The increase in domestic costs was driven by labor costs inflations and higher pension and postretirement medical expenses.
Lower revenue at Disney Vacation Club reflected lower sales as well as percentage of completion accounting. Results were also impacted by having one less week of operations compared to last year's Q4.
Q4 attendance at our domestic parks came in 6% lower than prior year. But when adjusted for the impact of the extra week, we estimate that the attendance was up 1%.
Per capita guest spending was up 6% driven by higher admissions pricing and food and beverage spending. Average room spending at our domestic hotels was 5% above prior year levels with a solid increase at Walt Disney World and a slight decrease at Disneyland.
Occupancy at our Orlando hotels came in 1 percentage point below prior year levels at 83%. And Anaheim occupancy remains steady at 84%. So far this quarter, domestic hotel reservations on the books are pacing 5% ahead of prior year.
Results at our international parks benefited from higher attendance and guest spending at both Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland Paris. Attendance was up 3% in Paris and up 26% in Hong Kong.
At Consumer Products, our licensing business performed well on the straight of our franchises particularly Toy Story. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue grew 12%. Increase in the segment operating income was also driven by improved performance at our Disney Stores in North America and Europe, as well as by publishing and licensing revenue from Marvel properties. We believe that our core franchises, including Toy Story and Cars, position us well for growth in our licensing business in fiscal 2011.
At the Interactive Media segment, results benefited from higher revenue up for our video games particularly Toy Story 3, and from increased subscribers to our Japan mobile service. Results were impacted by purchase accounting rising from the inclusion of Playdom.
We're pleased with the results we delivered in fiscal 2010. The strength of our businesses and our continued focus on managing with financial discipline enable us to deliver strong cash flow, even as we invest in initiatives that position us for the long term.
Turning to fiscal 2011, I'd like to highlight a few things that will likely influence our results.
On the cost side, we expect our pension and postretirement medical expenses to increase by approximately $100 million versus fiscal 2010 due predominantly to a further reduction in the discount rate. Approximately half of this amount will impact our Parks and Resorts segment.
In addition, we expect that overall capital expenditures will increase by at least $1 billion dollars, as several of our expansion initiatives at Parks and Resorts will meet key milestones in fiscal 2011. These include the launch of our first new cruise ship, the Disney Dream in late January, along with a variety of projects in our different parks and resorts across the globe. We are excited about these new assets and believe they will help position Disney for long term success.
In addition to internal investments, we expect to continue returning capital to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase. During fiscal 2010, we repurchased almost 80 million shares for approximately $2.7 billion. Thus far in fiscal 2011, we've repurchased a little over 11 million shares for about $392 million.
As you've seen in our results, the current trends in our businesses are encouraging. We're also optimistic about our creative pipeline. Thus, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver strong results in 2011.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Lowell for Q&A."

The details in terms of the nature of our ownership and other details about the project itself we're going to save it for the possibility of a formal announcement.
On the Time Warner side, Jessica, we don't give details. It was a deal that I think was very good not only for both sides but also for consumers. We created a lot of compelling new products for the subscribers of Time Warner Cable, including authentication of ESPN and enabling Time Warner subscribers to, in effect, consume ESPN on the Best Available Screen basis and also put into the marketplace a few specific new products for ESPN like the Red Zone, which we think strengthen the relationship with Time Warner and strengthened the overall multichannel package that consumers will offer. Obviously the deal reflects, as I said in my remarks, the considerable value that we provide not only to Time Warner Cable but to its customers with ABC and ABC stations and retransmission consent, ABC Family, Disney Channel and the array of ESPN networks, many of which had record ratings in 2010."

But I think it starts with the fact that Pixar made a fantastic film. And getting whatever, we're over $1.60 billion in global box office and doing nicely with DVD sales is probably largely tied to quality than anything else. That said, the studio made a number of changes to address a variety of different issues including the cost structure of the overall business. So if the changes that they made are to show up in results in 2011 and beyond, it would largely be due to some efficiencies that they've created by streamlining their organization.
On top of that, when we look at the business carefully, we know that a lot of things that we thought that were no longer reflecting the way that we were distributing our product in for the global marketplace in all windows, theatrically, in what I'll call a home video window, which is now home video in digital, and then in subsequent television windows around the world. And we tried to create an organization both on the distribution side and the marketing side that reflected how buyers and distributors are now accessing this product. For instance, we had multiple marketing organizations marketing this product to the sort of different layers or different platforms or windows that the product went into the marketplace. And that seemed inefficient to us. We also felt that in creating one distribution organization that in effect had responsibility over all windows that they would make decisions that would be in the best interest of the property and the company over all, instead of advantaging one window over another one. In effect, taking competition out of our internal structure that might have got in the way of maximizing value, particularly as consumer behavior changes and technology changes the way product is windowed and distributed to the world. And we did this on a global basis.
I just was in London, and the changes that were made in the structure of the company in London are particularly reflective of changes that we're seeing in the overall marketplace and the opportunity to basically look at both, not only those changes but each product in a much more holistic way rather than in a siloed way that the old structure allowed."

I don't think I'm going to address Google TV directly. We've not announced a deal with them at this point and I'm not going to say anything more specific about them. But we've been offering products into new services and new platforms and devices from almost the beginning, I guess where we led the way. Because we feel, we felt then and we still feel that it's important to serve consumers on these new platforms primarily to grow revenue and to take advantage of what are some pretty exciting new technologies. We also think it's important to make legitimate product available in the marketplace on a well-timed, well-priced basis to fight piracy, which we don't monetize at all. So in essence, we've looked at the these new opportunities as incremental to revenue that we generate for these properties, as well as keeping us relevant and generally fighting piracy.
And what I said earlier about ESPN and Best Available Screen, this is something that we're looking at more and more across our businesses. It's essentially saying to consumers that they should be able to watch our product on the best available screen to them. And how we do that is, I think, pretty important in terms of our potential to create more value for these properties whether we're distributing it to multichannel providers like Time Warner or whether we're going directly to the consumer or whether we're doing it through services like Apple TV. On a multichannel front, we've had conversations with a few multichannel providers very recently and we know their concerns about cord cutting and the impact of all this digital distribution on their business. And the sense that we get is that the trends they've seen very recently, which is a slight decrease in subscription and subscribers, is due mostly to the economy and the fact they went to the marketplace a year ago with some pretty low-priced offers both to mostly address the economy. And as of those who have expired, some of those consumers or subscribers have sort of fallen by the wayside. The sense that we got is that there's no one has any evidence, at least currently, of cord cutting. But I still think that it's -- and the best interest of this company is see to it that the multichannel business remain robust, continues to flourish because obviously it creates so much value for us.
So we're looking at, basically, the multichannel business in a bullish way, but we feel that we have to very carefully balance that business with our interest as a company to grow revenue on new platforms and creating new product like the one I described for ESPN and authenticated ESPN and these other services like Buzzer Beater and Red Zone is one way to help the multichannel providers do that. And so we're going to continue to look for opportunities on new devices unless we think it improves monetization but we're also going to look for opportunities to strengthen our relationship with the multichannel providers and create product that is beneficial to us, for them and to their consumers."

And I think we've gone through a lot of the rationale, but I'll just quickly talk about it a little bit more as it relates to return on invested capital, which is a metric that we follow very closely, and in fact is a key metric in determining compensation of the company as well.
On the Cruise Ship side, you know that our returns on invested capital in that business had been stellar. In the mid-teens and it's our goal to continue that. Those returns in the new ships, obviously, it takes a little bit of time, we're launching the Dream in January. There's some additional cost leading up to launch for instance but revenue doesn't stop flowing until we set sail with paying passengers. I don't know how much detail Jay went into, but the bookings for that ship have been extremely strong, and we feel it's a gorgeous ship. And we feel quite good about, not only the potential of that ship to deliver strong return on invested capital in the Caribbean, but it's going to give us the ability and the flexibility for us to put the other ships eventually into new itineraries and new destinations, which we think will also be good.
California Adventure, I talked about it, it was a bit of a brand withdrawal as I said in a recent interview, and that it was not returning value to us at a level that we would expect or hope for. We also thought that there was a negative brand impact. So we're putting capital in to fix the problem that we've had for a long time with the health growth of the overall Disneyland Resort. The results so far have been great with the World of Color but we have a lot more to deliver between now and 2012. So the revenue will start, will flow over time, it's already started but we won't be seeing it in full until basically the latter part of 2012.
Hawaii was an investment that we made primarily to support a business who's also had great returns on invested capital and that is our Vacation Club or our timeshare business, where we thought that having the ability to not only to sell those units directly to Disney timeshare customers but to allow for current customers to trade points would help us continue to deliver good returns on invested capital in that business. And I think I pretty much have covered the larger expenses. Jay and I have both talked about the fact this is a somewhat of a balloon in terms of capital expenses. There will be other projects. We're building Hong Kong out, which is relatively modest in nature. And of course the one that we sizable is Shanghai, but that's longer term and we will have a partner so we will not bear all of the costs. But we don't see on the horizon anything of great significance that would cost our annual CapEx to go back up to the level that we're looking out for 2011 for quite a while."

And I think, if you look at the industry, media industry is loosing around $750 million in that Digital business. So the big question is how should we think about the profitability of the business?

On secular versus cyclical and the overall question about DVD trends, I've been pretty vocal about that business suggesting that, while many believe that we are seeing cyclical trends, that we're due to the downturn that we thought that there were secular trends, they were also impacting the business due largely to just more competition for people's time more than anything else. And I would say that, well I don't know that we've necessarily seen that pattern worsen. I don't know, we haven't seen anything that would reverse it or cause me to believe that I was wrong when I made that statement. It's a title-driven business, no question about it. I mentioned Toy Story 3, which is out in the marketplace now. If ever there's a title that would do well, it would be Toy Story 3, particularly in the sell-through side because it's a title that just makes a lot of sense for people who are going to let their kids watch it multiple times to own versus rent for instance. It will do quite well. I'm not going to make predictions as to what it will do. But if you were to look at the numbers for Toy Story 3, which will be extremely strong versus what films did just three, four, five years ago you'd be sobered by those numbers.
That said, there's a larger percentage of people with each title, of good title, that's buying Blu-ray, and in our case multiple copies. We're out in the marketplace with Toy Story 3 with a premium product that is a Blu-ray DVD, a standard-def DVD, a downloadable file and stream-able file or stream-able code. And that's doing quite well. Actually it represents about 80% of Blu-ray sales, meaning of the roughly 25% of units, Toy Story 3 or Blu-ray with good pricing, about 80% of those are buying this multi-package. So we've seen some pricing leverage or improvement because we're out there offering more value to consumers. But it's a business that I think, meaning the movie business, that we just have to watch very carefully. Because I don't think we're -- even with a shift in the positive direction with the economy you're going to see a big bounce back to what we used to see in terms of conversion rates, which is one of the reasons why we've taken a brand approach to our business with Pixar and Disney and Marvel because we think we stand a chance of doing better than the industry average provided we make good movies.
On the interactive front, obviously we're quite mindful of the losses that we've delivered in that business, which is basically a collection of businesses. And just about a month ago we restructured from a management perspective of the business to accomplish a few things. One, we wanted to add more focus primarily so that we could both create and implement a strategy that was designed to deliver profitability because we do want to be in this business if we're not going to be able to make money. So we're looking at it two ways. On one side we got a collection of games businesses and the other side we have a collection of largely dot com businesses.
On the games front, we've seen a pretty big shift in games from console to what I call multi-platform, everything from mobile apps to social networking games. And by putting John Pleasants in to run games not only will he focus on turning that businesses into profitability but diversifying our presence in the business so we're not reliant on one platform that's obviously facing challenges. It's our goal, not only to be profitable, but obviously to get there by shifting our investment and reducing our investment, too. We probably will end up investing less on the console side than we have because of the shift we're seeing in consumption. And have a presence albeit with probably less investment in terms of game manufacturing on some of the newer platforms.
Consumers are obviously spending time playing games from casual games online to mobile apps to social networking to console, and we felt all along that we need to be where the consumers are and we know that our games work in a variety of places and we want to be there. We felt for a while that we should be both as a licensor, which we do in some cases, but also a publisher. And I would say the shift that we have made in terms of personnel and ultimately in how we invest our money and how we distribute this product is going to continue to reflect that philosophy but in a slightly different manner.
On the dot com side, the key sites that we invest in espn.com, disney.com, abc.com are designed to do a few things. One, they are marketing platforms, they're brand building platforms, and they're revenue-generating platforms. I'd like to get to the point where all three are run under profitable circumstances. I'd say that ESPN stands the best chance. I won't get into specifics about ESPN's profitability but I can tell you that sales of things like espn.com home screen advertising are incredibly robust. And so that's actually a good business for us. On the Disney side, our goal is to create the ultimate Disney portal, not only to provide navigation but to provide significant forms of entertainment. And that's what Jimmy Patero, the new head of that business, is going to do. And then on the ABC front, we've got a business that's designed to basically provide consumers with another screen experience and also help market ABC better. But I would be disappointed if we continue to lose significant amounts of money in those businesses. And if we do, I would imagine we will have to redirect in some form."

And we're just curious if you could give us a sense of whether you see a tracking notably higher than what Up did on DVD a year ago given that?"

And so it's a little early to give you any predictions, not that we would even if we were later in the game.

Given the fact that you've got substantially greater box office globally. But I don't have the numbers in terms of how it's trending versus Up on a worldwide basis."

That said, before that occurred Hong Kong was trending in a significantly positive direction. So they were knocked of course somewhat by the virus and then came back on course. So the comparison is a little bit apples-to-oranges for the year-ago, and apples-to-apples with couple of years ago. And we continue to see real growth in Hong Kong visitation from local residents, from Mainland China residence and then what I call other Asia. Mainland China represents somewhere in the neighborhood of high-30s to 40% of visitation to Hong Kong Disneyland. And we're adding capacity for Hong Kong, which is not only exciting in terms of the creativity. In fact, one of them is Toy Story-based. And it's going to take a few years for us to finish that project, but I think it's well-timed to take advantage of some positive visitation trends and to also leverage our successful IP."

We just opened a new store which you should see in Times Square, but we're going to proceed with real caution. We're using the design as a platform to greatly improve the quality of the merchandise and the presentation. And we're also using it to improve location, which we've done quite well. The Times Square, I think, is a good example of that. But we look at specialty retail as a relatively challenging business. And with that in mind, we're going to be really careful and watch these results quite carefully. We designed a 18, 19 store range, I think, it's around 20. And we don't see going significantly higher fast. We're going to wait and see how these stores do before we make any decisions about roll out. It costs us slightly above $1 million a store for this new design. I think, we think we're probably closer to $1.4 million for the initial stores and that will trend down as we bring this design to more. But we're going to be careful about this.
By the way, our comp store sales are up significantly across the chain not just with our new stores, but they're up significantly more with the redesign, which is interesting to us. Now a lot of that has to do with some unbelievably strong product in the marketplace. Toy Story is clearly leading the way but the Princess line continues to be strong. Cars is very strong, Fairies is strong. And we obviously have some great IP coming to support that, even more with the Tangled movie coming up and then Cars 2 and Pirates and Marvel."

An obvious reason for that is that when people buy a file in some form, if you give the ability to play that file on multiple devices or in multiple locations, then you're creating more value for them. And I think, lack of inter-operability is an impediment or a barrier to growing digital media. So KeyChest was designed to add inter-operability. We didn't get much volume from the industry on it, so we're using it for our own films and we've rolled that out with Toy Story 3 through a relationship with Walmart and their purchase of VUDU. So if you buy the multi-pack that I cited earlier of Toy Story 3, you have the ability to stream Toy Story 3 through VUDU, which is a form of inter-operability and you'll see more of that as we roll out more titles. We are not inclined to or expect to enter a format war over this. I will quickly get out of my element if I start getting into more technological detail, but there's actually a way that KeyChest can work with the UltraViolet platform. Again, don't ask me for specifics on that, but I'm sure there are others who could give you that detail. But it's not our goal to create a format war. It's our goal to create product and to implement technology that ultimately creates more value to the consumer, and obviously in doing so delivers more value to distributor and the seller where a retailer, a bricks-and-mortar retailer or a digital retailer and obviously to the content owner."

They're both real franchises. And we felt for a while, mostly since we made the Marvel acquisition, that we would benefit from distributing ourselves. It's just the big difference, we believe. This is not in any way meant to suggest criticism of the way Paramount handled it. But when everything is in-house, when it's your product that you are distributing and marketing and when it's done as part of, basically, an overall franchise-building strategy and brand-building strategy for the company that you create more value. I said from the beginning of the Marvel acquisition that we would be invested in growing and supporting the Marvel brand, as a for instance. That's not necessarily something that was of interest to or value creation proposition to a third-party distributor like Paramount. They're in the business of distributing the film, we're in the business of distributing the film, building the franchise and growing the brand. And there was great value although that's, obviously we were able to quantify it for ourselves. I'm not going to articulate all the ways that we did that, but it's great long-term value for us in not only controlling the marketing and the distribution but of appreciating the kind of value that could be created when you do that."
