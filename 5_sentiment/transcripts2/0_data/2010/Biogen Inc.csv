I'm pleased to report that in 2009, Biogen Idec once again delivered strong financial and operational results. For the full-year 2009, total revenue increased 7% to $4.4 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 13% to $4.12 and the business generated $1.1 billion of cash. The 13% non-GAAP EPS growth marks six consecutive years of double-digit EPS, which increase as the date back to the merger between Biogen and Idec in 2003. On the operational side, I'm also pleased to announce a very successful year. With $1.1 billion of in-market net sales in 2009, TYSABRI is officially a blockbuster. I'm especially proud of this accomplishment when you take a step back and consider the voluntary market withdrawal in 2005. Think about this, a product that was taken off the market is now generating over $1 billion in annual revenue and is still growing. Furthermore, we've made significant progress in our understanding of PML risk and the opportunities. Just try to find [ph] that risk. And I attribute these accomplishments to both TYSABRI's protein advocacy [ph], positive risk-benefit, health profile and a very committed team of Biogen Idec employees who are justifiably proud of their accomplishment but at the same time are aware that there are still more work to be done.During 2009, we also took steps to extend the durability of our core interferon franchise. The therapy is now protected until 2026 by virtue of newly-issued method-of-use patent. In addition, we advanced PEGylated interferon under registrational trial. PEGylated interferon has the potential to reinforce AVONEX's advantage and improve on convenience. With an eye on revigorating our efforts to restore AVONEX's market leadership, in Q4, we also announced some new additions to our commercial leadership team. Bob Hamm will talk about these new leaders later.Biogen Idec's MS [multiple sclerosis] pipeline is deeper and more complete than ever before. We now have first-in-class or best-in-class therapies that have a potential to address a full spectrum of patient need. Our strategy has been to slow, stop and reverse MS and we've assembled a collection of products and development programs designed to do just that.During 2009, our R&D organization filed for European and Canadian regulatory approval of Fampridine well ahead of plan. And we initiated two pivotal trials, three Phase II trials, two Phase I trials and four R to D [reaserch to development] transitions, all while continuing to manage 90 trials for 31 compounds with over 14,000 patients in more than 45 countries. Finally, we have a strong balance sheet and nearly $100 million in free cash flow monthly. This is allowing us the flexibility to both return cash for shareholders and continue to invest in future growth both internally and externally.Before we turn the call over to Al Sandrock for an update on R&D, let me address the topic I'm sure you're interested in, the board's search for my successor. The board has formed a CEO search committee headed by Director Brian Posner, which also includes Chairman Bill Young and Directors Alex Denner and Bruce Ross. The committee is working diligently with the leading search firm, Spencer Stuart. The process is underway, but you need to understand, beyond that, we're not going to comment on this call today. I'll now hand the call to Dr. Al Sandrock, our Senior Vice President of Neurology Research and Development. Al?"

I'd like to begin by welcoming some new additions to the Neurology R&D and Medical Affairs team to Biogen Idec. You probably already seen the announcements but let me take a moment to tell you about each person. Dr. John Richter joins us from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, where he served as Executive Vice President for Research and Clinical Programs for the past five years. Prior to that, John was at Georgetown University where he was Professor and Chair in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Professional of Neurology and Founder of the University's MS Clinic. Dr. Frederick Munschauer joins us from The State University of New York at Buffalo School of Medicine, where he was the Irvin & Rosemary Smith Professor in the Department of Neurology and Chair of the Department of Neurology. Dr. Nancy Richert, an expert in neuroimaging, joins us from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, where she served as a staff clinician in the Neuroimmunology Branch. And Dr. Doug Kerr, an expert on transe-verse myelitis and MS, joins us from Johns Hopkins where he was Associate Professor of Neurology. We are extremely excited to add these distinguished leaders of the multiple sclerosis community to the Biogen Idec team.I'd like to begin now with an update of our pipeline starting with one of my favorite programs. I'm very pleased to report that in January, we initiated a Phase I trial of our fully-human anti-LINGO-1 monoclonal antibody. This is especially exciting for us because most of the biology of LINGO-1 was elucidated in Biogen Idec's own research laboratories. That's been known for sometime but when myelin, the insulation around nerve fibers, is damaged by diseases such as multiple sclerosis, neurons often lose the ability to transmit nerve impulses. And it was also known that the ability of the human central nervous system to repair myelin was limited. As reported in such publications as Nature Medicine Nature Neuroscience, our scientists found that treatment with anti-LINGO-1 antibody promoted the remuneration of damaged nerve fibers when tested in various animal models of demyelination. Although current MS therapies can slow disease progression, none are designed to directly affect this repair process. As such, anti-LINGO-1 antibody represents a novel therapeutic approach in multiple sclerosis. Another new technology that we advanced into development last quarter was our bispecific antibody targeting TNF-alpha [tumor necrosis factor-alpha] and TWEAK. With this novel bispecific antibody design, which was also a pioneer by Biogen Idex scientists, we can simultaneously bind TNF-alpha and TWEAK with high affinity while retaining many of the desired properties of traditional monoclonal antibodies, including a long circulating half-life and ease of production. Simultaneous inhibition of the TNF-alpha and TWEAK pathways offers the potential to more effectively block imflammatory, pathologies and auto-immune diseases. Now an update on our blood factor programs. In December, with our partners Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, we announced that our Factor VIII product for hemophilia A moved into clinical trials, making ours the only long-acting Factor VIII compound in clinical trials. In January, we announced that our Factor IX products for hemophilia B moved into a registrational trial making ours the first long-acting Factor IX compound to reach this milestone. The chase for innovating in hemophilia is strong, where the only treatment options are those with relatively short half-lives, requiring between 100 and 150 infusions per year. Our products substantially increased half-life, which offers the hope that the hemophilia patients would need to receive 50 or fewer infusions per year. We will present the results of our Phase I, II Factor IX study at an upcoming medical meeting. As you may already know, Biogen Idec regularly reviews and adjusts its pipeline as scientific, market or regulatory conditions change. In accordance with this process, we reviewed the data for inventory and determined that the results are not supportive of continuing either the oral or the IV program. The efficacy and safety data from our TRIDENT trial analyzed to date suggest a beneficial effect on symptoms without a positive impact on clinical morbidity or mortality outcomes. These results are consistent with recent Phase III results from Merck's rolofylline program in acute decompensated heart failure.Now let me take a moment to provide an update on TYSABRI. When we introduced TYSABRI in July of 2006, you will recall that we set out to answer three questions about PML in TYSABRI-treated patients: Who is at risk, what is the risk and how can we mitigate the risk. With the start of the new year, I thought it would be a good time to revisit the progress we've made in answering these questions. I'll begin with what we know about the risk. During our Q3 earnings call, I announced that we had initiated conversations with regulators worldwide about updating the TYSABRI product label as we began to believe that the risk of PML increases with the length of time on therapy. In the U.S., we updated the label to include language stating that in patients treated with TYSABRI, the risk of developing PML increases the longer treatment duration, and that per patients treated for 24 to 36 months, the risk is generally similar to the rate seen in clinical trials. There is limited experience beyond three years. As recently as last Friday, February 5, the FDA reaffirmed that it believes that the clinical benefits of TYSABRI continues to outweigh the potential risks. On January 21, the European Medicines Agency announced that they had finalized a review of TYSABRI and the risk of PML. The agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use [CHMP] concluded that the risk of developing PML increases after two years of use of TYSABRI, although this risk remains low. The committee also reaffirmed its position that TYSABRI benefits continue to outweigh its risks for patients with highly active relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis [RRMS] for whom there are few treatment options available. We expect the TYSABRI label in the EU will be revised to reflect the committee's conclusions. We continue to explore avenues for stratifying risk. One key area of focus is on the development of a serological assay to detect the presence of JC virus [JCV] antibody. We are currently planning to initiate clinical studies to determine whether antibody-negative patients are at lower risk for PML. Our aim is to make these studies widely accessible to TYSABRI patients worldwide.Risk mitigation efforts have also continued. When TYSABRI was introduced, the expectation was that PML was usually fatal. This assumption was largely based on outcomes seen in the HIV-AIDS population. It is still too early to draw firm conclusions, but so far, survival rates have been approximately 75%. We believe that clinical vigilance combined with rapid action, including the ability to shut off the activity of natalizumab by timely dose suspension of plasma exchange, have contributed to improve the outcomes. We will continue to put considerable resources into PML research to further refine ways of identifying who is at risk for this rare event and to provide other approaches that could improve patient outcomes. A final note on TYSABRI's efficacy. Based on the data coming from our clinical trials, the real-world observations from various studies and registries around the world, as well as the uplifting stories we hear from many patients, we believe strongly in the benefit that TYSABRI can offer many patients with multiple sclerosis. While PML seems to get all the headlines, we think TYSABRI's efficacy is a story that also needs to be reinforced. To that end, last month, we announced our decision to launch a head-to-head trial of TYSABRI versus Copaxone and Rebif, a trial we call SURPASS. SURPASS has a target enrollment of 1,800 patients at 230 sites worldwide. As such, it will be largest well-controlled comparative trial of MS treatments ever undertaken. As you know, many neurologists currently witch patients from one ABCR therapy to another and they do this without any clinical trial evidence that has evaluated the utility of this approach. The SURPASS study will be the first trial to provide Class 1 data on whether who are not feeling well on first-line therapies are better off if they switched to TYSABRI versus waiting to switch or switching among the ABCR therapies. We expect the study to be completed in 2013. I will now pass the call over to Bob Hamm, our Chief Operating Officer."

In the fourth quarter, AVONEX, TYSABRI and RITUXAN generated combined worldwide revenue to Biogen Idec of $1.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year, with continued growth in our core MS business offsetting a modest decline in RITUXAN revenues. For",1076,"Thank you, Al. In the fourth quarter, AVONEX, TYSABRI and RITUXAN generated combined worldwide revenue to Biogen Idec of $1.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year, with continued growth in our core MS business offsetting a modest decline in RITUXAN revenues. For the year, this product revenue totaled $4.2 billion, which represents 7% growth versus 2008. As Jim mentioned, TYSABRI achieved blockbuster status in its fourth year, exceeding $1 billion in sales with 30% growth in both end-market sales and patients. Our durable AVONEX franchise, now in its 14th year in the market, delivered 5% revenue growth. In January, we installed new commercial leadership. Dr. Francesco Granata joined Biogen Idec to lead our commercial organization and our Global Medical Affairs team. Dr. Granata is a trained MD who previously held executive commercial leadership positions at Schering-Plough, Pharmacia and Pfizer. Joining Dr. Granata as Head of U.S. business is Tony Kingsley, an entrepreneurial leader who previously held senior operational management positions at Hologic and Cytyc. Together, Francesco and Tony's focus during 2010 will be on reenergizing our U.S. AVONEX business and continuing to drive TYSABRI adoption. I will now provide more detail on each franchise individually. TYSABRI finished 2009 with over 48,000 patients on therapy worldwide. In the U.S., the number of patients grew by 21%. Outside the U.S., the number of patients grew by 40%. The higher growth rate outside the U.S. was in part fueled by geographic expansion. During 2009, we launched TYSABRI in seven countries, bringing the total number of countries where TYSABRI is sold to 45. AVONEX is currently available in over 70 countries, so we still have plenty of room to continue to expand. We anticipate making TYSABRI available in five or six additional countries in Latin America and Central Europe during 2010.No doubt, much of the interest in TYSABRI is due to its efficacy, having demonstrated a 42% to 54% reduction in disability progression, a 68% reduction in relapse rate and five times as many patients free up [ph] disease activity versus placebo. Doctors and patients appear to be taking TYSABRI efficacy into account when weighing TYSABRI's benefit and risks. In Q4, we updated TYSABRI's label information to include a duration effect following two years of treatment. Response to this news, so far, appears to be measured. Worldwide, TYSABRI grew by an average of 867 patients net per month during Q4, which is somewhat lower than during the second and third quarters, but still about 24% above the same period, prior year. We have yet to see a meaningful change in discontinuation trends. As of December, we estimate that less than 10% of U.S. neurologists had ever prescribed TYSABRI drug suspension, and less than 5% of TYSABRI patients were currently on a drug suspension. For patients with few options other than TYSABRI, the risk of PML even after 24 months remains low while the risk of debilitating MS progression without TYSABRI is high. Potential competitors to TYSABRI are on the horizon. And for competitive reasons, I'm not going to go into detail on our commercial preparation for these nation [ph] therapies. But I can say this, we are quite confident in the appeal TYSABRI's benefit-risk equation has for many MS patients. In fact, advances in MS therapy such as TYSABRI are changing the way that many patients view and manage their disease. In January, we launched a customized yoga program called My MS Yoga for people with MS. This program was developed with a top MS specialist, Dr. Elliot Frohman, and world-renowned yoga instructor, Baron Baptiste. The video features TYSABRI patients who are all proactively managing their disease through exercise and treatment. This program has had significant pick-up in the national and local media, including a high-profile piece on Good Morning America Health [ph]. In the first three weeks since launch, over 4,600 patients had visited mymsyoga.com to learn more about the program, and over 1,200 patients have taken advantage of the free My MS Yoga DVD. Now an update on AVONEX. The franchise generated $596 million in global revenue during the fourth quarter of 2009 and $2.3 billion for the year, both an increase of 5% year-over-year. With approximately 137,000 patients on therapy worldwide, and 16 years of remaining patent life, AVONEX continues on as a strong and durable foundation to our market-leading franchise in neurology. RITUXAN Q4 revenues for Biogen Idec were $257 million, down 15% year-over-year. This decline was driven primarily by the continued expiration of royalties on the revenues outside of the United States, off 44% versus 2008. Also in the U.S., our Q4 profit share declined by 7%. As Reuters reported last week, this was due to a reduction in wholesaler inventory. For the year, RITUXAN revenues to Biogen Idec were $1.1 billion, down 3% year-over-year due to a 24% decline in royalties on sales outside the U.S.Now looking towards the future, let's turn to our next anticipated product launch in MS. As Jim mentioned, we field for regulatory approval of Fampridine in December ahead of schedule in Europe and Canada. In the U.S., where Fampridine is developed and commercialized by Acorda Therapeutics, the FDA recently approved the drug as AMPYRA extended-release tablets. It's the first therapy indicated in the U.S. to improve walking in patients with MS. This was demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. Biogen has established a focus team that has initiated the launch preparations for expected approval outside the U.S. in the first half of 2011. Much of our neurology sales and marketing infrastructure is already in place, given our market-leading position in most countries outside the U.S. Fampridine will fit very nicely into that infrastructure. Our commercial efforts are primarily focused on pharma co-economic research at this stage. In parallel, our supply-chain team is preparing to enable appropriate compassionate-use programs and name patients' supply. Biogen Idec is excited to bring this new therapy to MS patients outside of the U.S. Fampridine demonstrated efficacy in people with all four major types of MS: Relapsing/remitting, secondary progressive, progressive relapsing and primary progressive. And it can be used alone or with existing MS therapies. In short, Fampridine's launch outside the U.S. provides us an opportunity to offer therapies to an even broader community of MS patients, a goal that fits wholly with our mission to create new standards of curing neurology through our global commercial and medical capabilities. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."

I'll view our 2009 fourth quarter and full-year financial performance. Additionally, I'll provide our 2010 financial guidance. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between the GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter were $56 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles and $7 million from fully stock options, offset by a $24 million tax impact on these items. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.06 in Q4 and $3.35 for the full year. Now I'll move onto the non-GAAP P&L operating performance for Biogen Idec, which we believe, better represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business internally. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.20 for Q4 and $4.12 for full year 2009. In the fourth quarter, we benefited by $0.12 earnings per share due to one-time discrete tax benefits that I'll detail later in the call. Now let's move to the fourth quarter and full-year results in a bit more of detail. Total revenue for the fourth quarter 2009 was $1.1 billion, 5% growth over fourth quarter 2008. Revenue for the full-year 2009 totaled approximately $4.4 billion, which represents a 7% growth over full-year 2008. Q4 2009 product revenue was $827 million, a 13% growth over Q4 2008. And full-year 2009 product revenue totaled $3.2 billion, an 11% growth over full-year 2008. Going through our product revenues, I'll begin with AVONEX. Q4 AVONEX worldwide product revenue was $596 million, a 5% increase over Q4 of 2008. Worldwide AVONEX revenue for full-year 2009 totaled approximately $2.3 billion, also a 5% growth. U.S. AVONEX product revenue in the fourth quarter was $352 million, a 3% increase over Q4 2008. U.S. AVONEX revenue for the full year totaled $1.4 billion, which represents a 10% growth over full-year 2008. U.S. AVONEX inventory ended at just over two weeks in the fourth quarter, unchanged from the third quarter. In Q4 2009, units sold in the U.S. declined approximately 7% as compared to Q4 2008. This was offset by price increases. On a sequential basis, Q3 to Q4 U.S. AVONEX units declined by approximately 1%. Q4 international AVONEX product revenue was $244 million, a 9% increase over Q4 2008. On a sequential basis, AVONEX international revenues increased by 6% as compared to Q3, driven by higher volume. Foreign exchange, net of hedge, accounted for 2% of the increase. International AVONEX revenue for the full-year 2009 totaled $917 million, a 1% year-over-year decline. The full-year AVONEX international AVONEX revenue was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange and hedging, which reduced revenue by $88 million or approximately 10%. This was offset by unit increases of approximately 6% and favorable price and mix impact of 2%.Q4 TYSABRI worldwide product sales were $216 million per Biogen Idec, a 39% increase over Q4 2008. TYSABRI worldwide revenue for full-year 2009 totaled $776 million for Biogen Idec, a 32% increase over full-year 2008. In the U.S., end-market TYSABRI sales totaled $137 million for the fourth quarter. Q4 U.S. TYSABRI product revenue for Biogen Idec was the $62 million. U.S. end-user end-market TYSABRI sales for the full-year 2009 totaled $509 million, a 21% increase over 2008. Biogen Idec booked $232 million for full-year 2009.Q4 international TYSABRI product revenue was $154 million, a 49% increase over Q4 2008. In international, TYSABRI revenue for full-year 2009 totaled $544 million, a 39% year-over-year increase. Foreign-exchange reduced international TYSABRI revenue by approximately $29 million for full year 2009 or 5%. Q4 [indiscernible] revenue was $14 million. Now I'll move on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues to as revenue from unconsolidated joint business. We recorded $257 million in revenue for the quarter, representing a decrease of 15% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue for the full year decreased 3% to $1.1 billion as compared to full-year 2008. Our RITUXAN revenues are broken down into three components. First, our share of the net U.S. RITUXAN profits. Net U.S. RITUXAN sales were $658 million in the fourth quarter, down 3% versus prior year, and as Bob noted, was own partly due to destocking in the channel. Our Q4 2009 profit share from that business was $192 million, down 7% versus prior year. Full-year 2009 U.S. RITUXAN sales were $2,666,000, up 3% as compared to full-year profit share 2008. And our profit share from that business was $774 million, up 5% as compared to full-year 2008. Year-over-year profit share benefited from price increases and lower operating expenses in the collaboration. Second, we received revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. And in Q4, this was $46 million, down 44% versus Q4 2008, as royalties from individual countries have expired. Revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. for the full year was $256 million, down 24% as compared to full-year 2008. We expect for 2010 the rest-of-the-world revenues from Rituximab to be approximately $120 million to $130 million, depending on the exchange rates. Third, in the fourth quarter we reimbursed $18 million for selling and development cost incurred related to RITUXAN. For the full-year 2009, we reimbursed it $66 million. Royalty revenue were $41 million for fourth quarter 2009 and $124 million for the year.Now turning to the expense line on the non-GAAP P&L, Q4 COGS were $100 million or 9% of revenues. Q4 R&D expense was $279 million, 24% of revenues. R&D spend for the full year totaled $1.3 billion, approximately 29% of revenues and an increase of 20% on a year-over-year basis. This was owed largely to $110 million payment we made to Acorda Therapeutics in the first half of 2009. Q4 SG&A expense was $236 million, a 5% increase year-over-year. This represents 21% of revenues. Drivers of the year-over-year increase included investments that support the MS franchise and the ongoing geographic expansion of our commercial operations. Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit-sharing line totaled $63 million in expense for the quarter. Other income and expense for the quarter was a gain of $6 million driven by net interest income and a realized gains on strategic investments.Let me now share the progress we've made with respect to our share repurchase program. On our last earnings call, we announced that in October 2009, the Board of Directors had authorized the share-repurchase program of up to $1 billion of common stock, intended to reduce our shares outstanding with the objective of returning cash to shareholders. This program was in addition to the previously approved 20 million share-repurchase program authorized in October 2006, which has always been a mark for share stabilization. In the fourth quarter 2009, we made solid progress on our share repurchase programs, purchasing 14.8 million shares of stock at a total cost of approximately $694 million. Repurchases have continued in the first quarter of 2010 through February 5, whereby we've repurchased an additional 5.4 million shares for a total cost of $289 million. Net-net since October 2009 through February 5, 2010, we've purchased approximately 20.2 million shares for a total cost of $983 million. Our cash and marketable securities position remains strong. We ended the year at $2.5 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24%, which benefited from multiple discrete events. Specifically, in the fourth quarter, we effectively resolved previously-outstanding tax audits across multiple years on both the federal and state level. For the full-year 2009, our tax rate was approximately 27%, reflecting these benefits, offset by the negative impact from the Acorda transaction being entered into by an ex-U.S. affiliate. As we look into 2010, I expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be the 28% to 29% range. This does not include the R&D tax credit which currently has not been reinstated. This brings us to our Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.20 and our full-year non-GAAP EPS, $4.12, representing a 13% increase over full-year 2008. Now I'd like to provide our 2010 guidance. Revenue growth in 2010 is expected to be in the mid-single digits. This includes the expected decline of rituximab rest of the world revenues. Core operating expense growth is expected to be in the low single digits. R&D expense is expected to be approximately 24% to 27% of revenue, excluding any new business development expense. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 22% of revenue, the high end of this range reflects investments we may be making in our brands in light of the competitive landscape. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be above $3.71. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be above $4.55, striving towards another double-digit earnings growth year. We expect capital expenditures in the range of $170  million to $200 million. So in conclusion, 2009, it was a solid top and bottom line result. Our total revenue grew by 7% for the full year, product revenue grew by 11%. TYSABRI surpassed $1 billion in sales. Our non-GAAP earnings per share grew by 13%. Our cash flow is strong and we made solid progress against our $1 billion share purchase plan returning cash to shareholders. Now, I'll hand the call over to Jim for his closing comments."

But we'd be disciplined that it's the -- really trying to solve for is creating shareholder value, not simply kind of moving kind of the revenue growth numbers up a little bit up or down. So we are in an enviable position that we ended the year with $2.5 billion of cash. 2010 looks like another robust year with respect to cash flow generation and we will continue to be challenged with this strategic question of looking for opportunities to create value and in doing that in a disciplined way, and if not, returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined way as well."

I'm pleased to report that in 2009, Biogen Idec once again delivered strong financial and operational results. For the full-year 2009, total revenue increased 7% to $4.4 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 13% to $4.12 and the business generated $1.1 billion of cash. The 13% non-GAAP EPS growth marks six consecutive years of double-digit EPS, which increase as the date back to the merger between Biogen and Idec in 2003. On the operational side, I'm also pleased to announce a very successful year. With $1.1 billion of in-market net sales in 2009, TYSABRI is officially a blockbuster. I'm especially proud of this accomplishment when you take a step back and consider the voluntary market withdrawal in 2005. Think about this, a product that was taken off the market is now generating over $1 billion in annual revenue and is still growing. Furthermore, we've made significant progress in our understanding of PML risk and the opportunities. Just try to find [ph] that risk. And I attribute these accomplishments to both TYSABRI's protein advocacy [ph], positive risk-benefit, health profile and a very committed team of Biogen Idec employees who are justifiably proud of their accomplishment but at the same time are aware that there are still more work to be done.During 2009, we also took steps to extend the durability of our core interferon franchise. The therapy is now protected until 2026 by virtue of newly-issued method-of-use patent. In addition, we advanced PEGylated interferon under registrational trial. PEGylated interferon has the potential to reinforce AVONEX's advantage and improve on convenience.  With an eye on revigorating our efforts to restore AVONEX's market leadership, in Q4, we also announced some new additions to our commercial leadership team. Bob Hamm will talk about these new leaders later.Biogen Idec's MS [multiple sclerosis] pipeline is deeper and more complete than ever before. We now have first-in-class or best-in-class therapies that have a potential to address a full spectrum of patient need. Our strategy has been to slow, stop and reverse MS and we've assembled a collection of products and development programs designed to do just that.During 2009, our R&D organization filed for European and Canadian regulatory approval of Fampridine well ahead of plan. And we initiated two pivotal trials, three Phase II trials, two Phase I trials and four R to D [reaserch to development] transitions, all while continuing to manage 90 trials for 31 compounds with over 14,000 patients in more than 45 countries. Finally, we have a strong balance sheet and nearly $100 million in free cash flow monthly. This is allowing us the flexibility to both return cash for shareholders and continue to invest in future growth both internally and externally.Before we turn the call over to Al Sandrock for an update on R&D, let me address the topic I'm sure you're interested in, the board's search for my successor. The board has formed a CEO search committee headed by Director Brian Posner, which also includes Chairman Bill Young and Directors Alex Denner and Bruce Ross. The committee is working diligently with the leading search firm, Spencer Stuart. The process is underway, but you need to understand, beyond that, we're not going to comment on this call today.

We are extremely excited to add these distinguished leaders of the multiple sclerosis community to the Biogen Idec team.I'd like to begin now with an update of our pipeline starting with one of my favorite programs. I'm very pleased to report that in January, we initiated a Phase I trial of our fully-human anti-LINGO-1 monoclonal antibody. This is especially exciting for us because most of the biology of LINGO-1 was elucidated in Biogen Idec's own research laboratories. That's been known for sometime but when myelin, the insulation around nerve fibers, is damaged by diseases such as multiple sclerosis, neurons often lose the ability to transmit nerve impulses. And it was also known that the ability of the human central nervous system to repair myelin was limited. As reported in such publications as Nature Medicine Nature Neuroscience, our scientists found that treatment with anti-LINGO-1 antibody promoted the remuneration of damaged nerve fibers when tested in various animal models of demyelination. Although current MS therapies can slow disease progression, none are designed to directly affect this repair process. As such, anti-LINGO-1 antibody represents a novel therapeutic approach in multiple sclerosis. Another new technology that we advanced into development last quarter was our bispecific antibody targeting TNF-alpha [tumor necrosis factor-alpha] and TWEAK. With this novel bispecific antibody design, which was also a pioneer by Biogen Idex scientists, we can simultaneously bind TNF-alpha and TWEAK with high affinity while retaining many of the desired properties of traditional monoclonal antibodies, including a long circulating half-life and ease of production.  Simultaneous inhibition of the TNF-alpha and TWEAK pathways offers the potential to more effectively block imflammatory, pathologies and auto-immune diseases. Now an update on our blood factor programs. In December, with our partners Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, we announced that our Factor VIII product for hemophilia A moved into clinical trials, making ours the only long-acting Factor VIII compound in clinical trials. In January, we announced that our Factor IX products for hemophilia B moved into a registrational trial making ours the first long-acting Factor IX compound to reach this milestone. The chase for innovating in hemophilia is strong, where the only treatment options are those with relatively short half-lives, requiring between 100 and 150 infusions per year. Our products substantially increased half-life, which offers the hope that the hemophilia patients would need to receive 50 or fewer infusions per year. We will present the results of our Phase I, II Factor IX study at an upcoming medical meeting. As you may already know, Biogen Idec regularly reviews and adjusts its pipeline as scientific, market or regulatory conditions change. In accordance with this process, we reviewed the data for inventory and determined that the results are not supportive of continuing either the oral or the IV program. The efficacy and safety data from our TRIDENT trial analyzed to date suggest a beneficial effect on symptoms without a positive impact on clinical morbidity or mortality outcomes. These results are consistent with recent Phase III results from Merck's rolofylline program in acute decompensated heart failure.Now let me take a moment to provide an update on TYSABRI. When we introduced TYSABRI in July of 2006, you will recall that we set out to answer three questions about PML in TYSABRI-treated patients: Who is at risk, what is the risk and how can we mitigate the risk. With the start of the new year, I thought it would be a good time to revisit the progress we've made in answering these questions. I'll begin with what we know about the risk. During our Q3 earnings call, I announced that we had initiated conversations with regulators worldwide about updating the TYSABRI product label as we began to believe that the risk of PML increases with the length of time on therapy. In the U.S., we updated the label to include language stating that in patients treated with TYSABRI, the risk of developing PML increases the longer treatment duration, and that per patients treated for 24 to 36 months, the risk is generally similar to the rate seen in clinical trials. There is limited experience beyond three years. As recently as last Friday, February 5, the FDA reaffirmed that it believes that the clinical benefits of TYSABRI continues to outweigh the potential risks. On January 21, the European Medicines Agency announced that they had finalized a review of TYSABRI and the risk of PML. The agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use [CHMP] concluded that the risk of developing PML increases after two years of use of TYSABRI, although this risk remains low. The committee also reaffirmed its position that TYSABRI benefits continue to outweigh its risks for patients with highly active relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis [RRMS] for whom there are few treatment options available. We expect the TYSABRI label in the EU will be revised to reflect the committee's conclusions. We continue to explore avenues for stratifying risk. One key area of focus is on the development of a serological assay to detect the presence of JC virus [JCV] antibody. We are currently planning to initiate clinical studies to determine whether antibody-negative patients are at lower risk for PML. Our aim is to make these studies widely accessible to TYSABRI patients worldwide.Risk mitigation efforts have also continued. When TYSABRI was introduced, the expectation was that PML was usually fatal. This assumption was largely based on outcomes seen in the HIV-AIDS population. It is still too early to draw firm conclusions, but so far, survival rates have been approximately 75%. We believe that clinical vigilance combined with rapid action, including the ability to shut off the activity of natalizumab by timely dose suspension of plasma exchange, have contributed to improve the outcomes. We will continue to put considerable resources into PML research to further refine ways of identifying who is at risk for this rare event and to provide other approaches that could improve patient outcomes. A final note on TYSABRI's efficacy. Based on the data coming from our clinical trials, the real-world observations from various studies and registries around the world, as well as the uplifting stories we hear from many patients, we believe strongly in the benefit that TYSABRI can offer many patients with multiple sclerosis. While PML seems to get all the headlines, we think TYSABRI's efficacy is a story that also needs to be reinforced. To that end, last month, we announced our decision to launch a head-to-head trial of TYSABRI versus Copaxone and Rebif, a trial we call SURPASS. SURPASS has a target enrollment of 1,800 patients at 230 sites worldwide. As such, it will be largest well-controlled comparative trial of MS treatments ever undertaken. As you know, many neurologists currently witch patients from one ABCR therapy to another and they do this without any clinical trial evidence that has evaluated the utility of this approach. The SURPASS study will be the first trial to provide Class 1 data on whether who are not feeling well on first-line therapies are better off if they switched to TYSABRI versus waiting to switch or switching among the ABCR therapies. We expect the study to be completed in 2013. I will now pass the call over to Bob Hamm, our Chief Operating Officer."

For",1076,"Thank you, Al. In the fourth quarter, AVONEX, TYSABRI and RITUXAN generated combined worldwide revenue to Biogen Idec of $1.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year, with continued growth in our core MS business offsetting a modest decline in RITUXAN revenues. For the year, this product revenue totaled $4.2 billion, which represents 7% growth versus 2008. As Jim mentioned, TYSABRI achieved blockbuster status in its fourth year, exceeding $1 billion in sales with 30% growth in both end-market sales and patients. Our durable AVONEX franchise, now in its 14th year in the market, delivered 5% revenue growth. In January, we installed new commercial leadership. Dr. Francesco Granata joined Biogen Idec to lead our commercial organization and our Global Medical Affairs team. Dr. Granata is a trained MD who previously held executive commercial leadership positions at Schering-Plough, Pharmacia and Pfizer. Joining Dr. Granata as Head of U.S. business is Tony Kingsley, an entrepreneurial leader who previously held senior operational management positions at Hologic and Cytyc. Together, Francesco and Tony's focus during 2010 will be on reenergizing our U.S. AVONEX business and continuing to drive TYSABRI adoption. I will now provide more detail on each franchise individually. TYSABRI finished 2009 with over 48,000 patients on therapy worldwide. In the U.S., the number of patients grew by 21%. Outside the U.S., the number of patients grew by 40%. The higher growth rate outside the U.S. was in part fueled by geographic expansion. During 2009, we launched TYSABRI in seven countries, bringing the total number of countries where TYSABRI is sold to 45. AVONEX is currently available in over 70 countries, so we still have plenty of room to continue to expand. We anticipate making TYSABRI available in five or six additional countries in Latin America and Central Europe during 2010.No doubt, much of the interest in TYSABRI is due to its efficacy, having demonstrated a 42% to 54% reduction in disability progression, a 68% reduction in relapse rate and five times as many patients free up [ph] disease activity versus placebo. Doctors and patients appear to be taking TYSABRI efficacy into account when weighing TYSABRI's benefit and risks. In Q4, we updated TYSABRI's label information to include a duration effect following two years of treatment. Response to this news, so far, appears to be measured. Worldwide, TYSABRI grew by an average of 867 patients net per month during Q4, which is somewhat lower than during the second and third quarters, but still about 24% above the same period, prior year. We have yet to see a meaningful change in discontinuation trends. As of December, we estimate that less than 10% of U.S. neurologists had ever prescribed TYSABRI drug suspension, and less than 5% of TYSABRI patients were currently on a drug suspension. For patients with few options other than TYSABRI, the risk of PML even after 24 months remains low while the risk of debilitating MS progression without TYSABRI is high. Potential competitors to TYSABRI are on the horizon. And for competitive reasons, I'm not going to go into detail on our commercial preparation for these nation [ph] therapies. But I can say this, we are quite confident in the appeal TYSABRI's benefit-risk equation has for many MS patients. In fact, advances in MS therapy such as TYSABRI are changing the way that many patients view and manage their disease. In January, we launched a customized yoga program called My MS Yoga for people with MS. This program was developed with a top MS specialist, Dr. Elliot Frohman, and world-renowned yoga instructor, Baron Baptiste. The video features TYSABRI patients who are all proactively managing their disease through exercise and treatment. This program has had significant pick-up in the national and local media, including a high-profile piece on Good Morning America Health [ph]. In the first three weeks since launch, over 4,600 patients had visited mymsyoga.com to learn more about the program, and over 1,200 patients have taken advantage of the free My MS Yoga DVD. Now an update on AVONEX. The franchise generated $596 million in global revenue during the fourth quarter of 2009 and $2.3 billion for the year, both an increase of 5% year-over-year. With approximately 137,000 patients on therapy worldwide, and 16 years of remaining patent life, AVONEX continues on as a strong and durable foundation to our market-leading franchise in neurology. RITUXAN Q4 revenues for Biogen Idec were $257 million, down 15% year-over-year. This decline was driven primarily by the continued expiration of royalties on the revenues outside of the United States, off 44% versus 2008. Also in the U.S., our Q4 profit share declined by 7%. As Reuters reported last week, this was due to a reduction in wholesaler inventory. For the year, RITUXAN revenues to Biogen Idec were $1.1 billion, down 3% year-over-year due to a 24% decline in royalties on sales outside the U.S.Now looking towards the future, let's turn to our next anticipated product launch in MS. As Jim mentioned, we field for regulatory approval of Fampridine in December ahead of schedule in Europe and Canada. In the U.S., where Fampridine is developed and commercialized by Acorda Therapeutics, the FDA recently approved the drug as AMPYRA extended-release tablets. It's the first therapy indicated in the U.S. to improve walking in patients with MS. This was demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. Biogen has established a focus team that has initiated the launch preparations for expected approval outside the U.S. in the first half of 2011. Much of our neurology sales and marketing infrastructure is already in place, given our market-leading position in most countries outside the U.S. Fampridine will fit very nicely into that infrastructure. Our commercial efforts are primarily focused on pharma co-economic research at this stage. In parallel, our supply-chain team is preparing to enable appropriate compassionate-use programs and name patients' supply. Biogen Idec is excited to bring this new therapy to MS patients outside of the U.S. Fampridine demonstrated efficacy in people with all four major types of MS: Relapsing/remitting, secondary progressive, progressive relapsing and primary progressive. And it can be used alone or with existing MS therapies. In short, Fampridine's launch outside the U.S. provides us an opportunity to offer therapies to an even broader community of MS patients, a goal that fits wholly with our mission to create new standards of curing neurology through our global commercial and medical capabilities. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."

I'll view our 2009 fourth quarter and full-year financial performance. Additionally, I'll provide our 2010 financial guidance. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between the GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter were $56 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles and $7 million from fully stock options, offset by a $24 million tax impact on these items. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.06 in Q4 and $3.35 for the full year. Now I'll move onto the non-GAAP P&L operating performance for Biogen Idec, which we believe, better represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business internally. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.20 for Q4 and $4.12 for full year 2009. In the fourth quarter, we benefited by $0.12 earnings per share due to one-time discrete tax benefits that I'll detail later in the call. Now let's move to the fourth quarter and full-year results in a bit more of detail. Total revenue for the fourth quarter 2009 was $1.1 billion, 5% growth over fourth quarter 2008. Revenue for the full-year 2009 totaled approximately $4.4 billion, which represents a 7% growth over full-year 2008. Q4 2009 product revenue was $827 million, a 13% growth over Q4 2008. And full-year 2009 product revenue totaled $3.2 billion, an 11% growth over full-year 2008. Going through our product revenues, I'll begin with AVONEX. Q4 AVONEX worldwide product revenue was $596 million, a 5% increase over Q4 of 2008. Worldwide AVONEX revenue for full-year 2009 totaled approximately $2.3 billion, also a 5% growth. U.S. AVONEX product revenue in the fourth quarter was $352 million, a 3% increase over Q4 2008. U.S. AVONEX revenue for the full year totaled $1.4 billion, which represents a 10% growth over full-year 2008. U.S. AVONEX inventory ended at just over two weeks in the fourth quarter, unchanged from the third quarter. In Q4 2009, units sold in the U.S. declined approximately 7% as compared to Q4 2008. This was offset by price increases. On a sequential basis, Q3 to Q4 U.S. AVONEX units declined by approximately 1%. Q4 international AVONEX product revenue was $244 million, a 9% increase over Q4 2008. On a sequential basis, AVONEX international revenues increased by 6% as compared to Q3, driven by higher volume. Foreign exchange, net of hedge, accounted for 2% of the increase. International AVONEX revenue for the full year 2009 totaled $917 million, a 1% year-over-year decline. The full year AVONEX international AVONEX revenue was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange and hedging, which reduced revenue by $88 million or approximately 10%. This was offset by unit increases of approximately 6% and favorable price and mix impact of 2%.Q4 TYSABRI worldwide product sales were $216 million per Biogen Idec, a 39% increase over Q4 2008. TYSABRI worldwide revenue for full-year 2009 totaled $776 million for Biogen Idec, a 32% increase over full-year 2008. In the U.S., end-market TYSABRI sales totaled $137 million for the fourth quarter. Q4 U.S. TYSABRI product revenue for Biogen Idec was the $62 million. U.S. end-user end-market TYSABRI sales for the full-year 2009 totaled $509 million, a 21% increase over 2008. Biogen Idec booked $232 million for full year 2009.Q4 international TYSABRI product revenue was $154 million, a 49% increase over Q4 2008. In international, TYSABRI revenue for full year 2009 totaled $544 million, a 39% year-over-year increase. Foreign-exchange reduced international TYSABRI revenue by approximately $29 million for full year 2009 or 5%. Q4 [indiscernible] revenue was $14 million. Now I'll move on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues to as revenue from unconsolidated joint business. We recorded $257 million in revenue for the quarter, representing a decrease of 15% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue for the full year decreased 3% to $1.1 billion as compared to full-year 2008. Our RITUXAN revenues are broken down into three components. First, our share of the net U.S. RITUXAN profits. Net U.S. RITUXAN sales were $658 million in the fourth quarter, down 3% versus prior year, and as Bob noted, was own partly due to destocking in the channel. Our Q4 2009 profit share from that business was $192 million, down 7% versus prior year. Full-year 2009 U.S. RITUXAN sales were $2,666,000, up 3% as compared to full year profit share 2008. And our profit share from that business was $774 million, up 5% as compared to full-year 2008. Year-over-year profit share benefited from price increases and lower operating expenses in the collaboration. Second, we received revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. And in Q4, this was $46 million, down 44% versus Q4 2008, as royalties from individual countries have expired. Revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. for the full year was $256 million, down 24% as compared to full year 2008. We expect for 2010 the rest-of-the-world revenues from Rituximab to be approximately $120 million to $130 million, depending on the exchange rates. Third, in the fourth quarter we reimbursed $18 million for selling and development cost incurred related to RITUXAN. For the full year 2009, we reimbursed it $66 million. Royalty revenue were $41 million for fourth quarter 2009 and $124 million for the year.Now turning to the expense line on the non-GAAP P&L, Q4 COGS were $100 million or 9% of revenues. Q4 R&D expense was $279 million, 24% of revenues. R&D spend for the full year totaled $1.3 billion, approximately 29% of revenues and an increase of 20% on a year-over-year basis. This was owed largely to $110 million payment we made to Acorda Therapeutics in the first half of 2009. Q4 SG&A expense was $236 million, a 5% increase year-over-year. This represents 21% of revenues. Drivers of the year-over-year increase included investments that support the MS franchise and the ongoing geographic expansion of our commercial operations. Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit-sharing line totaled $63 million in expense for the quarter. Other income and expense for the quarter was a gain of $6 million driven by net interest income and a realized gains on strategic investments.Let me now share the progress we've made with respect to our share repurchase program. On our last earnings call, we announced that in October 2009, the Board of Directors had authorized the share-repurchase program of up to $1 billion of common stock, intended to reduce our shares outstanding with the objective of returning cash to shareholders. This program was in addition to the previously approved 20 million share-repurchase program authorized in October 2006, which has always been a mark for share stabilization. In the fourth quarter 2009, we made solid progress on our share repurchase programs, purchasing 14.8 million shares of stock at a total cost of approximately $694 million. Repurchases have continued in the first quarter of 2010 through February 5, whereby we've repurchased an additional 5.4 million shares for a total cost of $289 million. Net-net since October 2009 through February 5, 2010, we've purchased approximately 20.2 million shares for a total cost of $983 million. Our cash and marketable securities position remains strong. We ended the year at $2.5 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24%, which benefited from multiple discrete events. Specifically, in the fourth quarter, we effectively resolved previously-outstanding tax audits across multiple years on both the federal and state level. For the full year 2009, our tax rate was approximately 27%, reflecting these benefits, offset by the negative impact from the Acorda transaction being entered into by an ex-U.S. affiliate. As we look into 2010, I expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be the 28% to 29% range. This does not include the R&D tax credit which currently has not been reinstated. This brings us to our Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.20 and our full-year non-GAAP EPS, $4.12, representing a 13% increase over full-year 2008. Now I'd like to provide our 2010 guidance. Revenue growth in 2010 is expected to be in the mid-single digits. This includes the expected decline of rituximab rest of the world revenues. Core operating expense growth is expected to be in the low single digits. R&D expense is expected to be approximately 24% to 27% of revenue, excluding any new business development expense. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 22% of revenue, the high end of this range reflects investments we may be making in our brands in light of the competitive landscape. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be above $3.71. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be above $4.55, striving towards another double-digit earnings growth year. We expect capital expenditures in the range of $170  million to $200 million. So in conclusion, 2009, it was a solid top and bottom line result. Our total revenue grew by 7% for the full year, product revenue grew by 11%. TYSABRI surpassed $1 billion in sales. Our non-GAAP earnings per share grew by 13%. Our cash flow is strong and we made solid progress against our $1 billion share purchase plan returning cash to shareholders. Now, I'll hand the call over to Jim for his closing comments."

I'm pleased to report that in 2009, Biogen Idec once again delivered strong financial and operational results. For the full-year 2009, total revenue increased 7% to $4.4 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 13% to $4.12 and the business generated $1.1 billion of cash. The 13% non-GAAP EPS growth marks six consecutive years of double-digit EPS, which increase as the date back to the merger between Biogen and Idec in 2003. On the operational side, I'm also pleased to announce a very successful year. With $1.1 billion of in-market net sales in 2009, TYSABRI is officially a blockbuster. I'm especially proud of this accomplishment when you take a step back and consider the voluntary market withdrawal in 2005. Think about this, a product that was taken off the market is now generating over $1 billion in annual revenue and is still growing. Furthermore, we've made significant progress in our understanding of PML risk and the opportunities. Just try to find [ph] that risk. And I attribute these accomplishments to both TYSABRI's protein advocacy [ph], positive risk-benefit, health profile and a very committed team of Biogen Idec employees who are justifiably proud of their accomplishment but at the same time are aware that there are still more work to be done.During 2009, we also took steps to extend the durability of our core interferon franchise. The therapy is now protected until 2026 by virtue of newly-issued method-of-use patent. In addition, we advanced PEGylated interferon under registrational trial. PEGylated interferon has the potential to reinforce AVONEX's advantage and improve on convenience.  With an eye on revigorating our efforts to restore AVONEX's market leadership, in Q4, we also announced some new additions to our commercial leadership team. Bob Hamm will talk about these new leaders later.Biogen Idec's MS [multiple sclerosis] pipeline is deeper and more complete than ever before. We now have first-in-class or best-in-class therapies that have a potential to address a full spectrum of patient need. Our strategy has been to slow, stop and reverse MS and we've assembled a collection of products and development programs designed to do just that.During 2009, our R&D organization filed for European and Canadian regulatory approval of Fampridine well ahead of plan. And we initiated two pivotal trials, three Phase II trials, two Phase I trials and four R to D [research to development] transitions, all while continuing to manage 90 trials for 31 compounds with over 14,000 patients in more than 45 countries. Finally, we have a strong balance sheet and nearly $100 million in free cash flow monthly. This is allowing us the flexibility to both return cash for shareholders and continue to invest in future growth both internally and externally.Before we turn the call over to Al Sandrock for an update on R&D, let me address the topic I'm sure you're interested in, the board's search for my successor. The board has formed a CEO search committee headed by Director Brian Posner, which also includes Chairman Bill Young and Directors Alex Denner and Bruce Ross. The committee is working diligently with the leading search firm, Spencer Stuart. The process is underway, but you need to understand, beyond that, we're not going to comment on this call today.

I'd like to begin by welcoming some new additions to the Neurology R&D and Medical Affairs team to Biogen Idec. You probably already seen the announcements but let me take a moment to tell you about each person. Dr. John Richter joins us from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, where he served as Executive Vice President for Research and Clinical Programs for the past five years. Prior to that, John was at Georgetown University where he was Professor and Chair in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Professional of Neurology and Founder of the University's MS Clinic. Dr. Frederick Munschauer joins us from The State University of New York at Buffalo School of Medicine, where he was the Irvin & Rosemary Smith Professor in the Department of Neurology and Chair of the Department of Neurology. Dr. Nancy Richert, an expert in neuroimaging, joins us from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, where she served as a staff clinician in the Neuroimmunology Branch. And Dr. Doug Kerr, an expert on transe-verse myelitis and MS, joins us from Johns Hopkins where he was Associate Professor of Neurology. We are extremely excited to add these distinguished leaders of the multiple sclerosis community to the Biogen Idec team.I'd like to begin now with an update of our pipeline starting with one of my favorite programs. I'm very pleased to report that in January, we initiated a Phase I trial of our fully-human anti-LINGO-1 monoclonal antibody. This is especially exciting for us because most of the biology of LINGO-1 was elucidated in Biogen Idec's own research laboratories. That's been known for sometime but when myelin, the insulation around nerve fibers, is damaged by diseases such as multiple sclerosis, neurons often lose the ability to transmit nerve impulses. And it was also known that the ability of the human central nervous system to repair myelin was limited. As reported in such publications as Nature Medicine Nature Neuroscience, our scientists found that treatment with anti-LINGO-1 antibody promoted the remuneration of damaged nerve fibers when tested in various animal models of demyelination. Although current MS therapies can slow disease progression, none are designed to directly affect this repair process. As such, anti-LINGO-1 antibody represents a novel therapeutic approach in multiple sclerosis. Another new technology that we advanced into development last quarter was our bispecific antibody targeting TNF-alpha [tumor necrosis factor-alpha] and TWEAK. With this novel bispecific antibody design, which was also a pioneer by Biogen Idex scientists, we can simultaneously bind TNF-alpha and TWEAK with high affinity while retaining many of the desired properties of traditional monoclonal antibodies, including a long circulating half-life and ease of production.  Simultaneous inhibition of the TNF-alpha and TWEAK pathways offers the potential to more effectively block imflammatory, pathologies and auto-immune diseases. Now an update on our blood factor programs. In December, with our partners Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, we announced that our Factor VIII product for hemophilia A moved into clinical trials, making ours the only long-acting Factor VIII compound in clinical trials. In January, we announced that our Factor IX products for hemophilia B moved into a registrational trial making ours the first long-acting Factor IX compound to reach this milestone. The chase for innovating in hemophilia is strong, where the only treatment options are those with relatively short half-lives, requiring between 100 and 150 infusions per year. Our products substantially increased half-life, which offers the hope that the hemophilia patients would need to receive 50 or fewer infusions per year. We will present the results of our Phase I, II Factor IX study at an upcoming medical meeting. As you may already know, Biogen Idec regularly reviews and adjusts its pipeline as scientific, market or regulatory conditions change. In accordance with this process, we reviewed the data for inventory and determined that the results are not supportive of continuing either the oral or the IV program. The efficacy and safety data from our TRIDENT trial analyzed to date suggest a beneficial effect on symptoms without a positive impact on clinical morbidity or mortality outcomes. These results are consistent with recent Phase III results from Merck's rolofylline program in acute decompensated heart failure.Now let me take a moment to provide an update on TYSABRI. When we introduced TYSABRI in July of 2006, you will recall that we set out to answer three questions about PML in TYSABRI-treated patients: Who is at risk, what is the risk and how can we mitigate the risk. With the start of the new year, I thought it would be a good time to revisit the progress we've made in answering these questions. I'll begin with what we know about the risk. During our Q3 earnings call, I announced that we had initiated conversations with regulators worldwide about updating the TYSABRI product label as we began to believe that the risk of PML increases with the length of time on therapy. In the U.S., we updated the label to include language stating that in patients treated with TYSABRI, the risk of developing PML increases the longer treatment duration, and that per patients treated for 24 to 36 months, the risk is generally similar to the rate seen in clinical trials. There is limited experience beyond three years. As recently as last Friday, February 5, the FDA reaffirmed that it believes that the clinical benefits of TYSABRI continues to outweigh the potential risks. On January 21, the European Medicines Agency announced that they had finalized a review of TYSABRI and the risk of PML. The agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use [CHMP] concluded that the risk of developing PML increases after two years of use of TYSABRI, although this risk remains low. The committee also reaffirmed its position that TYSABRI benefits continue to outweigh its risks for patients with highly active relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis [RRMS] for whom there are few treatment options available. We expect the TYSABRI label in the EU will be revised to reflect the committee's conclusions. We continue to explore avenues for stratifying risk. One key area of focus is on the development of a serological assay to detect the presence of JC virus [JCV] antibody. We are currently planning to initiate clinical studies to determine whether antibody-negative patients are at lower risk for PML. Our aim is to make these studies widely accessible to TYSABRI patients worldwide.Risk mitigation efforts have also continued. When TYSABRI was introduced, the expectation was that PML was usually fatal. This assumption was largely based on outcomes seen in the HIV-AIDS population. It is still too early to draw firm conclusions, but so far, survival rates have been approximately 75%. We believe that clinical vigilance combined with rapid action, including the ability to shut off the activity of natalizumab by timely dose suspension of plasma exchange, have contributed to improve the outcomes. We will continue to put considerable resources into PML research to further refine ways of identifying who is at risk for this rare event and to provide other approaches that could improve patient outcomes. A final note on TYSABRI's efficacy. Based on the data coming from our clinical trials, the real-world observations from various studies and registries around the world, as well as the uplifting stories we hear from many patients, we believe strongly in the benefit that TYSABRI can offer many patients with multiple sclerosis. While PML seems to get all the headlines, we think TYSABRI's efficacy is a story that also needs to be reinforced. To that end, last month, we announced our decision to launch a head-to-head trial of TYSABRI versus Copaxone and Rebif, a trial we call SURPASS. SURPASS has a target enrollment of 1,800 patients at 230 sites worldwide. As such, it will be largest well-controlled comparative trial of MS treatments ever undertaken. As you know, many neurologists currently witch patients from one ABCR therapy to another and they do this without any clinical trial evidence that has evaluated the utility of this approach. The SURPASS study will be the first trial to provide Class 1 data on whether who are not feeling well on first-line therapies are better off if they switched to TYSABRI versus waiting to switch or switching among the ABCR therapies. We expect the study to be completed in 2013. I will now pass the call over to Bob Hamm, our Chief Operating Officer."

In the fourth quarter, AVONEX, TYSABRI and RITUXAN generated combined worldwide revenue to Biogen Idec of $1.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year, with continued growth in our core MS business offsetting a modest decline in RITUXAN revenues. For the year, this product revenue totaled $4.2 billion, which represents 7% growth versus 2008. As Jim mentioned, TYSABRI achieved blockbuster status in its fourth year, exceeding $1 billion in sales with 30% growth in both end-market sales and patients. Our durable AVONEX franchise, now in its 14th year in the market, delivered 5% revenue growth. In January, we installed new commercial leadership. Dr. Francesco Granata joined Biogen Idec to lead our commercial organization and our Global Medical Affairs team. Dr. Granata is a trained MD who previously held executive commercial leadership positions at Schering-Plough, Pharmacia and Pfizer. Joining Dr. Granata as Head of U.S. business is Tony Kingsley, an entrepreneurial leader who previously held senior operational management positions at Hologic and Cytyc. Together, Francesco and Tony's focus during 2010 will be on reenergizing our U.S. AVONEX business and continuing to drive TYSABRI adoption. I will now provide more detail on each franchise individually. TYSABRI finished 2009 with over 48,000 patients on therapy worldwide. In the U.S., the number of patients grew by 21%. Outside the U.S., the number of patients grew by 40%. The higher growth rate outside the U.S. was in part fueled by geographic expansion. During 2009, we launched TYSABRI in seven countries, bringing the total number of countries where TYSABRI is sold to 45. AVONEX is currently available in over 70 countries, so we still have plenty of room to continue to expand. We anticipate making TYSABRI available in five or six additional countries in Latin America and Central Europe during 2010.No doubt, much of the interest in TYSABRI is due to its efficacy, having demonstrated a 42% to 54% reduction in disability progression, a 68% reduction in relapse rate and five times as many patients free up [ph] disease activity versus placebo. Doctors and patients appear to be taking TYSABRI efficacy into account when weighing TYSABRI's benefit and risks. In Q4, we updated TYSABRI's label information to include a duration effect following two years of treatment. Response to this news, so far, appears to be measured. Worldwide, TYSABRI grew by an average of 867 patients net per month during Q4, which is somewhat lower than during the second and third quarters, but still about 24% above the same period, prior year. We have yet to see a meaningful change in discontinuation trends. As of December, we estimate that less than 10% of U.S. neurologists had ever prescribed TYSABRI drug suspension, and less than 5% of TYSABRI patients were currently on a drug suspension. For patients with few options other than TYSABRI, the risk of PML even after 24 months remains low while the risk of debilitating MS progression without TYSABRI is high. Potential competitors to TYSABRI are on the horizon. And for competitive reasons, I'm not going to go into detail on our commercial preparation for these nation [ph] therapies. But I can say this, we are quite confident in the appeal TYSABRI's benefit-risk equation has for many MS patients. In fact, advances in MS therapy such as TYSABRI are changing the way that many patients view and manage their disease. In January, we launched a customized yoga program called My MS Yoga for people with MS. This program was developed with a top MS specialist, Dr. Elliot Frohman, and world-renowned yoga instructor, Baron Baptiste. The video features TYSABRI patients who are all proactively managing their disease through exercise and treatment. This program has had significant pick-up in the national and local media, including a high-profile piece on Good Morning America Health [ph]. In the first three weeks since launch, over 4,600 patients had visited mymsyoga.com to learn more about the program, and over 1,200 patients have taken advantage of the free My MS Yoga DVD. Now an update on AVONEX. The franchise generated $596 million in global revenue during the fourth quarter of 2009 and $2.3 billion for the year, both an increase of 5% year-over-year. With approximately 137,000 patients on therapy worldwide, and 16 years of remaining patent life, AVONEX continues on as a strong and durable foundation to our market-leading franchise in neurology. RITUXAN Q4 revenues for Biogen Idec were $257 million, down 15% year-over-year. This decline was driven primarily by the continued expiration of royalties on the revenues outside of the United States, off 44% versus 2008. Also in the U.S., our Q4 profit share declined by 7%. As Reuters reported last week, this was due to a reduction in wholesaler inventory. For the year, RITUXAN revenues to Biogen Idec were $1.1 billion, down 3% year-over-year due to a 24% decline in royalties on sales outside the U.S.Now looking towards the future, let's turn to our next anticipated product launch in MS. As Jim mentioned, we field for regulatory approval of Fampridine in December ahead of schedule in Europe and Canada. In the U.S., where Fampridine is developed and commercialized by Acorda Therapeutics, the FDA recently approved the drug as AMPYRA extended-release tablets. It's the first therapy indicated in the U.S. to improve walking in patients with MS. This was demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. Biogen has established a focus team that has initiated the launch preparations for expected approval outside the U.S. in the first half of 2011. Much of our neurology sales and marketing infrastructure is already in place, given our market-leading position in most countries outside the U.S. Fampridine will fit very nicely into that infrastructure. Our commercial efforts are primarily focused on pharma co-economic research at this stage. In parallel, our supply-chain team is preparing to enable appropriate compassionate-use programs and name patients' supply. Biogen Idec is excited to bring this new therapy to MS patients outside of the U.S. Fampridine demonstrated efficacy in people with all four major types of MS: Relapsing/remitting, secondary progressive, progressive relapsing and primary progressive. And it can be used alone or with existing MS therapies. In short, Fampridine's launch outside the U.S. provides us an opportunity to offer therapies to an even broader community of MS patients, a goal that fits wholly with our mission to create new standards of curing neurology through our global commercial and medical capabilities. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."

I'll view our 2009 fourth quarter and full-year financial performance. Additionally, I'll provide our 2010 financial guidance. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between the GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter were $56 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles and $7 million from fully stock options, offset by a $24 million tax impact on these items. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.06 in Q4 and $3.35 for the full year. Now I'll move onto the non-GAAP P&L operating performance for Biogen Idec, which we believe, better represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business internally. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.20 for Q4 and $4.12 for full year 2009. In the fourth quarter, we benefited by $0.12 earnings per share due to one-time discrete tax benefits that I'll detail later in the call. Now let's move to the fourth quarter and full-year results in a bit more of detail. Total revenue for the fourth quarter 2009 was $1.1 billion, 5% growth over fourth quarter 2008. Revenue for the full-year 2009 totaled approximately $4.4 billion, which represents a 7% growth over full-year 2008. Q4 2009 product revenue was $827 million, a 13% growth over Q4 2008. And full-year 2009 product revenue totaled $3.2 billion, an 11% growth over full-year 2008. Going through our product revenues, I'll begin with AVONEX. Q4 AVONEX worldwide product revenue was $596 million, a 5% increase over Q4 of 2008. Worldwide AVONEX revenue for full-year 2009 totaled approximately $2.3 billion, also a 5% growth. U.S. AVONEX product revenue in the fourth quarter was $352 million, a 3% increase over Q4 2008. U.S. AVONEX revenue for the full year totaled $1.4 billion, which represents a 10% growth over full-year 2008. U.S. AVONEX inventory ended at just over two weeks in the fourth quarter, unchanged from the third quarter. In Q4 2009, units sold in the U.S. declined approximately 7% as compared to Q4 2008. This was offset by price increases. On a sequential basis, Q3 to Q4 U.S. AVONEX units declined by approximately 1%. Q4 international AVONEX product revenue was $244 million, a 9% increase over Q4 2008. On a sequential basis, AVONEX international revenues increased by 6% as compared to Q3, driven by higher volume. Foreign exchange, net of hedge, accounted for 2% of the increase. International AVONEX revenue for the full year 2009 totaled $917 million, a 1% year-over-year decline. The full year AVONEX international AVONEX revenue was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange and hedging, which reduced revenue by $88 million or approximately 10%. This was offset by unit increases of approximately 6% and favorable price and mix impact of 2%.Q4 TYSABRI worldwide product sales were $216 million per Biogen Idec, a 39% increase over Q4 2008. TYSABRI worldwide revenue for full-year 2009 totaled $776 million for Biogen Idec, a 32% increase over full-year 2008. In the U.S., end-market TYSABRI sales totaled $137 million for the fourth quarter. Q4 U.S. TYSABRI product revenue for Biogen Idec was the $62 million. U.S. end-user end-market TYSABRI sales for the full-year 2009 totaled $509 million, a 21% increase over 2008. Biogen Idec booked $232 million for full year 2009.Q4 international TYSABRI product revenue was $154 million, a 49% increase over Q4 2008. In international, TYSABRI revenue for full year 2009 totaled $544 million, a 39% year-over-year increase. Foreign-exchange reduced international TYSABRI revenue by approximately $29 million for full year 2009 or 5%. Q4 [indiscernible] revenue was $14 million. Now I'll move on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues to as revenue from unconsolidated joint business. We recorded $257 million in revenue for the quarter, representing a decrease of 15% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue for the full year decreased 3% to $1.1 billion as compared to full-year 2008. Our RITUXAN revenues are broken down into three components. First, our share of the net U.S. RITUXAN profits. Net U.S. RITUXAN sales were $658 million in the fourth quarter, down 3% versus prior year, and as Bob noted, was own partly due to destocking in the channel. Our Q4 2009 profit share from that business was $192 million, down 7% versus prior year. Full-year 2009 U.S. RITUXAN sales were $2,666,000, up 3% as compared to full year profit share 2008. And our profit share from that business was $774 million, up 5% as compared to full-year 2008. Year-over-year profit share benefited from price increases and lower operating expenses in the collaboration. Second, we received revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. And in Q4, this was $46 million, down 44% versus Q4 2008, as royalties from individual countries have expired. Revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. for the full year was $256 million, down 24% as compared to full year 2008. We expect for 2010 the rest-of-the-world revenues from Rituximab to be approximately $120 million to $130 million, depending on the exchange rates. Third, in the fourth quarter we reimbursed $18 million for selling and development cost incurred related to RITUXAN. For the full year 2009, we reimbursed it $66 million. Royalty revenue were $41 million for fourth quarter 2009 and $124 million for the year.Now turning to the expense line on the non-GAAP P&L, Q4 COGS were $100 million or 9% of revenues. Q4 R&D expense was $279 million, 24% of revenues. R&D spend for the full year totaled $1.3 billion, approximately 29% of revenues and an increase of 20% on a year-over-year basis. This was owed largely to $110 million payment we made to Acorda Therapeutics in the first half of 2009. Q4 SG&A expense was $236 million, a 5% increase year-over-year. This represents 21% of revenues. Drivers of the year-over-year increase included investments that support the MS franchise and the ongoing geographic expansion of our commercial operations. Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit-sharing line totaled $63 million in expense for the quarter. Other income and expense for the quarter was a gain of $6 million driven by net interest income and a realized gains on strategic investments.Let me now share the progress we've made with respect to our share repurchase program. On our last earnings call, we announced that in October 2009, the Board of Directors had authorized the share-repurchase program of up to $1 billion of common stock, intended to reduce our shares outstanding with the objective of returning cash to shareholders. This program was in addition to the previously approved 20 million share-repurchase program authorized in October 2006, which has always been a mark for share stabilization. In the fourth quarter 2009, we made solid progress on our share repurchase programs, purchasing 14.8 million shares of stock at a total cost of approximately $694 million. Repurchases have continued in the first quarter of 2010 through February 5, whereby we've repurchased an additional 5.4 million shares for a total cost of $289 million. Net-net since October 2009 through February 5, 2010, we've purchased approximately 20.2 million shares for a total cost of $983 million. Our cash and marketable securities position remains strong. We ended the year at $2.5 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24%, which benefited from multiple discrete events. Specifically, in the fourth quarter, we effectively resolved previously-outstanding tax audits across multiple years on both the federal and state level. For the full year 2009, our tax rate was approximately 27%, reflecting these benefits, offset by the negative impact from the Acorda transaction being entered into by an ex-U.S. affiliate. As we look into 2010, I expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be the 28% to 29% range. This does not include the R&D tax credit which currently has not been reinstated. This brings us to our Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.20 and our full-year non-GAAP EPS, $4.12, representing a 13% increase over full-year 2008. Now I'd like to provide our 2010 guidance. Revenue growth in 2010 is expected to be in the mid-single digits. This includes the expected decline of rituximab rest of the world revenues. Core operating expense growth is expected to be in the low single digits. R&D expense is expected to be approximately 24% to 27% of revenue, excluding any new business development expense. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 22% of revenue, the high end of this range reflects investments we may be making in our brands in light of the competitive landscape. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be above $3.71. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be above $4.55, striving towards another double-digit earnings growth year. We expect capital expenditures in the range of $170  million to $200 million. So in conclusion, 2009, it was a solid top and bottom line result. Our total revenue grew by 7% for the full year, product revenue grew by 11%. TYSABRI surpassed $1 billion in sales. Our non-GAAP earnings per share grew by 13%. Our cash flow is strong and we made solid progress against our $1 billion share purchase plan returning cash to shareholders. Now, I'll hand the call over to Jim for his closing comments."

But it became clear that the impact appreciated by patients goes beyond the primary endpoint. That's not what's going to be in a label, but I think as Acorda and we expand out the trials and additional things, hopefully, we can tease that kind of clinically-relevant data. And then the last point is there's certainly strong technical rationales to consider this product in other disease areas where nerve conduction is also a problem, and there's a fair number of those. So I think you've got a big opportunity in MS and a bigger opportunity, potentially, in some other similar diseases. Al, you got any though on that ?"

I'm pleased to report that in 2009, Biogen Idec once again delivered strong financial and operational results. For the full-year 2009, total revenue increased 7% to $4.4 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 13% to $4.12 and the business generated $1.1 billion of cash. The 13% non-GAAP EPS growth marks six  consecutive years of double-digit EPS, which increase as the date back to the merger between Biogen and Idec in 2003. On the operational side, I'm also pleased to announce a very successful year. With $1.1 billion of in-market net sales in 2009, TYSABRI is officially a blockbuster. I'm especially proud of this accomplishment when you take a step back and consider the voluntary market withdrawal in 2005. Think about this, a product that was taken off the market is now generating over $1 billion in annual revenue and is still growing. Furthermore, we've made significant progress in our understanding of PML risk and the opportunities to stratify that risk. And I attribute these accomplishments to both TYSABRI's potent efficacy, positive risk-benefit profile and a very committed team of Biogen Idec employees who are justifiably proud of their accomplishments but at the same time are aware that there is still more work to be done.During 2009, we also took steps to extend the durability of our core interferon franchise. The therapy is now protected until 2026 by virtue of a newly-issued method-of-use patent. In addition, we advanced PEGylated interferon into registrational trials. PEGylated interferon has the potential to reinforce AVONEX's advantage and improve on convenience.  With an eye on revigorating [ph] our efforts to restore AVONEX's market leadership, in Q4 we also announced some new additions to our commercial leadership team. Bob Hamm will talk about these new leaders later.Biogen Idec's MS [multiple sclerosis] pipeline is deeper and more complete than ever before. We now have first-in-class or best-in-class therapies that have the potential to address a full spectrum of patient needs. Our strategy has been to slow, stop and reverse MS and we've assembled a collection of products and development programs designed to do just that.During 2009, our R&D organization filed for European and Canadian regulatory approval of Fampridine well ahead of plan. And we initiated two pivotal trials, three Phase II trials, two Phase I trials and four R to D [research to development] transitions, all while continuing to manage 90 trials for 31 compounds with over 14,000 patients in more than 45 countries. Finally, we have a strong balance sheet and nearly $100 million in free cash flow monthly. This is allowing us the flexibility to both return cash to our shareholders and continue to invest in future growth both internally and externally.Before we turn the call over to Al Sandrock for an update on R&D, let me address the topic I'm sure you're interested in, the board's search for my successor. The board has formed a CEO search committee headed by Director Brian Posner, which also includes Chairman Bill Young and Directors Alex Denner and Bruce Ross. The committee is working diligently with a leading search firm, Spencer Stuart. The process is underway, but as you can understand, beyond that, we're not going to comment on this call today. I'll now hand the call to Dr. Al Sandrock, our Senior Vice President, Neurology Research and Development. Al?"

I'd like to begin by welcoming some new additions to the Neurology R&D and Medical Affairs team to Biogen Idec. You’ve probably already seen the announcements but let me take a moment to tell you about each person. Dr. John Richert joins us from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, where he served as Executive Vice President for Research and Clinical Programs for the past five years. Prior to that, John was at Georgetown University where he was Professor and Chair in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Professor of Neurology and Founder of the University's MS Clinic. Dr. Frederick Munschauer joins us from The State University of New York at Buffalo School of Medicine, where he was the Irvin & Rosemary Smith Professor in the Department of Neurology and Chair of the Department of Neurology. Dr. Nancy Richert, an expert in neuroimaging, joins us from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, where she served as a staff clinician in the Neuroimmunology Branch. And Dr. Doug Kerr, an expert on transverse myelitis and MS, joins us from Johns Hopkins where he was Associate Professor of Neurology. We are extremely excited to add these distinguished leaders of the multiple sclerosis community to the Biogen Idec team.I'd like to begin now with an update of our pipeline starting with one of my favorite programs. I'm very pleased to report that in January, we initiated a Phase I trial of our fully-human anti-LINGO-1 monoclonal antibody. This is especially exciting for us because most of the biology of LINGO-1 was elucidated in Biogen Idec's own research laboratories. It had been known for some time that when myelin, the insulation around nerve fibers, is damaged by diseases such as multiple sclerosis, neurons often lose the ability to transmit nerve impulses. And it was also known that the ability of the human central nervous system to repair myelin was limited. As reported in such publications as Nature Medicine and Nature Neuroscience, our scientists found that treatment with anti-LINGO-1 antibody promoted the remyelination of damaged nerve fibers when tested in various animal models of demyelination. Although current MS therapies can slow disease progression, none are designed to directly affect this repair process. As such, anti-LINGO-1  antibody represents a novel therapeutic approach in multiple sclerosis. Another new technology that we advanced into development last quarter was our bispecific antibody targeting TNF-alpha [tumor necrosis factor-alpha] and TWEAK. With this novel bispecific antibody design, which was also a pioneer by Biogen Idex scientists, we can simultaneously bind TNF-alpha and TWEAK with high affinity while retaining many of the desired properties of traditional monoclonal antibodies, including a long circulating half-life and ease of production.  Simultaneous inhibition of the TNF-alpha and TWEAK pathways offers the potential to more effectively block imflammatory, pathologies and auto-immune diseases. Now an update on our blood factor programs. In December, with our partners Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, we announced that our Factor VIII product for hemophilia A moved into clinical trials, making ours the only long-acting Factor VIII compound in clinical trials. In January, we announced that our Factor IX products for hemophilia B moved into a registrational trial making ours the first long-acting Factor IX compound to reach this milestone. The chase for innovating in hemophilia is strong, where the only treatment options are those with relatively short half-lives, requiring between 100 and 150 infusions per year. Our products substantially increased half-life, which offers the hope that the hemophilia patients would need to receive 50 or fewer infusions per year. We will present the results of our Phase I, II Factor IX study at an upcoming medical meeting. As you may already know, Biogen Idec regularly reviews and adjusts its pipeline as scientific, market or regulatory conditions change. In accordance with this process, we reviewed the data for inventory and determined that the results are not supportive of continuing either the oral or the IV program. The efficacy and safety data from our TRIDENT trial analyzed to date suggest a beneficial effect on symptoms without a positive impact on clinical morbidity or mortality outcomes. These results are consistent with recent Phase III results from Merck's rolofylline program in acute decompensated heart failure.Now let me take a moment to provide an update on TYSABRI. When we introduced TYSABRI in July of 2006, you will recall that we set out to answer three questions about PML in TYSABRI-treated patients: Who is at risk, what is the risk and how can we mitigate the risk. With the start of the new year, I thought it would be a good time to revisit the progress we've made in answering these questions. I'll begin with what we know about the risk. During our Q3 earnings call, I announced that we had initiated conversations with regulators worldwide about updating the TYSABRI product label as we began to believe that the risk of PML increases with the length of time on therapy. In the U.S., we updated the label to include language stating that in patients treated with TYSABRI, the risk of developing PML increases the longer treatment duration, and that per patients treated for 24 to 36 months, the risk is generally similar to the rate seen in clinical trials. There is limited experience beyond three years. As recently as last Friday, February 5, the FDA reaffirmed that it believes that the clinical benefits of TYSABRI continues to outweigh the potential risks. On January 21, the European Medicines Agency announced that they had finalized a review of TYSABRI and the risk of PML. The agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use [CHMP] concluded that the risk of developing PML increases after two years of use of TYSABRI, although this risk remains low. The committee also reaffirmed its position that TYSABRI benefits continue to outweigh its risks for patients with highly active relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis [RRMS] for whom there are few treatment options available. We expect the TYSABRI label in the EU will be revised to reflect the committee's conclusions. We continue to explore avenues for stratifying risk. One key area of focus is on the development of a serological assay to detect the presence of JC virus [JCV] antibody. We are currently planning to initiate clinical studies to determine whether antibody-negative patients are at lower risk for PML. Our aim is to make these studies widely accessible to TYSABRI patients worldwide.Risk mitigation efforts have also continued. When TYSABRI was introduced, the expectation was that PML was usually fatal. This assumption was largely based on outcomes seen in the HIV-AIDS population. It is still too early to draw firm conclusions, but so far, survival rates have been approximately 75%. We believe that clinical vigilance combined with rapid action, including the ability to shut off the activity of natalizumab by timely dose suspension of plasma exchange, have contributed to improve the outcomes. We will continue to put considerable resources into PML research to further refine ways of identifying who is at risk for this rare event and to provide other approaches that could improve patient outcomes. A final note on TYSABRI's efficacy. Based on the data coming from our clinical trials, the real-world observations from various studies and registries around the world, as well as the uplifting stories we hear from many patients, we believe strongly in the benefit that TYSABRI can offer many patients with multiple sclerosis. While PML seems to get all the headlines, we think TYSABRI's efficacy is a story that also needs to be reinforced. To that end, last month, we announced our decision to launch a head-to-head trial of TYSABRI versus Copaxone and Rebif, a trial we call SURPASS. SURPASS has a target enrollment of 1,800 patients at 230 sites worldwide. As such, it will be largest well-controlled comparative trial of MS treatments ever undertaken. As you know, many neurologists currently witch patients from one ABCR therapy to another and they do this without any clinical trial evidence that has evaluated the utility of this approach. The SURPASS study will be the first trial to provide Class 1 data on whether who are not feeling well on first-line therapies are better off if they switched to TYSABRI versus waiting to switch or switching among the ABCR therapies. We expect the study to be completed in 2013. I will now pass the call over to Bob Hamm, our Chief Operating Officer."

For",1073,"Thank you, Al. In the fourth quarter, AVONEX, TYSABRI and RITUXAN generated combined worldwide revenue to Biogen Idec of $1.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year, with continued growth in our core MS business offsetting a modest decline in RITUXAN revenues. For the year, this product revenue totaled $4.2 billion, which represents 7% growth versus 2008. As Jim mentioned, TYSABRI achieved blockbuster status in its fourth year, exceeding $1 billion in sales with 30% growth in both end-market sales and patients. Our durable AVONEX franchise, now in its 14th year in the market, delivered 5% revenue growth. In January, we installed new commercial leadership. Dr. Francesco Granata joined Biogen Idec to lead our commercial organization and our Global Medical Affairs team. Dr. Granata is a trained MD who previously held executive commercial leadership positions at Schering-Plough, Pharmacia and Pfizer. Joining Dr. Granata as Head of U.S. business is Tony Kingsley, an entrepreneurial leader who previously held senior operational management positions at Hologic and Cytyc. Together, Francesco and Tony's focus during 2010 will be on reenergizing our U.S. AVONEX business and continuing to drive TYSABRI adoption. I will now provide more detail on each franchise individually. TYSABRI finished 2009 with over 48,000 patients on therapy worldwide. In the U.S., the number of patients grew by 21%. Outside the U.S., the number of patients grew by 40%. The higher growth rate outside the U.S. was in part fueled by geographic expansion. During 2009, we launched TYSABRI in seven countries, bringing the total number of countries where TYSABRI is sold to 45. AVONEX is currently available in over 70 countries, so we still have plenty of room to continue to expand. We anticipate making TYSABRI available in five or six additional countries in Latin America and Central Europe during 2010.No doubt, much of the interest in TYSABRI is due to its efficacy, having demonstrated a 42% to 54% reduction in disability progression, a 68% reduction in relapse rate and five times as many patients free of disease activity versus placebo. Doctors and patients appear to be taking TYSABRI efficacy into account when weighing TYSABRI's benefit and risks. In Q4, we updated TYSABRI's label information to include a duration effect following two years of treatment. Response to this news, so far, appears to be measured. Worldwide, TYSABRI grew by an average of 867 patients net per month during Q4, which is somewhat lower than during the second and third quarters, but still about 24% above the same period, prior year. We have yet to see a meaningful change in discontinuation trends. As of December, we estimate that less than 10% of U.S. neurologists had ever prescribed TYSABRI drug suspension, and less than 5% of TYSABRI patients were currently on a drug suspension. For patients with few options other than TYSABRI, the risk of PML even after 24 months remains low while the risk of debilitating MS progression without TYSABRI is high. Potential competitors to TYSABRI are on the horizon. And for competitive reasons, I'm not going to go into detail on our commercial preparation for these nascent therapies. But I can say this, we are quite confident in the appeal TYSABRI's benefit-risk equation has for many MS patients. In fact, advances in MS therapy such as TYSABRI are changing the way that many patients view and manage their disease. In January, we launched a customized yoga program called My MS Yoga for people with MS. This program was developed with a top MS specialist, Dr. Elliot Frohman, and world-renowned yoga instructor, Baron Baptiste. The video features TYSABRI patients who are all proactively managing their disease through exercise and treatment. This program has had significant pick-up in the national and local media, including a high-profile piece on Good Morning America Health. In the first three weeks since launch, over 4,600 patients had visited mymsyoga.com to learn more about the program, and over 1,200 patients have taken advantage of the free My MS Yoga DVD. Now an update on AVONEX. The franchise generated $596 million  in global revenue during the fourth quarter of 2009 and $2.3 billion for the year, both an increase of 5% year-over-year. With approximately 137,000 patients on therapy worldwide, and 16 years of remaining patent life, AVONEX continues on as a strong and durable foundation to our market-leading franchise in neurology. RITUXAN Q4 revenues for Biogen Idec were $257 million, down 15% year-over-year. This decline was driven primarily by the continued expiration of royalties on the revenues outside of the United States, off 44% versus 2008. Also in the U.S., our Q4 profit share declined by 7%. As Reuters reported last week, this was due to a reduction in wholesaler inventory. For the year, RITUXAN revenues to Biogen Idec were $1.1 billion, down 3% year-over-year due to a 24% decline in royalties on sales outside the U.S.Now looking towards the future, let's turn to our next anticipated product launch in MS. As Jim mentioned, we field for regulatory approval of Fampridine in December ahead of schedule in Europe and Canada. In the U.S., where Fampridine is developed and commercialized by Acorda Therapeutics, the FDA recently approved the drug as AMPYRA extended-release tablets. It's the first therapy indicated in the U.S. to improve walking in patients with MS. This was demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. Biogen has established a focus team that has initiated the launch preparations for expected approval outside the U.S. in the first half of 2011. Much of our neurology sales and marketing infrastructure is already in place, given our market-leading position in most countries outside the U.S. Fampridine will fit very nicely into that infrastructure. Our commercial efforts are primarily focused on pharma co-economic research at this stage. In parallel, our supply-chain team is preparing to enable appropriate compassionate-use programs and name patients' supply. Biogen Idec is excited to bring this new therapy to MS patients outside of the U.S. Fampridine demonstrated efficacy in people with all four major types of MS: Relapsing/remitting, secondary progressive, progressive relapsing and primary progressive. And it can be used alone or with existing MS therapies. In short, Fampridine's launch outside the U.S. provides us an opportunity to offer therapies to an even broader community of MS patients, a goal that fits wholly with our mission to create new standards of curing neurology through our global commercial and medical capabilities. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."

Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between the GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter were $56 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles and $7 million from fully stock options, offset by a $24 million tax impact on these items. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.06 in Q4 and $3.35 for the full year. Now I'll move onto the non-GAAP P&L operating performance for Biogen Idec, which we believe, better represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business internally. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.20 for Q4 and $4.12 for full year 2009. In the fourth quarter, we benefited by $0.12 earnings per share due to one-time discrete tax benefits that I'll detail later in the call. Now let's move to the fourth quarter and full-year results in a bit more of detail. Total revenue for the fourth quarter 2009 was $1.1 billion, 5% growth over fourth quarter 2008. Revenue for the full-year 2009 totaled approximately $4.4 billion, which represents a 7% growth over full-year 2008. Q4 2009 product revenue was $827 million, a 13% growth over Q4 2008. And full-year 2009 product revenue totaled $3.2 billion, an 11% growth over full-year 2008. Going through our product revenues, I'll begin with AVONEX. Q4 AVONEX worldwide product revenue was $596 million, a 5% increase over Q4 of 2008. Worldwide AVONEX revenue for full-year 2009 totaled approximately $2.3 billion, also a 5% growth. U.S. AVONEX product revenue in the fourth quarter was $352 million, a 3% increase over Q4 2008. U.S. AVONEX revenue for the full year totaled $1.4 billion, which represents a 10% growth over full-year 2008. U.S. AVONEX inventory ended at just over two weeks in the fourth quarter, unchanged from the third quarter. In Q4 2009, units sold in the U.S. declined approximately 7% as compared to Q4 2008. This was offset by price increases. On a sequential basis, Q3 to Q4 U.S. AVONEX units declined by approximately 1%. Q4 international AVONEX product revenue was $244 million, a 9% increase over Q4 2008. On a sequential basis, AVONEX international revenues increased by 6% as compared to Q3, driven by higher volume. Foreign exchange, net of hedge, accounted for 2% of the increase. International AVONEX revenue for the full year 2009 totaled $917 million, a 1% year-over-year decline. The full year AVONEX international AVONEX revenue was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange and hedging, which reduced revenue by $88 million or approximately 10%. This was offset by unit increases of approximately 6% and favorable price and mix impact of 2%.Q4 TYSABRI worldwide product sales were $216 million per Biogen Idec, a 39% increase over Q4 2008. TYSABRI worldwide revenue for full-year 2009 totaled $776 million  for Biogen Idec, a 32% increase over full-year 2008. In the U.S., end-market TYSABRI sales totaled $137 million for the fourth quarter. Q4 U.S. TYSABRI product revenue for Biogen Idec was the $62 million. U.S. end-user end-market TYSABRI sales for the full-year 2009 totaled $509 million, a 21% increase over 2008. Biogen Idec booked $232 million for full year 2009.Q4 international TYSABRI product revenue was $154 million, a 49% increase over Q4 2008. In international, TYSABRI revenue for full year 2009 totaled $544 million, a 39% year-over-year increase. Foreign-exchange reduced international TYSABRI revenue by approximately $29 million for full year 2009 or 5%.  Q4 perimeter revenue was $14 million.  Now I'll move on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues to as revenue from unconsolidated joint business. We recorded $257 million in revenue for the quarter, representing a decrease of 15% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue for the full year decreased 3% to $1.1 billion as compared to full-year 2008. Our RITUXAN revenues are broken down into three components. First, our share of the net U.S. RITUXAN profits. Net U.S. RITUXAN sales were $658 million in the fourth quarter, down 3% versus prior year, and as Bob noted, was own partly due to destocking in the channel. Our Q4 2009 profit share from that business was $192 million, down 7% versus prior year. Full-year 2009 U.S. RITUXAN sales were $2,666,000,  up 3% as compared to full year profit share 2008. And our profit share from that business was $774 million, up 5% as compared to full-year 2008. Year-over-year profit share benefited from price increases and lower operating expenses in the collaboration. Second, we received revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. And in Q4, this was $46 million, down 44% versus Q4 2008, as royalties from individual countries have expired. Revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. for the full year was $256 million, down 24% as compared to full year 2008. We expect for 2010  the rest-of-the-world revenues from Rituximab to be approximately $120 million to $130 million, depending on the exchange rates. Third, in the fourth quarter we reimbursed $18 million for selling and development cost incurred related to RITUXAN. For the full year 2009, we reimbursed it $66 million. Royalty revenue were $41 million for fourth quarter 2009 and $124 million for the year.Now turning to the expense line on the non-GAAP P&L, Q4 COGS were $100 million or 9% of revenues. Q4 R&D expense was $279 million, 24% of revenues. R&D spend for the full year totaled $1.3 billion, approximately 29% of revenues and an increase of 20% on a year-over-year basis. This was owed largely to $110 million payment we made to Acorda Therapeutics in the first half of 2009. Q4 SG&A expense was $236 million, a 5% increase year-over-year. This represents 21% of revenues. Drivers of the year-over-year increase included investments that support the MS franchise and the ongoing geographic expansion of our commercial operations. Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit-sharing line totaled $63 million in expense for the quarter. Other income and expense for the quarter was a gain of $6 million driven by net interest income and a realized gains on strategic investments.Let me now share the progress we've made with respect to our share repurchase program. On our last earnings call, we announced that in October 2009, the Board of Directors had authorized the share-repurchase program of up to $1 billion of common stock, intended to reduce our shares outstanding with the objective of returning cash to shareholders. This program was in addition to the previously approved 20 million share-repurchase program authorized in October 2006, which has always been a mark for share stabilization. In the fourth quarter 2009, we made solid progress on our share repurchase programs, purchasing 14.8 million shares of stock at a total cost of approximately $694 million. Repurchases have continued in the first quarter of 2010 through February 5, whereby we've repurchased an additional 5.4 million shares for a total cost of $289 million. Net-net since October 2009 through February 5, 2010, we've purchased approximately 20.2 million shares for a total cost of $983 million. Our cash and marketable securities position remains strong. We ended the year at $2.5 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24%, which benefited from multiple discrete events. Specifically, in the fourth quarter, we effectively resolved previously-outstanding tax audits across multiple years on both the federal and state level. For the full year 2009, our tax rate was approximately 27%, reflecting these benefits, offset by the negative impact from the Acorda transaction being entered into by an ex-U.S. affiliate. As we look into 2010,  I expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be the 28% to 29% range. This does not include the R&D tax credit which currently has not been reinstated. This brings us to our Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.20 and our full-year non-GAAP EPS, $4.12, representing a 13% increase over full year 2008. Now I'd like to provide our 2010 guidance. Revenue growth in 2010 is expected to be in the mid-single digits. This includes the expected decline of rituximab rest of the world revenues. Core operating expense growth is expected to be in the low single digits. R&D expense is expected to be approximately 24% to 27% of revenue, excluding any new business development expense. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 22% of revenue, the high end of this range reflects investments we may be making in our brands in light of the competitive landscape. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be above $3.71. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be above $4.55, striving towards another double-digit earnings growth year. We expect capital expenditures in the range of $170  million to $200 million. So in conclusion, 2009, it was a solid top and bottom line result. Our total revenue grew by 7% for the full year, product revenue grew by 11%. TYSABRI surpassed $1 billion  in sales. Our non-GAAP  earnings per share grew by 13%. Our cash flow is strong and we made solid progress against our $1 billion  share purchase plan returning cash to shareholders. Now, I'll hand the call over to Jim for his closing comments."

I'm pleased to report that in 2009, Biogen Idec once again delivered strong financial and operational results. For the full year 2009, total revenue increased 7% to $4.4 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 13% to $4.12, and the business generated $1.1 billion of cash. The 13% non-GAAP EPS growth marks six  consecutive years of double-digit EPS, which increases [ph] date back to the merger between Biogen and Idec in 2003. On the operational side, I'm also pleased to announce a very successful year. With $1.1 billion of in-market net sales in 2009, TYSABRI is officially a blockbuster. I'm especially proud of this accomplishment when you take a step back and consider the voluntary market withdrawal in 2005. Think about this, a product that was taken off the market is now generating over $1 billion in annual revenue and is still growing. Furthermore, we've made significant progress in our understanding of PML risk and the opportunities to stratify that risk. And I attribute these accomplishments to both TYSABRI's potent efficacy, positive risk-benefit profile and a very committed team of Biogen Idec employees, who are justifiably proud of their accomplishments, but at the same time are aware that there is still more work to be done.During 2009, we also took steps to extend the durability of our core interferon franchise. The therapy is now protected until 2026 by virtue of a newly-issued method-of-use patent. In addition, we advanced PEGylated interferon into registrational trials. PEGylated interferon has the potential to reinforce AVONEX's advantage and improve on convenience. With an eye on revigorating [ph] our efforts to restore AVONEX's market leadership, in Q4 we also announced some new additions to our commercial leadership team. Bob Hamm will talk about these new leaders later.Biogen Idec's MS [multiple sclerosis] pipeline is deeper and more complete than ever before. We now have first-in-class or best-in-class therapies that have the potential to address a full spectrum of patient needs. Our strategy has been to slow, stop and reverse MS, and we've assembled a collection of products and development programs designed to do just that.During 2009, our R&D organization filed for European and Canadian regulatory approval of Fampridine, well ahead of plan. And we initiated two pivotal trials, three Phase II trials, two Phase I trials and four R to D [research to development] transitions, all while continuing to manage 90 trials for 31 compounds with over 14,000 patients in more than 45 countries. Finally, we have a strong balance sheet and nearly $100 million in free cash flow monthly. This is allowing us the flexibility to both return cash to our shareholders and continue to invest in future growth both internally and externally.Before we turn the call over to Al Sandrock for an update on R&D, let me address the topic I'm sure you're interested in, the board's search for my successor. The board has formed a CEO search committee headed by Director Brian Posner, which also includes Chairman Bill Young and Directors Alex Denner and Bruce Ross. The committee is working diligently with a leading search firm, Spencer Stuart. The process is underway, but as you can understand, beyond that, we're not going to comment on this call today. I'll now hand the call to Dr. Al Sandrock, our Senior Vice President, Neurology Research and Development. Al?"

I'd like to begin by welcoming some new additions to the Neurology R&D and Medical Affairs teams with Biogen Idec. You’ve probably already seen the announcements, but let me take a moment to tell you about each person. Dr. John Richert joins us from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, where he served as Executive Vice President for Research and Clinical Programs for the past five years. Prior to that, John was at Georgetown University, where he was Professor and Chair in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Professor of Neurology and Founder of the University's MS Clinic. Dr. Frederick Munschauer joins us from The State University of New York at Buffalo School of Medicine, where he was the Irvin & Rosemary Smith Professor in the Department of Neurology and Chair of the Department of Neurology. Dr. Nancy Richert, an expert in neuroimaging, joins us from the National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke (sic) [National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke], where she served as a staff clinician in the Neuroimmunology Branch. And Dr. Doug Kerr, an expert on transverse myelitis and MS, joins us from Johns Hopkins, where he was Associate Professor of Neurology. We are extremely excited to add these distinguished leaders of the multiple sclerosis community to the Biogen Idec team.I'd like to begin now with an update of our pipeline, starting with one of my favorite programs. I'm very pleased to report that in January, we initiated a Phase I trial of our fully-human anti-LINGO-1 monoclonal antibody. This is especially exciting for us because most of the biology of LINGO-1 was elucidated in Biogen Idec's own research laboratories. It had been known for some time that when myelin, the insulation around nerve fibers, is damaged by diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, neurons often lose the ability to transmit nerve impulses. And it was also known that the ability of the human central nervous system to repair myelin was limited. As reported in such publications as Nature Medicine and Nature Neuroscience, our scientists found that treatment with anti-LINGO-1 antibody promoted the remyelination of damaged nerve fibers when tested in various animal models of demyelination. Although current MS therapies can slow disease progression, none are designed to directly affect this repair process. As such, anti-LINGO-1 antibody represents a novel therapeutic approach in multiple sclerosis. Another new technology that we advanced into development last quarter was our bispecific antibody targeting TNF-alpha [tumor necrosis factor-alpha] and TWEAK. With this novel bispecific antibody design, which was also a pioneer by Biogen Idec's scientists, we can simultaneously bind TNF-alpha and TWEAK with high affinity, while retaining many of the desired properties of traditional monoclonal antibodies, including a long circulating half-life and ease of production.  Simultaneous inhibition of the TNF-alpha and TWEAK pathways offers the potential to more effectively block imflammatory, pathologies and autoimmune diseases. Now an update on our blood factor programs. In December, with our partner, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, we announced that our Factor VIII product for hemophilia A moved into clinical trials, making ours the only long-acting Factor VIII compound in clinical trials. In January, we announced that our Factor IX product for hemophilia B moved into a registrational trial, making ours the first long-acting Factor IX compound to reach this milestone. The case for innovating in hemophilia is strong, where the only treatment options are those with relatively short half-lives, requiring between 100 and 150 infusions per year. Our products substantially increased the half-life, which offers the hope that hemophilia patients would need to receive 50 or fewer infusions per year. We will present the results of our Phase I/II Factor IX study at an upcoming medical meeting. As you may already know, Biogen Idec regularly reviews and adjusts its pipeline as scientific, market or regulatory conditions change. In accordance with this process, we reviewed the data for inventory and determined that the results are not supportive of continuing either the oral or the IV program. The efficacy and safety data from our TRIDENT trial analyzed to date suggest a beneficial effect on symptoms without a positive impact on clinical morbidity or mortality outcomes. These results are consistent with recent Phase III results from Merck's rolofylline program in acute decompensated heart failure.Now, let me take a moment to provide an update on TYSABRI. When we reintroduced TYSABRI in July of 2006, you will recall that we set out to answer three questions about PML in TYSABRI-treated patients: Who is at risk, what is the risk, and how can we mitigate the risk. With the start of the new year, I thought it would be a good time to revisit the progress we've made in answering these questions. I'll begin with what we know about the risk. During our Q3 earnings call, I announced that we had initiated conversations with regulators worldwide about updating the TYSABRI product label, as we began to believe that the risk of PML increases with the length of time on therapy. In the U.S., we updated the label to include language stating that in patients treated with TYSABRI, the risk of developing PML increases with longer treatment duration, and that for patients treated for 24 to 36 months, the risk is generally similar to the rates seen in clinical trials. There is limited experience beyond three years. As recently as last Friday, February 5, the FDA reaffirmed that it believes that the clinical benefits of TYSABRI continue to outweigh the potential risks. On January 21, the European Medicines Agency announced that they had finalized a review of TYSABRI and the risk of PML. The agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use [CHMP] concluded that the risk of developing PML increases after two years of use of TYSABRI, although this risk remains low. The committee also reaffirmed its position that TYSABRI's benefits continue to outweigh its risks for patients with highly active relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis [RRMS], for whom there are few treatment options available. We expect that the TYSABRI label in the EU will be revised to reflect the committee's conclusions. We continue to explore avenues for stratifying risk. One key area of focus is on the development of a serological assay to detect the presence of JC virus [JCV] antibody. We are currently planning to initiate clinical studies to determine whether antibody-negative patients are at lower risk for PML. Our aim is to make these studies widely accessible to TYSABRI patients worldwide.Risk mitigation efforts have also continued. When TYSABRI was introduced, the expectation was that PML was usually fatal. This assumption was largely based on outcomes seen in the HIV-AIDS population. It is still too early to draw firm conclusions, but so far, survival rates have been approximately 75%. We believe that clinical vigilance, combined with rapid action, including the ability to shut off the activity of natalizumab by timely dose suspension and plasma exchange, have contributed to improve the outcome. We will continue to put considerable resources into PML research to further refine ways of identifying who is at risk for this rare event and to provide other approaches that could improve patient outcome. A final note on TYSABRI's efficacy. Based on the data coming from our clinical trials, the real-world observations from various studies and registries around the world, as well as the uplifting stories we hear from many patients, we believe strongly in the benefit that TYSABRI can offer many patients with multiple sclerosis. While PML seems to get all the headlines, we think TYSABRI's efficacy is a story that also needs to be reinforced. To that end, last month, we announced our decision to launch a head-to-head trial of TYSABRI versus Copaxone and Rebif, a trial we call SURPASS. SURPASS has a target enrollment of 1,800 patients at 230 sites worldwide. As such, it will be the largest, well-controlled comparative trial of MS treatments ever undertaken. As you know, many neurologists currently switch patients from one ABCR therapy to another, and they do this without any clinical trial evidence that has evaluated the utility of this approach. The SURPASS study will be the first trial to provide Class 1 data on whether patients who are not feeling well on first-line therapies are better off if they switched to TYSABRI, versus waiting to switch or switching among the ABCR therapies. We expect the study to be completed in 2013. I will now pass the call over to Bob Hamm, our Chief Operating Officer."

In the fourth quarter, AVONEX, TYSABRI and RITUXAN generated combined worldwide revenue for Biogen Idec of $1.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year, with continued growth in our core MS business, offsetting a modest decline in RITUXAN revenues. F",1077,"Thank you, Al. In the fourth quarter, AVONEX, TYSABRI and RITUXAN generated combined worldwide revenue for Biogen Idec of $1.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year, with continued growth in our core MS business, offsetting a modest decline in RITUXAN revenues. For the year, this product revenue totaled $4.2 billion, which represents 7% growth versus 2008. As Jim mentioned, TYSABRI achieved blockbuster status in its fourth year, exceeding $1 billion in sales with 30% growth in both end-market sales and patients. Our durable AVONEX franchise, now in its 14th year in the market, delivered 5% revenue growth. In January, we installed new commercial leadership. Dr. Francesco Granata joined Biogen Idec to lead our global commercial organization and our global medical affairs team. Dr. Granata is a trained MD, who previously held executive commercial leadership positions at Schering-Plough, Pharmacia and Pfizer. Joining Dr. Granata as Head of U.S. Business is Tony Kingsley, an entrepreneurial leader, who previously held senior operational management positions at Hologic and Cytyc. Together, Francesco and Tony's focus during 2010 will be on reenergizing our U.S. AVONEX business and continuing to drive TYSABRI adoption. I will now provide more detail on each franchise, individually. TYSABRI finished 2009 with over 48,000 patients on therapy worldwide. In the U.S., the number of patients grew by 21%. Outside the U.S., the number of patients grew by 40%. The higher growth rate outside the U.S. was in part fueled by geographic expansion. During 2009, we launched TYSABRI in seven countries, bringing the total number of countries where TYSABRI is sold to 45. AVONEX is currently available in over 70 countries, so we still have plenty of room to continue to expand. We anticipate making TYSABRI available in five or six additional countries in Latin America and Central Europe during 2010.No doubt, much of the interest in TYSABRI is due to its efficacy, having demonstrated a 42% to 54% reduction in disability progression, a 68% reduction in relapse rate and five times as many patients free of disease activity versus placebo. Doctors and patients appear to be taking TYSABRI efficacy into account when weighing TYSABRI's benefit and risks. In Q4, we updated TYSABRI's label information to include a duration effect, following two years of treatment. Response to this news, so far, appears to be measured. Worldwide, TYSABRI grew by an average of 867 patients net per month during Q4, which is somewhat lower than during the second and third quarters, but still about 24% above the same period, prior year. We have yet to see a meaningful change in discontinuation trends. As of December, we estimate that less than 10% of U.S. neurologists had ever prescribed TYSABRI drug suspension, and less than 5% of TYSABRI patients were currently on a drug suspension. For patients with few options other than TYSABRI, the risk of PML, even after 24 months, remains low while the risk of debilitating MS progression without TYSABRI is high. Potential competitors to TYSABRI are on the horizon. And for competitive reasons, I'm not going to go into detail on our commercial preparation for these nascent therapies. But I can say this, we are quite confident in the appeal TYSABRI's benefit-risk equation has for many MS patients. In fact, advances in MS therapy, such as TYSABRI are changing the way that many patients view and manage their disease. In January, we launched a customized yoga program called My MS Yoga for people with MS. This program was developed with a top MS specialist, Dr. Elliot Frohman, and world-renowned yoga instructor, Baron Baptiste. The video features TYSABRI patients who are all proactively managing their disease through exercise and treatment. This program has had significant pick up in the national and local media, including a high-profile piece on Good Morning America Health. In the first three weeks since launch, over 4,600 patients had visited mymsyoga.com to learn more about the program, and over 1,200 patients have taken advantage of the free My MS Yoga DVD. Now an update on AVONEX. The franchise generated $596 million  in global revenue during the fourth quarter of 2009 and $2.3 billion for the year, both an increase of 5% year-over-year. With approximately 137,000 patients on therapy worldwide, and 16 years of remaining patent life, AVONEX continues on as a strong and durable foundation to our market-leading franchise in neurology. RITUXAN Q4 revenues to Biogen Idec were $257 million, down 15% year-over-year. This decline was driven primarily by the continued expiration of royalties on the revenues outside of the United States, off 44% versus 2008. Also in the U.S., our Q4 profit share declined by 7%. As Roche reported last week, this was due to reduction in wholesaler inventory. For the year, RITUXAN revenues to Biogen Idec were $1.1 billion, down 3% year-over-year due to a 24% decline in royalties on sales outside the U.S.Now looking towards the future, let's turn to our next anticipated product launch in MS. As Jim mentioned, we filed for regulatory approval of Fampridine in December ahead of schedule in Europe and Canada. In the U.S., where Fampridine is developed and commercialized by Acorda Therapeutics, the FDA recently approved the drug as AMPYRA extended-release tablets. It's the first therapy indicated in the U.S. to improve walking in patients with MS. This was demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. Biogen has established a focused team that has initiated the launch preparations for expected approval outside the U.S. in the first half of 2011. Much of our neurology sales and marketing infrastructure is already in place, given our market-leading position in most countries outside the U.S. Fampridine will fit very nicely into that infrastructure. Our commercial efforts are primarily focused on pharmacoeconomic research at this stage. In parallel, our supply chain team is preparing to enable appropriate compassionate use programs and named patient supply. Biogen Idec is excited to bring this new therapy to MS patients outside of the U.S. Fampridine demonstrated efficacy in people with all four major types of MS: Relapsing remitting, secondary progressive, progressive relapsing and primary progressive. And it can be used alone or with existing MS therapies. In short, Fampridine's launch outside the U.S. provides us an opportunity to offer therapies to an even broader community of MS patients, a goal that fits wholly with our mission to create new standards of care in neurology through our global commercial and medical capabilities. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."

I'll view our 2009 fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Additionally, I'll provide our 2010 financial guidance. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between the GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter were $56 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles and $7 million from fully stock options, offset by a $24 million tax impact on these items. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.06 in Q4 and $3.35 for the full year. Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP P&L operating performance for Biogen Idec, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business internally. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.20 for Q4 and $4.12 for full year 2009. In the fourth quarter, we benefited by $0.12 earnings per share to one-time discrete tax benefits that I'll detail later in the call. Now let's move to the fourth quarter and full-year results in a bit more detail. Total revenue for the fourth quarter 2009 was $1.1 billion, 5% growth over fourth quarter 2008. Revenue for the full year 2009 totaled approximately $4.4 billion, which represents a 7% growth over full year 2008. Q4 2009 product revenue was $827 million, a 13% growth over Q4 2008. And full-year 2009 product revenue totaled $3.2 billion, an 11% growth over full year 2008. Going through our product revenues, I'll begin with AVONEX. Q4 AVONEX worldwide product revenue was $596 million, a 5% increase over Q4 of 2008. Worldwide AVONEX revenue for full year 2009 totaled approximately $2.3 billion, also a 5% growth. U.S. AVONEX product revenue in the fourth quarter was $352 million, a 3% increase over Q4 2008. U.S. AVONEX revenue for the full year totaled $1.4 billion, which represents a 10% growth over full year 2008. U.S. AVONEX inventory ended at just over two weeks in the fourth quarter, unchanged from the third quarter. In Q4 2009, units sold in the U.S. declined approximately 7%, as compared to Q4 2008. This was offset by price increases. On a sequential basis, Q3 to Q4 U.S. AVONEX units declined by approximately 1%. Q4 international AVONEX product revenue was $244 million, a 9% increase over Q4 2008. On a sequential basis, AVONEX international revenues increased by 6%, as compared to Q3, driven by higher volume. Foreign exchange, net of hedge, accounted for 2% of the increase. International AVONEX revenue for the full year 2009 totaled $917 million, a 1% year-over-year decline. The full year international AVONEX revenue was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange and hedging, which reduced revenue by $88 million or approximately 10%. This was offset by unit increases of approximately 6% and favorable price and mix impact of 2%.Q4 TYSABRI worldwide product sales were $216 million for per Biogen Idec, a 39% increase over Q4 2008. TYSABRI worldwide revenue for full year 2009 totaled $776 million for Biogen Idec, a 32% increase over full year 2008. In the U.S., end-market TYSABRI sales totaled $137 million for the fourth quarter. Q4 U.S. TYSABRI product revenue for Biogen Idec was the $62 million. U.S. end-user end-market TYSABRI sales for the full year 2009 totaled $509 million, a 21% increase over 2008. Biogen Idec booked $232 million for full year 2009.Q4 international TYSABRI product revenue was $154 million, a 49% increase over Q4 2008. In international, TYSABRI revenue for full year 2009 totaled $544 million, a 39% year-over-year increase. Foreign exchange reduced international TYSABRI revenue by approximately $29 million for full year 2009 or 5%.  Q4 perimeter [ph] revenue was $14 million. Now, I'll move on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues, referred to as revenue from unconsolidated joint business. We recorded $257 million in revenue for the quarter, representing a decrease of 15% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue for the full year decreased 3% to $1.1 billion as compared to full year 2008. Our RITUXAN revenues are broken down into three components. First, our share of the net U.S. RITUXAN profits. Net U.S. RITUXAN sales were $658 million in the fourth quarter, down 3% versus prior year, and as Bob noted, was own partly due to destocking in the channel. Our Q4 2009 profit share from that business was $192 million, down 7% versus prior year. Full year 2009 U.S. RITUXAN sales were $2,666,000,000, up 3% as compared to full year 2008. And our profit share from that business was $774 million, up 5% as compared to full year 2008. Year-over-year profit share benefited from price increases and lower operating expenses in the collaboration. Second, we received revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. And in Q4, this was $46 million, down 44% versus Q4 2008, as royalties from individual countries have expired. Revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. for the full year was $256 million, down 24% as compared to full year 2008. We expect for 2010  the rest-of-the-world revenues from Rituximab to be approximately $120 million to $130 million, depending on exchange rates. Third, in the fourth quarter, we reimbursed $18 million for selling and development cost incurred related to RITUXAN. For the full year 2009, we reimbursed $66 million. Royalty revenue were $41 million for fourth quarter 2009 and $124 million for the year.Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q4 COGS were $100 million or 9% of revenues. Q4 R&D expense was $279 million, 24% of revenues. R&D spend for the full year totaled $1.3 billion, approximately 29% of revenues and an increase of 20% on a year-over-year basis. This was owed largely to $110 million payment we made to Acorda Therapeutics in the first half of 2009. Q4 SG&A expense was $236 million, a 5% increase year-over-year. This represents 21% of revenues. Drivers of the year-over-year increase included investments that support the MS franchise and the ongoing geographic expansion of our commercial operations. Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit-sharing line totaled $63 million in expense for the quarter. Other [ph] income and expense for the quarter was a gain of $6 million driven by net interest income and the realized gains on the strategic investments.Let me now share the progress we've made with respect to our share repurchase program. On our last earnings call, we announced that in October 2009, the Board of Directors had authorized the share repurchase program of up to $1 billion of common stock, intended to reduce our shares outstanding with the objective of returning cash to shareholders. This program was in addition to the previously approved 20 million share repurchase program, authorized in October 2006, which has always been an earmark [ph] for share stabilization. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we made solid progress on our share repurchase programs, purchasing 14.8 million shares of stock at a total cost of approximately $694 million. Repurchases have continued in the first quarter of 2010 through February 5, whereby we've repurchased an additional 5.4 million shares for a total cost of $289 million. Net-net since October 2009 through February 5, 2010, we've purchased approximately 20.2 million shares for a total cost of $983 million. Our cash and marketable securities position remain strong. We ended the year at $2.5 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24%, which benefited from multiple discrete events. Specifically, in the fourth quarter, we effectively resolved previously outstanding tax audits across multiple years on both the federal and state level. For the full year 2009, our tax rate was approximately 27%, reflecting these benefits, offset by the negative impact from the Acorda transaction being entered into by an ex-U.S. affiliate. As we look into 2010,  I expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be in the 28% to 29% range. This does not include the R&D tax credit, which currently, has not been reinstated. This brings us to our Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.20 and our full year non-GAAP EPS, $4.12, representing a 13% increase over full year 2008. Now I'd like to provide our 2010 guidance. Revenue growth in 2010 is expected to be in the mid-single digits. This includes the expected decline in Rituximab rest of the world revenues. Core operating expense growth is expected to be in the low-single digits. R&D expense is expected to be approximately 24% to 27% of revenue, excluding any new business development expense. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 22% of revenue, the high end of this range reflects investments we may be making in our brands in light of the competitive landscape. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be above $3.71. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be above $4.55, striving towards another double-digit earnings growth year. We expect capital expenditures in the range of $170  million to $200 million. So in conclusion, 2009 was a solid top and bottom line result. Our total revenue grew by 7% for the full year. Product revenue grew by 11%. TYSABRI surpassed $1 billion in sales. Our non-GAAP  earnings per share grew by 13%. Our cash flow is strong, and we made solid progress against our $1 billion share purchase plan, returning cash to shareholders. Now, I'll hand the call over to Jim for his closing comments."

So we're in an enviable position that we ended the year with $2.5 billion of cash. 2010 looks like another robust year with respect to cash flow generation, and we will continue to be challenged with this strategic question of looking for opportunities to create value, and in doing that in a disciplined way, and if not, returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined way as well."

During the first quarter of 2010, we continue to execute on our business strategy and position the company for growth over the long term. Total revenue increased 7% on a year-over-year basis to $1.1 billion, driven by 32% year-over-year TYSABRI revenue growth. 
Two items negatively impacted first quarter: Earnings of $13 million increase in rebates mandated by the Patient Protection and Affordability Care Act; and a $14 million write-down on our investment in AVEO Pharmaceuticals. Taken together, these items reduced EPS by $0.07. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first quarter of 2010 was $1.08, an increase of 3% on a year-over-year basis. The company generated $337 million in cash flow from operations and ended the quarter with a $2.2 billion cash balance. And as of the end of March 2010, we estimated we now have more than 50,000 patients in commercial and clinical TYSABRI therapy. 
On an operational basis in the first quarter, we launched three new TYSABRI trials that surpassed the head-to-head comparative trials to determine the effect of switching from Copaxone or Rebif to TYSABRI, and STRATIFY 1 and 2 to test the utility of the JC virus antibody assay for risk stratification. These studies are the latest in the series of investments we made to clarify the benefits and risks of TYSABRI. 
We completed a share repurchase program announced in October of last year, which returned $1 billion in cash to our shareholders and received Board approval to purchase an additional 1.5 billion of shares. We continue to make significant strides in the development of our late-stage clinical pipeline. Last week, we updated the medical community on our progress of our neurology pipeline at the annual American Academy of Neurology meeting, where we presented 38 posters on our broad and deep MS pipeline.

I'd like to begin with an update of our registrational trials. We continue to make good progress on advancing and developing our late stage clinical pipeline and expect data on some of these programs as early as next year. Preparations are underway to initiate the Phase III trial of daclizumab. This is a side trial, it's a two-year study of daclizumab in RRMS patients with AVONEX as the comparator. We look forward to updating you with further details of this study. 
As previously announced, both BG-12 registrational studies DEFINE and CONFIRM have completed patient enrollment and the trials continue on plan. We expect data from DEFINE during the first half of 2011 and from CONFIRM during the second half of 2011. We continue enrolling patients in the advanced study of PEGylated interferon beta-1a and in a Phase III study of GA101 for front-line chronic lymphocytic leukemia in combination with chlorambucil. Enrollment for a second registrational trial in RITUXAN refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients is planned to start during the second quarter of 2010. Patient enrollment for  B-LONG, which is the registrational trial for a long-acting recombinant Factor IX candidate in hemophilia B continues to progress well. 
Last week, we shared important data on our neurology franchise at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting, where we demonstrated the strength and quality of our neurology pipeline with 38 company-sponsored platform and poster presentations. Nearly four years after its reintroduction in the U.S. and initial launch in the EU, we continue to demonstrate the powerful efficacy that TYSABRI offers relapsing multiple sclerosis patients. Key data presentations reinforced the growing body of evidence that TYSABRI is an important therapeutic option for patients, and may lead to overall improved  quality of life for MS patients from improvements in physical function, cognition and visual function to reduce fatigue. 
We take the issue of PML very seriously. With each case of PML, there is the potential to learn something new about this rare but serious adverse event. To this point, Dr. Rick Rudick presented data from a retrospective analysis of patients enrolled in the STRATA trial, which show that TYSABRI does not lead to substantial changes in the presence of JC viral DNA in blood or urine samples of MS patients. 
During the first quarter, we initiated three important trials related to TYSABRI, STRATIFY 1 and 2 and SURPASS. As discussed during a platform presentation at AAN, we have developed a blood test that detects antibodies to the JC virus, the virus that causes PML. The presence of the antibody to the virus suggests that a patient has been previously exposed to the JC virus. While the data are still preliminary, this assay may provide a tool for physicians to STRATIFY the risk of PML in their MS patients. To recap what we know to date, for 13 TYSABRI-treated PML patients, where we have baseline plasma samples, all 13 of them were antibody positive for one to three years before developing PML. If antibody status was not a factor for developing PML, we would only have expected six or seven to be positive based on our data that 54% of MS patients have been exposed to the virus previously. 
So our hypothesis is, that there maybe a lower risk for developing PML in TYSABRI-treated MS patients who are antibody negative. To confirm this hypothesis, we have initiated two clinical trials. STRATIFY 1 is designed to determine the percentage of the MS patient population that's positive for JC virus antibodies, as well as the false negative rates for the blood test. We expect to enroll 1,000 patients in this trial including criteria, our current TYSABRI patients enrolled in TOUCH, or patients who are not currently on TYSABRI but are considering beginning TYSABRI treatment. For this trial, we'll be testing for JC virus antibody in the blood and testing for the presence of JC virus DNA in the urine every six months for two years from the time of enrollment. 
STRATIFY 2 is designed to evaluate whether the incidence of PML in TYSABRI patients were negative for the JC virus antibodies is less than the incidence among TYSABRI patients who are positive for antibodies to JC virus. STRATIFY 2 is expected to enroll a minimum of 8,000 patients and is open to all TOUCH prescribers. In this trial, we'll be testing for the JC virus antibody only in the blood and on an annual basis for two years from their time of enrollment. Our goal is to ultimately provide neurologists and MS patients with tools to stratify risks. Our thinking here is that within the context of a clinical trial, where there's perspective analysis of the data. We have the best opportunity to validate and determine the clinical utility of this assay. Our hope is that over the long term, the JC virus assay may help physicians make better treatment decisions for MS patients. 
Moving on to SURPASS, our objective with this study is to provide a new model for making optimal treatment decisions in order to improve the outcomes of patients with MS. SURPASS will be the largest prospect of study to provide comparator data regarding the management of breakthrough disease in MS. Amongst MS specialists, there's an evolving standard of care that when a patient on first-line MS therapy presents with either clinical or MRI evidence of disease activity, modification of treatment needs to be considered. Yet, there is no evidence confirming whether switching MS therapies results in improved outcomes. In the SURPASS trial, we're enrolling MS patients initially treated with Rebif or Copaxone for at least six months, who subsequently experienced either a clinical attack or two or more new MRI lesions. Patients will then be randomized to one of three arms: The first is to continue on the initial therapy; the second, converting to the other first-line therapy; or third, converting to TYSABRI.
SURPASS has a target enrollment of 1,800 patients at 230 sites worldwide. We expect that it will provide important data on whether early identification of breakthrough disease and subsequent modifications of therapy improves patient outcomes. We expect the study to be completed in 2013. Our goal with SURPASS and the STRATIFY trials is that combined, these studies will provide physicians with powerful tools for informed treatment decisions, such as improved techniques for stratifying the risk of PML in MS patients on TYSABRI.
Now an update on the rest of our pipeline. During the first quarter, we along with our partner, Roche, decides to suspend treatment of patients in the Ocrelizumab Rheumatoid Arthritis program. This decision followed the recommendation of the independent Ocrelizumab RA & Lupus Data and Safety Monitoring Board, based on their assessment of the safety risk outweighed the benefits observed in this specific patient populations. We recently announced that the primary endpoint was met in the Phase III SCRIPT study of Ocrelizumab in the TNF-IR RA patients. The future of the Ocrelizumab RA clinical program is currently under review, as we and our partner will have to consider these recent results along with the complete safety data set. The Ocrelizumab program in relapsing remitting MS remains ongoing at this time. However, the MS Data Safety Monitoring Board will be reviewing the safety data from the RA Lupus and MS trials. We previously announced that the MS study achieved its primary endpoint, and we continue to discuss the next steps for Ocrelizumab MS program with our partner, Roche. 
Turning to oncology. As you may recall, during our third quarter earnings last year, we announced that we had stopped patient recruitment in the lumiliximab LUCID trial. We recently reviewed the data for the lumiliximab trials in both relapse in the frontline CLL and determine that the results do not support continuing the program. 
Next, an update on our blood factor programs. As we announced in January, the global registrational trial for our long-acting recombinant Factor IX candidate in hemophilia B continues to enroll patients. We plan to present results of the Phase I2 Factor IX study in July at the World Federation of Hemophilia meeting in Buenos Aires. Additionally, the Phase I2 study of our long-acting recombinant Factor VIII program is progressing well, and we expect to readout from this study later this year. 
Recombinant Factor IX Fc is the first major blood factor innovation since the development of recombinant drugs in the 1990s. We believe that our long-acting blood factor programs have the potential to significantly improve the lives of people with hemophilia and as a result, expand the hemophilia market opportunity. Recombinant Factor IX Fc offers the hope of less frequent injections and prolonged protection from bleeding compared to existing therapies. Our goal in developing the long-acting blood factor candidate is to change the treatment paradigm in hemophilia with more prophylactic usage. 
Current short-acting treatments requiring two to  three infusions per week for hemophilia B and three to four infusions per week for hemophilia A, don't lend themselves to easy prophylactic usage. While most children with severe hemophilia are already on prophylactic regiments based on the compelling outcome studies. Giving frequent IV infusions to children places a significant burden on parents. For young children, prophylactic dosing also frequently requires placement of essential catheter or port, which introduces risk of serious infection. For adults with hemophilia, episodic or on-demand treatment is more common despite the clinical benefits of prophylaxis. Recombinant Factor IX Fc has the potential to lower the hurdle for prophylactic treatment of hemophilia B in both the pediatric and adult populations. 
Looking forward, we expect to announce data readout in seven clinical studies throughout the remainder of this year, as well as data presentations at several medical meetings. We expect to readout from the target study, which is the Phase II trial of daclizumab in combination with RITUXAN and Follicular NHL during the fourth quarter of this year at a medical meeting. We have completed enrollment in two out of three pivotal studies for lixivaptan and hyponatremia. These multinational studies include THE BALANCE (Treatment of HyponatrEmia BAsed on LixivAptan in NYHA Class III/IV Cardiac Patient Evaluation) trial of 650 patient study that enrolled patients with heart failure and the LIBRA trial, a study within patients with the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone hyper secretion or SIADH. Top line data readout for these two studies is expected during the second half of this year. 
We continue to make advances on our other pipeline programs, with readouts for the Phase II trials of AVONEX and ulcerative colitis and BG-12 in rheumatoid arthritis, both expected during the second half of 2010. We expect to present data from four of the Phase III studies of Ocrelizumab in RA at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting. These include data from the STAGE, FEATURE, FILM and SCRIPT trials. For the Ocrelizumab MS program, we previously announced positive top line data from this trial in Q4 2009. And in October of this year, we plan to present data at ECTRIMS. Data announcement from the Phase III PRIMA study of Rituxan as a maintenance therapy for indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is planned in an oral presentation at the upcoming ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology)Annual Meeting. Last September, we announced that this study met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival during a pre-planned interim analysis. We, along with our partner, Roche, also plan data presentations at upcoming medical meetings on our anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody designed specifically for use in oncology, GA101. Specifically, we expect data presentation from the Phase II portion of the Phase I2 study of GA101 at indolent NHL in June at the European Hematology Association Meeting in Barcelona. Also, we plan to present data from the Phase II portion at NHL and CLL patients at the American Society of Hematology Meeting in December. 
Along with advancements on our clinical programs, we continue to make progress on our regulatory efforts. Recall that earlier in Q1, we received FDA approval for RITUXAN in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for previously treated and untreated CD20 positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We continue efforts aimed at expanding the RITUXAN label with additional indications. Last month, we submitted supplemental Biologics License Applications to the FDA and EMA to expand the RITUXAN label in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma to include maintenance treatment for previously untreated patients with advanced follicular lymphomas. We based our submissions on phase III PRIMA study data. 
The U.S. regulatory filing for RITUXAN in ANCA-associated vasculitis also remains on track for the second half of this year. We continue to expand on the regulatory efforts with prolonged release Fampridine outside of the U.S. We have filed for approval in the EU, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand and expect to have more filings. We're excited for the anticipated x U.S. launch of prolonged release Fampridine. Data presentations at AAN, highlighted consistent improvement in average walking speed for MS patients last week. 
In conclusion, we continue to make progress on our pipeline and our R&D organization continues to perform well. We're currently supporting 76 trials with more than 4,700 patients across more than 1,200 sites worldwide. Our efforts position us well for future growth, and we look forward to providing you updates on new developments in the quarters ahead. With that, I'll now pass the call over to Bob Hamm, our Chief Operating Officer."
29726,100508523,56655,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2010",2010-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Evan. In the first quarter, AVONEX, TYSABRI and RITUXAN generated combined worldwide revenue to Biogen Idec of $1.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year.

In the first quarter, AVONEX, TYSABRI and RITUXAN generated combined worldwide revenue to Biogen Idec of $1.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year. With continued growth in our core MS business, more than offsetting the decline in RITUXAN royalty revenue. As Jim mentioned, TYSABRI exceeded 50,000 patients. 
While TYSABRI continue to add patients during the quarter, patient growth during the first half was modest. We saw a rebound in March, when we added more than 190 patients per week. Importantly, the moderation in patient growth during the first half of the quarter was a result of a decrease in new patient starts, not an increase in discontinuations. We've seen this pattern in the past, when physicians and patients have taken the time to absorb new information regarding PML risks. In this case, we suspect the label change reflect the increased risk of PML with increase duration of therapy may have been the cause. Also, we have seen a deceleration in patient growth in Germany, where there's still a high level of PML discussion. The safety concern in Germany may have been amplified by Dear Doctor letters sent to physicians during the first quarter. 
We also see evidence of a modest increase in drug suspensions. In order to better understand the impact this is having on TYSABRI use, we regularly ask our patients and physicians about their dosing preferences while at the same time, monitoring our TOUCH data on U.S. compliance in discontinuations. What we have found is that most of the physicians, who discuss this option with their patients allow them to make their own decision based on their own unique situation. 
Based on our data from the TOUCH program and from physician and patient interactions, we estimate that at the end of March, less than 10% of all U.S. TYSABRI patients were in a drug suspension. We plan to continue to follow this trend closely. The impact of this can be seen as a modest decline in net revenue per patient, as most physicians in the U.S. do not discontinue their patients from TOUCH during drug suspension. Since our relaunch in 2006, we have had questions about the impact of research initiatives on TYSABRI's adoption. Most recently, there's been interest on our work on the JCV antibody assay. Long term, we believe that it is important for neurologists and their patients to have more information clarifying TYSABRI's benefit and risks for individual doctor-patient benefit risks discussions. So while our net patient growth may moderate to absorb this new information over the short term, we've disciplined ourselves to keep perspective onwards is best for the long-term adoption of the product. 
Now an update on AVONEX. The franchise generated $593 million in global revenue during the first quarter of 2010, an increase of 7% year-over-year. AVONEX Q1 sales benefited partially from a 5.5% price increase in the U.S. on 26 February. Our new U.S. commercial team is now largely in place and showing renewed energy and focus. The leadership team has assessed our U.S. AVONEX commercial strategy and identified three areas we can address in order to arrest the decline of our AVONEX U.S. market share. 
The first is sales force effectiveness. We need to re-emphasize clinical selling and focus calling programs on key customers. We were examining multiple options to increase our interactions with physicians. The second is tactical marketing execution. AVONEX has compelling long-term efficacy data but that message has been lost over the past few years. Our CHAMPIONS tenured data brought that message back into focus and is starting to resonate with physicians. Now we need to build on that as we continue to amass evidence of AVONEX's long-term efficacy. The third area we need to better leverage is our patient services. Biogen Idec has been a pioneer in this area, and we need to re-establish supremacy of this as a competitive advantage. We have an extremely talented organization in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, that's been doing some great work with therapy support. We know that patient participation in this program increases product compliance. Over the next few months, we'll be launching programs to increase patient participation in therapy support. 
Outside the U.S., our sales force has been highly effective and our marketing message has been clear and in step with the local market. We have a strong international leadership team and more than a dozen years of experience selling directly to markets outside the U.S. Structurally, one thing that has facilitated our effectiveness overseas has been our affiliate model. We have a local presence in each of our direct markets with an experienced sales force and programs tailored to local patients and physicians. In my opinion, these are the factors that make AVONEX the number one MS therapy outside the U.S. and inform our updated strategy within the U.S. 
Next an update on RITUXAN. RITUXAN Q1 revenues to Biogen Idec were $255 million, down 9% year-over-year. This decline was driven by the continued expiration of royalties on revenues outside the U.S. Our U.S. RITUXAN profit share was up 12% on a year-over-year basis and 4% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, driven by increased demand in the hematology and oncology settings and some restocking in the channel. 
Finally, a quick update on prolonged release Fampridine, market is in impure in the U.S. by Acorda Therapeutics. Our plan for launching outside the U.S. continues on schedule. During the first quarter, we assembled an international prolonged release Fampridine advisory board of neurologists from 14 countries. This advisory board provides scientific input in the potential prolonged release Fampridine launch and subsequent product life cycle management. The advisory board held their first meeting in January. In parallel, our supply chain team continues preparation to enable appropriate, compassionate use programs and name patients supply. We look forward to upcoming discussions with the regulators, now that the launch is potentially less than a year away. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."
29726,100508523,56655,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2010",2010-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob. I'll review our 2010 first quarter financial performance. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release, Table 3 includes a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between our GAAP an",1642,"Thanks, Bob. I'll review our 2010 first quarter financial performance. 
Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release, Table 3 includes a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter were $49 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, $40 million for the contingent consolidation payment associated with the Syntonix acquisition, $12 million for employee stock option expense and $5 million for severance and restructuring. All of these offset by a $27 million tax impact on these items. Our GAAP diluted EPS was $0.80 in Q1 2010. 
Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP P&L operating performance of Biogen Idec, which we believe better reflects the ongoing economics of the business. It reflects how we manage the business internally and set operational goals. Our Q1 non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.08. The quarter was negatively impacted by two items. 
First, we incurred a $14 million charge resulting from the impairment of our strategic investment in AVEO Pharmaceuticals following their initial public offering in March. Second, we were impacted by U.S. healthcare reform. Specifically, revenues were reduced by $13 million due to the recently approved Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. 
In the quarter, we specifically incurred additional discounts from three changes: First, the change in the minimum Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1%, which took effect retroactive to January 1; second, the extension of Medicaid rebates to managed care organizations that dispense drugs to Medicaid beneficiaries, which took effect on March 23 as the law was enacted; and third, the expansion of 340B Public Health Services Drug Pricing Program, which provides outpatient drugs at reduce rates to include certain hospitals, clinics and healthcare centers. This was effective retroactive to January 1. These additional discounts impacted each of our products as noted on a slide in the earnings presentation. 
The AVEO impairment combined with the impacts of healthcare reform unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.07. 
Now let's move to the first quarter results in a bit more detail starting with revenue. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2010 was $1.1 billion, a 7% growth over the first quarter of 2009. Q1 product revenue grew double digit to $824 million, a 12% growth over Q1 2009. I'll start now going through our product revenues with AVONEX. 
Q1 AVONEX worldwide product revenue was $593 million, a 7% increase over Q1 2009. U.S. AVONEX product revenue in the first quarter was $350 million, a 3% increase versus prior year. U.S. AVONEX inventory in the channel ended at about two and a quarter weeks in the first quarter. In Q1, units sold in the U.S. declined approximately 9% as compared to Q1 2009. This was offset, as Bob noted, by price increases. Unemployment continued to impact our U.S. AVONEX trends as free goods once again increased. Q1 international AVONEX product sales were $243 million, a 13% increase over Q1 2009. In Q1 2010, units sold outside the U.S. increased approximately 4% as compared to prior year. 
Q1 TYSABRI worldwide product sales were $219 million for Biogen Idec, a 32% increase over Q1 2009. As Bob mentioned, TYSABRI patient growth moderated in the quarter, likely the lag effect of label discussions with both FDA and EMEA. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the trajectory we saw in the last month of Q1. Specifically, we estimate our net patient adds in the month of March pick back up to average approximately 190 per week. 
In the U.S., end-user TYSABRI sales hold $135 million for the first quarter, a 17% increase over Q1 2009. Biogen Idec booked $60 million of revenue of this amount. Q1 international TYSABRI  product revenue was $158 million, a 42% increase over Q1 2009. Q1 Fumaderm revenue was $13 million. Now moving on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues, referred to as revenue from unconsolidated joint business. 
We recorded $255 million in revenue for the quarter, representing a decrease of 9% on a year-over-year basis. Our RITUXAN revenues are broken down into three components. First, our share of the net U.S. RITUXAN profits. Net U.S. RITUXAN sales were $687 million in the first quarter of 2010, up 7% versus prior year, benefiting from demand and channel restocking. Our Q1 2010 profit share from that business was $200 million, up 12% versus prior year. Second, we received revenue on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. And in Q1, this was $38 million, down 54% versus prior year as royalties from individual countries have expired. Third, in the first quarter, we were reimbursed $16 million for selling and development cost incurred related to RITUXAN. Royalties were $26 million for the first quarter of 2010, an 8% increase year-over-year. 
Now turning to the expense lines in the non-GAAP P&L, which includes the adjustments that I described earlier. Q1 COGS were $97 million or 9% of revenues, benefiting from fewer inventory write-offs. Q1 R&D expense was $303 million or 27% of revenues. This represents a 9% increase over the prior quarter and a 10% increase over the prior year due primarily to an additional $19 million in expense we assumed as a result of a restructured collaboration agreement with Swedish orphan, Biovitrum, for our blood factor programs. In essence, we're now bearing the full development in manufacturing expenses for the Factor IX and Factory VIII programs in exchange for more favorable downstream economics and streamlined roles. Additionally at our large-scale facility in RTP, we redeployed manufacturing activity to clinical programs away from commercial production which reduced the amount of expenses normally capitalized to the balance sheet. This added an additional $30 million of R&D expense during the quarter. These two impacts were somewhat offset by favorability from recent program decisions. 
I'd also note that during the second quarter of this year, we anticipate that we may make a $30 million milestone payment to Facet Biotech, our partner on daclizumab, due upon initiation of the Phase III DECIDE trial. Q1 SG&A expense was $234 million or 21% of revenues. As mentioned during our last call, our SG&A expenses' percentage of revenues may average as much as 22% in total for 2010 as we prepare to defend our MS franchise against potential new competitors. 
Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit-sharing line totaled $64 million in expense in the quarter, representing our payment of profits outside the U.S. to Elan in the reimbursement of third-party royalties incurred by Elan outside the U.S. Other income and expense for the quarter was a loss of $8 million driven by the $14 million charge for the impairment of our investment in AVEO Pharmaceuticals as previously mentioned. Our cash and marketable securities position ended the quarter at $2.2 billion down from year end, mostly due to purchase of treasury stock. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25%. The Q1 tax includes a $6 million one-time benefit related to the restructuring of an international entity. 
This brings us to our Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $1.08. Now let me share the progress we've made with respect to our share repurchase program. During the first quarter of 2010, we repurchased and retired 10.5 million shares at a total cost of $578 million. As a result, we completed the $1 billion share repurchase program announced during the fourth quarter of 2009. In total, since the October authorization, we purchased 25.3 million shares for a total cost of $1.3 billion including approximately 6 million shares earmarked for share stabilization. Biogen Idec's average diluted shares outstanding were approximately 273 million for the first quarter. 
Last week, the board approved an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program with the objective of returning excess cash to shareholders. The authorization is open-ended and our intention is to execute the program in the open market at more likely a more deliberate pace. Our decision to repurchase more shares is influenced by a number of factors including the continued improvement in the credit markets, our outlook in the cash flow generation of the enterprise and the potential for our product initiatives and pipeline maturation. We continue to have the flexibility and capacity to pursue meaningful strategic investments. 
Turning to the full-year outlook, we're leaving our financial guidance unchanged from previous communication. We estimate healthcare legislation will reduce our revenue by approximately $70 million to $90 million for the year or about 2%. These reductions are due to the increase in Medicaid rebates, the expansion of hospitals eligible for 340(B) pricing and the extension of Medicaid rebate to managed care organizations. Nevertheless, the longer-term impact on our business can be less than favorable as expansion of patients who are currently uninsured and prescription drug coverage for patients in Medicare Part D donut hole takes effect in future years. In biosimilar legislation, including a 12-year data exclusivity on biologic therapies can be quite positive. 
The balance of year market impact to both potential new competition and data provided in the context of our JCV antibody assay trial is equivocal. We'll monitor closely the TYSABRI® trends over the next few months as patients and physicians adjust to new information. Regardless, we believe that our initiatives to provide more clinical data on the benefit risk equation can poise TYSABRI® for strong growth over the longer term. 
In conclusion, our core business delivered a solid quarter. Total product sales grew by 12%. We're marking progress on our late stage pipeline, and we continue to generate strong free cash flow.  We face new headwinds this quarter, yet we'll continue to keep our focus on the long term. From that perspective, we're in an enviable position. Our pipeline features six products in registrational trials. We have several intriguing TYSABRI® initiatives underway, and we generate sound cash flow allowing us to return capital shareholders. 
I'll now hand the call over to Jim for his closing comments."

I think the broader trend that we've seen in the business is that subsequent to the label discussions -- there is a lagged effect here because patients and physicians decide and then it takes four to five or six weeks to put them on therapy and get their first infusion. So subsequent to those discussions that were happening in the fourth quarter, we did see a modest slowdown in the net patient adds on a gross basis as well. We've seen that largely pick up and that kind of trends back into the four to five weeks since the label discussions were largely finished. So I think it's -- I just kind of keep it at a full month of March basis."

During first quarter of 2010, we continued to execute on our business strategy and positioned the company for growth over the long-term. Total revenue increased 7% on a year-over-year basis to $1.1 billion driven by 32% year-over-year TYSABRI revenue growth.
Two items negatively impacted first quarter earnings, a $13 million increase in rebates mandated by the Patient Protection and Affordability Care Act, and a $14 million write-down on our investment in AVEO Pharmaceuticals. Taken together these items reduced EPS by $0.07. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first quarter of 2010 was a $1.08, an increase of 3% on a year-over-year basis.
The company generated $337 million in cash flow from operations and ended the quarter with a $2.2 billion cash balance, and as of the end of March 2010, we estimate that we now have more than 50,000 patients in commercial and clinical TYSABRI therapy.
On an operational basis in the first quarter, we launched three new TYSABRI trials that surpassed head-to-head comparative trials that determine the effect of switching from Copaxone or Rebif to TYSABRI and stratify one and two to test the utility of JC virus antibody assay through risk stratification. These studies are the latest in a series of investments we made to clarify the benefits and risks of TYSABRI.
We completed a share repurchase program announced in October of last year, which returned $1 billion in cash to our shareholders and received board approval to purchase an additional 1.5 billion of shares.
We continue to make significant strides in the development related to the clinical pipeline. Last week, we updated the medical community on our progress of our neurology pipeline at the Annual American Academy of Neurology meeting, where we presented 38 posters on our broad and deep MS pipeline.

I would like to begin with an update of our registration trial. We continue to make good progress on advancing and developing our late stage clinical pipeline and expect data on some of these programs as early as next year.
Preparations are underway to initiate the phase 3 trial Daclizumab. This is DECIDE trial into two-year study of Daclizumab in RRMS patients with AVONEX is the comparator. We look forward to updating you with further details of this study.
As previously announced both BG-12 registrational studies DEFINE and CONFIRM have completed patient enrollment and the trials continue on plan. We expect data from DEFINE during the first half of 2011 and from CONFIRM during the second half of 2011.
We continue enrolling patients in the ADVANCE study of PEGylated interferon beta-1a and in a Phase 3 study of GA101 for frontline chronic lymphocytic leukemia in combination with Chlorambucil.
Enrollment for a second registrational trial in Rituxan-refractory indolent Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients is planned to start during the second quarter of 2010.
Patient enrollment for B-LONG, which is the registrational trial for our long-acting, recombinant Factor IX candidate in hemophilia B continues to progress well.
Last week, we shared important data on our neurology franchise at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting, where we demonstrated the strength and the quality of our neurology pipeline with 38 company-sponsored platform and poster presentations.
Nearly four years after its reintroduction in the US and initial launch in the EU, we continue to demonstrate the powerful efficacy of the TYSABRI offers relapsing multiple sclerosis patients.
Key data presentations reinforced the growing body of evidence that TYSABRI is an important therapeutic option for patients and may lead to overall improved quality of life for MS patients, from improvement and physical function, cognition and visual function to reduce fatigue.
We take the issue of PML very seriously with each case of PML there is the potential to learn something new about this rare, but serious adverse event.
To this point, Dr. Rick Rudick presents a data from our retrospective analysis of patients enrolled in the STRATIFY trial which show that TYSABRI does not lead to substantial changes in the presence of JC virus DNA in blood or urine samples of MS patients.
During the first quarter, we initiated three important trials related to TYSABRI, STRATIFY 1 and 2 and SURPASS. As discussed during the platform presentation at AAN, we have developed the blood test that detects antibodies to the JC virus, the virus that causes PML. The presence of the antibody to the virus suggests that a patient has been previously exposed to the JC virus. While the data are still preliminary, this assay may provide a tool for physicians to stratify the risk of PML in their MS patients.
To recap what we know today, for 13 TYSABRI treated PML patients, where we have baseline plasma samples, all 13 of them were antibody positive for one to three years before developing PML. If antibodies status was not a factor for developing PML, we would only have expected six or seven to be positive based on our data that 54% of MS patients have been exposed to the virus previously. So, our hypothesis is that there may be a lower risk for developing PML in TYSABRI treated MS patients who are antibody negative.
To confirm this hypothesis, we have initiated two clinical trials. STRATIFY 1 is designed to determine the percentage of the MS patient population that’s positive for JC virus antibodies as well as the false negative rates for the blood test. We expect to enroll 1,000 patients in this trial, inclusion criteria are current TYSABRI patients enrolled in [Touch] or patients who are not currently on TYSABRI but are considering beginning TYSABRI treatment. For this trial, we will be testing for JC virus antibody in the blood and testing for the presence of JC virus DNA in the urine every six months for two years from the time of enrollment.
STRATIFY II is designed to evaluate whether the incidents of PML and TYSABRI patients were negative for the JC virus antibodies is less than the incidents among TYSABRI patients who were positive for the antibodies to JC virus.
STRATIFY II is expect to enroll a minimum of 8000 patients and is open to all types of prescribers. In this trial we'll be testing for the JC virus antibody only in the blood and on an annual basis for two years from their time of enrollment. Our goal is to ultimately provide neurologist and MS patients with tools to stratify risk.
Our thinking here is that within the context of the clinical trial, whether it's prospective analysis of the data with the best opportunity to validate and determine the clinical utility of this assay. Our hope is that over the long-term the JC virus assay may help physicians to make better treatment decisions for MS patients.
Moving onto SURPASS, our objective with this study is to provide a new model for making optimal treatment decisions in order to improve the outcomes of patients with MS. SURPASS will be the largest prospective study to provide comparative data regarding the management of breakthrough disease in MS. Amongst MS specialists there is an evolving standard of care that when a patient on first-line MS therapy presents with either clinical or MRI evidence of disease activity, modification of treatment needs to considered. Yet, there is no evidence confirming whether switching MS therapies results in improved outcomes. In the SURPASS trial, we're enrolling MS patients initially treated with the Rebif or Copaxone for least six months.
We subsequently experienced either a clinical attack or two or more new MRI lesions.  Patients would then be randomized to one of three arms. The first is to continue on the initial therapy, the second converting to the other first-line therapy or third converting to TYSABRI. SURPASS has a target enrollment of 1800 patients, at 230 sites worldwide, we expect they will provide important data on whether early identification of breakthrough disease, and subsequent modification of therapy improves patient outcomes.
We expect the study to be completed in 2013, our goal with SURPASS and the STRATIFIED trials is that combined these studies will provide physicians with powerful tools for informed treatment decisions, such as improved techniques for stratifying the risk of PML in MS patients on TYSABRI.
Now an update on the rest of our pipeline, during the first quarter we along with our partner Roche decided to suspend treatments of patients in the Ocrelizumab rheumatoid arthritis program. This decision followed the recommendation of the independent Ocrelizumab RA & Lupus Data and Safety Monitoring Board, based on their assessment that safety risk, outweigh the benefits observed in these specific patient populations.
We recently announced that the primary endpoint was met in the Phase III SCRIPT study of Ocrelizumab in the TNF IR RA patients. The future of the Ocrelizumab RA clinical programs is currently under review as we and our partner will have to consider these recent results along with the complete safety data set
The Ocrelizumab program in relapsing remitting MS remains ongoing at this time. However the MS Data Safety Monitoring Board will be reviewing the safety data, from the RA Lupus and MS files. We previously announced that the MS study achieved its primary end point and we continue to discuss the next steps for Ocrelizumab MS program with our partner Roche.
Turning to oncology. As you may recall during the third quarter earnings last year, we announced that we had stopped patient recruitment, in the lumiliximab LUCID trial. We recently reviewed the data for the lumiliximab trials in both relapsed and the front line CLL and determined that the results do not support continuing the program.
Next an update on our blood factor programs. As we announced in January, the global registrational trial for a long-acting recombinant Factor IX candidate in hemophilia B continues to enroll patients. We planned to present results of the Phase 1/2 Factor IX study in July at the World Federation of Hemophilia meeting in Buenos Aires. Additionally, the Phase 1/2 study of our long-acting recombinant Factor VIII program is progressing well and we expect to redial from this study later this year.
Recombinant Factor IX Fc is the first major blood factor innovation since the development of recombinant drugs in the 1990. We believe that our long-acting blood factor programs have the potential to significantly improve the lives of people with hemophilia and as a result expand the hemophilia market opportunity. Recombinant Factor IX Fc offers the hope of less frequent injections and prolong protection from bleeding compared to existing therapies.
Our goal in developing the long-acting blood factor candidates is to change the treatment paradigm in hemophilia with more prophylactic usage. Current short-acting treatments require in two to three infusions per week for hemophilia B and three to four infusions per week for hemophilia A, don’t lend themselves to easy prophylactic usage.
Well, most children with severe hemophilia are already on prophylactic regimen based on the compelling outcome studies giving frequent IV infusions to children, places are significant burden on parents.
For young children prophylactic dosing also frequently requires placement of a central catheter or port, which introduces risk of serious infection. For adults with hemophilia, episodic or on-demand treatment is more common despite the clinical benefits to prophylaxis. Recombinant Factor IX Fc has the potential to lower the hurdle for prophylactic treatment of hemophilia B in both the pediatric and adult populations.
Looking forward, we expect to announce data readouts in seven clinical studies throughout the remainder of this year as well as data presentations at several medical meetings. We expect to readout from the TARGET study, which is the Phase II trial of Galiximab in combination with RITUXAN in follicular NHL during the fourth quarter of this year at a medical meeting.
We have completed enrollment in two out of three pivotal studies for Lixivaptan in hyponatremia. These multinational studies include the balance trial, a 650 patient study that enrolled patients with heart failure and the Leber trial, a study of in-patients with the syndrome inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion, or SIADH.
Top-line data readout for these two studies is expected during the second half this year. We continue to make advances on our other pipeline programs with readouts for the Phase II trials of AVONEX in ulcerative colitis, and BG-12 in rheumatoid arthritis, both expected during the second half of 2010.
We expect to present data from four of the Phase III studies of Ocrelizumab in RA at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting. These include data from the STAGE, FEATURE, FILM and SCRIPT trials. For the Ocrelizumab MS program, we previously announced positive top-line data from this trial in Q4 2009 and in October of this year, we planned to present data at ACTRIMS.
Data announcement from the Phase III PRIMA study of RITUXAN as a [latent] therapy for indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma is planned in oral presentation of the upcoming ASCO Annual Meeting.
Last September, we announced that this study met its primary endpoint of progression free survival during a pre-planned interim analysis. We, along with our partner Roche, also planned data presentations at upcoming medical meetings on our anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, designed specifically for use in oncology, GA101.
Specifically, we expect data presentation from the Phase II portion of the Phase I/II study of GA101 an indolent NHL in June at the European Hematology Association meeting in Barcelona.
Also, we planned to present data from the Phase II portion at NHL and CLL patients at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December.
Along with advancements on our clinical programs, we continued to make progress on our regulatory efforts. Recall that earlier in Q1 we received FDA approval for RITUXAN in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for previously treated and untreated CD20-positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
We continue efforts aimed at expanding the RITUXAN label with additional indications. Last month we submitted supplemental Biologics License Application to the FDA and EMA to expand the RITUXAN label in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma to include maintenance treatment for previously untreated patients with advanced follicular lymphomas.
We based our submissions on Phase 3 PRIMA study data. The US regulatory filings for RITUXAN in ANCA-associated vasculitis also remained on track for the second half of this year.
We continue to expand on the regulatory efforts with prolong release Fampridine outside of the US. We have filed for approval in the EU, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand and expect to have more filings.
We are excited for the anticipated ex-US launch of prolonged release Fampridine. Data presentations at AAN highlighted consistent improvements in average walking speed for MS patients last week.
In conclusion, we continue to make progress in our pipeline and our R&D organization continues to perform well. We are currently supporting 76 trials with more than 4700 patients across more than 1200 sites worldwide. Our efforts position us well for future growth and we look forward to providing you updates on new developments in the quarters ahead.
With that, I will now pass the call over to Rob Hamm, our Chief Operating Officer.

In the first quarter, AVONEX, TYSABRI and RITUXAN, generated combine worldwide revenue for Biogen Idec of 1.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year with continued growth in our core MS business more than offsetting a decline in RITUXAN royalty revenue.
As Jim mentioned, TYSABRI exceeded 50,000 patients. While TYSABRI continued to add patients during the quarter, patient growth during the first half was modest. We saw a rebound in March when we added more than 190 patients per week. Importantly the moderation in patient growth during the first half of the quarter was a result of a decrease in new patient starts not an increase in discontinuations. We have seen this pattern in the past when physicians and patients have taken the time to absorb new information regarding PML risk.
In this case, we suspect a label change to reflect the increase risk of PML with increased duration of therapy may have been the cause. Also, we have seen a deceleration in patient growth in Germany where there is still a high level of PML discussion. The safety concern in Germany may have been amplified by Dear Doctor letters sent to physicians during the first quarter.
We also see evidence of a modest increase in drug suspensions. In order to better understand the impact this is having on TYSABRI use, we regularly ask our patients and physicians about their dosing preferences, while at the same time monitoring our TOUCH data on US compliance in discontinuations. What we have found is that most of the physicians who discuss this option with their patients allow them to make their own decisions based on their own unique situation.
Based on our data from the TOUCH program and from physician and patient interactions, we estimate that at the end of March, less than 10% of all US TYSABRI patients were under drug suspension. We plan to continue to follow this trend closely. The impact of this can be seen as a modest decline in net revenue for patient as most physicians in the US do not discontinue their patients from TOUCH during drug suspension.
Since our re-launch in 2006, we have had questions about the impact of research initiatives on TYSABRI's adoption. Most recently there has been interest in our work on the JCV antibody aspect. Long-term, we believe that it is important for neurologist in MS patients to have more information clarifying TYSABRI’s benefit and risk for individual doctor-patient benefit risk discussions.
So while our net patient growth may moderate to observe this new information over the short-term, we've disciplined ourselves to keep perspective onwards is best for the long-term adoption of the product.
Now an update on AVONEX, the franchise generated $593 million in global revenue during the first quarter of 2010, an increase of 7% year-over-year. AVONEX Q1 sales benefited partially from a 5.5 price increase in the US on 26 February. 
Our new US commercial team is now largely in place and showing renewed energy and focus. The new US team has accessed our US AVONEX commercial strategy and indentified three areas we can address in order to arrest the decline of our AVONEX US market share. The first is sales force effectiveness, we need to have reemphasized clinical selling and focus calling programs on key customers. We were examining multiple options to increase our interactions with physicians.
The second is tactical marketing execution, AVONEX has compelling long-term efficacy data but that message has been lost over the past few years. Our CHAMPIONS ten-year data brought that message back into focus and is starting to resonate with physicians. Now we need to build on that as we continue to mass evidence of AVONEX long-term efficacy.
The third area we need bear leverage is our patient services. Biogen Idec has been a pioneer in this area and we need to reestablish the premise of this as a competitive advantage. We have an extremely talented organization and research channel partner in (Carolina) that has been doing some great work with therapy support. We know that patient participation program increases product compliance.
Over the next few months we will be launching programs to increase patient participation in therapy support. Outside the US, our sales force has been highly effective and our marketing message has been cleared in step with the local market.
We have a strong international leadership team in more than a dozen years of experience selling directly to markets outside the US. Structurally one thing that has facilitated our effectiveness overseas has been our affiliate model. We have a local presence in each of our direct markets with experienced sales force and programs tailored to local patients and physicians. In my opinion these are the factors that make AVONEX the number one MS therapy outside the US and inform our updated strategy within the US.
Next, an update on RITUXAN. RITUXAN Q1 revenues to Biogen Idec were $255 million, down 9% year-over-year. This decline was driven by the continued exploration of royalties on revenues outside the US. Our US RITUXAN profit share was up 12% on a year-over-year basis and 4% on a quarter-over-quarter basis driven by increased demand in the hematology and oncology settings and some restocking in the channel.
Finally, quick update on prolonged release Fampridine, marketed as AMPYRA in the US by Acorda Therapeutics. Our plan for launching outside the US continues on schedule. During the first quarter, we assembled an international prolonged release Fampridine advisory board of neurologists from 14 countries. This advisory board provides scientific input in the potential prolonged release Fampridine launch and subsequent product life cycle management.
The advisory board held their first meeting in January in parallel with our supply chain team continues preparation to enable appropriate compassionate use programs and name patient supply. We look forward to upcoming discussions with the regulators now that launches potentially less than a year away.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Paul Clancy our Chief Financial Officer.

29726,100508523,56657,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2010",2010-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob.

The primary differences between our GAAP an",1639,"Thanks, Bob. I'll review our 2010 first quarter financial performance. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release table 3, includes the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter were $49 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, $40 million for the contingent consolidation payment associated with the Syntonix acquisition, $12 million from employee stock option expense and $5 million for severance and restructuring. All of these, offset by a $27 million tax impact on these items. Our GAAP diluted EPS was $0.80 in Q1 2010.
Now, I'll move on to the non-GAAP P&L operating performance of Biogen IDEC, which we believe better reflects the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business internally and set operational goals.
Our Q1 non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.08. The quarter was negatively impacted by two items. First, we incurred a $14 million charge resulting from the impairment of our strategic investment in AVEO Pharmaceuticals following their initial public offering in March.
Second, we were impacted by US Healthcare Reform. Specifically, revenues were reduced by $13 million due to the recently approved Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
In the quarter, we specifically incurred additional discounts from three changes. First, the change in the minimum Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1%, which took effect retroactive to January 1st.
Second, the expansion of Medicaid rebates to managed care organizations that dispense drugs to Medicaid beneficiaries, which took effect on March 23rd as the law was enacted, and third, the expansion of 340B Public Health Services Drug Pricing Program, which provides outpatient drugs at reduced rates to include certain hospitals, clinics and healthcare centers. This was effective retroactive to January 1st.
These additional discounts impacted each of our products as noted on our slide in the earnings presentation. The AVEO impairment combined with the impacts of healthcare reform, unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.07.
Now, let's move to the first quarter results in a bit more detail starting with revenue. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2010 was $1.1 billion, a 7% growth over the first quarter of 2009.
Q1 product revenue grew double-digit to $824 million, a 12% growth over Q1 2009.
I will start now going through our products revenues with AVONEX. Q1 AVONEX worldwide product revenue was $593 million, a 7% increased over Q1 2009. US AVONEX product revenue in the first quarter was $350 million, a 3% increase versus prior year. US AVONEX inventory in the channel ended at about two-and-a-quarter weeks in the first quarter.
In Q1, units sold in the US declined approximately 9%, as compared to Q1 2009. This was offset as Bob noted by price increases. Unemployment continues to impact our US AVONEX trend as free goods once again increased. Q1 international AVONEX products sales were $243 million, a 13% increase over Q1 2009. In Q1 2010, units sold outside the US increased approximately 4% as compared to prior year.
Q1 TYSABRI worldwide product sales were $219 million for Biogen IDEC, a 32% increase over Q1 2009. As Bob mentioned TYSABRI patient growth moderated in the quarter likely the lagged effect of label discussion with FDA and EMEA.
Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the trajectory we saw in the last month of Q1 specifically we estimate our net patient adds in the month of March pick backup to average approximately a 190 per week.
In the US, end-user TYSABRI sales totaled $135 million for the first quarter, a 17% increase over Q1 2009. Biogen Idec booked $60 million of revenue of this amount. Q1 international TYSABRI product revenue was $158 million, a 42% increase over Q1, 2009. Q1 (Fampridine) revenue was $13 million.
Now moving on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues referred to as revenue from unconsolidated joint business. We recorded $255 million in revenue for the quarter, representing a decrease of 9% on a year-over-year basis.
Our RITUXAN revenues have broken down into three components. First, our share of the net US RITUXAN profits, net US RITUXAN sales were $687 million in the first quarter of 2010, up 7% versus prior year, benefiting from demand in channel restocking. Our Q1 2010 profit share from that business was $200 million, up 12% versus prior year.
Second, we received revenue on sales of rituximab outside the US and in Q1 this was $38 million, down 54% versus prior year as royalties from individual countries have expired.
Third, in the first quarter, we've reimbursed $16 million for selling and developing cost incurred related to RITUXAN. Royalties were $26 million for the first quarter 2010, an 8% increase year-over-year.
Now turning to the expense lines in the non-GAAP P&L, which includes the adjustments that I described earlier. Q1 COGS were $97 million or 9% of revenues, benefiting from fewer inventory write-offs.
Q1 R&D expense was $303 million or 27% of revenues. This represents a 9% increase over the prior quarter and 10% increase over the prior year, due primarily to an additional $19 million in expense we assumed as a result of a restructured collaboration agreement with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum for our blood factor programs. In essence, we are now bearing the full development and manufacturing expenses for the Factor IX and Factor VIII programs in exchange for more favorable downstream economics in streamlined roles.
Additionally, at our large scale facility in RTP, we redeployed the manufacturing activity to clinical programs away from commercial production which reduce the amount of expense that is normally capitalized to the balance sheet. This adds an additional $30 million of R&D expense during the quarter. These two impacts were somewhat offset favorability from recent program decisions.
I'd also note that during the second quarter this year, we anticipate that we may make a $30 million milestone payment to Facet Biotech, our partner in Daclizumab due upon initiation of the Phase 3 DECIDE trails.
Q1 SG&A expense was $234 million or 21% revenues. As mentioned during our last call, our SG&A expenses percentage of revenues may average as much as 22% in total for 2010, as we prepared to defend our MS franchise, against potentials new competitors.
Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $64 million in expense for the quarter, representing our payments of profits outside the US to Elan and the reimbursement of third-party royalties incurred by Elan outside the U.S.
Other income and expense for the quarter was a loss of $8 million driven by the $14 million charge from the impairment of our investment in AVEO Pharmaceuticals as previously mentioned. Our cash in marketable securities position ended the quarter at $2.2 billion, down from year end, mostly due to purchase of treasury stock.
Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25%. The Q1 tax includes the $6 million one-time benefit related to restructuring of an international entity. This brings us to our Q1 non-GAAP diluted recurring per share, which were $8.
Now let me share the progress we've made with respect to our share repurchase program. During the first quarter of 2010, we repurchased and retired 10.5 million shares at a total cost of $578 million As a result we completed the billion dollar share repurchase program announced during the fourth quarter of 2009. In total since the October authorization we purchased 25.3 million shares for a total cost of $1.3 billion including approximately 6 million shares earmarked for share stabilization.
Biogen Idec’s average shares outstanding were approximately 273 million for the first quarter. Last week the board approved an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program with the objective or returning excess cash to share holders. The authorization is open ended and our intention is to execute the program in the open market at a more likely and more deliberate pace.
Our decision to repurchase more shares is influenced by a number of factors including the continued improvement in the credit markets, our outlook in the cash flow generation of the enterprise and the potential for our product initiatives in pipeline maturation. We continue to have the flexibility in capacity to pursue meaningful strategic investments. 
Turning to the full year outlook, we’re leaving our financial guidance unchanged from previous communication. We estimate healthcare legislation, will reduce our revenue by approximately $70 million to $90 million for the year or about 2%. These reductions are due to the increase in medicate rebates, the expansion of hospitals eligible for 340(B) pricing and the extension of medicate rebate to managed care organizations.
Nevertheless, the longer-term impact on our business can be less unfavorable as expansion of patients who are currently uninsured and prescription drug coverage for patients in Medicare part D, Doughnut Hole takes affect in future years and Biosimilar legislation including the 12-year data exclusivity on biologic therapies can be quite positive. The balance of your market impact of both, potential new competition and data provided in the context of our JCV Antibody Assay trial is equivocal.
We'll monitor closely the TYSABRI trends over the next few months as patients and physicians adjust to new information. Regardless, we believe that our initiatives to provide more clinical data on the benefit risk equation can poise TYSABRI for strong growth over the long-term.
In conclusion, our core business delivered a solid quarter. Total product sales grew by 12%. We are marking progress on our late-stage pipeline and we continue to generate strong free cash flow. We faced new headwinds this quarter, yet, we'll continue to keep our focus on the long-term. From that perspective, we are in an enviable position.
Our pipeline feature six products in registrational trials, we have several intriguing TYSABRI initiatives underway, and we generate sound cash flow allowing us to return capital to shareholders.
I'll now hand the call over to Jim for his closing comments.

I’ll give a brief update on the quarter, Al Sandrock will give you an R&D update, and then Paul Clancy will go through the business and financial results for the quarter, and I’ll come back at the end for a few closing remarks.
So briefly, I’m pleased to report that Biogen Idec had a solid second quarter. Revenues were $1.21 billion, up 11% versus Q2 of ’09. And as you’ll hear from Paul in a few minutes, we’re revising our 2010 EPS guidance upwards. I’m also pleased to report that after only a few days here, I’m impressed by the willingness and in fact eagerness as well as the ability of the people here to move the company forward aggressively.
In the coming months, we’ll focus on the three priorities that I outlined a few weeks ago, defending and expanding the commercial business, taking a hard look at R&D to ensure that we maximize the return on our investment, and infusing a sense of urgency in all parts of the organization.
Commercially, that means, doing everything that we can to protect and expand our AVONEX franchise, including a vigorous program to address the likely approval on oral MS compounds. I’m pleased to report that AVONEX unit sales ex-US grew 6% versus Q2 ‘09. And, while unit sales inside the US decreased 7% in the same time period, there was a 4% increase in US AVONEX unit sales in Q2 compared to Q1. 
Though the numbers are encouraging, it’s a little early to conclude that our newly invigorated marketing efforts led by Dr. Francesco Granata are paying off. The unit sales of AVONEX will continue to be a major focus for us as we move forward. And, as you’ll hear from Paul Clancy, we’ve begun an aggressive program towards that end. Making sure that we identify the proper subsets of patients for TYSABRI is also a crucial importance. 
TYSABRI is an extremely efficacious drug that can be life changing for many MS patients. I’m pleased that during Q2, there was an average of a 185 net new patients taking TYSABRI each week. I believe that this number reflects the recognition of the remarkable efficacy of TYSABRI. That being said, we owe it patients to identify those subsets of patients who can safely take TYSABRI with reduced concern about developing PML. The JC virus assay that the company is testing is likely to be an important step in that direction.
As you know, all 17 patients who developed PML - excuse me - and for whom serum was available prior to the onset of the disease has deposited in this assay. The ongoing STRATIFY 1 and STRATIFY 2 trials are intended to confirm the percentage of MS patients who test positive in this assay and to further explore their relationship between the results in assay and the risk of developing PML. 
If, as we postulate, PML develops predominantly or exclusively in patients who test positive in the assay. Patients who test negative could use TYSABRI with reduced concern about developing PML. That could lead to improve therapy from many MS patients. Today, I’m happy to say that during the second quarter, enrollment in the STRATIFY 1 trial was completed. And at the end of quarter, over 700 patients had been enrolled in the STRATIFY 2 trial.
As you know, we have our own oral compound BG-12 in development. The DEFINE and CONFIRM trials for BG-12 are on track and both are scheduled to be completed in 2011. Additionally, during Q2, we began the trial of BG-12 in combination with interferon and with glatiramer acetate, the Phase II efficacy and tolerability of BG-12 raise the possibility of the combinations of the compound and other MS agents could be to enhance efficacy for many MS patients and this trial is intended to begin to address that possibility. Personally, I’m enthusiastic about this possibility, because if positive, the results could lead to enhance therapy for many MS patients, and of course to increase revenues for the company as well.
Also, during Q2, we reached agreement with the FDA on a special protocol assessment for the ADVANCE study of PEGylated interferon. ADVANCE is a one-year placebo-controlled trial testing the impact on the annual relapse rate of PEGylated interferon every four weeks and every two weeks. Finally, we made progress in both of our hemophilia projects, long-acting Factor IX and long-acting Factor VIII. If the Phase III trials of these compounds confirm our early data and demonstrate longer duration of action on existing products with an acceptable safety profile, these products will lead to more convenient dosing for thousands of patients with hemophilia.
Al Sandrock and Paul Clancy will give more details on our business in a moment. I just want to conclude by saying that I’m happy to be here, I sense in the company a strong desire to move forward aggressively and decisively, and I’m looking forward to working with the management and the Board to better serve our patients, grow our business and generate increased value for our shareholders. 
So, at this point, I’ll turn the call over to Al Sandrock for a review of our R&D activities.

Before I begin, I just wanted to say that my colleagues and I in the R&D organization are very excited about George’s arrival here. His passion for scientific excellence and innovation motivates all of us to believe that science is at the heart of our business.
I’ll be providing an update on the pipeline a bit later, but let me begin with our TYSABRI risk stratification efforts. As I’ve mentioned before, one of our goals has been to provide prescribers with tools they can identify individuals who might be at risk for PML when taking TYSABRI. 
We began with a premise that only patients who’ve been affected with the JC virus are at risk of developing PML. Our hypothesis that our two-step ELISA assay that detects antibodies against JCV will be informative in estimating the risk of developing PML for patients receiving TYSABRI. 
Based on testing, nearly 2000 MS patients from STRATA and TYGRIS studies, we find that approximately 50% of MS patients are still positive with our assay. We currently estimate that our assay has a false negative rate of about 2.5%. When we tested archived samples that were available from 17 patients who developed PML while on TYSABRI, all 17 tested positive with our assay. 
These samples have been collected 16 months to a 180 months prior to the onset of PML for various reasons, including participation in clinical studies and national registries. With antibody status, we’re not a risk factor for developing PML, one would have expected that roughly half of these 17 patients would have been antibody positive. So we believe the finding all 17 to be positive was extremely unlikely to be due to chance.
Encouraged by these preliminary data, we have initiated two studies to test our hypothesis at the anti-JCV test that we have developed will be helpful to clinicians as risk stratification tools. These studies are STRATIFY 1 and STRATIFY 2, both of which are being conducted in the United States. 
As George mentioned, STRATIFY 1 is now fully enrolled and STRATIFY 2 is off to a great start with more than 700 patients enrolled at over 90 sites around the United States. This study which will enroll a total of 8000 to 24000 patients will provide an estimate of the risk of PML in TYSABRI patients test negative in our assay. Our hypothesis is that those who test negative in our assay will have a lower risk of PML than those who test positive. 
We plan to show preliminary data from STRATIFY 1 at the ECTRIMS meeting in October of this year. Also, our manuscript on the anti-JCV assay methodology and its potential use as a risk stratification tool has been accepted for publication in the Annals of Neurology and will be coming out in approximately six weeks.
We also want to update you on a change to the US TYSABRI label that we along with our partner Elan have just made. After a thorough evaluation of our post-marketing surveillance data, we have concluded that the risk of PML is increased in patients have been treated with an immunosuppressant prior to receiving TYSABRI. 
This increased risk appears to be independent of treatment duration and there was a broad range in the time interval between the discontinuation of the prior immunosuppressant and the TYSABRI initiation. Recall that the original label had warned that patients receiving TYSABRI should not be treated with concomitant immunosuppressants. We have added an additional warning about the prior use of these drugs to the existing warning. 
Based on data from the TYGRIS observational study, only 13% of US patients and 24% of ex-US patients have had prior immunosuppressant use, whereas about half of the PML cases had previously received these drugs. Thus, there was a disproportionately higher representation of prior immunosuppressant use in the PML cases. The new label changes were posted online as of July 15th. Overall, we continue to learn more about factors associated with the risk of PML and we’re looking forward to providing data to the MS community to help with their decision-making for treatment choices.
Now, I will turn to the progress we’ve made on our pipeline. We currently have eight programs in late-stage development or in registration. Four are in MS and four in other indications. We continue to make good progress on these programs and expect data on some of them as early as next year.
Let me start with our late-stage MS pipeline. Last month, we and our partner Abbott announced enrollment of the first patient into the Phase III trial of daclizumab. The DECIDE study is a two-year study in relapsing, remitting MS, comparing the effect of daclizumab on annualized relapse rate with beta interferon as the comparator. Also, during the quarter, we completed our formal discussions with the FDA and I’m pleased to report that this trial is being conducted under a special protocol assessment. 
As George mentioned, we recently started a Phase II BG-12 combination study called EXPLORE, which will evaluate whether adding BG-12 can help patients whose MS progresses despite treatment with interferon or Copaxone. BG-12 offers a promising safety and efficacy profile based on its unique mechanism of action and thus maybe a suitable medication to combine with these first-line therapies.
We also continued to make good progress on both registrational studies of BG-12 in the monotherapy setting and expect data from the DEFINE study during the first half of 2011 and from the CONFIRM study during the second half of 2011. Site activation and patient enrollment continues to progress for the advanced study of PEGylated interferon beta-1a. During the quarter, we completed our formal discussions with the FDA. And so, as George mentioned, this trial is being conducted under special protocol assessment.
Turning to the rest of the pipeline, we recently reviewed the data from two Phase II trials. One a BG-12 in rheumatoid arthritis and the second interferon beta-1a in ulcerative colitis. After an extensive review of the data, we have determined that the results of these studies are not supportive of advancing either of these programs further.
In addition, we along with our partners Vernalis, recently made the decision to discontinue development of the Vipadenant, our A2a receptor antagonist for Parkinson's disease in favor of an alternate next-generation compound which we call BIIB34. 
Our decision was based on a review of the findings in preclinical toxicology studies of Vipadenant and not the Phase II clinical studies which were positive. We continued to move ahead with the backup compound BIIB34 which was designed to address the chemical structural liabilities that may have led to the toxicity seen with Vipadenant.
We continued to make progress on our regulatory efforts on two fronts with RITUXAN and with prolonged release Fampridine tablets. The US regulatory filings for RITUXAN in ANCA-associated vasculitis remains on track for the second half of this year. The RAVE study which was supported by Biogen Idec and our partner Roche was conducted by an international consortium at the NIH. 
Data from this study was recently published in the July issue of the New England Journal of Medicine and demonstrated that RITUXAN treatment was as effective as cyclophosphamide which is the current standard of care and inducing disease remission at six months and patients with severe AAV. 
RAVE also showed that patients who enter the trial with recurrent severe disease relapse responded better to RITUXAN than to the standard of care. Also in this quarter, the FDA accepted our sBLA filing for RITUXAN as maintenance therapy and previously untreated follicular NHL based on positive results from the PRIMA study. The FDA action date is January 29th, 2011.
We are excited about the progress of prolonged release Fampridine tablets through the regulatory processes ex-US and look forward to updating you on our plans to bring prolonged release Fampridine tablets to patients in these geographies at the appropriate time. 
Prolonged release Fampridine tablets have the potential to offer MS patients increased independence and improve confidence as patients improve their walking ability. Our market research in Europe and Canada indicates that improvement in mobility is a high unmet need in MS. Physicians believe that more than half of their MS patients suffer from impaired mobility and the percentage is higher when patients are asked directly.
Lastly, our hemophilia pipeline has also made significant progress. In collaboration with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, we recently decided to advance our long-acting intravenous recombinant factor VIII Fc candidate in hemophilia A to the registrational phase. The decision to advance the program is based on promising data from the Phase I/IIa open-label, safety, dose-escalation and pharmacokinetic study in 16 severe previously treated hemophilia A patients and dose levels. 
There were no signs of injection side reactions, inhibitor development or anti-recombinant factor VIII Fc drug antibodies in the single-dose study. We will present a detailed results of this trial at an upcoming meeting. In June, the European Medicine Agency issued a positive opinion regarding that Orphan drug application for recombinant factor VIII Fc. A final decision is expected in the coming months. We’re excited about the pace with which this program has moved and we’re hoping to start the registrational trial before the end of the year.
Last week, we shared important data on our recombinant factor IX Fc program after World Federation of Hemophilia meeting in Buenos Aires. Data presented from the Phase I/II factor IX study indicated that recombinant factor IX Fc was well tolerated and demonstrated in approximately three-fold increase in half-light compared to historical data for BeneFIX, which would allow for a reduced dosing frequency of once weekly or less. Patient enrollment for B-LONG, which is the registrational trial for our long-acting, factor IX candidate in hemophilia B continues to progress well and we expect data read out in 2012.
In conclusion, our R&D organization continues to execute on our pipeline and make progress on our TYSABRI risk stratification efforts. Moreover, we’re gearing up to potentially file five new products for regulatory approval over the next three years. Our efforts position us well for future growth and we look forward to providing you updates on new developments in the quarters ahead. 
With that, I will now pass the call over to Paul Clancy, our CFO.

I’ll review our second quarter financial results, discuss our business performance and provide comments regarding our full-year outlook.As a reminder, during the second quarter of 2009, we recorded a $110 million expense related to the ex-U",2052,"Thanks Al. I’ll review our second quarter financial results, discuss our business performance and provide comments regarding our full-year outlook.
As a reminder, during the second quarter of 2009, we recorded a $110 million expense related to the ex-US rates to Fampridine. This increased R&D expense, impacted the tax rate, and reduced our EPS in Q2 2009. I simply point this out to keep that in mind for year-over-year comparisons.
Our GAAP financials are provided in tables one and two of the earnings release. Table three includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter were $53 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, $10 million for stock comp expense, offset by $15 million tax impact on these items. Our GAAP diluted EPS was $1.12 in the second quarter of 2010.
Now, I'll move on to the non-GAAP P&L operating performance of Biogen Idec, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business and set operational goals.
Our Q2 2010 non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.31. Before we move through the detail for the second quarter, let me provide four introductory thoughts. First, Q2 was characterized by a number of items specific to this quarter, both positive and negative to the P&L. Specifically, there were three items of note benefiting revenue, including a change in our estimate for healthcare reform on RITUXAN, a one-time gain on RITUXIMAB rest of world royalties and contract manufacturing revenue from the sale of Amevive products. 
There were two items of note unfavorably impacting expenses, including that the daclizumab $30 million milestone and charges related to our planned facility shutdown. I’ll provide detail on each of these as I walk down the P&L. These items are also itemized in the financial worksheets including in our earnings presentation slides. 
Second, we made significant progress on the share repurchase program authorized by our Board in April 2010, reducing the share count in returning cash to shareholders. Third, while the positives outweigh the negatives even without the items I just mentioned, the quarter was very strong financially. Revenue growth was solid and we delivered earnings leverage. 
And, fourth, the key operating metrics in the business were solid. Most notably, we increased the rate of growth for patient as in TYSABRI, made excellent progress on the TYSABRI risk stratification trials as outlined by Al, continued to progressively stage pipeline and delivered solid growth from our international AVONEX business. 
Now, let’s move through the second quarter results in a bit more detail, starting with revenues. Total revenues for the second quarter were $1.2 billion, an increase of 11% over the second quarter of 2009. Q2 worldwide AVONEX product revenue was $628 million, a 6% increase over Q2 2009. US AVONEX product revenue in the second quarter was $371 million, a 1% increase over Q2 2009. Inventory in the channel ended just under two weeks in the second quarter, slightly below the first quarter of 2010. 
In Q2 2010, price increases offset a 7% decline in US units sold versus Q2 2009. However, on a sequential basis, units sold increased by 4%. It’s nice to see an increase in US units sales on a sequential quarterly basis, but still premature to draw conclusions. Our US AVONEX team is executing on its plan to improve units and market share performance. 
This includes increasing AVONEX’s share of voice with greater sales effort, improving customer segmentation and targeting, hiring senior level outside sales and marketing leaders, driving patient persistency with nurse initiatives, elucidating the scientific data on AVONEX’s long-term safety and efficacy, and driving a much stronger sense of pride and accountability, area-by-area and region-by-region. While much of this is blocking and tackling, we do feel these are the core ingredients needed.
Moving to AVONEX international, international AVONEX product revenue was $257 million, an increase of 14% over second quarter of 2009. In Q2 2010, units sold outside the US increased by approximately 6% as compared to prior year. Included in the international AVONEX product revenue was a $15 million gain from hedging. Let me pause here and take a moment to explain our hedging approach as we did manage to mitigate the impact of the weakening Euro in Q2. 
Our practice has been to hedge a portion of our projected international revenues using forward contracts. The P&L also has some natural hedge with our international sales and R&D expense. Because of the profitability inherent in each brand, we assign a larger portion of the hedge to AVONEX than to TYSABRI. Generally speaking, we enter into contract after each quarter, so the quarter one year in advance. Our hedges in the most recent second quarter were entered into during Q3 2009 at a weak rate in the dollar. This created the favorable hedge gains. 
Now moving to TYSABRI, second quarter worldwide TYSABRI and market product sales were $298 million, a 17% increase over Q2 2009. Product sales for Biogen Idec were $219 million. As of the end of June, we had approximately 52,700 patients on therapy, including about 600 in clinical trials. This translates into net patient adds of approximately a 185 per week this quarter, more than 20% above last quarter. In the US, in market, TYSABRI sales totaled a $145 million for the second quarter, a 16% increase over Q2 2009, and a 7% increase sequentially. Biogen Idec booked $62 million of this revenue. US TYSABRI unit sales increased 15% year-over-year and 9% on a sequential basis.
In the US, where we sell TYSABRI to Elan, the net price declined on a sequential quarter basis. This is due to the fact that we used material that was previously expensed to R&D. And as a result, we lowered our purchase price to reflect this. This lower US TYSABRI price for Biogen Idec was offset by a lower cost of goods resulting in a benefit on the gross margin and bottom line.
As of the end of June, we estimate that we now have approximately 26,200 patients on therapy in the US. This translates into net patient adds of approximately 77 per week this quarter in the US, more than 40% above Q1. Based on the data from our touch patient registry and follow-ups with physicians, our estimate of the share of US patients who are on treatment suspension or ultimate dosing remains below 10%, unchanged from the first quarter.
Q2 international TYSABRI product revenue was a $157 million, a 21% increase over prior year. This total includes a $5 million gain from hedging. International TYSABRI unit sales increased 28% year-over-year and 6% on a sequential basis. As of the end of June, we estimate that we now have approximately 26,000 patients on therapy outside the US. This translates into net patient adds of approximately a 108 per week this quarter, more than 15% above the Q1 average.
In the second quarter, FUMADERM was $12 million and corporate partner revenue for the second quarter were $17 million, which includes revenue earned from Amevive contract manufacturing.
Now moving on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues, referred to as revenue from unconsolidated joint business, we recorded $306 million in revenues for the quarter, an increase of a 11% on a year-over-year basis. I’ll walk through each of the three components comprising the revenue from RITUXAN.
First, our share of the net US RITUXAN profits. Net US RITUXAN sales were $707 million in the second quarter of 2010. Our Q2 profit share from that business was $228 million, up 15% versus prior year as we experienced lower clinical trial expenses. 
In addition, results for the second quarter were favorably impacted by a $9 million change in estimated reserves which were recorded in the prior quarter related to healthcare reform. This change in estimate is driven by our expectation now that fewer entities will be eligible for enrollment in the 340B program. 
Second, we receive revenue on sales of RITUXIMAB outside the US. In Q2, this was $61 million. This total includes $21 million for cumulative underpayment of royalties owed to us by Genentech on rest of the world RITUXAN sales. This was a one-time benefit recorded in Q2. Excluding this payment, royalties were down as expected from country-by-country expiry. 
Third, the second quarter, we were reimbursed $18 million for selling and developing costs incurred related to RITUXAN. Royalties were $30 million for the second quarter of 2010, a 20% increase versus prior year. 
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L which includes the adjustments that I described earlier. Q2 COGS were $107 million or 9% of revenues, the shutdown of our RTP manufacturing facility for plant maintenance and scheduled upgrades increased COGS by $7 million, and COGS also increased due to the end of these contract manufacturing activity.
Q2 R&D expense was $328 million or 27% of revenues. R&D expense increased over prior quarter due to a $30 million milestone to FACET for enrollment of the first patient in the DECIDE trial. Q2 SG&A expense was $252 million or 21% of revenue. Our SG&A expense as a percent of revenues may average as much as 22% in total for 2010 as we make investments require to drive the performance of the MS franchise. 
Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $63 million for the quarter. Other income and expense for the quarter was a gain of $1 million. 
I’m pleased to report that we’ve made significant progress towards completing the $1.5 billion share repurchase plan we announced in April of this year. During the second quarter, we repurchased and retired 20.8 million shares at a total cost of $1 billion. The pace of this share repurchase program exceeded expectations largely due to a period of weak biotech evaluations. 
Our cash and marketable securities ended the quarter at $1.5 billion. Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25%. The decreased year-to-year in our tax rate was primarily a result of an unusually high tax rate last year due to the impact of the agreement with a Acorda Therapeutics. And during 2010, we also had a favorable impact from an increase in the US manufacturers’ tax deduction and increased in Orphan drug credits and benefit in international affiliates. This brings us to our Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were a $1.31.
I’ll now take a moment to update you on our 2010 guidance. We expect 2010 revenue growth in the mid single digits unchanged from previous guidance. Based upon our latest estimates, we expect that our revenue impact from US Healthcare Reform to be about a 1% impacts on revenue versus our previous estimate of 2%. More specifically, our estimate is at across all products. The impact will be $40 million to $60 million, which is below the range we provided during the Q1 call. 
Outside the US, we’ve had recently announced price reductions in Germany, Greece, and Spain, which were modestly larger than we had planned. We continue to monitor the situation closely, but currently expect to manage the downward pressure on revenues. And we’re working hard to mitigate the impact of new competition in the US with the sales and marketing efforts outlined. As a result, on balance, we continue to aim for mid single digit revenue growth.
We expect core operating expense in the low single digits, also unchanged from previous guidance. SG&A expense is more likely to be at the high end of our previous 20% to 22% of revenue, due to the commercial investments needed. Nevertheless, as a results of the progress on the share repurchase program, we’re revising our 2010 full-year GAAP EPS guidance to above $3.82 and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to above $4.70. This excludes any unplanned for business development activities.
So, in summary, the second quarter was a very strong quarter financially with solid revenue growth and sound earnings leverage. We made significant progress on the share repurchase authorized by our Board, returning cash to shareholders, and the key operating metrics in the business were solid. Most notably, we increased the rate of patient adds on TYSABRI, made excellent progress on the risk stratification trials, and progressed the late-stage pipeline.
With that, I’ll now hand the call over to George, for this closing comments.

Now having said that, the realization of that potential is dependent on our ability to execute, making sure that we move aggressively and thoughtfully, to maximize the benefits that our compounds can provide the patients and the returns that they can provide to our investors is the top priority here.
As Paul stated, the company began more aggressive marketing efforts at the beginning of the year and will continue to strengthen the focus on AVONEX and push-forward with patient stratification to make sure that both AVONEX and TYSABRI reach the maximum number of appropriate patients.
I’m also pleased to have several high potential compounds in development. And, again, we have to focus on the high potential part of the pipeline and make sure that we execute.

Our - we have a number of currencies that we deal with, but the Euro is largely predictive of our P&L, because of the amount of business in Europe and because many of other currencies follow that. On a quarter - a sequential quarter basis, we’re looking at a spot rate that went down 7%. And the impact on our business was about that across AVONEX, TYSABRI, and a little bit on FUMADERM. So we had a downdraft that was driven by the FX rates of about 7% on our international business or $27 million. 
Our hedge gains managed to offset that on - by about $20 million. So, the international business in essence had a 7% headwind from FX. We overcame a bit of that on the top line and then the combination of price, volume, and mix increased revenue by about $16 million for the international business. And then, as I had noted, the impact of foreign exchange that we have a natural hedge from our operating expenses created a little bit of an upside on a quarter-to-quarter basis by about $10 million and all of that is on a pretax basis. Hopefully, that helps.

So out of that information, we’re not seeing a very meaningful change in discontinuation. And, in fact, in the second quarter, it actually improved ever so modestly, but certainly nothing to build a trend. 
As we had talked about before, I think that what we saw in November, December, January, February in terms of the trough, I think we do point to kind of the label discussions that were underway on both sides of the Atlantic with the FDA as well as the E&A and that probably likely caused a pause which we’ve now come out of that and feel very good about.

But I worked that bear for many years and we got factor VIII, recombinant factor VIII on the market was the first recombinant factor VIII replacing the plasma drive was my unit that did that there. I can tell you that the frequency of administration is a major consideration for patients with hemophilia and providing continuous coverage in a prophylactic setting is important. And I don’t know the current percentage, but I do know that that percentage is affected by the convenience of administration. So with a longer acting factor VIII, we could expect to see an uptick in the prophylactic use of the compound, I would speculate.
The factor IX, long-acting factor IX with a threefold longer half life if that is worn out in the Phase III trial, that really does provide a meaningful benefit for those patients. The other part of this obviously is the safety of the compounds and the you know some hemophilia patients developed neutralizing antibodies against the clotting factors, factor VIII or factor IX, and so we’ll continue to monitor for the presence of those antibodies as well.

I think each patient should be treated individually, their own set of issues that lead to a benefit risk assessment. And so, I would never want to tell a doctor for giving advice based on a single risk factor. If their MS is severe enough and they haven’t responded to other treatments, they should still consider TYSABRI. And so it’s an individual benefit risk decision.

I'll give a brief update on the quarter. Al Sandrock will give you an R&D update. And then Paul Clancy will go through the business and financial results for the quarter, and I'll come back at the end for a few closing remarks. 
So briefly, I'm pleased to report that Biogen Idec had a solid second quarter. Revenues were $1.21 billion, up 11% versus Q2 of '09. And as we'll hear from Paul in a few minutes, we're revising our 2010 EPS guidance upwards. I'm also pleased to report that after only a few days here, I'm impressed by the willingness and in fact the eagerness, as well as the ability of the people here to move the company forward aggressively.
In the coming months, we'll focus on the three priorities that I outlined a few weeks ago, defending and expanding the Commercial business, taking a hard look at R&D to ensure that we maximize the return on our investment and infusing a sense of urgency in all parts of the organization. Commercially, that means doing everything that we can to protect and expand our AVONEX franchise, including a vigorous program to address the likely approval of oral MS [multiple sclerosis] compound. 
I'm pleased to report that AVONEX unit sales x U.S. grew 6% versus Q2 '09. And while unit sales inside the U.S. decreased 7% in the same time period, there was a 4% increase in U.S. AVONEX unit sales in Q2 compared to Q1. While the numbers are encouraging, it's a little early to conclude that our newly invigorated marketing efforts led by Dr. Francesco Granata are paying off. The unit sales of AVONEX will continue to be a major focus for us as we move forward. And as you'll year from Paul Clancy, we've begun an aggressive program towards that end.
Making sure that we identify the proper subsets of patients for TYSABRI is also of crucial importance. TYSABRI is an extremely efficacious drug that can be life-changing for many MS patients. I'm pleased that during Q2, there was an average of 185 net new patients taking TYSABRI each week. I believe that this number reflects the recognition of the remarkable efficacy of TYSABRI. 
That being said, we owe it to patients to identify those subsets of patients who can safely take TYSABRI with reduced concern about developing PML. The JC virus assay that the company is testing is likely to be an important step in that direction.
And as you know, all 17 patients who develop PML and for whom serum was available prior to the onset of the disease has been positive in this assay. The ongoing STRATIFY 1 and STRATIFY 2 trials are intended to confirm the percentage of MS patients who test positive in this assay and to further explore the relationship between the results in the assay and the risk of developing PML. If, as we postulate, PML develops predominantly or exclusively in patients who test positive in the assay, patients who test negative could use TYSABRI with reduced concern about developing PML. That could lead to improved therapy for any MS patients. 
Today, I'm happy to say that during the second quarter, enrollment in the STRATIFY 1 trial is completed, and at the end of the quarter, over 700 patients have been enrolled in the STRATIFY 2 trial.
As you know, we have our own oral compound, BG-12, in development. The DEFINE and CONFIRM trials for BG-12 are on track and both are scheduled to be completed in 2011. Additionally, during Q2, we began the trial of BG-12 in combination with Interferon and with glatiramer acetate. The Phase II efficacy and tolerability of BG-12 raise the possibility that combinations of the compound and other MS agents could lead to enhanced efficacy for many MS patients. And this trial is intended to begin to address that possibility. Personally, I'm enthusiastic about this possibility because if positive, the results could lead to enhanced therapy for many MS patients and, of course, to increase revenues for the company as well.
Also, during Q2, we reached agreement with the FDA on a special protocol assessment for the advanced study of PEGylated Interferon, advances a one-year placebo-controlled trial testing the impact on annual relapse rate of PEGylated Interferon every four weeks and every two weeks. 
Finally, we made progress in both of our hemophilia projects, long-acting Factor IX and long-acting Factor VIII. If the Phase III trials of these compounds confirm our early data and demonstrate longer duration of action in existing products with an acceptable safety profile, these products will lead to more convenient dosing for thousands of patients with hemophilia.
Al Sandrock and Paul Clancy will give more details on our business in a moment. I just want to conclude by saying that I'm happy to be here. I sense in the company a strong desire to move forward aggressively and decisively. And I'm looking forward to working with the management team and the board to better serve our patients, grow our business and generate increased value for our shareholders. 
So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Al Sandrock for a review of our R&D activities."

Before I begin, I just wanted to say that my colleagues and I in the R&D organization are very excited about George's arrival here. His passion for scientific excellence and innovation motivates all of us who believe that science is at the heart of our business. I'll be providing an update on the pipeline a bit later, but let me begin with our TYSABRI risk-stratification efforts.
As I have mentioned before, one of our goals has been to provide prescribers with tools they can identify individuals who might be at risk for PML when taking TYSABRI. We began with the premise that only patients who have been infected with the JC virus are at risk of developing PML. 
Our hypothesis is that our two-step serologic assay that detects antibodies against JCV will be informative in estimating the risk of developing PML for patients receiving TYSABRI. Based on testing nearly 2,000 MS patients from STRATA and TYGRIS studies, we find that approximately 50% of MS patients are zero positive with our assay. We currently estimate that our assay has a false negative rate of about 2.5%. 
When we tested archived samples that were available from 17 patients who developed PML while on TYSABRI, all 17 tested positive with our assay. These samples have been collected 16 to 180 months prior to the onset of PML for various reasons, including participation in clinical studies and national registries. This antibody status were not a risk factor for developing PML. One would have expected that roughly half of these 17 patients would've been antibody-positive. So we believe that finding all 17 to be positive is extremely unlikely to be due to chance.
Encouraged by these preliminary data, we have initiated two studies to test our hypothesis that the anti-JCV tests that we have developed would be helpful to clinicians as risk-stratification tools. These studies are called STRATIFY 1 and 2, both of which are being conducted in the United States. 
As George mentioned, STRATIFY 1 is now fully enrolled and STRATIFY 2 is off to a great start, with more than 700 patients enrolled at over 90 sites around the United States. 
This study, which will enroll a total of 8,000 to 24,000 patients, will provide an estimate of the risk of PML in TYSABRI patients who test negative in our assay. Our hypothesis is that those who test negative in our assay will have a lower risk of PML than those who test positive. We plan to show preliminary data from STRATIFY 1 at the ECTRIMS meeting in October of this year. Also, our manuscript on the anti-JCV assay methodology and its potential use as a risk-stratification tool has been accepted for publication in the Annals of Neurology and will be coming our in approximately six weeks.
We also want to update you on a change to the U.S. TYSABRI label that we, along with our partner, Elan, have just made. After a thorough evaluation of our post-marketing surveillance data, we have concluded that the risk of PML is increased in patients who've been treated with an immunosuppressant prior to receiving TYSABRI. This increased risk appears to be independent of treatment duration, and there was a broad range in the time interval between the discontinuation of the prior immunosuppressant and the TYSABRI initiation. Recall that the original label had warned that patients receiving TYSABRI should not be treated with concomitant immunosuppressants. We have added an additional warning about the prior use of these drugs to the existing warning.
Based on data from the TYGRIS observational study, only 13% of U.S. patients and 24% of x U.S. patients have had prior immunosuppressant use, whereas about half of the PML cases had previously received these drugs. Thus, there was a disproportionately higher representation of prior immunosuppressant use in the PML cases. The new label changes were posted online as of July 15. Overall, we continue to learn more about factors associated with the risk of PML, and we are looking forward to providing data to the MS community to help with their decision making for treatment choices.
Now I will turn to the progress we've made on our pipeline. We currently have eight programs in late-stage development or in registration. Four are in MS and four in other indications. We continue to make good progress on these programs and expect data on some of them as early as next year. 
Let me start with our late-stage MS pipeline. Last month, we and our partner, Abbott, announced enrollment of the first patient into the Phase III trial of daclizumab. The DECIDE study is a two-year study in relapsing remitting MS comparing the effect of daclizumab on annualized relapse rate with beta Interferon as the comparator. Also, during the quarter, we completed our formal discussions with the FDA. And I am pleased to report that this trial is being conducted under a special protocol assessment.
As George mentioned, we recently started a Phase II BG-12 combination study called EXPLORE, which will evaluate whether adding BG-12 can help patients whose MS progresses despite treatment with Interferon or Copaxone. BG-12 offers a promising safety and efficacy profile based on its unique mechanism of action, and thus, maybe a suitable medication to combine with these first-line therapies. We also continue to make good progress on both registrational studies of BG-12 in the monotherapy setting and expect data from the defined study during the first half of 2011 and from the CONFIRM study during the second half of 2011.
Site activation and patient enrollment continues to progress for the advanced study of PEGylated Interferon beta-1a. During the quarter, we completed our formal discussions with the FDA. And so, as George mentioned, this trial is being conducted under a special protocol assessment.
Turning to the rest of the pipeline. We recently reviewed the data from two Phase II trials, one of BG-12 in rheumatoid arthritis; and the second, Interferon beta-1a in Ulcerative Colitis. After an extensive review of the data, we have determined that the results of these studies are not supportive of advancing either of these programs further. In addition, we, along with our partner, Vernalis,  recently made the decision to discontinue development of Vipadenant, our A2A receptor antagonist for Parkinson's disease, in favor of an alternate next-generation compound, which we called BIIB034. Our decision was based on a review of the findings and preclinical toxicology studies of Vipadenant and not the Phase II clinical studies which were positive. We continued to move ahead with the backup compound BIIB034, which was designed to address the chemical structural liabilities that may have led to the toxicity seen with Vipadenant. 
We continue to make progress on our regulatory efforts on two fronts, with RITUXAN and with prolonged release Fampridine tablets. The U.S. regulatory filing for RITUXAN and ANCA-associated vasculitis remains on track for the second half of this year. The RAVE [Rituximab for ANCA-Associated Vasculitis] study, which was supported by Biogen Idec and our partner, Roche, was conducted by an international consortium at the NIH. Data from this study was recently published in the July issue of the New England Journal of Medicine and demonstrated that RITUXAN treatment was as effective as cyclophosphamide, which is the current standard of care, in inducing disease remission at six months in patients with severe AAV. RAVE also showed that patients who entered the trial with recurrent severe disease relapse responded better to RITUXAN than to the standard of care.
Also in this quarter, the FDA accepted our sBLA filing for RITUXAN as maintenance therapy in previously untreated follicular NHL based on positive results of from the PRIMA study. The FDA action date is January 29, 2011.
We are excited about the progress of prolonged release Fampridine tablets due to the regulatory processes x U.S. and look forward to updating you on our plans to bring prolonged release Fampridine tablets to patients in these geographies at the appropriate time. Prolonged release Fampridine tablets have the potential to offer MS patients increased independence and improved confidence, as patients improve their walking ability. Our market research in Europe and Canada indicates that improvement in mobility is a high unmet need in MS. Physicians believe that more than half of their MS patients suffer from impaired mobility, and the percentage is higher when patients are asked directly.
Lastly, our hemophilia pipeline has also made significant progress. In collaboration with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, we recently decided to advance our long-acting intravenous recombinant Factor VIII Fc candidate in hemophilia A to the registrational phase. The decision to advance the program was based on promising data from the Phase I/2a open-label safety dose escalation and pharmacokinetic study in 16 severe previously treated hemophilia A patients. 
Recombinant Factor VIII Fc was well tolerated in the study and demonstrated a prolonged half-life compared to Advate across all patients and dose levels. There were no signs of injection site reactions, inhibitor development or anti-recombinant Factor VIII Fc drug antibodies in the single-dose study. We will present detailed results of this trial in an upcoming medical meeting. 
In June, the European Medicines Agency issued a positive opinion regarding the orphan drug application for recombinant Factor VIII Fc. A final decision is expected in the coming months. We are excited about the pace with which this program has moved, and we are hoping to start the registrational trial before the end of the year.
Last week, we shared important data in our recombinant Factor IX Fc program at the World Federation of Hemophilia meeting in Buenos Aires. Data presented from the Phase I/2 Factor IX study indicated that recombinant Factor IX Fc was well tolerated and demonstrated in approximately threefold increase in half-life compared to historical data for BeneFIX, which would allow for a reduced dosing frequency of once weekly or less. Patient enrollment for B-LONG, which is the registrational trial of our long-acting Factor IX candidate in hemophilia B continues to progress well, and we expect data readout in 2012.
In conclusion, our R&D organization continues to execute on our pipeline and make progress on our TYSABRI risk-stratification efforts. Moreover, we are gearing up to potentially file five new products for regulatory approval over the next three years. Our efforts position us well for future growth and we look forward to providing you updates on new developments in the quarters ahead. With that, I will now pass the call over to Paul Clancy, our CFO."
29726,108755866,67892,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-20-2010",2010-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Al.

As a reminder, during the second quarter of 2009, we recorded $110 million expense related to the x U.S. r",2045,"Thanks, Al. I'll review our second quarter financial results, discuss our business performance and provide comments regarding our full year outlook. As a reminder, during the second quarter of 2009, we recorded $110 million expense related to the x U.S. rights for Fampridine. This increased R&D expense, impacted the tax rate and reduced our EPS in Q2 2009. I simply point this out to keep that in mind for year-over-year comparisons. 
Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. 
The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter were $53 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles; $10 million for stock comp expense, offset by $15 million tax impact on these items. Our GAAP diluted EPS was $1.12 in the second quarter of 2010. 
Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP P&L operating performance of Biogen Idec, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business and set operational goals. Our Q2 2010 non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.31. Before we move to the detail for the second quarter, let me provide four introductory thoughts. First, Q2 was characterized by a number of items specific to this quarter, both positive and negative to the P&L. Specifically, there were three items of note benefiting revenue, including a change in our estimate for healthcare reform on the RITUXAN, a one-time gain on the Rituximab rest of the world royalties and contract manufacturing revenue from the sale of AMEVIVE product. 
There were two items of note unfavorably impacting expenses, including the daclizumab $30 million milestone and charges related to our planned facility shutdown. I'll provide details on each of these as I walk down the P&L. These items are also itemized in the financial worksheets including in our earnings presentation slides.
Second, we made significant progress on the share repurchase program authorized by our board in April 2010, reducing the share count in returning cash to shareholders. Third, while the positives outweigh the negatives, even without the items I just mentioned, the quarter was very strong financially. Revenue growth was solid and we delivered earnings leverage. And the fourth, the key operating metrics in the business were solid. Most notably, we increased the rate of growth for patient adds in TYSABRI; made excellent progress on the TYSABRI risk-stratification trials, as outlined by Al; continued to progress the late-stage pipeline; and delivered solid growth from our international AVONEX business.
Now let's move to the second quarter results in a bit more detail, starting with revenues. Total revenues for the second quarter were $1.2 billion, an increase of 11% over the second quarter of 2009. Q2 worldwide AVONEX product revenue was $628 million, a 6% increase over Q2 2009. U.S. AVONEX product revenue in the second quarter was $371 million, a 1% increase over Q2 2009. Inventory in the channel ended just under two weeks in the second quarter, slightly below the first quarter of 2010.
In Q2 2010 price increases offset a 7% decline in U.S. units sold versus Q2 2009. However, on a sequential basis, units sold increased by 4%. It's nice to see an increase in U.S. unit sales on a sequential quarterly basis, but still premature to draw conclusions. 
Our U.S. AVONEX team is executing on its plan to improve unit and market share performance. This includes increasing AVONEX's share of voice with greater sales effort, improving customer segmentation and targeting, hiring senior-level outside sales and marketing leaders, driving patient persistency with nurse initiatives, elucidating the scientific data on AVONEX as long-term safety and efficacy and driving a much stronger sense of pride and accountability, area-by-area and region-by-region. While much of this is blocking and tackling, we do feel these as the core ingredients needed.
Moving to AVONEX International. International AVONEX product revenue was $257 million, an increase of 14% over second quarter of 2009. In Q2 2010, units sold outside the U.S. increased by approximately 6% as compared to prior year. Included in the international AVONEX product revenue was a $15 million gain from hedging. Let me pause here and take a moment to explain our hedging approach, as we did manage to make to mitigate the impact of the weakening euro in Q2.
Our practice has been to hedge a portion of our projected international revenues using forward contracts. The P&L also has some natural hedge with our international sales and R&D expense. Because of the profitability inherent in each brand, we assign a larger portion of the hedge to AVONEX than to TYSABRI. Generally speaking, we enter into contract after each quarter for the quarter one year in advance. Our hedges in the most recent second quarter were entered into during Q3 2009 at a week [ph] rate in the dollar. This created the favorable hedge gains.
Now moving to TYSABRI. Second quarter worldwide TYSABRI in-market product sales were $298 million, a 17% increase over Q2 2009. Product sales for Biogen Idec were $219 million. As of the end of June, we had approximately 52,700 patients on therapy, including about 600 in clinical trials. This translates into net patient adds of approximately 185 per week this quarter, more than 20% above last quarter.
In the U.S., in-market TYSABRI sales totaled 145 million for the second quarter, a 16% increase over Q2 2009 and a 7% increase sequentially. Biogen Idec booked $62 million of this revenue. U.S. TYSABRI unit sales increased 15% year-over-year and 9% on a sequential basis.
In the U.S. where we sell TYSABRI to Elan, the net price declined on a sequential-quarter basis. This is due to the fact that we used material that was previously expensed to R&D. And as a result, we lowered our purchase price to reflect this. This lower U.S. TYSABRI price for Biogen Idec was offset by a lower cost of goods, resulting in a benefit on the gross margin and bottom line.
As of the end of June, we estimate that we now have approximately 26,200 patients on therapy in the U.S. This translates into net patient adds of approximately 77 per week this quarter in the U.S., more than 40% above Q1. Based on the data from our TOUCH patient registry and follow-ups with physicians, our estimate of the share of U.S. patients who are on treatment suspension or alternate dosing remains below 10%, unchanged from the first quarter.
Q2 international TYSABRI product revenue was $157 million, a 21% increase over prior year. This total includes a $5 million gain from hedging. International TYSABRI unit sales increased 28% year-over-year and 6% on a sequential basis. As of the end of June, we estimate that we now have approximately 26,000 patients on therapy outside the U.S. This translates into net patient adds of approximately 108 per week this quarter, more than 15% above the Q1 average. In the second quarter, Fumaderm revenue was $12 million, and corporate partner revenue for the second quarter was $17 million, which includes revenue earned from AMEVIVE contract manufacturing.
Now moving on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues, referred to as revenue from unconsolidated joint business. We recorded $306 million in revenue for the quarter, an increase of 11% on a year-over-year basis. I'll walk through each of the three components comprising the revenue from RITUXAN.
First, our share of the net U.S. RITUXAN profits. Net U.S. RITUXAN sales were $707 million in the second quarter of 2010. Our Q2 profit share from that business was $228 million, up 15% versus prior year, as we experienced lower clinical trial expenses. In addition, results for the second quarter were favorably impacted by a $9 million change in estimated reserves, which we recorded in prior quarter related to healthcare reform. This change in estimate is driven by our expectation now that fewer entities will be eligible for enrollment in the 340(B) program.
Second, we received revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. And in Q2, this was $61 million. This total includes $21 million for cumulative underpayment of royalties owed to us by Genentech on rest of the world RITUXAN sales. This was a one-time benefit recorded in Q2. Excluding this payment, royalties were down as expected from country-by-country expiry. Third, in the second quarter, we reversed $18 million for selling and developing costs incurred related to RITUXAN. Royalties were $30 million for the second quarter of 2010, a 20% increase versus prior year. 
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L, which includes the adjustments that I described earlier. Q2 COGS were $107 million or 9% of revenues. The shutdown of our RTP manufacturing facility for planned maintenance and scheduled upgrades increased COGS by $7 million. And COGS also increased due to the AMEVIVE contract manufacturing activity. Q2 R&D expense was $328 million or 27% of revenues. R&D expense increased over prior quarter due to a $30 million milestone payment to Facet for enrollment of the first patient in the DECIDE trial. 
Q2 SG&A expense was $252 million or 21% of revenues. Our SG&A expense as a percent of revenues may average as much as 22% in total for 2010, as we make investments required to drive the performance of the MS franchise. Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit-sharing line totaled $63 million for the quarter. Other income and expense for the quarter was a gain of $1 million. 
I'm pleased to report that we've made significant progress towards completing the $1.5 billion share repurchase plan we announced in April of this year. During the second quarter, we repurchased and retired 20.8 million shares at a total cost of $1 billion. The pace of this share repurchase program exceeded expectations largely due to a period of weak biotech valuations. Our cash and marketable securities ended the quarter at $1.5 billion.
Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25%. The decrease year-to-year in our tax rate was primarily a result of an unusually high tax rate last year due to the impact of the agreement with Acorda Therapeutics. And during 2010, we also had a favorable impact from an increase in the U.S. manufacturers tax deduction, an increase in orphan drug credits and benefit in international affiliates. This brings us to our Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.31.
I'll now take a moment to update you on our 2010 guidance. We expect 2010 revenue growth in the mid-single digits, unchanged from previous guidance. Based upon our latest estimates, we expect that a revenue impact from U.S. healthcare reform to be about a 1% impact on revenue versus our previous estimate of 2%. More specifically, our estimate is that across all products, the impact will be $40 million to $60 million, which is below the range we've provided during the Q1 call.
Outside the U.S., we've had recently announced price reductions in Germany, Greece and Spain, which were modestly larger than we had planned. We continue to monitor the situation closely, but currently expect to manage the downward pressure on revenues. And we are working hard to mitigate the impact of new competition in the U.S. with the sales and marketing efforts outlined. As a result, on balance, we continue to aim for mid-single-digit revenue growth. 
We expect core operating expense growth in the low-single digits, also unchanged from previous guidance. SG&A expense is more likely to be at the high end of our previous 20% to 22% of revenue due to commercial investments needed. Nevertheless, as a result of the progress on the share repurchase program, we're revising our 2010 full year GAAP EPS guidance to above $3.82 and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to above $4.70. This excludes any unplanned-for business development activities.
So in summary, the second quarter was a very strong quarter financially, with solid revenue growth and sound earnings leverage. We made significant progress on the share repurchase program authorized by our board, returning cash to shareholders, and the key operating metrics in the business were solid. Most notably, we increased the rate of patient adds on TYSABRI, made excellent progress on the risk-stratification trials and progressed the late-stage pipeline. With that, I'll now hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

So I'd like to be the first to congratulate the company here on a solid Q2 performance. The products on which the outperformance has provided real benefit to patients, and I'm quite optimistic about their potential as we move into the future. Now having said that, the realization of that potential is dependent on our ability to execute, making sure that we move aggressively and thoughtfully to maximize the benefits that our compounds can provide to patients and the returns that they can provide to our investors is the top priority here.
As Paul stated, the company began more aggressive marketing efforts at the beginning of the year and will continue to strengthen the focus on AVONEX and push forward with patient stratification to make sure that both AVONEX and TYSABRI reach the maximum number of appropriate patients. I'm also pleased to have several high-potential compounds in development. And again, we have to focus on the high-potential part of the pipeline and make sure that we execute. We're also quite focused on costs, which we need to contain. 
So in the coming months, I will outline steps that we're taking to maximize near-, mid- and long-term revenues at the same time that we keep our costs under control. I look forward to updating you all on our progress as those plans evolve. And with that, we'll close the remarks and be happy to open up the call for questions. Kia?"

Let me try to give you a little bit more detail. We have a number of currencies that we deal with, but the euro is largely predictive of our P&L because of the amount of business in Europe and because many of the other currencies follow that. On a sequential quarter basis, we are looking at a spot rate that went down 7%. And the impact on our business was about that, across AVONEX, TYSABRI and a little bit on Fumaderm. So we had a downdraft that was driven by the FX rates of about 7% on our International business or $27 million. Our hedge gains managed to offset that by about $20 million. So the International business, in essence, had a 7% headwind from FX. We overcame a bit of that on the top line, and the combination of price, volume and mix increased revenue by about $60 million for the International business. And then as I had noted, the impact of foreign exchange that we have a natural hedge from our operating expenses created a little bit of an upside on a quarter-to-quarter basis by about $10 million. And all of that is on a pretax basis. Hopefully that helps."

And in fact, in the second quarter, it actually improved ever so modestly, but certainly nothing to build the trend.

The Factor IX, long-acting Factor IX, with a three-fold longer half-life, if that is borne out in the Phase III trial, that really does provide a meaningful benefit for those patients.

It doesn't seem like that long ago that we're on the Q2 call. I guess time flies when you're having fun. I'm happy to report that Biogen Idec delivered another solid quarter. And financial revenues were $1.2 billion, up 5% versus the third quarter of '09, non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.35, which is a 21% increase year-over-year. And we completed the $1.5 billion share buyback that the Board authorized this April, retiring a total of nearly 30 million shares at an average price of $15.35. During the quarter, we also made considerable progress on three top priorities, growing and expanding the commercial business, taking a hard look at R&D to ensure that we maximize the return in our investment and in choosing the sense of urgency in all parts of the organization. Our MS franchise delivered double-digit year-over-year revenue growth and continues to be the global leader in MS.
Importantly, AVONEX U.S. unit sales increased sequentially for the second straight quarter at the first such performance since 2004. And we just now completed the expansion of our sales force, finished strengthening the skills and competencies of the entire commercial organization and launched a number of new initiatives to keep these areas competitive as we prepare to face new market entrance. So anticipate that the full effect of the actions we've taken have not yet been fully felt.  
Our Neurology, Research and Development organization made some noteworthy advances. Al Sandrock will provide more details later on the call, but here are some highlights. We made significant progress on our TYSABRI risk stratification efforts. Earlier this month at ECTRIMS, we presented interim results from our STRATIFY 1 study, which confirmed earlier data that roughly half of the MS patient population tested positive in our sclerosis collassay for JC virus. For STRATIFY 2, we've made tremendous progress on patient enrollment. And as of October 22, we enrolled over 6,800 patients. At ECTRIMS, along with our partner Roche, we announced positive data from the Phase II study of Ocrelizumab and relapsing remitting MS. Al will go through the data in more detail, but overall, it looks quite impressive.
And as we now announced last week, we reached an agreement with Genentech and Roche to allow them to move Ocrelizumab forward while allowing Biogen Idec to avoid a further concentration of its R&D dollars in Phase III trials in MS, while we maintain our economic interest in the compound. Importantly, we agree that the introduction of Ocrelizumab on to the market would not impact our profit sharing arrangement on RITUXAN. We also agree that the profit sharing arrangements for GA101 and RITUXAN, which were a potential area of dispute in the future. The company's interest are now in line, allowing us to work together to maximize with the collaboration revenues, as well as the benefits to patients. We also diversified our Neurology pipeline. In August, we announced the licensing agreement with Knopp Neurosciences to develop and commercialize for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, and potentially other indications. We expect to initiate this trial during the first half of next year. 
Our hemophilia pipeline also has some positive developments. Last month, the European Commission granted orphan designation to our long acting recombinant factor VIII FC fusion protein . We plan to initiate the registrational trial for this program called A-long by year end. Patient enrollment for B-long, which is the registrational trial for our long acting recombinant Factor IX FC fusion protein in hemophilia B, continues to enroll as expected. And we're on track for data readout in 2012.
Many of you also are interested in the status of our search for Head of R&D. We've identified several accomplished, talented people who are interested in the job and the interview process is underway. I'm confident that we'll end up with a high-quality R&D head. We want to get this done quickly, as quickly as we can, but we also want to make sure to take the time to identify and recruit the best candidate. So it's been a busy three months since our last earnings call. Since my arrival, I've spoken with many of Biogen Idec's employees, visited many of the company sites and talk to most of our major shareholders, business partners and other important constituencies. As a result, I'm more optimistic than ever about the long-term future of Biogen Idec. As I've said before, this is a fundamentally good company from which to build. There are many things we can and we must do better, and we will. And thanks to do so, we're being implemented. On our last call, I talked about our efforts to focusing control costs, and we're making great progress on both fronts. We're not yet ready to talk publicly about our plans and any potential actions, and so we won't be answering any questions on that subject today. I can assure you that we're on track to share our plans prior to the end of the year, consistent with the timeline I laid out on the last call. So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Al Sandrock for details on the progress we've been making in Neurology R&D."

I'll be addressing our late stage of Neurology pipeline a bit later, so let me begin by first updating you on our TYSABRI risk stratification efforts. Earlier this month at ECTRIMS, we made several presentation highlighting the results",1254,"Thank you, George. I'll be addressing our late stage of Neurology pipeline a bit later, so let me begin by first updating you on our TYSABRI risk stratification efforts. Earlier this month at ECTRIMS, we made several presentation highlighting the results of our work on the anti-JCV antibody assay. Today, we have analyzed blood samples from five large MS studies including the STRATA; TYSABRI safety extension study; the predominantly European affirmed Phase III trial of TYSABRI; the North American portion of the TYSABRI Safety Observations Study, called TYGRIS; the independent Swedish MS registry; and the baseline data from the STRATIFY 1 study, which as you know, we implemented this year in the United States in patients either on TYSABRI or considering TYSABRI.
We are pleased to see that the data obtained from these studies have been quite consistent and confirmed the findings which were recently published in the anals of neurology. Let me summarize our findings. We have now tested blood samples from over 5000 MS patients. To our knowledge, this is the largest study of JCV zerology[ph] ever undertaken. Across studies, JCV zero prevalence ranges from approximately 50% to 60%. In all studies, zero prevalence is lower in females than in males, which is consistent with previously published reports. Zero prevalence increases with age, also in keeping with the published literature. We have found that prior immunosuppressant use has no bearing on JC virus zero prevalence. Moreover, TYSABRI exposure does not appear to affect the prevalence of anti-JCV antibodies. 
Importantly, when we tested archive samples that were available from 20 patients who have developed PML while on TYSABRI, all 20 tested positive by our assay. These samples have been collected 6.5 to 187 months prior to the onset of PML. Based on what we have now learned about JCV in antibody status and MS patient populations, if antibody status were not a risk factor for developing PML, one would've expected their roughly half of these 20 patients would have been antibody positive. So we believe that finding all 20 to be positive is extremely unlikely to be due to chance. In addition, we have tested 31 serum samples taken at the time of, or shortly after PML diagnosis. And all 31 have also tested positive by our assay. Thus, we continue to believe that the anti-JCV antibodies test could be an important risk stratification tool for TYSABRI. We note that another laboratory using a different anti-JCV antibody assay have reported that a few TYSABRI PML patients at the time of diagnosis were only borderline positive or negative by their assay. When we used our own assay to test duplicates of the very same blood samples, we found them all to test positive in our assay, thus, confirming the high sensitivity of our assay for anti-JCV antibodies. One hypothesis that may explain the difference is that all these blood samples were collected after plasma exchange, a procedure which was used to remove TYSABRI from the circulation. This procedure also removes other antibodies so the antibody may be at or below the limit of detection of their assay.
We have had preliminary discussions with both the U.S. and European regulatory authorities about our work on the anti-JCV assay and have shared these and other data with them. As a result of these discussions, we are planning to submit labeling changes to both regulatory agencies by the first quarter of next year. We believe that the 5000 patient data set, coupled with the results from the 20 pre-PML samples that I just described, are sufficiently compelling that it should be included in the information available to patients and physicians. We will continue to update you as we make progress along this front. 
Now, I would like to turn to the rest of our late stage neurology pipeline to update you on our progress during the quarter. Post the result for long release Fampridine tablets at ECTRIMS highlighted improvements in walking speed across the broad range of MS patients and the emerging recognition of the importance of mobility problems facing MS patients. Our market research in Europe and Canada indicates that improvement in mobility is the high unmet need in MS. Physicians believe that more than half of their MS patients suffer from impaired mobility and the percentage is higher when patients are asked directly. We continue to work diligently towards our goal of making prolonged release Fampridine tablets available to MS patients outside of the United States. Our organization is also gearing up for Phase III data readouts and regulatory submissions on our oral MS treatment BG-12. At ECTRIMS, we presented new data on the potential neuro protective properties of BG-12. Oxidative stress is increasingly being recognized as an MS relevant cellular injury mechanism, which contributes to Central Nervous System tissue damage. In primary cultures of human spinal cord astrasite, BG-12 activated the NR-2 pathway and protected cells from death due to oxidative stress.
We are on track for data readouts from the defined study during the first half and from the confirmed study during the second half of next year. Site activation and patient enrollment continues to progress for the advanced study of regulated Interferon beta-1a. There continues to be investigator enthusiasm for the product, which is expected to improve the convenience of Interferon treatment for MS patients, thus, improving patient adherance to therapy. As you will recall, this trial is being conducted under a special protocol assessment from FDA.
SELECT, which is the first of the two registrational trial of daclizumab, is fully enrolled, and we expect data from this trial in the second half of this year. Daclizumab is believed to work by selectively targeting pathogenic autoreactive T cells without causing immune cell depletion. At ECTRIMS, our presentations reported the increase in CD56bright NK cells that occurs with daclizumab treatment and its correlation to the reduction and gadolinium-enhancing lesions in the brain. Thus, daclizumab would represent an entirely noble approach to treating MS. 
We, along with our partner Roche, have also announced positive results from the 24 weeks Phase II trial of Ocrelizumab in patients that's relapsing remitting MS. In this study, Ocrelizumab demonstrated reductions in disease activity as measured by gadolinium-enhancing lesions and relapse rate. Specifically, there was a robust 89% to 96% reduction in enhancing lesions compared to placebo. The reduction in annualized relapse rate at 24 weeks was also significantly lower than placebo with the reduction of 73% to 80%. Clearly, these data point to the potential of Ocrelizumab as a highly efficacious therapy for relapsing remitting MS. 
We continue to diversify our neurology pipeline beyond MS. In August, we announced the licensing agreement with Knopp Neurosciences to develop and commercialize dexpramipexole for the treatment of ALS and potentially other indications. The Phase II data showed favorable dose-related treatment effects and preserving motor function and extending survival. And there is growing interest among ALS investigators as we look ahead to the Phase III trial. Dexpramipexole has received orphan drug designation both in the U.S. and Europe, as well as fast-track designation in the United States. We expect to initiate this trial in the first half of next year.
In conclusion, our R&D organization continues to advance our neurology pipeline and make progress on TYSABRI risk stratification for PML. Our efforts position us well for future growth, and we look forward to providing you with updates on new developments in the quarters ahead. With that, I'll now pass the call over to Dr. Francesco Granata, our Head of Global Commercial Operations."

This is a pleasure for me to join you today and report on a very productive third quarter. As this is my first earnings call, I would like to begin by sharing the three key priorities I've been focused on since I joined the company. Hopefully, that will provide some context as I walk through our Q3 performance.
The key priorities are: to maximize our commercial business with a special focus on turning around the U.S. AVONEX performance; to literally defend our MS franchise against competition from new therapies; and to strengthen the commercial organization talent. With these priorities in mind, let me begin by reviewing our product performance for Q3 2010, in which combined AVONEX and TYSABRI revenue increased by 10% year-over-year.
Let me start with AVONEX. With wide revenue grew by 11%, this is the third quarter of 2009. We continue to see solid demand growth overseas, and the U.S. is starting to show signs of improvement. Outside the U.S., AVONEX unit sales grew by 6% year-over-year. U.S. unit sales grew by 1% sequentially. As George mentioned, this is the first time we have had two consecutive quarters of U.S. AVONEX unit growth since 2004. Why this is too early to draw any firm conclusion? The market performance over the past two quarters appeared to be a break from what has been the plan over the past three years. We have been able to hold market share both in the U.S. and overseas for a few months now.
In the going markets, the result is expected as being an increasing unit growth and positive pull through to the revenue line. 
Moving onto TYSABRI performance, let me preface my comment by saying that I'm going to focus on in-market revenue and demand, while Paul Clancy will provide more detail on how in-market revenue translate into Biogen Idec revenue later in the call. Q3 were wide in market TYSABRI revenue grew by 9%, that was the third quarter of 2009. U.S. in-market revenue grew by 15%, patient grew by 16% and units grew by 6%. Outside the U.S., revenue grew by 4%, however, foreign exchange reduced revenue growth outside the U.S. by 7%. The number of TYSABRI patients outside the U.S. grew by 25%, and unit sales grew by 15%. A decline in patient compared during the fourth quarter of 2009, inventory changes and increased participation in our patient assistance programs close the GAAP between unit demand and patient growth on a year-over-year basis. In early 2010, we instituted a number of educational programs and strengthen our patient assistance programs. These resulted in a stabilization in discontinuation in compliance rates, which have been sustained during the past two quarters. At the same time, we have seen an improvement in the number of U.S. TYSABRI patients ahead.
Looking ahead, we feel that our potential growth catalyst for both AVONEX and TYSABRI. Al Sandrock already mentioned the terrific progress our R&D team is making with TYSABRI risk stratification. If successful, we may be able to identify a large sample population of patients that may be at much lower risk of developing PML. Also, we are seeing strong growth in markets outside the U.S. and Europe. In the third quarter, revenue from these market increased by 18% versus Q3 2009. We have not yet launched TYSABRI in China, Japan or Russia and are just now in the midst of the launch phase in India, Brazil and Argentina. With South East Asia, the Middle East and other Latin American market to follow in 2011. We have only just began ramping up our next phase in India and Latin America and have no AVONEX presence in China and several Southeast Asian markets. So, there are still opportunity for both brands as these markets develops.
We know that there are a lot of questions about the impact of new therapies on our MS franchise. Let me share our view. We believe that both AVONEX and TYSABRI will fair well as the safety, efficacy, polaribility and convenience of new therapies is evaluated in real-life settings. 
With AVONEX, patients and physicians can take comfort in stopping in the sting on a therapy that is well tolerated and is well documented nearly 15 years track of record of safety and efficacy over the cost of 1.4 million patient a year. With TYSABRI, we have a powerful efficacy profile, showing significant reductions in both annual relapse rate and importantly, physical disability progression through well controlled Phase III studies and four years of postmarketing experience. For some patient segment, incremental dosing, convenience may be more important than the established long-term efficacy and safety demonstrated with existing therapies increasing a chronic debilitating disease. These new problems would likely meet to the need of some of the approximately 170,000 patients worldwide who are not on therapy today due to profile of currently available treatment.
Overall, we feel that we have the best offering for MS therapies in the industry. Accordingly, we have announced our sales and marketing capabilities and are now depending the franchise synergy. During the third quarter, we made progress in several ways. First, we have continued to establish a strong focus on the field force, both in terms of share of voice and quality. We have completed the hiring of a number of experienced sales and marketing leaders. We have strengthened the skills and competencies both of our U.S. sales force and across the entire commercial organization. And we have clearly put our self on impact to be in the highest rate in the neurology sales force in the industry. Second, we have further increase the quality and output of our new global marketing teams. In this respect, we resegmented the market to be more customer need focused and position our problems accordingly. Third, we have significantly increased our focus on customers across the organization. We upgraded the tools and resources available to our sales, marketing patient services and managed market functions. And we have launched new nurse initiatives toward support patient consistency and compliance. Lastly, we continue to build on our sustained profitable growth so we have added field force effectiveness and market especially to expand our capabilities in these important areas. In the coming quarters, I will continue to keep you updated on our progress. In summary, we saw a strong revenue growth in Q3 and the second consecutive quarter of stable AVONEX unit demand. Looking ahead, our commercial infrastructure is trying to vigorously defend our MS franchise against new competition while capitalizing on emerging opportunities overseas. With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."

Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release, Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. Let me start with the differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter. First, we incurred $54 million expense related to the amortization of acquired intangibles. Second, we incurred $6 million per stock compensation expense. Third, the Knopp transaction involved purchasing a 30% equity interest and entering into a license agreement for the treatment of ALS. The equity interest resulted in recording in IPR&D charge of $205 million based upon the fair value of the entity, and we incurred a noncontrolling interest offset of $145 million.
And finally, there was a $45 million tax impact on all of these items. Our GAAP diluted EPS were $1.05 in the third quarter of 2010. 
Now move on to the non-GAAP P&L operating performance of Biogen Idec, which we believe that it represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business instead operational goals. Our Q3 2010 non-GAAP diluted EPS were $1.35. Total revenues for the third quarter of 2010 were $1,176,000,000, an increase of 5% over third quarter of 2009. We have a strong quarter commercially with AVONEX and TYSABRI, both increasing unit sales year-over-year, and together, delivering double-digit revenue growth in our MS franchise. These increase in MS revenue was partially offset by a 9% drop in our RITUXAN revenue as our ex-U.S. royalties continues to expire.
Now I'll provide product level detail on our revenue performance. Q3 worldwide AVONEX product revenue was $644 million, an 11% increase over Q3 2009. The U.S. business grew 11% to $387 million in the international AVONEX business, also grew 11% to $257 million. Let me provide insights on some of the key metrics for AVONEX. In the U.S., inventory in the channel ended at 2.2 weeks in the third quarter, slightly above the second quarter, providing a modest benefit. On a sequential basis, as Francesco mentioned, U.S. AVONEX unit increased 1%, solid performance particularly for the third quarter when overall market demand typically softens during the summer months.
Internationally, AVONEX units grew a solid 6% versus prior year. International AVONEX revenue benefited from a $17 million gain from hedging, which largely offset the year-over-year unfavorable impact from exchange rates. 
Moving to TYSABRI. Q3 2010 worldwide TYSABRI in-market product sales were $307 million, a 9% increase over Q3 2009. In the U.S., in-market TYSABRI sales totaled $151 million for the third quarter, a 15% increase over Q3 2009, and a 4% increase sequentially.
And internationally, TYSABRI in-market sales were $156 million, a 4% increase over Q3 2009. I'll again provide insight of some of the key metrics for TYSABRI. As of the end of September, we had approximately 55,100 patients on therapy, including about 600 in clinical trials. Units grew 6% year-over-year for TYSABRI in the U.S. and 15% internationally.
In U.S., a number of factors impacted the results. The price increase at the end of Q2, while favorable, was partially offset by increased discounts and allowances, some tollpay assistance and the impact of accruals for health care reform. In the U.S., levels of inventory in the channel declined by the end of Q3 by 0.5 weeks, resulting in an unfavorable impact of approximately $5 million. In the U.S., we're witnessing a relatively stable compliance rate, specifically the use of drug suspensions and alternative dosing schedule are in the mid-to high-single digit percentage of patients. This percentage while higher than Q3 2009 has been relatively stable throughout all of 2010.
Internationally, TYSABRI product sales were unfavorably impacted by exchange rates on the year-over-year basis by about 7% or approximately $11 million. So while the quarter did experience these impacts, TYSABRI patient evolution continued to perform solidly, growing 2300 patients worldwide for the quarter. TYSABRI product sales for Biogen Idec were $221 million, $61 million in the U.S. and $160 million outside the U.S., which include a $4 million hedge gain. 
In the U.S., we'll resell TYSABRI to the net price decline year-over-year because we lowered our purchase price to reflect the use of product material that was previously expensed to R&D. This lower U.S. TYSABRI price for Biogen Idec is offset by lower COGS, resulting in a modest benefit on the gross margin and the bottom-line. We've largely completed using this previously expense material, so this particular effect on the U.S. price will not carry forward substantially into the fourth quarter. 
Now moving onto the RITUXAN collaboration revenues referred to as revenue from unconsolidated joint business. We recorded $258 million in revenue for the quarter, a decrease of 9% on a year-over-year basis.
I'll walk through each of the three components comprising the revenue from RITUXAN. First, our share of U.S. RITUXAN profits. Net U.S. RITUXAN sales were $675 million in the third quarter, up 1% over prior year. Our profit share from that business was $204 million. Second, we received revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S., and in Q3 2010, this was $38 million. Royalties were down 42% as our 11 year royalty term expires on a country-by-country basis. Third, in the third quarter, we reimbursed $60 million for selling and developing costs incurred related to RITUXAN. 
Moving to royalties. Royal treaties were $36 million for the third quarter of 2010, a 4% increase versus prior year, largely due to an increase in our royalties from the medicines company. Corporate partner revenue for the third quarter was $5 million. 
Now turning to the expense line to the non-GAAP P&L, which includes the adjustments I described earlier. Q3 COGS were $96 million or 8% of revenues. Q3 R&D expense was $316 million or 27% of revenues. R&D expense includes $26 million related to the upfront payment related to the Knopp Neurosciences transaction. Q3 SG&A expense was $241 million or 20% of revenues. Our collaboration profit-sharing lines totaled $64 million in expenses for the quarter.
Q3 other income and expense was a $7 million expense due to the declining yields and cash balances in our marketable securities portfolio. We completed, as George noted, the $1.5 billion share repurchase plan announced this April. During the third quarter, we purchased the retired 9 million shares and a total cost of $468 million. As a result, our fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding were approximately $2 million for the third quarter. We're able to return such a significant amount of cash to our shareholders because of our ability to generate robust cash flow. During the third quarter, we generated $420 million of cash from operating activities, bringing the total to the first three quarters to $1.2 billion. Our cash and marketable securities ended the quarter at $1.4 billion. Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 27%, including approximately $5 million in various discreet items.
The GAAP tax rate was impacted due to transaction in the quarter as certain charges did not generate a tax deduction. This brings us to our Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $1.35, a 21% increase over Q3 2009. Since George's appointment, we've been evaluating the company's strategic priorities in examining additional meanings of maximizing shareholder value. We anticipate announcing the results of these evaluation before the end of the year which may change the company's financial trend. I'll provide detailed financial  guidance for 2010, in conjunction with this communication.
Certainly, we feel very good about the execution of our business objectives for 2010, including being on track to achieve our original goal of mid-single digit revenue growth for the full year. So the third quarter was another strong quarter financially with double-digit earnings per share growth and the completion of the share repurchase program. With that, I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

It's hard to believe that we're sitting here today. Another quarter has passed. It doesn't seem like that long ago that we were on the Q2 call. I guess time flies when you're having fun. I'm happy to report that Biogen Idec delivered another solid quarter. Financially, revenues were $1.2 billion, up 5% versus the third quarter of '09. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.35, which is a 21% increase year-over-year. And we completed the $1.5 billion share buyback that the board authorized this April, retiring a total of nearly 30 million shares at an average price of $50.35. During the quarter, we also made considerable progress on three top priorities, growing and expanding the commercial business, taking a hard look at R&D to ensure that we maximized the return in our investment and infusing a sense of urgency in all parts of the organization. Our MS franchise delivered double-digit year-over-year revenue growth and continues to be the global leader in MS.
Importantly, AVONEX U.S. unit sales increased sequentially for the second straight quarter. That’s the first such performance since 2004. And we just now completed the expansion of our sales force, finished strengthening the skills and competencies of the entire commercial organization and launched a number of new initiatives to keep these areas competitive as we prepare to face new market entrants. So anticipate that the full effect of the actions we've taken have not yet been fully felt.  
Our Neurology, Research and Development organization made some noteworthy advances. Al Sandrock will provide more details later in the call, but here are some highlights. We made significant progress on our TYSABRI risk stratification efforts. Earlier this month at ECTRIMS, we presented interim results from our STRATIFY 1 study, which confirmed earlier data that roughly half of the MS patient population tested positive in our serological assay for JC virus. For STRATIFY 2, we've made tremendous progress on patient enrollment. And as of October 22, we’ve enrolled over 6,800 patients. At ECTRIMS, along with our partner Roche, we announced positive data from the Phase II study of Ocrelizumab in relapsing remitting MS. Al will go through the data in more detail, but overall, it looks quite impressive.
And as we announced last week, we reached an agreement with Genentech and Roche to allow them to move Ocrelizumab forward while allowing Biogen Idec to avoid a further concentration of its R&D dollars in Phase III trials in MS, while we maintain our economic interest in the compound. Importantly, we agreed that the introduction of Ocrelizumab onto the market would not impact our profit sharing arrangement on RITUXAN. We also agreed that the profit sharing arrangements for GA101 and RITUXAN, which were a potential area of dispute in the future. The company's interests are now aligned, allowing us to work together to maximize the collaboration revenues, as well as the benefits to patients. We also diversified our Neurology pipeline. In August, we announced the licensing agreement with Knopp Neurosciences to develop and commercialize dexpramipexole for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, and potentially other indications. We expect to initiate this trial during the first half of next year. 
Our hemophilia pipeline also has some positive developments. Last month, the European Commission granted orphan designation to our long acting recombinant factor VIII FC fusion protein. We plan to initiate the registrational trial for this program called A-long by year end. Patient enrollment for B-long, which is the registrational trial for our long acting recombinant Factor IX FC fusion protein in hemophilia B, continues to enroll as expected. And we're on track for data readout in 2012.
Many of you also are interested in the status of our search for a Head of R&D. We've identified several accomplished, talented people who are interested in the job and the interview process is underway. I'm confident that we'll end up with a high-quality R&D head. We want to get this done quickly, as quickly as we can, but we also want to make sure to take the time to identify and recruit the best candidate. So it's been a busy three months since our last earnings call. Since my arrival, I've spoken with many of Biogen Idec's employees, visited many of the company sites and talked to most of our major shareholders, business partners and other important constituencies. As a result, I'm more optimistic than ever about the long-term future of Biogen Idec. As I've said before, this is a fundamentally good company from which to build. There are many things we can and we must do better, and we will. And plans to do so are being implemented. On our last call, I talked about our efforts to focus and control costs, and we're making great progress on both fronts. We're not yet ready to talk publicly about our plans and any potential actions, and so we won't be answering any questions on that subject today. I can assure you that we're on track to share our plans prior to the end of the year, consistent with the timeline I laid out on the last call. So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Al Sandrock for details on the progress we've been making in Neurology R&D."

Earlier this month at ECTRIMS, we made several presentations highlighting the results of",1244,"Thank you, George. I'll be addressing our late stage Neurology pipeline a bit later, so let me begin by first updating you on our TYSABRI risk stratification efforts. Earlier this month at ECTRIMS, we made several presentations highlighting the results of our work on the anti-JCV antibody assay. To date, we have analyzed blood samples from five large MS studies including the STRATA TYSABRI safety extension study; the predominantly European affirmed Phase III trial of TYSABRI; the North American portion of the TYSABRI Safety Observations Study, called TYGRIS; the independent Swedish MS registry; and the baseline data from the STRATIFY 1 study, which as you know, we implemented this year in the United States in patients either on TYSABRI or considering TYSABRI.
We are pleased to see that the data obtained from these studies have been quite consistent and confirmed the findings which were recently published in the annals of neurology. Let me summarize our findings. We have now tested blood samples from over 5,000 MS patients. To our knowledge, this is the largest study of JCV serology ever undertaken. Across studies, JCV seroprevalence ranges from approximately 50% to 60%. In all studies, seroprevalence is lower in females than in males, which is consistent with previously published reports. Seroprevalence increases with age, also in keeping with the published literature. We have found that prior immunosuppressant use has no bearing on JC virus seroprevalence. Moreover, TYSABRI exposure does not appear to affect the prevalence of anti-JCV antibodies. 
Importantly, when we tested archive samples that were available from 20 patients who had developed PML while on TYSABRI, all 20 tested positive by our assay. These samples had been collected 6.5 to 187 months prior to the onset of PML. Based on what we have now learned about JCV antibody status in MS patient populations, if antibody status were not a risk factor for developing PML, one would've expected that roughly half of these 20 patients would have been antibody positive. So we believe that finding all 20 to be positive is extremely unlikely to be due to chance. In addition, we have tested 31 serum samples taken at the time of, or shortly after, PML diagnosis. And all 31 have also tested positive by our assay. Thus, we continue to believe that the anti-JCV antibody test could be an important risk stratification tool for TYSABRI. We note that another laboratory using a different anti-JCV antibody assay has reported that a few TYSABRI PML patients at the time of diagnosis were only borderline positive or negative by their assay. When we used our own assay to test duplicates of the very same blood samples, we found them all to test positive in our assay, thus confirming the high sensitivity of our assay for anti-JCV antibodies. One hypothesis that may explain the difference is that all these blood samples were collected after plasma exchange, a procedure which was used to remove TYSABRI from the circulation. This procedure also removes other antibodies, so the antibody titers may be at or below the limit of detection of their assay.
We have had preliminary discussions with both the U.S. and European regulatory authorities about our work on the anti-JCV assay and have shared these and other data with them. As a result of these discussions, we are planning to submit labeling changes to both regulatory agencies by the first quarter of next year. We believe that the 5,000 patient data set, coupled with the results from the 20 pre-PML samples that I just described, are sufficiently compelling that it should be included in the information available to patients and physicians. We will continue to update you as we make progress along this front. 
Now I would like to turn to the rest of our late-stage neurology pipeline to update you on our progress during the quarter. Posters on prolonged-release Fampridine tablets at ECTRIMS highlighted improvements in walking speed across the broad range of MS patients and the emerging recognition of the importance of mobility problems facing MS patients. Our market research in Europe and Canada indicates that improvement in mobility is the high unmet need in MS. Physicians believe that more than half of their MS patients suffer from impaired mobility, and the percentage is higher when patients are asked directly. We continue to work diligently towards our goal of making prolonged release Fampridine tablets available to MS patients outside of the United States. Our organization is also gearing up for Phase III data readouts and regulatory submissions on our oral MS treatment BG-12. At ECTRIMS, we presented new data on the potential neuro-protective properties of BG-12. Oxidative stress is increasingly being recognized as an MS relevant cellular injury mechanism, which contributes to central nervous system tissue damage. In primary cultures of human spinal cord astrasite, BG-12 activated the NR-2 pathway and protected cells from death due to oxidative stress.
We are on track for data readouts from the defined study during the first half and from the confirmed study during the second half of next year. Site activation and patient enrollment continues to progress for the advanced study of PEGylated interferon beta-1a. There continues to be investigator enthusiasm for the product, which is expected to improve the convenience of Interferon treatment for MS patients, thus improving patient adherence to therapy. As you will recall, this trial is being conducted under a special protocol assessment from FDA.
SELECT, which is the first of the two registrational trial of daclizumab, is fully enrolled, and we expect data from this trial in the second half of this year. Daclizumab is believed to work by selectively targeting pathogenic autoreactive T cells without causing immune cell depletion. At ECTRIMS, our presentations reported the increase in CD56bright NK cells that occurs with daclizumab treatment and its correlation to the reduction in gadolinium-enhancing lesions in the brain. Thus, daclizumab would represent an entirely novel approach to treating MS. 
We, along with our partner Roche, have also announced positive results from the 24-week Phase II trial of Ocrelizumab in patients with relapsing remitting MS. In this study, Ocrelizumab demonstrated reductions in disease activity as measured by gadolinium-enhancing lesions and relapse rate. Specifically, there was a robust 89% to 96% reduction in enhancing lesions compared to placebo. The reduction in annualized relapse rate at 24 weeks was also significantly lower than placebo with the reduction of 73% to 80%. Clearly, these data point to the potential of Ocrelizumab as a highly efficacious therapy for relapsing remitting MS. 
We continue to diversify our neurology pipeline beyond MS. In August, we announced the licensing agreement with Knopp Neurosciences to develop and commercialize dexpramipexole for the treatment of ALS and potentially other indications. The Phase II data showed favorable dose-related treatment effects in preserving motor function and extending survival. And there is growing interest among ALS investigators as we look ahead to the Phase III trial. Dexpramipexole has received orphan drug designation both in the U.S. and Europe, as well as fast-track designation in the United States. We expect to initiate this trial in the first half of next year.
In conclusion, our R&D organization continues to advance our neurology pipeline and make progress on TYSABRI risk stratification for PML. Our efforts position us well for future growth, and we look forward to providing you with updates on new developments in the quarters ahead. With that, I'll now pass the call over to Dr. Francesco Granata, our Head of Global Commercial Operations."

As this is my first earnings call, I would like to begin by sharing the three key priorities I've been focused on since I",1109,"Thank you, Al, and good morning, everyone. This is a pleasure for me to join you today and report on a very productive third quarter. As this is my first earnings call, I would like to begin by sharing the three key priorities I've been focused on since I joined the company. Hopefully, that will provide some context as I walk through our Q3 performance.
The key priorities are: to maximize our commercial business with a special focus on turning around the U.S. AVONEX performance; to rigorously [ph] defend our MS franchise against competition from new therapies; and to strengthen the commercial organization talent. With these priorities in mind, let me begin by reviewing our product performance for Q3 2010, a period in which combined AVONEX and TYSABRI revenue increased by 10% year-over-year.
Let me start with AVONEX. Worldwide revenue grew by 11% versus the third quarter of 2009. We continue to see solid demand growth overseas, and the U.S. is starting to show signs of improvement. Outside the U.S., AVONEX unit sales grew by 6% year-over-year. U.S. unit sales grew by 1% sequentially. As George mentioned, this is the first time we have had two consecutive quarters of U.S. AVONEX unit growth since 2004. While this is too early to draw any firm conclusion, the market performance over the past two quarters appeared to be a break from what has been the trend over the past three years. We have been able to hold market share both in the U.S. and overseas for a few months now.
In a growing market, the result as expected, has been an increase in unit growth and positive pull-through to the revenue line. 
Moving on to TYSABRI performance, let me preface my comment by saying that I'm going to focus on in-market revenue and demand, while Paul Clancy will provide more detail on how in-market revenue translate into Biogen Idec revenue later in the call. Q3 worldwide in-market TYSABRI revenue grew by 9% versus the third quarter of 2009. U.S. in-market revenue grew by 15%, patient grew by 16% and units grew by 6%. Outside the U.S., revenue grew by 4%. However, foreign exchange reduced revenue growth outside the U.S. by 7%. The number of TYSABRI patients outside the U.S. grew by 25%, and unit sales grew by 15%. A decline in patient companies [ph] during the fourth quarter of 2009, inventory changes and increased participation in our patient assistance programs caused a gap between unit demand and patient growth on a year-over-year basis. In early 2010, we instituted a number of educational programs and strengthened our patient assistance programs. These resulted in a stabilization in discontinuation and compliance rate, which have been sustained during the past two quarters. At the same time, we have seen an improvement in the number of U.S. TYSABRI patient added.
Looking ahead, we feel that our potential growth catalyst for both AVONEX and TYSABRI. Al Sandrock already mentioned the terrific progress our R&D team is making with TYSABRI risk stratification. If successful, we may be able to identify a large sample population of patients that may be at much lower risk of developing PML. Also, we are seeing strong growth in markets outside the U.S. and Europe. In the third quarter, revenue from these market increased by 18% versus Q3 2009. We have not yet launched TYSABRI in China, Japan or Russia and are just now in the midst of the launch phase in India, Brazil and Argentina, with Southeast Asia, the Middle East and other Latin American markets to follow in 2011. We have only just begun ramping up our next phase in India and Latin America and have no AVONEX presence in China and several Southeast Asian markets. So, there is still opportunity for both brands as these markets develop.
We know that there are a lot of questions about the impact of new therapies on our MS franchise. Let me share our view. We believe that both AVONEX and TYSABRI will fare well as the safety, efficacy, affordability and convenience of new therapies is evaluated in real-life settings. 
With AVONEX, patients and physicians can take comfort in starting and  staying on a therapy that is well tolerated and is well documented nearly 15 years track of record of safety and efficacy over the course of 1.4 million patients year. With TYSABRI, we have a product with powerful efficacy profile, showing significant reductions in both annual relapse rate and importantly, physical disability progression through well- controlled Phase III studies and four years of postmarketing experience. For some patient segments, incremental dosing, convenience may be more important than the established long-terms efficacy and safety demonstrated with existing therapies in treating a chronic debilitating disease. These new products will likely meet the need of some of the approximately 170,000 patients worldwide who are not on therapy today due to product profile of currently available treatment.
Overall, we feel that we have the best offering of MS therapies in the industry. Accordingly, we have enhanced our sales and marketing capabilities and are now defending that franchise vigorously. During the third quarter, we made progress in several ways. First, we have continued to establish a strong focus on the field force, both in terms of share voice and quality. We have completed the hiring of a number of experienced sales and marketing leaders. We have strengthened the skills and competencies both of our U.S. sales force and across the entire commercial organization. And we have clearly put our self on a path to be the highest-rated neurology field force in the industry. Second, we have further increased the quality and output of our new global marketing teams. In this respect, we resegmented the market to be more customer need focused and position our products accordingly. Third, we have significantly increased our focus on customers across the organization. We upgraded the tools and resources available to our sales, marketing, patient services and managed market functions. And we have launched new nurse initiatives toward support patient persistency and compliance. Lastly, we continue to build on our sustained profitable growth so we have added field force effectiveness and market access [ph] especially to expand our capabilities in these important areas. In the coming quarters, I will continue to keep you updated on our progress. In summary, we saw strong revenue growth in Q3 and a second consecutive quarter of stable AVONEX unit demand. Looking ahead, our commercial infrastructure is trying to vigorously defend our MS franchise against new competition while capitalizing on emerging opportunities overseas. With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."
29726,114113728,81886,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Francesco. I'll review our 2010 third quarter financial results. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. Let me start with the differences betwe",1320,"Thanks, Francesco. I'll review our 2010 third quarter financial results. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. Let me start with the differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter. First, we incurred $54 million expense related to the amortization of acquired intangibles. Second, we incurred $6 million for stock compensation expense. Third, the Knopp transaction involved purchasing a 30% equity interest and entering into a license agreement for the treatment of ALS. The equity interest resulted in recording in IPR&D charge of $205 million based upon the fair value of the entity, and we incurred a noncontrolling interest offset of $145 million.
And finally, there was a $45 million tax impact on all of these items. Our GAAP diluted EPS were $1.05 in the third quarter of 2010. 
Now I’ll move on to the non-GAAP P&L operating performance of Biogen Idec, which we believe that it represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business and set operational goals. Our Q3 2010 non-GAAP diluted EPS were $1.35. Total revenues for the third quarter of 2010 were $1,176,000,000, an increase of 5% over third quarter of 2009. We had a strong quarter commercially, with AVONEX and TYSABRI both increasing unit sales year-over-year and together, delivering double-digit revenue growth in our MS franchise. This increase in MS revenue was partially offset by a 9% drop in our RITUXAN revenue as our x U.S. royalties continues to expire.
Now I'll provide product-level detail on our revenue performance. Q3 worldwide AVONEX product revenue was $644 million, an 11% increase over Q3 2009. The U.S. business grew 11% to $387 million, and the international AVONEX business also grew 11% to $257 million. Let me provide insight on some of the key metrics for AVONEX. In the U.S., inventory in the channel ended at 2.2 weeks in the third quarter, slightly above the second quarter, providing a modest benefit. On a sequential basis, as Francesco mentioned, U.S. AVONEX unit increased 1%, solid performance particularly for the third quarter when overall market demand typically softens during the summer months.

Internationally, AVONEX units grew a solid 6% versus prior year. International AVONEX revenue benefited from a $17 million gain from hedging, which largely offset the year-over-year unfavorable impact from exchange rates. 
Moving to TYSABRI. Q3 2010 worldwide TYSABRI in-market product sales were $307 million, a 9% increase over Q3 2009. In the U.S., in-market TYSABRI sales totaled $151 million for the third quarter, a 15% increase over Q3 2009 and a 4% increase sequentially.
And internationally, TYSABRI in-market sales were $156 million, a 4% increase over Q3 2009. I'll again provide insight of some of the key metrics for TYSABRI. As of the end of September, we had approximately 55,100 patients on therapy, including about 600 in clinical trials. Units grew 6% year-over-year for TYSABRI in the U.S. and 15% internationally.
In the U.S., a number of factors impacted the results. The price increase at the end of Q2, while favorable, was partially offset by increased discounts and allowances, some co-pay assistance and the impact of accruals for health care reform. In the U.S., levels of inventory in the channel declined by the end of Q3 by 0.5 weeks, resulting in an unfavorable impact of approximately $5 million. In the U.S., we're witnessing a relatively stable compliance rate. Specifically, the use of drug suspensions and alternative dosing schedule are in the mid- to high-single digit percentage of patients. This percentage, while higher than Q3 2009, has been relatively stable throughout all of 2010.
Internationally, TYSABRI product sales were unfavorably impacted by exchange rates on a year-over-year basis by about 7% or approximately $11 million. So while the quarter did experience these impacts, TYSABRI patient evolution continued to perform solidly, growing 2,300 patients worldwide for the quarter. TYSABRI product sales for Biogen Idec were $221 million, $61 million in the U.S. and $160 million outside the U.S., which includes a $4 million hedge gain. 
In the U.S., we'll resell TYSABRI to align [ph] the net price decline year-over-year because we lowered our purchase price to reflect the use of product material that was previously expensed to R&D. This lower U.S. TYSABRI price for Biogen Idec is offset by lower COGS, resulting in a modest benefit on the gross margin and the bottom line. We've largely completed using this previously expensed material, so this particular effect on the U.S. price will not carry forward substantially into the fourth quarter. 
Now moving on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues referred to as revenue from unconsolidated joint business. We recorded $258 million in revenue for the quarter, a decrease of 9% on a year-over-year basis.
I'll walk through each of the three components comprising the revenue from RITUXAN. First, our share of U.S. RITUXAN profits. Net U.S. RITUXAN sales were $675 million in the third quarter, up 1% over prior year. Our profit share from that business was $204 million. Second, we received revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S., and in Q3 2010, this was $38 million. Royalties were down 42% as our 11-year royalty term expires on a country-by-country basis. Third, in the third quarter, we  were reimbursed $16 million for selling and developing costs incurred related to RITUXAN. 
Moving to royalties. Royalty fees were $36 million for the third quarter of 2010, a 4% increase versus prior year, largely due to an increase in our royalties from the medicines company. Corporate partner revenue for the third quarter was $5 million. 
Now turning to the expense line to the non-GAAP P&L, which includes the adjustments I described earlier. Q3 COGS were $96 million or 8% of revenues. Q3 R&D expense was $316 million or 27% of revenues. R&D expense includes $26 million related to the upfront payment related to the Knopp Neuroscience transaction. Q3 SG&A expense was $241 million or 20% of revenues. Our collaboration profit-sharing lines totaled $64 million in expenses for the quarter.
Q3 other income and expense was a $7 million expense due to the declining yields in cash balances in our marketable securities portfolio. We completed, as George noted, the $1.5 billion share repurchase plan announced this April. During the third quarter, we repurchased and retired 9 million shares at a total cost of $468 million. As a result, our fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding were approximately 242 million for the third quarter. We were able to return such a significant amount of cash to our shareholders because of our ability to generate robust cash flow. During the third quarter, we generated $420 million of cash from operating activities, bringing the total through the first three quarters to $1.2 billion. Our cash and marketable securities ended the quarter at $1.4 billion. Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 27%, including approximately $5 million in various discrete items.
The GAAP tax rate was impacted due to the Knopp transaction in the quarter as certain charges did not generate a tax deduction. This brings us to our Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.35, a 21% increase over Q3 2009. Since George's appointment, we've been evaluating the company's strategic priorities and examining additional meanings of maximizing shareholder value. We anticipate announcing the results of this evaluation before the end of the year, which may change the company's financial trends. I'll provide detailed financial guidance for 2010 in conjunction with this communication.
Certainly, we feel very good about the execution of our business objectives for 2010, including being on track to achieve our original goal of mid-single digit revenue growth for the full year. So the third quarter was another strong quarter financially with double-digit earnings per share growth and the completion of the share repurchase program. With that, I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

Moving forward, we'll continue to focus on growing the commercial business, optimizing our R&D investments and instilling a sense of urgency in the company.

It's too early to give you very detailed feedback on the reception of Gilenya in the marketplace.

So is that something that you envisage having to include in the label and include in the communication to patients?

It doesn't seem like that long ago that we're on the Q2 call. I guess time flies when you're having fun. I'm happy to report that Biogen Idec delivered another solid quarter. And financial revenues were $1.2 billion, up 5% versus the third quarter of '09, non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.35, which is a 21% increase year-over-year. And we completed the $1.5 billion share buyback that the Board authorized this April, retiring a total of nearly 30 million shares at an average price of $15.35. During the quarter, we also made considerable progress on three top priorities, growing and expanding the commercial business, taking a hard look at R&D to ensure that we maximize the return in our investment and in choosing the sense of urgency in all parts of the organization. Our MS franchise delivered double-digit year-over-year revenue growth and continues to be the global leader in MS.
 Importantly, AVONEX U.S. unit sales increased sequentially for the second straight quarter at the first such performance since 2004. And we just now completed the expansion of our sales force, finished strengthening the skills and competencies of the entire commercial organization and launched a number of new initiatives to keep these areas competitive as we prepare to face new market entrance. So anticipate that the full effect of the actions we've taken have not yet been fully felt.
 Our Neurology, Research and Development organization made some noteworthy advances. Al Sandrock will provide more details later on the call, but here are some highlights. We made significant progress on our TYSABRI risk stratification efforts. Earlier this month at ECTRIMS, we presented interim results from our STRATIFY 1 study, which confirmed earlier data that roughly half of the MS patient population tested positive in our sclerosis collassay for JC virus. For STRATIFY 2, we've made tremendous progress on patient enrollment. And as of October 22, we enrolled over 6,800 patients. At ECTRIMS, along with our partner Roche, we announced positive data from the Phase II study of Ocrelizumab and relapsing remitting MS. Al will go through the data in more detail, but overall, it looks quite impressive.
 And as we now announced last week, we reached an agreement with Genentech and Roche to allow them to move Ocrelizumab forward while allowing Biogen Idec to avoid a further concentration of its R&D dollars in Phase III trials in MS, while we maintain our economic interest in the compound. Importantly, we agree that the introduction of Ocrelizumab on to the market would not impact our profit sharing arrangement on RITUXAN. We also agree that the profit sharing arrangements for GA101 and RITUXAN, which were a potential area of dispute in the future. The company's interest are now in line, allowing us to work together to maximize with the collaboration revenues, as well as the benefits to patients. We also diversified our Neurology pipeline. In August, we announced the licensing agreement with Knopp Neurosciences to develop and commercialize for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, and potentially other indications. We expect to initiate this trial during the first half of next year.
 Our hemophilia pipeline also has some positive developments. Last month, the European Commission granted orphan designation to our long acting recombinant factor VIII FC fusion protein . We plan to initiate the registrational trial for this program called A-long by year end. Patient enrollment for B-long, which is the registrational trial for our long acting recombinant Factor IX FC fusion protein in hemophilia B, continues to enroll as expected. And we're on track for data readout in 2012.
 Many of you also are interested in the status of our search for Head of R&D. We've identified several accomplished, talented people who are interested in the job and the interview process is underway. I'm confident that we'll end up with a high-quality R&D head. We want to get this done quickly, as quickly as we can, but we also want to make sure to take the time to identify and recruit the best candidate. So it's been a busy three months since our last earnings call. Since my arrival, I've spoken with many of Biogen Idec's employees, visited many of the company sites and talk to most of our major shareholders, business partners and other important constituencies. As a result, I'm more optimistic than ever about the long-term future of Biogen Idec. As I've said before, this is a fundamentally good company from which to build. There are many things we can and we must do better, and we will. And thanks to do so, we're being implemented. On our last call, I talked about our efforts to focusing control costs, and we're making great progress on both fronts. We're not yet ready to talk publicly about our plans and any potential actions, and so we won't be answering any questions on that subject today. I can assure you that we're on track to share our plans prior to the end of the year, consistent with the timeline I laid out on the last call. So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Al Sandrock for details on the progress we've been making in Neurology R&D.

I'll be addressing our late stage of Neurology pipeline a bit later, so let me begin by first updating you on our TYSABRI risk stratification efforts. Earlier this month at ECTRIMS, we made several presentation highlighting the results",1254," Thank you, George. I'll be addressing our late stage of Neurology pipeline a bit later, so let me begin by first updating you on our TYSABRI risk stratification efforts. Earlier this month at ECTRIMS, we made several presentation highlighting the results of our work on the anti-JCV antibody assay. Today, we have analyzed blood samples from five large MS studies including the STRATA; TYSABRI safety extension study; the predominantly European affirmed Phase III trial of TYSABRI; the North American portion of the TYSABRI Safety Observations Study, called TYGRIS; the independent Swedish MS registry; and the baseline data from the STRATIFY 1 study, which as you know, we implemented this year in the United States in patients either on TYSABRI or considering TYSABRI.
 We are pleased to see that the data obtained from these studies have been quite consistent and confirmed the findings which were recently published in the anals of neurology. Let me summarize our findings. We have now tested blood samples from over 5000 MS patients. To our knowledge, this is the largest study of JCV zerology[ph] ever undertaken. Across studies, JCV zero prevalence ranges from approximately 50% to 60%. In all studies, zero prevalence is lower in females than in males, which is consistent with previously published reports. Zero prevalence increases with age, also in keeping with the published literature. We have found that prior immunosuppressant use has no bearing on JC virus zero prevalence. Moreover, TYSABRI exposure does not appear to affect the prevalence of anti-JCV antibodies.
 Importantly, when we tested archive samples that were available from 20 patients who have developed PML while on TYSABRI, all 20 tested positive by our assay. These samples have been collected 6.5 to 187 months prior to the onset of PML. Based on what we have now learned about JCV in antibody status and MS patient populations, if antibody status were not a risk factor for developing PML, one would've expected their roughly half of these 20 patients would have been antibody positive. So we believe that finding all 20 to be positive is extremely unlikely to be due to chance. In addition, we have tested 31 serum samples taken at the time of, or shortly after PML diagnosis. And all 31 have also tested positive by our assay. Thus, we continue to believe that the anti-JCV antibodies test could be an important risk stratification tool for TYSABRI. We note that another laboratory using a different anti-JCV antibody assay have reported that a few TYSABRI PML patients at the time of diagnosis were only borderline positive or negative by their assay. When we used our own assay to test duplicates of the very same blood samples, we found them all to test positive in our assay, thus, confirming the high sensitivity of our assay for anti-JCV antibodies. One hypothesis that may explain the difference is that all these blood samples were collected after plasma exchange, a procedure which was used to remove TYSABRI from the circulation. This procedure also removes other antibodies so the antibody may be at or below the limit of detection of their assay.
 We have had preliminary discussions with both the U.S. and European regulatory authorities about our work on the anti-JCV assay and have shared these and other data with them. As a result of these discussions, we are planning to submit labeling changes to both regulatory agencies by the first quarter of next year. We believe that the 5000 patient data set, coupled with the results from the 20 pre-PML samples that I just described, are sufficiently compelling that it should be included in the information available to patients and physicians. We will continue to update you as we make progress along this front.
 Now, I would like to turn to the rest of our late stage neurology pipeline to update you on our progress during the quarter. Post the result for long release Fampridine tablets at ECTRIMS highlighted improvements in walking speed across the broad range of MS patients and the emerging recognition of the importance of mobility problems facing MS patients. Our market research in Europe and Canada indicates that improvement in mobility is the high unmet need in MS. Physicians believe that more than half of their MS patients suffer from impaired mobility and the percentage is higher when patients are asked directly. We continue to work diligently towards our goal of making prolonged release Fampridine tablets available to MS patients outside of the United States. Our organization is also gearing up for Phase III data readouts and regulatory submissions on our oral MS treatment BG-12. At ECTRIMS, we presented new data on the potential neuro protective properties of BG-12. Oxidative stress is increasingly being recognized as an MS relevant cellular injury mechanism, which contributes to Central Nervous System tissue damage. In primary cultures of human spinal cord astrasite, BG-12 activated the NR-2 pathway and protected cells from death due to oxidative stress.
 We are on track for data readouts from the defined study during the first half and from the confirmed study during the second half of next year. Site activation and patient enrollment continues to progress for the advanced study of regulated Interferon beta-1a. There continues to be investigator enthusiasm for the product, which is expected to improve the convenience of Interferon treatment for MS patients, thus, improving patient adherance to therapy. As you will recall, this trial is being conducted under a special protocol assessment from FDA.
 SELECT, which is the first of the two registrational trial of daclizumab, is fully enrolled, and we expect data from this trial in the second half of this year. Daclizumab is believed to work by selectively targeting pathogenic autoreactive T cells without causing immune cell depletion. At ECTRIMS, our presentations reported the increase in CD56bright NK cells that occurs with daclizumab treatment and its correlation to the reduction and gadolinium-enhancing lesions in the brain. Thus, daclizumab would represent an entirely noble approach to treating MS.
 We, along with our partner Roche, have also announced positive results from the 24 weeks Phase II trial of Ocrelizumab in patients that's relapsing remitting MS. In this study, Ocrelizumab demonstrated reductions in disease activity as measured by gadolinium-enhancing lesions and relapse rate. Specifically, there was a robust 89% to 96% reduction in enhancing lesions compared to placebo. The reduction in annualized relapse rate at 24 weeks was also significantly lower than placebo with the reduction of 73% to 80%. Clearly, these data point to the potential of Ocrelizumab as a highly efficacious therapy for relapsing remitting MS.
 We continue to diversify our neurology pipeline beyond MS. In August, we announced the licensing agreement with Knopp Neurosciences to develop and commercialize dexpramipexole for the treatment of ALS and potentially other indications. The Phase II data showed favorable dose-related treatment effects and preserving motor function and extending survival. And there is growing interest among ALS investigators as we look ahead to the Phase III trial. Dexpramipexole has received orphan drug designation both in the U.S. and Europe, as well as fast-track designation in the United States. We expect to initiate this trial in the first half of next year.
 In conclusion, our R&D organization continues to advance our neurology pipeline and make progress on TYSABRI risk stratification for PML. Our efforts position us well for future growth, and we look forward to providing you with updates on new developments in the quarters ahead. With that, I'll now pass the call over to Dr. Francesco Granata, our Head of Global Commercial Operations.

This is a pleasure for me to join you today and report on a very productive third quarter. As this is my first earnings call, I would like to begin by sharing the three key priorities I've been focused on since",1112," Thank you, Al, and good morning, everyone. This is a pleasure for me to join you today and report on a very productive third quarter. As this is my first earnings call, I would like to begin by sharing the three key priorities I've been focused on since I joined the company. Hopefully, that will provide some context as I walk through our Q3 performance.
 The key priorities are: to maximize our commercial business with a special focus on turning around the U.S. AVONEX performance; to literally defend our MS franchise against competition from new therapies; and to strengthen the commercial organization talent. With these priorities in mind, let me begin by reviewing our product performance for Q3 2010, in which combined AVONEX and TYSABRI revenue increased by 10% year-over-year.
 Let me start with AVONEX. With wide revenue grew by 11%, this is the third quarter of 2009. We continue to see solid demand growth overseas, and the U.S. is starting to show signs of improvement. Outside the U.S., AVONEX unit sales grew by 6% year-over-year. U.S. unit sales grew by 1% sequentially. As George mentioned, this is the first time we have had two consecutive quarters of U.S. AVONEX unit growth since 2004. Why this is too early to draw any firm conclusion? The market performance over the past two quarters appeared to be a break from what has been the plan over the past three years. We have been able to hold market share both in the U.S. and overseas for a few months now.
 In the going markets, the result is expected as being an increasing unit growth and positive pull through to the revenue line.
 Moving onto TYSABRI performance, let me preface my comment by saying that I'm going to focus on in-market revenue and demand, while Paul Clancy will provide more detail on how in-market revenue translate into Biogen Idec revenue later in the call. Q3 were wide in market TYSABRI revenue grew by 9%, that was the third quarter of 2009. U.S. in-market revenue grew by 15%, patient grew by 16% and units grew by 6%. Outside the U.S., revenue grew by 4%, however, foreign exchange reduced revenue growth outside the U.S. by 7%. The number of TYSABRI patients outside the U.S. grew by 25%, and unit sales grew by 15%. A decline in patient compared during the fourth quarter of 2009, inventory changes and increased participation in our patient assistance programs close the GAAP between unit demand and patient growth on a year-over-year basis. In early 2010, we instituted a number of educational programs and strengthen our patient assistance programs. These resulted in a stabilization in discontinuation in compliance rates, which have been sustained during the past two quarters. At the same time, we have seen an improvement in the number of U.S. TYSABRI patients ahead.
 Looking ahead, we feel that our potential growth catalyst for both AVONEX and TYSABRI. Al Sandrock already mentioned the terrific progress our R&D team is making with TYSABRI risk stratification. If successful, we may be able to identify a large sample population of patients that may be at much lower risk of developing PML. Also, we are seeing strong growth in markets outside the U.S. and Europe. In the third quarter, revenue from these market increased by 18% versus Q3 2009. We have not yet launched TYSABRI in China, Japan or Russia and are just now in the midst of the launch phase in India, Brazil and Argentina. With South East Asia, the Middle East and other Latin American market to follow in 2011. We have only just began ramping up our next phase in India and Latin America and have no AVONEX presence in China and several Southeast Asian markets. So, there are still opportunity for both brands as these markets develops.
 We know that there are a lot of questions about the impact of new therapies on our MS franchise. Let me share our view. We believe that both AVONEX and TYSABRI will fair well as the safety, efficacy, polaribility and convenience of new therapies is evaluated in real-life settings.
 With AVONEX, patients and physicians can take comfort in stopping in the sting on a therapy that is well tolerated and is well documented nearly 15 years track of record of safety and efficacy over the cost of 1.4 million patient a year. With TYSABRI, we have a powerful efficacy profile, showing significant reductions in both annual relapse rate and importantly, physical disability progression through well controlled Phase III studies and four years of postmarketing experience. For some patient segment, incremental dosing, convenience may be more important than the established long-term efficacy and safety demonstrated with existing therapies increasing a chronic debilitating disease. These new problems would likely meet to the need of some of the approximately 170,000 patients worldwide who are not on therapy today due to profile of currently available treatment.
 Overall, we feel that we have the best offering for MS therapies in the industry. Accordingly, we have announced our sales and marketing capabilities and are now depending the franchise synergy. During the third quarter, we made progress in several ways. First, we have continued to establish a strong focus on the field force, both in terms of share of voice and quality. We have completed the hiring of a number of experienced sales and marketing leaders. We have strengthened the skills and competencies both of our U.S. sales force and across the entire commercial organization. And we have clearly put our self on impact to be in the highest rate in the neurology sales force in the industry. Second, we have further increase the quality and output of our new global marketing teams. In this respect, we resegmented the market to be more customer need focused and position our problems accordingly. Third, we have significantly increased our focus on customers across the organization. We upgraded the tools and resources available to our sales, marketing patient services and managed market functions. And we have launched new nurse initiatives toward support patient consistency and compliance. Lastly, we continue to build on our sustained profitable growth so we have added field force effectiveness and market especially to expand our capabilities in these important areas. In the coming quarters, I will continue to keep you updated on our progress. In summary, we saw a strong revenue growth in Q3 and the second consecutive quarter of stable AVONEX unit demand. Looking ahead, our commercial infrastructure is trying to vigorously defend our MS franchise against new competition while capitalizing on emerging opportunities overseas. With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer.

29726,114113728,87177,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives"," Thanks, Francesco. I'll review our 2010 third quarter financial results. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release, Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. Let me start with the differences betw",1309," Thanks, Francesco. I'll review our 2010 third quarter financial results. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release, Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. Let me start with the differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter. First, we incurred $54 million expense related to the amortization of acquired intangibles. Second, we incurred $6 million per stock compensation expense. Third, the Knopp transaction involved purchasing a 30% equity interest and entering into a license agreement for the treatment of ALS. The equity interest resulted in recording in IPR&D charge of $205 million based upon the fair value of the entity, and we incurred a noncontrolling interest offset of $145 million.
 And finally, there was a $45 million tax impact on all of these items. Our GAAP diluted EPS were $1.05 in the third quarter of 2010.
 Now move on to the non-GAAP P&L operating performance of Biogen Idec, which we believe that it represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business instead operational goals. Our Q3 2010 non-GAAP diluted EPS were $1.35. Total revenues for the third quarter of 2010 were $1,176,000,000, an increase of 5% over third quarter of 2009. We have a strong quarter commercially with AVONEX and TYSABRI, both increasing unit sales year-over-year, and together, delivering double-digit revenue growth in our MS franchise. These increase in MS revenue was partially offset by a 9% drop in our RITUXAN revenue as our ex-U.S. royalties continues to expire.
 Now I'll provide product level detail on our revenue performance. Q3 worldwide AVONEX product revenue was $644 million, an 11% increase over Q3 2009. The U.S. business grew 11% to $387 million in the international AVONEX business, also grew 11% to $257 million. Let me provide insights on some of the key metrics for AVONEX. In the U.S., inventory in the channel ended at 2.2 weeks in the third quarter, slightly above the second quarter, providing a modest benefit. On a sequential basis, as Francesco mentioned, U.S. AVONEX unit increased 1%, solid performance particularly for the third quarter when overall market demand typically softens during the summer months.
 Internationally, AVONEX units grew a solid 6% versus prior year. International AVONEX revenue benefited from a $17 million gain from hedging, which largely offset the year-over-year unfavorable impact from exchange rates.
 Moving to TYSABRI. Q3 2010 worldwide TYSABRI in-market product sales were $307 million, a 9% increase over Q3 2009. In the U.S., in-market TYSABRI sales totaled $151 million for the third quarter, a 15% increase over Q3 2009, and a 4% increase sequentially.
 And internationally, TYSABRI in-market sales were $156 million, a 4% increase over Q3 2009. I'll again provide insight of some of the key metrics for TYSABRI. As of the end of September, we had approximately 55,100 patients on therapy, including about 600 in clinical trials. Units grew 6% year-over-year for TYSABRI in the U.S. and 15% internationally.
 In U.S., a number of factors impacted the results. The price increase at the end of Q2, while favorable, was partially offset by increased discounts and allowances, some tollpay assistance and the impact of accruals for health care reform. In the U.S., levels of inventory in the channel declined by the end of Q3 by 0.5 weeks, resulting in an unfavorable impact of approximately $5 million. In the U.S., we're witnessing a relatively stable compliance rate, specifically the use of drug suspensions and alternative dosing schedule are in the mid-to high-single digit percentage of patients. This percentage while higher than Q3 2009 has been relatively stable throughout all of 2010.
 Internationally, TYSABRI product sales were unfavorably impacted by exchange rates on the year-over-year basis by about 7% or approximately $11 million. So while the quarter did experience these impacts, TYSABRI patient evolution continued to perform solidly, growing 2300 patients worldwide for the quarter. TYSABRI product sales for Biogen Idec were $221 million, $61 million in the U.S. and $160 million outside the U.S., which include a $4 million hedge gain.
 In the U.S., we'll resell TYSABRI to the net price decline year-over-year because we lowered our purchase price to reflect the use of product material that was previously expensed to R&D. This lower U.S. TYSABRI price for Biogen Idec is offset by lower COGS, resulting in a modest benefit on the gross margin and the bottom-line. We've largely completed using this previously expense material, so this particular effect on the U.S. price will not carry forward substantially into the fourth quarter.
 Now moving onto the RITUXAN collaboration revenues referred to as revenue from unconsolidated joint business. We recorded $258 million in revenue for the quarter, a decrease of 9% on a year-over-year basis.
 I'll walk through each of the three components comprising the revenue from RITUXAN. First, our share of U.S. RITUXAN profits. Net U.S. RITUXAN sales were $675 million in the third quarter, up 1% over prior year. Our profit share from that business was $204 million. Second, we received revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S., and in Q3 2010, this was $38 million. Royalties were down 42% as our 11 year royalty term expires on a country-by-country basis. Third, in the third quarter, we reimbursed $60 million for selling and developing costs incurred related to RITUXAN.
 Moving to royalties. Royal treaties were $36 million for the third quarter of 2010, a 4% increase versus prior year, largely due to an increase in our royalties from the medicines company. Corporate partner revenue for the third quarter was $5 million.
 Now turning to the expense line to the non-GAAP P&L, which includes the adjustments I described earlier. Q3 COGS were $96 million or 8% of revenues. Q3 R&D expense was $316 million or 27% of revenues. R&D expense includes $26 million related to the upfront payment related to the Knopp Neurosciences transaction. Q3 SG&A expense was $241 million or 20% of revenues. Our collaboration profit-sharing lines totaled $64 million in expenses for the quarter.
 Q3 other income and expense was a $7 million expense due to the declining yields and cash balances in our marketable securities portfolio. We completed, as George noted, the $1.5 billion share repurchase plan announced this April. During the third quarter, we purchased the retired 9 million shares and a total cost of $468 million. As a result, our fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding were approximately $2 million for the third quarter. We're able to return such a significant amount of cash to our shareholders because of our ability to generate robust cash flow. During the third quarter, we generated $420 million of cash from operating activities, bringing the total to the first three quarters to $1.2 billion. Our cash and marketable securities ended the quarter at $1.4 billion. Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 27%, including approximately $5 million in various discreet items.
 The GAAP tax rate was impacted due to transaction in the quarter as certain charges did not generate a tax deduction. This brings us to our Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $1.35, a 21% increase over Q3 2009. Since George's appointment, we've been evaluating the company's strategic priorities in examining additional meanings of maximizing shareholder value. We anticipate announcing the results of these evaluation before the end of the year which may change the company's financial trend. I'll provide detailed financial  guidance for 2010, in conjunction with this communication.
 Certainly, we feel very good about the execution of our business objectives for 2010, including being on track to achieve our original goal of mid-single digit revenue growth for the full year. So the third quarter was another strong quarter financially with double-digit earnings per share growth and the completion of the share repurchase program. With that, I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments.

Tools means that the customers confidence in adding new patients, they see our all for TYSABRI in the treatment of their patients, and this is justified by, again, the patients additions but also by the stability of the discontinuation that we have seen over the past couple of quarters. Again, it means that if the customer feels that the problem can bring value to their patients and we'll continue to stay focused on this communication and until we'll have available the risk stratification, hopefully, the risk stratification tool. We'll still think that even when we get the risk stratification, we will see various patients being added to the therapy because of the -- again, high efficacy performance of TYSABRI. And that's all.

The 19 -- I kind of tried to outline the -- in broad strokes, the price increase. Behind the price increase, there were certainly, increased discounts and allowances, and that would be on a channel by channel basis. We've had increase accruals related to healthcare reform. That had been going on, obviously, since the beginning of the year. But to some extent it really started in Q2 and Q3. And then, there was a little bit of increase with respect to co-pay assistance in the United States. I think the way to think about is it may take a couple of quarters for the full pull through of the price to kind of be realized and we'll kind of have to see that monitor along the way.
 With respect to the difference on AVONEX outside the United States and inside the United States, a pretty public information as it relates to inside the United States, outside the United States it is actually looking right now, Rachel. It is roughly -- it's about 50% or 6% of that, but it really can vary on a country-by-country basis to some extent, and it certainly -- we have a portion of our business outside the United States that is distributors and those are kind of individual agreements in terms of what the transfer price is.
