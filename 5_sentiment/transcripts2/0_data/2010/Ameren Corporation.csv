Moving to Slide 3 of the presentation posted on our website, I am pleased to report that 2009 non-GAAP or core earnings were $2.79 per share, in line with our expectations. Key drivers favorably af",2073,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Moving to Slide 3 of the presentation posted on our website, I am pleased to report that 2009 non-GAAP or core earnings were $2.79 per share, in line with our expectations. Key drivers favorably affecting 2009 core earnings per share compared to 2008 results included new utility service rates in Illinois and Missouri, and lower operations and maintenance expenses. These lower expenses were due in part to the absence in 2009 of a refueling outage at the Callaway Nuclear Plant and proactive cost-cutting efforts across all of our businesses. These positive factors were more than offset by lower electricity and natural gas sales in our regulated utility businesses as a result of weak economic conditions, the Noranda outage and milder 2009 weather. Merchant generation margins were also hurt by higher fuel costs and less generation, being in the money. Higher depreciation and interest expense and an increased average number of common shares outstanding further affected comparative results.Turning to Slide 4, today, we also announced 2010 GAAP and core earnings guidance of $2.20 to $2.60 per share. The expected decline in 2010 earnings from 2009 primarily reflects lower projected merchant generation segment margins and earnings. While earnings of our regulated utilities are expected to improve, regulatory lags is anticipated to result in earnings lower than those authorized by state commissions. Marty will provide further details on our 2009 earnings and 2010 guidance in his remarks. But before I turn the call over to him, I would like to provide a business and regulatory update.Looking now at Slide 5, in electricity sales at our regulated utilities, it is clear that the economy drove our sales down in 2009. While 2009 was indeed a difficult year, there are signs that the weak economy has hit bottom in our region. In a positive sales development, the Noranda Aluminum smelter plant has continued to add to its load as the plant now starts returning to full capacity. You may recall that Noranda's New Madrid, Missouri smelter plant, AmerenUE's largest customer, sustained damage because of a power interruption on non-Ameren-owned power lines during a severe ice storm in January 2009. As a result, the smelter's load was sharply reduced but has been rising steadily as repairs have been made to their production lines, with full production expected to be reached early in the second quarter of this year. In Illinois, our industrial sales are expected to benefit significantly from the expansion of an oil refinery and the resumption of higher levels of operations at several other facilities. While increased industrial sales in Illinois will not significantly contribute to margins, the health of local businesses is certainly a key to the prosperity of all of our customers.Moving on to the regulatory front, we have rate cases pending in both our Illinois and Missouri jurisdictions. We are seeking revenue levels that reflect the significant investments we have made in electric and gas utility infrastructure to improve reliability. We are also seeking recovery of higher financing costs, and in Missouri, rising net fuel cost. As detailed on Slide 6, our Ameren Illinois Utilities are currently requesting $130 million annual increase in base electric and natural gas delivery rates. This amount is less than our original request of $226 million, due in part to the removal of revenues related to reliability, audit expenditures. We are now seeking recovery of these costs in a separate rider. The lower rate request also reflects updates to our requested rates of return on equity and other items. The staff of the Illinois Commerce Commission or ICC is currently supporting a $46 million annual revenue increase. The staff's lower revenue amount reflects their lower recommended return on equity of approximately 10.1% compared to our request of approximately 11.5%, and use of a lower pension and benefits expense level, among other things. ICC administrative law judges are scheduled to issue their proposed rate order in this case by February 25, with the ICC expected to issue an order in late April. New rates should be effective by early May, 2010.Turning to Slide 7. At AmerenUE, we filed a request with the Missouri Public Service Commission in July of 2009 for an annual electric service rate increase of $402 million. More than half of the request was for anticipated higher net fuel costs. These increased net fuel costs would have been eligible for recovery through the fuel adjustment cost, absent this filing. On December 18, the staff of the Missouri Public Service Commission filed its direct testimony in the rate case, recommending an annual electric service rate increase of $218 million to $251 million, but approximately $214 million of this related to higher net fuel costs. The staff's lower revenue amount reflects their recommended return on equity range of 9% to 9.7%, which was lower than our initial request of 11.5%. The staff's revenue amount also incorporated lower depreciation, lower plant maintenance and financing cost levels, as well as other adjustments. The staff's testimony reflects continuation of the current fuel adjustment cost and the pension and OPEB trackers, and a modified Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism. Other parties filed testimony in December, including a group of large industrial customers in the Office of Public Counsel. The Office of Public Counsel recommended a return on equity of 10.2%. The large industrial customers recommended a rate increase of $139 million, which included a $181 million increase related to net fuel costs. Their lower revenue requirement reflects their lower recommended return on equity of 10%, the use of significantly lower depreciation rates and plant maintenance expenses, as well as lower financing costs and consumption levels, among other things. It should be noted that the large industrial customers' testimony reflects the continuation of the current fuel adjustment cost, as well as the modified approach for the accounting and recovery of the environmental costs. Last Thursday, AmerenUE filed its rebuttal testimony in this case, which included among other things, a modification of its originally requested ROE down to 10.8%. We anticipate the certain major changes to revenues, expenses, rate base and capital structure will be trued up through January 31, 2010 in an early March update. A PSC order is expected by late May, with new rates effective in late June 2010. We are very aware that the prospect of higher utility rates is difficult for our customers in Illinois and Missouri, especially in this economic environment. We have taken many proactive steps across our company to control our cost in order to moderate the need for higher rates. These steps include reductions and planned operating and capital expenditures, headcount reductions and the freezing of management salary. As always, there are several issues which need to be carefully considered in each rate cases, some of which are rather complicated. We believe we have filed well-supported rate cases in both Illinois and Missouri, and expect to be treated fairly by the respective commissions. Parties in both states have filed very aggressive positions in a number of areas, including return on equity, depreciation and certain operating expenses. These aggressive recommendations are not consistent with sound, long-term energy policy, and would result in our need to reduce our level of investment in energy infrastructure and operations. For several years, our regulated utility businesses have been earning returns on investments that are well below our authorized levels, in part due to regulatory lag. We are committed to improving earnings to levels that represent fair returns on our regulated investments. We strongly believe that consistent constructive regulatory outcomes will allow us to achieve this objective, as well as continue to invest in our energy infrastructure on a timely basis in order to maintain reliability, consistent with our customers' expectations. I would like to shift from a discussion of our regulated utilities to an update on our Merchant Generation business. Currently, power prices are low, a condition very much linked to weak economic conditions. Weak economic conditions have reduced the demand for power and other energy commodities. We believe that when the economy recovers and we expect it to recover, these prices will rise. In the meantime, we continue to look for every opportunity to prudently reduce our operating and capital spending in this business, as well as protect and enhance margins. We have a consistent practice of hedging both our power sales and our fuel costs. As a result, our margins were well protected in 2009 and we have a solid base of sales hedges for 2010 and out through in 2012 at prices that are above current market prices. Such hedging protects credit quality and reduces earnings and cash flow volatility. In addition, we continue to focus on providing value-added electricity products to the market. Leveraging our competitive merchant generation assets, our experienced power marketing group has a track record of enhancing margins through sales to wholesale and retail customers. Strength in our ability to successfully weather the current price environment, we have reduced plant operating and capital spending, substantially improving the cash flow outlook for our Merchant Generation business.Turning to Slide 8. Those actions have included updating and refining our strategy for compliance with current environmental standards. Most of you recall that our Merchant Generation business reached an agreement with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency in 2006. This agreement was ultimately adopted by the Illinois Pollution Control Board as a compliance alternative to the Illinois mercury regulations. These regulations which were modified in 2009, require our merchant generating plants to reduce emissions for sulfur dioxide or SO2, nitrous oxide or NOx and mercury over a number of years. The nitric oxide emission standards phase in through January 1, 2012, and the sulfur dioxide emission standards phase in through January 1, 2017. The mercury removal efficiency requirements are deferred to January 1, 2015. NOx and SOx compliance is determined on a systemwide basis. As you know during 2009, we reduced our anticipated non-environmental capital spending in the Merchant segment by approximately $1 billion over the period of 2009 to 2013. Because of the excellent performance of recently installed scrubbers at Duck Creek and Coffeen Plants, which are achieving removal rates beyond those contemplated in our initial plans, we have been able to re-evaluate and improve our environmental compliance strategy. As a result of this performance and updated cost experience, our estimate of capital expenditures required for compliance with existing air emission standards for our merchant generation fleet has been reduced. We now expect these expenditures will cumulatively be between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion over the period of 2010 to 2017. Our previously disclosed range of comparable capital expenditures was $1.5 billion to $2 billion. These estimates of our capital spending required to comply with regulations as of December 31, 2009 and would allow for each of our merchant coal-fired power plants to remain in service beyond January 1, 2017. As you would expect, we have teams in place that continue to evaluate our plans in light of changing technologies, power prices and delivered fuel costs in order to ensure that we identify the lowest cost options in terms of both capital and ongoing operating costs. Over the next two years, our environmental capital expenditure plans are moderate. We will use this time to continue to evaluate our plans looking for any opportunities to reduce compliance costs.Over the past 18 months, we have reduced planned spending, headcount and investment across the company to mitigate the negative impact on sales of a weak economy and related lower power prices. We've also enhanced our financial strength and liquidity position. Our regulated utilities are controlling spending and seeking updated rates to recover our cost and earn fair returns on investments. I believe that our actions have established a solid foundation for executing on future strategies in creating long-term shareholder value. While we expect earnings per share to decline in 2010, we expect earnings from our regulated businesses to improve over time as a result of narrowing the gap between our earned and authorized returns, and investing in improving reliability and promoting a cleaner environment. Our Merchant Generation business is poised to benefit from unexpected eventual recovery in power prices. Further, I believe, Ameren common shares provide investors with an attractive and sustainable dividend supported by our rate-regulated utility earnings. I will now turn the call over to Marty to walk you through the details of our 2009 earnings and our 2010 earnings guidance."

I would like to direct you to the year column which reconciles 2008 earnings to 2009 earnings. 2009 net income, in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, was $612 million or $2.78 per share, compared to",2089,"Thanks, Tom. Turning to Slide 9. I would like to direct you to the year column which reconciles 2008 earnings to 2009 earnings. 2009 net income, in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, was $612 million or $2.78 per share, compared to 2008 GAAP net income of $605 million or $2.88 per share. Excluding certain items in each year, Ameren recorded 2009 core net income of $615 million or $2.79 per share compared with 2008 core net income of $622 million or $2.95 per share. There are three items in 2009 that we have excluded from our core earnings. These are the net costs associated with the Illinois comprehensive electro rate relief and customer assistance settlement agreement reached in 2007, which reduced 2009 GAAP earnings by $0.08 per share; the net effects of unrealized mark-to-market activities, which increased 2009 GAAP earnings by $0.14 per share; and employee separation and impairment charges related to our headcount reduction and facilities closures, which reduced 2009 GAAP earnings by $0.07 per share. Continuing with the 2008 to 2009 earnings reconciliation on Slide 9, the Missouri electric rate increase, which took effect March 1, 2009, raised 2009 earnings by $0.40 per share net of amortizations compared to 2008. The net increase in Illinois electric and natural gas delivery service rate, effective October 1, 2008, lifted 2009 earnings by $0.40 per share compared to the prior year. We estimate milder weather reduced 2009 earnings by $0.15 per share compared to 2008, and by $0.13 per share compared to normal.Moving to the next slide, in our year-to-year reconciliation, reduced sales to Noranda Aluminum lowered 2009 earnings by $0.11 per share. Other electric and gas margins for our regulated utility operations, excluding the impact of rate adjustments, weather and the lost Noranda sale, decreased earnings by $0.30 per share. As Tom discussed earlier, this decline in margin was largely due to lower electric and natural gas sales volumes as a result of the weak economy.The next line on the reconciliation is a $0.10 per share decline in our Merchant Generation segment's earnings, reflecting the absence in 2009 of the gain recorded in 2008 for a lump-sum settlement payment received from a coal supplier related to a contract termination. Other electric margins for the Merchant Generation business decreased by $0.05 per share in 2009 compared to 2008. This Merchant Generation margin decline was largely due to having less in the money generation and higher fuel and related transportation costs, offset in part by improved realized revenue per megawatt hour. Proactive forward sales and hedges of 2009 generation, executed in prior years at higher than 2009 market prices, largely shielded Merchant Generation segment earnings from the impact of falling market prices for power. The absence of the refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Nuclear Plant boosted 2009 earnings by $0.09 per share versus the prior year. You will recall, the Callaway is typically refueled every 18 months. So there is no refueling outage every third year. The next three lines on our reconciliation combined to reduce 2009 earnings by $0.02 per share compared to 2008. This reflected higher distribution system reliability spending and higher depreciation and amortization expense, offset by lower plant operations and maintenance expense. Higher financing costs and share dilution reduced 2009 earnings by a combined $0.31 per share versus 2008.Moving now to the other taxes line on the reconciliation, where higher property taxes contributed to a $0.06 per share increase in cost versus the year ago period. Finally, the net impact of other items, including lower bad debt and non-plant operations and maintenance expenses, increased 2009 earnings per share by $0.05 per share compared to 2008.Turning to Slide 10. I would like to discuss the key assumptions and drivers behind our 2010 core earnings guidance of $1.90 per share to $2.15 per share for our Missouri and Illinois regulated utilities businesses. In 2010, we expect to achieve returns on equity of approximately 7.5% to 8.5% on average expected 2010 utility common equity of about $6 billion. These returns are anticipated to be up from an average 2009 returns on utility common equity of approximately 6.5% to 6.8%. The guidance for our regulated utilities reflects expected new Illinois electric and gas delivery rate effective in late April or early May, and expected new Missouri electric rate effective in late June. Further, our guidance assumes some moderate electric sales growth. The sales outlook incorporates our expectation that the Noranda smelter plant will return to full operation early in the second quarter of 2010, adding an estimated $0.10 per share to earnings compared to 2009. Note that 2010 earnings per share guidance variances versus 2009 are calculated using 2009 average common shares outstanding. As usual, guidance is based on normal weather, which would add an estimated $0.13 to earnings per share versus the milder-than-normal 2009. In addition, the Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric facility is expected to return to service in the second quarter of 2010, improving margins by approximately $1.8 million per month. The scheduled spring refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway nuclear plant is expected to reduce 2010 earnings by $0.09 per share compared to 2009. 2010 earnings guidance incorporates higher expected plant operations and maintenance expenses, primarily for scheduled work at AmerenUE's coal-fired plant. Pension and benefit, depreciation and other tax expenses are also expected to increase in 2010 versus 2009. As I wrap up my discussion of 2010 guidance for our regulated utility, let me be clear that the return on equity of 7.5% to 8.5% assumed in our guidance is well below the level we consider to be reasonable. As Tom stated earlier, our management is committed to lifting the return on investment at our regulated utilities to levels that are fair. For every 100 basis points, by which our regulated utilities underearn their allowed returns on equity, our shareholders are deprived of earnings of approximately $0.25 per share. We believe that given the current regulatory frameworks in place in Missouri and Illinois, achieving these higher returns will not be accomplished in one rate case proceeding. We are focused on achieving fair returns by pursuing consistent constructive regulatory outcomes, including mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag as well as synchronizing our spending, consistent with the level of rates authorized by the respective commission. Turning to Slide 11, let's now move to a discussion of the key drivers and assumptions behind our 2010 Merchant Generation business earnings guidance. We expect this business segment to post core earnings $0.30 to $0.45 per share in 2010. The largest driver of the decline in Merchant Generation business earnings in 2009 to 2010 is a decrease in expected margins of $0.70 to $0.80 per share. We expect our base load merchant plant to generate approximately 30.5 million megawatt hours in 2010, approximately 26 million megawatt hours of this is hedged at an average price of $47 per megawatt hour. Our expected margins assume that all non-hedged expected generation is sold at current market prices. In 2010, we anticipate having base load capacity available to generate 35 million-megawatt hours in the event power prices rise, and support higher generation level. A $5 per megawatt hour improvement in 2010 market power prices as compared to current prices, would increase our expected 2010 generation output by approximately 1.5 million-megawatt hours and our expected 2010 merchant generation margin by approximately $30 million. Our all-in base load fuel cost are 100% hedged at approximately $23.25 per megawatt hour. Lastly, the Merchant Generation business is expected to post higher depreciation and interest expense in 2010 compared to 2009.Moving now to key company-wide assumptions. Our earnings guidance reflects an expected, effective, consolidated income tax rate of approximately 34% and average number of common shares outstanding of approximately 239 million for 2010. As I close our discussion of 2010 earnings guidance, I remind you that any net unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses will affect our GAAP earnings, but are excluded from our GAAP and core earnings guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any such gains or losses. Further, our earnings guidance for 2010 assumes normal weather for the year and is subject to, among other things, regulatory decisions and legislative actions, plant operations, energy and capital and credit market conditions, economic conditions, severe storms, usual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses, and other risk and uncertainties outlined or referred to in the Forward-looking Statements section of today's press release.Turning now to Slide 12, I would like to report on our 2009 and projected 2010 cash flow. A year ago, we shared with you that we expected 2009 negative free cash flow, defined as cash flows from operations less capital expenditures and common dividend, of approximately $450 million. I am pleased to report that we were able to achieve markedly better results. This significant improvement was the result of curtailed spending and cash tax savings, including deferral of tax payments as a result of bonus depreciation. As we look to 2010, despite expected reduced earnings, we anticipate that free cash flow from our Merchant Generation segment will be positive, allowing us to reduce outstanding borrowings. We anticipate that our regulated utilities will continue to generate negative free cash flow although at reduced levels, while providing funding for our current dividends. In summary, we anticipate that Ameren, on a consolidated basis, will require minimum net additional capital from external sources during 2010. We ended 2009 with approximately $1.9 billion of total available liquidity. That was comprised of cash on hand, as well as available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our debt maturities in 2010 are a very manageable $220 million. Before we conclude our formal remarks, I would like to share with you some additional numbers to assist you in assessing Ameren's longer-term outlook. On Slide 13, we detailed Ameren's updated five-year capital expenditure outlook. Over the 2010 through 2014 period, cumulative capital spending is projected to range between $6.3 billion and $8.1 billion, and between $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion per year. These spending levels reflect reductions made to plant spending in both the regulated utility and Merchant Generation segments of our business. On Slide 14, we present our expected capital expenditures for our Merchant Generation business segment for each of the next five years. The amounts shown reflect lower-than-planned actual expenditures in 2009 and a reduction of $45 million in the years 2010 through 2013 versus estimates we shared with you at the Edison Electric Institute financial conference last November. These numbers are included in the total Ameren-wide capital expenditures I just mentioned. Our Merchant Generation business spending plans are particularly moderate this year and next year. Of course, we will continue to review, and adjust as needed, our merchant generation business spending plan in light of evolving outlooks for power prices, delivered fuel costs environmental standards and compliance technologies, among other things.Moving now to Slide 15, we provide an update on our 2010 to 2012 forward power sales and hedges. As you can see, we have significant hedges in place for 2010 through 2012 at power prices above the current market. We already discussed our 2010 hedges. For 2011, we have hedged approximately 18 million megawatt hours at an average price of $49 per megawatt hour. Further, for 2012, we have hedged approximately 12 million megawatt hours at an average price of $53 per megawatt hour. Our capacity sales are approximately 75% hedged in 2010, approximately 40% hedged in 2011 and approximately 20% hedged in 2012. To assist you in understanding our Merchant Generation business segment's margin drivers, we have provided a pie chart that breaks down our 2010 expected revenue by type. Now turning to Slide 16. We update our merchant generation segments fuel and related transportation hedges. We previously discussed our 2010 hedge. For 2011, we have hedged approximately 20 million-megawatt hours at about $25.50 per megawatt hour. For 2012, we have hedged approximately 11 million megawatt hours at about $26.50 per megawatt hour. Similar to our previous slide dealing with merchant generation revenues, we included a pie chart that breaks down forecasted 2010 all-in fuel cost to provide a perspective on how each component contributes to our overall cost. As Tom stated, our management team is extremely focused on meaningfully improving the returns at our regulated utilities and continuing to position our merchant generation business to weather current power market condition, and benefit from an expected eventual recovery in power prices. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now be happy to take your questions."

First of all, that's sort of just the CIN HUB prices we talked about on the call, made typically as we're out in the market, we're looking for opportunities to enhance margins beyond the prices you see just at CIN HUB, through sales to retail customers around the States that we operate in. But in terms of basis differentials, some of the things that we've seen recently this past year, we certainly saw basis differentials right now versus what we've seen in other periods when loads were higher. And essentially, as the economy split and we saw demand drop off, we saw some of the basis differential increase. And it was on peak around our service territory, in Illinois, around 7% decrement on-peak to synergy and about 14% off-peak this past calendar year. And now it varies from region to region. If you go down to, for example, where our EEI Joppa facility is, it's actually better. The base with differential there is positive on-peak and a little bit negative off-peak, about 6%. So as we've gone into 2010 planning, we've assumed similar kinds of basis differentials to 2009, as we look out to 2010.

Certainly seeking cost recovery mechanisms in the cases that we have pending. Those cost recovery mechanisms would allow us to recover our cost on a more timely basis, reducing the amount of lag that we have. These kinds of recovery mechanism, such as trackers or writers are certainly helpful in terms of our being -- given an opportunity to earn your allowed return in your jurisdictions. And then I think, too, we'll also be looking at making sure that we manage our spend appropriately and try to manage our spending to help close those gaps over time. Before I leave the whole Q&A with you, Paul, I appreciate the question. As it relates to basis differential, one thing I did want to mention is, that we look at some of those basis differentials. It's really only a percentage of our volumes that are exposed when you look at something like 2010. Some of our hedges really do protect us from some of that basis differential. Of our total megawatt hours that we have expected to generate next year of about 30.5, only about 35% of those are actually exposed to some of those basis differentials I discussed before. So that also helps to further mitigate the impact of this basis differential."

I noticed that last week , the commission granted an increase to Missouri Gas Energy, which of course is a small company, but nonetheless was down at 10% ROE down from 10.5%, and as the chairman made a statement about the unanimity of the decision. I don't think in talking to individual commissioners necessarily give animity without bargaining, and the bargaining seems to go towards the low end rather than the high end. But I wonder what steps you might take either be they with legislature or in specific filings and things that you ask for, trackers, et cetera, to try to cut spread between earned returns and the lab returns. You don't have a forward year, although they tried to explosively update your year during the course of the proceedings. But what else besides the forward year can you look to put in, and/or to get the legislature to say that this makes sense?

Second quarter 2010 non-GAAP or core earnings were $0.73 per share compared to the second quarter 2009 core earnings of $0.75 per share. These results exceeded our expectations and reflect strong el",1688,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Second quarter 2010 non-GAAP or core earnings were $0.73 per share compared to the second quarter 2009 core earnings of $0.75 per share. These results exceeded our expectations and reflect strong electricity sales and disciplined management of our cost.
Key positive earning drivers included a 9% increase in sales electricity to native load utility customers in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009. The higher sales partly reflected a recovering economy. This was evident in the 26% increase in kilowatt-hour sales to industrial customers.
A significant portion of this 26% increase was due to the return to full capacity in March 2010 of the Noranda aluminum smelter plant, our Missouri utility’s largest customer. Even after excluding Noranda’s contribution, industrial sales rose 17% at our regulated utilities driven by strong growth in Illinois.
Sales to residential customers rose 4% and sales to commercial customers rose 1%. These increases were driven in large part by early summer weather that was both warmer than that experienced in the second quarter of 2009 and warmer than normal.
In addition to strong sales, our year-over-year results benefited from disciplined cost management across all of our business segments. These cost containment efforts more than offset additional expenses from this spring’s refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway nuclear plant. You’ll recall that the Callaway plant did not have a refueling outage in 2009.
The impact of these positive factors on the second quarter earnings comparison was offset by the expected reduction in margins at our Merchant Generation segment. That reduction was a result of lower realized power prices and higher fuel and related transportation costs.
Turning to slide number 4, I am very pleased to report that we have raised our 2010 GAAP and core earnings guidance to reflect strong year-to-date earnings and continued expected disciplined cost management. We now expect GAAP and core earnings to be in the range of $2.50 per share to $2.80 per share, an increase from our prior guidance range of $2.20 per share to $2.60 per share. Marty will provide further details on our second-quarter earnings and our 2010 guidance.
However, before moving on, I would like to emphasize that our year-to-date performance and ability to raise our 2010 guidance reflects our management team’s commitment to improving earned returns in our regulated businesses.
Further, we continue to aggressively manage the cost of our Merchant Generation business, so that it remains well positioned to weather current low power prices and benefit from an expected power price recovery. We will not lose focus on these objectives. At the same time, we will not lose focus on operating safely and reliably.
Moving to slide number 5; I would like to update you on several recent regulatory developments in Missouri, in Illinois and at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In late May, the Missouri Public Service Commission issued its order for our retail electric rate increase request. The Missouri PSC authorized a $230 million increase in rates effective June 21, 2010. We were able to settle many of the issues in this case.
However, several key issues were decided by the Missouri Commission after hearings, including return on equity, the fuel adjustment clause, our reliability tracking mechanisms and depreciation. While we were disappointed with the 10.1% authorized return on equity, we believe the balance of the Commission’s order was fair.
In addition to providing electric service to 1.2 million customers in Missouri, we also provide natural gas delivery service to approximately 126,000 customers in the state. In a 2007 settlement, we agreed not to file a new natural gas delivery rate case in Missouri before March of 2010.
As a result, this part of our business is currently earning significantly less than it’s allowed return on investment. Therefore, in June, we filed for a $12 million annual rate increase and new rates are expected to be effective in May 2011.
Further, we plan to file our retail electric rate case in Missouri by the end of September 2010. The primary driver of this electric rate filing is the need to begin recovering our approximately $600 million investment in the nearly-complete Sioux plant scrubbers. This environmental control equipment is a key to our Missouri utility’s ability to meet increasingly strict air emission standards, including the transport rule recently proposed by the U.S. EPA.
We have also had significant recent regulatory developments in Illinois. This past spring, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued a disappointing rate order for our Illinois electric and natural gas delivery businesses. The ICC authorized a corrected $15 million annual increase in delivery rates.
In response, we significantly reduced plant spending levels at our Illinois utilities to align our spending with the revenues and related cash flows provided by the Illinois Commission’s rate order, while still maintaining safe and reliable service.
We are encouraged that in June, the ICC agreed to rehear several key issues in the case and we stand ready to restore important reliability enhances we have cut from our plants if we receive additional revenues as a result of the rehearing process. Marty will provide further details on the recent Missouri electric rate order and the Illinois delivery case rehearing in a few minutes.
Moving now to the FERC jurisdiction, on June 1, we implemented updated electric transmission rates that are expected to provide approximately $29 million of additional annual revenue. This rate adjustment reflects infrastructure investment and updated costs and capital structures through the end of 2009.
Turning to slide number six, I would like to continue the discussion of electric transmission and update you on our new transmission investment opportunities we announced this week.
We are excited about the benefits we see from growing our investment in the electric transmission business. Customers should benefit from improved reliability and a more efficient regional electric system. Our investor should benefit because we expect to be able to earn attractive returns.
We have identified more than $3 billion of transmission investment opportunities in Illinois and Missouri over the next 10 to 15 years, and we are working aggressively, but prudently, to pursue these opportunities.
We announced this week the formation of a new subsidiary Ameren Transmission Company or ATX, dedicated to building regional Greenfield electric transmission infrastructure under FERC regulation. Our investment is contingent upon pre-approval of supported rate treatment of the projects by FERC.
In addition for us to move forward, the projects would need to be approved by the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator. We expect to seek appropriate state approvals for the projects as well.
Our initial ATX investments are expected to be the Grand Rivers projects, the first of which involves building a 345 KV line across the state of Illinois from the Missouri border to the Indiana border. Our investment in the Grand Rivers projects could total more than $1.3 billion through 2021 with the potential investment of $125 million over the 2011 to 2014 period.
I would now like to briefly update you on the reorganization of our Illinois businesses and comment on the U.S. EPA’s recently proposed transport rule. Regarding our Illinois reorganization, I am pleased to report that we are close to realizing our long held desire to combine our three Illinois delivery utilities into a single entity to be called Ameren Illinois Company.
Further, we will combine the generation subsidiary currently held under AmerenCILCO with our other Merchant Generation assets under Ameren Energy Resources Company. We have now obtained all the necessary regulatory approvals and expect to complete the reorganization on October 1 of this year.
As we have previously discussed, this reorganization will bring our legal structure in line with the way we operate our business. We believe consolidation of our Illinois utilities will over time lower cost and increase our efficiency, provide greater convenience to our customers and improve financial reporting transparency for our investors.
Moving to the transport rule, on July 6, the U.S. EPA released its proposed new transport rule. The rule is complex, contains alternatives and is not expected to be finalized until the spring of 2011. As a result, we’re still studying the rule and its potential impact on our business segments. That said, we have a solid history of taking action to reduce emissions. More that 95% of Ameren’s coal-fired generation is produced using low sulfur Powder River Basin coal.
In addition, our Merchant Generation segment has been executing on a plan to install scrubbers to comply with the Illinois Multi-Pollutant Standard or MPS. As a result, we believe our Merchant Generation business is better positioned for a compliance with the transport rule than many of its MISO peers.
Under the MPS, our Merchant Generation fleet is required to significantly reduce by 2015 its emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide to levels comparable to those required by the EPA’s original Clean Air Interstate Rule. Mercury emissions from our larger units in Illinois must be reduced by 90% by 2015.
To comply with state and federal regulations, we have taken a number of actions over the years to reduce emissions from our plants, including the installation of Selective Catalytic Reduction and over-fire air to control nitrogen oxide emissions and the use of activated carbon injection to control mercury emissions. In addition, we placed new scrubbers into service at the Duck Creek and Coffeen plants in 2009 and 2010.
Further we have plans in place to install scrubbers at our Newton plant and equipment necessary to support dry sorbent injection at our Joppa plant. At our Missouri regulated utility, Sioux plant scrubbers are expected to go into service later this year. We believe that installing the Sioux scrubbers is the right thing to do for the environment and will also significantly improve our Missouri utilities’ ability to comply with whatever form the transport rule ultimately takes.
Now, I will turn the call over to Marty. He will walk you through the details of our second quarter earnings and our increased 2010 earnings guidance. He will also provide details on recent regulatory and merchant generation developments and other financial matters.

Second quarter 2010 net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP was $152 million or $0.64 per share, compared to second quarter 2009 GAAP net income of $165 million or $0.77 pe",1888,"Thanks, Tom. Turning to slide number seven. Second quarter 2010 net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP was $152 million or $0.64 per share, compared to second quarter 2009 GAAP net income of $165 million or $0.77 per share.
Excluding certain items in each year, Ameren recorded second quarter 2010 core net income of $173 million or $0.73 per share compared with second quarter 2009 core net income of $161 million or $0.75 per share.
We excluded one time from our second quarter 2010 core earnings, the net effect of unrealized mark-to-market activities. As a result GAAP earnings were $0.09 per share lower than core earnings per share. The net unrealized mark-to-market activity was primarily related to non-qualified power and fuel hedges for our Merchant Generation segment.
Now, I would like to discuss the key factors driving the change in core earnings per share between this year’s second quarter and last year’s second quarter. Regulated electric and gas margins increased $0.21 per share reflecting a 9% increase in electricity sales to native load customers.
The strong increase in sales was driven by the return to full capacity in late March 2010 of Noranda Aluminum smelter plant, a recovering economy and warmer early summer weather.
We estimate that weather increased second quarter 2010 earnings by $0.05 per share, compared to the warm year-ago quarter and by $0.11 per share compared to normal weather.
In addition, operations and maintenance or O&M expenses declined in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009 reflecting disciplined cost management. This decrease in OEM was accomplished even though the scheduled Callaway refueling and maintenance outage reduced the second quarter 2010 earnings by $0.11 per share compared to the year-ago period when there was no Callaway refueling outage.
Financing costs declined $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting greater capitalization of such costs, partly as a result of the recently concluded Missouri rate case and partly because of greater construction work in progress, increasing the accrual of allowance for funds used during construction.
Key factors negatively impacting the comparison of second quarter 2010 earnings to second quarter 2009 earnings, included a decline in merchant generation margins of $0.22 per share. This margin decline reflected lower realized power prices and higher fuel and related transportation costs compared to the second of 2009.
An increased average number of common shares outstanding, primarily due to our September 2009 stock offering, reduced second quarter results by $0.08 per share compared to the second quarter of 2009.
Depreciation and amortization expenses rose, reducing second quarter 2010 earnings by $0.02 per share compared to the year-ago quarter.
Moving to slide number eight and a discussion of our increased 2010 earnings guidance. We now expect 2010 GAAP and core earnings from our Missouri and Illinois-regulated utility businesses to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.30 per share. This new range is higher than our prior range of $1.85 to $2.10 per share for reasons previously mentioned by Tom.
Key drivers and assumptions behind our updated earnings guidance are listed on this slide. We now expect to achieve a 2010 weather-normalized return on equity of approximately 8% to 8.5%. This is still well below our allowed returns in both states. It is an improvement over our 2009 earned return on common equity of approximately 7%.
Turning to slide number 9, we continue to expect our Merchant Generation business segment to post GAAP and core earnings of $0.35 to $0.50 per share in 2010. You’ll recall that we raised earnings guidance for this segment by $0.05 per share when we released first quarter 2010 earnings. This first quarter increase was due to cost reductions.
This slide lists the key drivers and assumptions behind our 2010 merchant generation earnings guidance. For the most part, the assumptions are unchanged from our first quarter 2010 earnings call.
After funding expected capital expenditures of $120 million in 2010, we continue to anticipate that free cash flow from our Merchant Generation segment will be positive in 2010, allowing us to reduce outstanding Merchant Generation borrowings.
As I close our discussion of earnings guidance, I’ll remind you that any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses will affect our GAAP earnings, but are excluded from our GAAP and core earnings guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any such gains or losses.
Also, our earnings guidance for 2010 assumes normal weather for the second half of the year and is subject to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties outlined or referred to you in today’s press release.
As Tom mentioned and as detailed on slide number 10, on May 28, we received a rate order from the Missouri Public Service Commission for the retail electric rate case we initiated in July of 2009. The order authorized $230 million or 10% increase in annual electric revenues.
Of this amount, $119 million was an increase in annual revenues to recover higher net base fuel costs, including lower off-system sales revenues due to declining power prices. And the remaining $111 million was to recover other costs of service.
The rate increase amount was based on a 10.1% return on equity, a capital structure composed of 51.3% common equity and a rate base of approximately $6 billion. The order approved continued use of the fuel adjustment clause. In addition, the order call for continuation of trackers, for pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and vegetation management and infrastructure inspection costs.
Post-construction accounting deferrals were authorized for the Sioux plant scrubbers. This means that for regulatory purposes, we will defer depreciation expense and both debt and equity carrying costs associated with the Sioux plant scrubbers after the in-service date of such equipment. For external reporting purposes, we will defer only the depreciation and debt carrying costs associated with the scrubbers.
This post-construction accounting will end on the earlier of the date the cost of the equipment is reflected in customer rates or January 1, 2012. The rate order also includes the provision that mitigates the impact in an unexpected significant decline in electricity sale to the Noranda smelter plant.
If a significant loss of service occurs at Noranda, we will be allowed to sell the power not taken by Noranda and use the proceeds to offset revenues lost up to the amount necessary to be held harmless. Any excess revenues will be refunded to customers through the fuel adjustment clause.
The Missouri order also approved an increase in our annual depreciation rate by $14 million annually. Further, the order provided for recovery of previously incurred credit facility and voluntary employee separation costs. The new rates went into effect on June 21.
Moving now to slide number 11. As mentioned by Tom, AmerenUE filed for an increase in gas delivery revenues. The requested increase is approximately $12 million annually or 7%. It is based on a 10.5% return on equity, a capital structure including 51.3% common equity and a rate base of $245 million. The filing uses the test year ended December 31, 2009 with certain pro forma adjustments through the anticipated true-up date of November 30, 2010.
The key drivers of the request for increased revenues include higher rate base and higher operations and maintenance costs. Given the 11-month statutory deadline, the Missouri Commission must rule on the gas rate case by the end of May 2011.
Turning now to slide number 12, I would like to provide more details on the ICC’s rehearing of certain issues in the recently decided electric and natural gas delivery case for the Ameren Illinois Utilities.
We asked the ICC to reconsider its decision on six issues in the order and on June 14, the Commission agreed to rehear three of these issues as well as one issue raised by the ICC itself.
One of these issues is the adjustment that was made to the accumulated depreciation reserve. As you know, we believe the adjustment made in the order was a departure from past ICC precedent and is a violation of the Commission’s rules. A reversal on this issue could add up to $35 million of annual revenue. The ICC also agreed to rehear its decision on the level of pension and other post-retirement benefit expenses that we may recover in rates.
In its order, the ICC used 2008 pension and OPEB cost levels arguing that the 2009 cost levels were not known and measurable. Our position is that the 2009 costs, which were significantly greater than the 2008 costs were indeed known and measurable and therefore should be factored into the rate order. A reversal on this issue could add up to $16 million of annual revenues.
There are also two smaller dollar item issues under consideration in the rehearing and these are mentioned on the slides. A schedule for the rehearing process has been established with an ICC decision expected close to November 12, 2010, the statutory deadline.
Moving from regulatory matters to a discussion of our Merchant Generation segment, please turn to slide number 13. Here we provide an update on our forward power sale hedges as of June 30, as you can see we have significant hedges in place for 2011 through 2012 at power prices above current market prices.
For 2011, we have now hedged approximately 23 million megawatt hours at an average price of $46 per megawatt hour, and for 2012 we have hedged approximately 14 million megawatt hours at an average price of $52.
Our capacity sales are approximately 83% hedged in 2010, approximately 63% hedged in 2011, and approximately 37% hedged in 2012. Our ownership of iron in the ground, low cost coal-fired baseload and coal and gas-fired intermediate and peaking generation gives us a solid position from which to work to achieve premiums about visible forward power prices, through negotiated customized contracts.
As we move forward to hedge open positions in 2011 and beyond, we are targeting wholesale and large retail opportunities with customized and value-added load shaped products that allow us to enhanced margin by leveraging our capabilities.
On slide number 14, we update our Merchant Generation segment’s fuel and related transportation hedges. For 2011, we have now hedged approximately 21 million megawatt hours at about $25 per megawatt hours. For 2012, we’ve hedged approximately 13 million megawatt hours at about $26 per megawatt hour.
Moving to slide number 15, we provide an update on our 2010 cash flow outlook. As you can see, we now expect positive consolidated free cash flow of approximately $330 million, a significant improvement from our prior 2010 cash flow guidance provided in February.
At that time we expected consolidated free cash flow to be just slightly negative by $25 million. This significant improvement in our expected free cash flow is the result of the previously discussed increase in earnings expectations expected cash tax savings and reduced capital spending plans.
As I said earlier, we continue to anticipate that our Merchant Generation segment will produce positive free cash flow, allowing us to reduce outstanding Merchant Generation borrowings. Specifically, this includes the expectation of reducing Genco’s long-term borrowings by utilizing available cash to fund Genco’s $200 million maturity later this year.
This completes our prepared remarks. We will now be happy to take your questions.

So we really are looking to control costs and about half of that improvement in guidance is related to the expectation of being able to sustain some of the cuts we’ve made, here are the controls we’ve put in place in the first half, sustain those through the end of this year.

Midwest ISO had made its own filing on July 15 of this year for regional cost allocation, and it had included one of the major projects in the Grand Rivers project. The project called the Illinois Rivers project, which has an estimated cost of $739 million, included that project as one of its starter set of multi-valued project that it was recommending to FERC.
So the next step in the process would be getting that project approved by the Midwest ISO, at which point in time we could begin moving forward with that project. At that point in time to actually begin the construction of the projects, we’d seek whatever appropriate state approvals were needed for citing and certification.

I am pleased to report that third quarter 2010 core earnings were $1.40 per share, a $0.24 per share increase over third quarter 2009 core earnings.These strong results driven by warm weather and",1379,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to report that third quarter 2010 core earnings were $1.40 per share, a $0.24 per share increase over third quarter 2009 core earnings.
These strong results driven by warm weather and a continued focus on cost control raised our expectations for full year 2010 core earnings. Our GAAP results for the third quarter of 2010 included after-tax non-cash charges of $522 million or $2.19 per share related to goodwill and other asset impairments associated with the Ameren’s Merchant Generation operations.
These charges did not impact the company’s liquidity position and have been excluded from core earnings. Key drivers of the increase in our third quarter core earnings included a 16% increase in kilowatt hour sales of electricity to native load utility customers compared to the third quarter of 2009.
Sales to residential customers rose 28%, and sales to commercial customers rose 11%, reflecting warmer weather as well as underlying growth. The improving economy also contributed to the 18% increase in kilowatt-hour sales to industrial customers.
A significant portion of this 18% increase was due to the return to full capacity in March 2010 of our Missouri utility’s largest electric customer, the Noranda Aluminum smelter plant. However, even after excluding Noranda’s contribution, industrial sales rose 10% at our regulated utilities. New utilities rates and lower financing expenses also contributed to the earnings improvement.
Our year-over-year results reflect continued disciplined cost management and strong operating performance across all of our business segments. I am pleased to report that our power plants performed well during the hot weather of the third quarter.
Our coal and nuclear units were available for service 90% of the time, equaling the solid availability achieved in the prior year quarter. The favorable impact of these factors on the third quarter earnings comparison was mitigated by an expected reduction in Merchant Generation segment margins. Lower realized power prices and higher fuel and related transportation costs contributed to this decrease.
Turning to page four, I am pleased to announce that for the second quarter in a row, we have our raised our 2010 core earnings guidance reflecting strong year-to-date core earnings. We now expect core earnings to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.80 per share, an increase from our prior guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share.
Marty will provide further details on our third quarter results and our updated guidance in a few minutes.
Moving now to page five on October 1, we completed the reorganization of our Illinois businesses by merging our three Illinois electric and natural gas delivery utilities into a single legal entity now called Ameren Illinois Company.
We also moved the generation subsidiary that had been held under AmerenCILCO under Ameren Energy Resources Company with other Merchant Generation assets.
We believe consolidation of our Illinois utilities will over time lower cost and increase our efficiency, provide greater convenience to our customers, and improve financial reporting transparency for our investors.
Also on October 1, we applied the geographic naming convention to our Missouri utility. Union Electric Company is now doing business as Ameren Missouri. We believe the use of the Ameren Illinois and Ameren Missouri names will bring greater clarity to our communications with customers in the two states.
Turning to page six, I would like to highlight regulatory proceedings that are pending in our various jurisdictions. At Ameren Missouri, we filed an electric rate case on September 3 this year.
In this case we’re requesting a $263 million or 11% annual revenue increase. The request is primarily driven by the need to recover investments made to improve the reliability of our energy infrastructure, comply with environmental regulations, and recover higher net fuel costs.
By the time new rates from this case go into effect more than $1 billion of new energy infrastructure will be in operation and serving customers as compared to our last rate case. This includes investments related to the scrubber project at the Sioux power plant.
A decision for the Missouri Public Service Commission is required by August of 2011. Earlier this year, Ameren Missouri also requested a $12 million or 7% annual increase in natural gas delivery rates. A Missouri Public Service Commission decision on that request is required by May of 2011.
For details regarding these pending Missouri rate cases, I’ll refer you to our September 2010 investor presentations, which are archived on our Web site and to our filings with the SEC.
We also have an important regulatory matter pending in Illinois. We are in the midst of the Illinois Commerce Commission’s rehearing of several significant issues related to the rate order our Ameren Illinois electric and natural gas delivery businesses received this past spring.
You may recall that we significantly reduced planned spending levels at our Illinois utility to align such spending with the revenues and related cash flows resulting from that order.
The total additional annual revenue, we’re now requesting in conjunction with the rehearing is $32 million. Our prior request had been for $52 million. The reduction in our request reflects a recent Illinois Public Court decision involving Commonwealth Edison on an issue that was also in dispute in our rehearing case.
On October 6, the ICC administrative law judges issued their proposed order in the case. ALJs recommended that Ameren Illinois be granted an additional $25 million of annual revenue beyond the $15 million annual authorized in the May order. If the ICC adopts the ALJ’s proposed order, the 2010 delivery rate increase would total $40 million annually.
You may recall that the ICC’s May order also provided for recovery of an additional estimated $13 million annually of electric and gas supply related cost via riders. The ICC is not bound by ALJ’s proposed order. The ICC must issue a decision by November 12.
We stand ready to restore important reliability enhancements we cut from our plans based on the additional revenues we received as a result of the rehearing process. In addition to these rate cases in Missouri and Illinois we have a transmission case pending at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Specifically, we have applied for pre-approval of supportive rate treatment for phase 1 Grand River’s electric transmission projects, a series of proposed Greenfield regional projects we announced in early August. We filed our response to intervener’s comments on September 15 and we are awaiting an order.
As discussed on our August call, the investment associated with the Grand River’s phase 1 project could total more than $1.3 billion through 2021, with a potential investment of $125 million over the 2011 to 2014 period.
Our investment is contingent upon constructive FERC action in the pending case. In addition for us to move forward the projects would need to be approved by the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator or MISO. Where appropriate we will also seek state approvals for the projects. We are excited about the customer and investor benefits we expect to achieve with these projects.
On the environmental controls front, Ameren’s Missouri scrubber project at the Sioux power plant is near completion. We anticipate the scrubbers for both Sioux units will be in service by the end of the year. These scrubbers are expected to remove nearly 100% of the sulfur dioxide emissions resulting from coal burned at the plant or about 45,000 tons per year.
The scrubbers are also expected to materially reduce nitrogen oxide and mercury emissions. We believe that the operation of the Sioux scrubbers will significantly improve our Missouri utilities ability to comply with more stringent environmental standards.
Before I conclude my comments I would like to emphasize that at our Missouri and Illinois utilities our management teams remain committed to improving earned returns and exercising disciplined management of both operating and capital costs.
As I discussed, we’re also aggressively but prudently pursuing strategic investment opportunities in regional electric transmission projects.
Further, at our Merchant Generation business we continue to aggressively manage operating and capital costs, so that this business remains well positioned to weather current low power prices and benefit from an expected power price recovery, and at both our regulated and merchant businesses we remained focused on operating safely and reliably.
Now I’ll turn the call over to Marty.

Turning to page seven, and the third quarter 2010 column. Today we reported a third quarter 2010 net loss in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP of $167 million or $0.70 per share compared to third quarter 2009 GAA",1389,"Thanks Tom. Turning to page seven, and the third quarter 2010 column. Today we reported a third quarter 2010 net loss in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP of $167 million or $0.70 per share compared to third quarter 2009 GAAP net income of $227 million or $1.04 per share.
Excluding certain items in each year, Ameren recorded third quarter 2010 core net income of $333 million or $1.40 per share compared to third quarter 2009 core net income of $255 million or $1.16 per share.
Third quarter 2010 core earnings exclude two items that are included in GAAP earnings. The first item is goodwill and other asset impairment charges associated with our Merchant Generation business. These charges reduced third quarter 2010 GAAP results by $522 million or $2.19 per share.
These charges reflected a decline in the market value of Merchant Generation businesses including our own, principally as a result of sustained lower forward power prices as well as the potential enactment of more stringent environmental regulations.
All of the goodwill formerly assigned to the Merchant Generation segment was written off as part of this charge. These charges also included the reduction in the carrying amounts of certain of our merchant generating asset and our SO2 allowance inventory.
The goodwill and other asset impairment charges are non-cash and did not result in the violation of any Ameren or Ameren subsidiary debt covenants or counterparty agreements. These charges did not have an impact on current liquidity and are not expected to affect future operations.
The second item excluded from third quarter 2010 results in arriving at core earnings is $0.09 per share of gains representing the net effect of unrealized mark-to-market accounting. The net unrealized mark-to-market activity is primarily caused by power and fuel hedges for our Merchant Generation segment that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
Moving then to page eight, we highlight the key factors that drove the $0.24 per share increase in third quarter 2010 core earnings, compared to the third quarter of 2009 core earnings. Regulated electric and gas margins excluding the impact of rate changes, increased $0.40 per share compared to the year ago quarter reflecting higher electricity sales.
We estimate that warm weather increased third quarter 2010 results by $0.10 per share compared to normal weather. New utility rates over the past year in Missouri, Illinois, and for FERC electric transmission increased earnings by a combined $0.19 per share compared to the third quarter of 2009.
Financing costs declined $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the year ago quarter, partially reflecting increased capitalization of construction financing costs, and improved cash flow.
The factors negatively impacting the comparison of third quarter 2010 core earnings to third quarter 2009 core earnings included a decline in Merchant Generation margins of $0.16 per share. This margin decline reflected lower realized power prices and higher fuel and related transportation costs compared to the third quarter 2009.
An increased average number of common shares outstanding primarily due to our September 2009 FAC offering reduced third quarter 2010 results by $0.16 per share compared to the third quarter of 2009.
Because the additional common shares issued in the September 2009 public offering are now fully reflected in the average share count, prospective 2010 per share dilution will be limited to the relatively small number of shares issued through our dividend reinvestment and 401(k) plan.
Non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses increased $0.08 per share in the quarter, excluding non-core items. This increase in expenses primarily reflects the absence in the third quarter of 2010 of a benefit from anticipated recovery of previously expensed bad debt that was recognized in the third quarter of 2009.
Moving to page nine, and a discussion of our increased 2010 core earnings guidance, we now expect 2010 core earnings from our Missouri and Illinois regulated utility businesses to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share. This new range is $0.10 per share higher at the bottom and $0.05 per share higher at the top of the range reflecting stronger than expected third quarter results driven by warm summer weather.
Key drivers and assumptions behind our updated earnings guidance are listed on this page. We continue to expect our regulated utility businesses to achieve a 2010 weather normalized return on equity of approximately 8% to 8.5% on a combined basis.
This expected return on equity range is still well below our allowed returns of approximately 10% in both states, but is an improvement over our 2009 earned return on equity of approximately 7%.
Turning to page 10, we now expect our Merchant Generation business segment to post core earnings of $0.35 to $0.45 per share in 2010. This represents a reduction of $0.05 per share at the top end of the range and reflects refined margin expectations as year-end approaches. This page lists the key drivers and assumptions behind our 2010 Merchant Generation core earnings guidance.
The assumptions are largely unchanged from those disclosed during our second quarter 2010 earnings call. Our 2010 core earnings guidance excludes the first quarter 2010 charge of $0.06 per share related to the deferred tax impact of new federal healthcare laws, and the third quarter 2010 charge of $2.19 per share related to goodwill and other asset impairment associated with the Merchant Generation business.
Any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses recorded in 2010 will impact GAAP results, but will be excluded from our core earnings. I want to remind you that our earnings guidance for 2010 assumes normal weather for the fourth quarter of the year and is subject to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties outlined or referred to in today’s press release.
Moving to page 11, we provide an update of our cash flow outlook for 2010. I’m pleased to report we are raising our cash flow outlook for the second quarter in a row.
As you can see we now expect positive free cash flow of approximately $415 million, an increase from our August 5 guidance of $330 million. This improvement in our expected free cash flow is the result of additional expected cash tax savings and the previously discussed increase in earnings expectation.
Moving from 2010 earnings and cash flow to a discussion of our Merchant Generation segment, please now turn to page 12. Here we provide an update on our forward power sales hedges as of September 30. As you can see, we have significant hedges in place for 2012 at power prices greater than current market prices.
As we noted on our Merchant Generation core earnings guidance page for 2010, we have sold or hedged approximately 28.5 million megawatt hours at an average price of $47 per megawatt hour. For 2011, we’ve now hedged approximately $24 million megawatt hours at an average price of $46 per megawatt hour and for 2012, we have hedged approximately 14.5 million megawatt hours at an average price of $51.
Our capacity sales are approximately 86% hedged in 2010, approximately 67% hedged in 2011, and approximately 40% hedged in 2012. Our ownership of iron in the ground, low cost coal fired base load, and coal and gas fired intermediate and peaking generation gives us a solid position from which to work to achieve premiums greater than visible forward power prices through negotiated customized contracts.
As we move forward to hedge our open positions in 2011 and beyond, we continue to target wholesale and large retail opportunities with customized and value added load-shape products that allow us to enhance margins by leveraging our capabilities.
On page 13, we update our Merchant Generation segment’s fuel and related transportation hedges. As we disclosed on our Merchant Generation core earnings guidance page for 2010, our expected base load all-in fuel costs are hedged at approximately $22.50 per megawatt hour.
For 2010, we have now hedged approximately 23 million megawatt hours at about $25 per megawatt hour. For 2012, we have hedged approximately 13 million megawatt hours at about $26 per megawatt hour.
After funding expected capital expenditures of $120 million in 2010, we continue to anticipate that free cash flow from our Merchant Generation segment will be positive in 2010 allowing us to reduce outstanding Merchant Generation borrowings.
This completes our prepared remarks. And we will now be happy to take your questions.

Wanted to touch on your write-down of the Merchant Generation. Just two things there.

Really, it does have to do with the things that we outlined in our call. You’re right, we mentioned anticipated environmental regulations, and I guess the thing I’d point you there that had the pronounced effect is that we did have proposed rules, transportation rules that came out from EPA in July.
I think you saw that those did have a negative impact on the value of emission allowances. The charge we took which was gross $589 million charge, of that about $68 million was for an emission allowance write-down. Obviously those transport rules aren’t finalized yet, but the market value of emission allowances did drop and our estimation the allowances we had plus the allowances we would be granted in the future would not be fully utilized in operations and as a result we did write those down to their fair value.

David, it’s a good question I think that when you look at what we projected that time in terms of cost savings, we’re still on track to achieve. So we really haven’t pulled back on those initiatives at all. Now we saw about a $0.10 positive impact from weather in the third quarter. Obviously we’re able to raise our guidance which we are happy with.
One of the things, you’ll see in the slide I think from the bottom of slide 10 is we are experiencing a little bit of a higher expected effective tax rate than we expected at the end of the second quarter and that’s really very much a function of two things. One, the higher earnings; as your earnings go up, your effective tax rate goes up a little bit because of the impact of the permanent items.
The other thing that you see there is we have as I said before taken advantage of opportunities to reduce our cash taxes, most recently with (inaudible) signing of law that allows for additional bonus deprecation. We’re certainly taking advantage of that. That’s a timing item, which on a present value basis is going to help us because of the cash that it provides, but it actually wipes out a permanent deduction, manufacturing deduction, which also raises the effective tax rate. In terms of cost savings, we’re laser-focused on that and continue to be locked in, but our effective tax rate has come up a little bit from earlier expectation.

Otherwise I think some of the spending that you’ll have from a year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter will be driven by plant outages.
As we look at the fourth quarter at Union Electric for example, we do have the Sioux scrubber tie-ins and so as a result you’d expected to see a little bit higher O&M around an outage like that. And our O&M spending next year will certainly be influenced by that type of thing as well.

I am pleased to report that third quarter 2010 core earnings were $1.40 per share, a $0.24 per share increase over third quarter 2009 core earnings.These strong results driven by warm weather and",1379,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to report that third quarter 2010 core earnings were $1.40 per share, a $0.24 per share increase over third quarter 2009 core earnings.
These strong results driven by warm weather and a continued focus on cost control raised our expectations for full year 2010 core earnings. Our GAAP results for the third quarter of 2010 included after-tax non-cash charges of $522 million or $2.19 per share related to goodwill and other asset impairments associated with the Ameren’s Merchant Generation operations.
These charges did not impact the company’s liquidity position and have been excluded from core earnings. Key drivers of the increase in our third quarter core earnings included a 16% increase in kilowatt hour sales of electricity to native load utility customers compared to the third quarter of 2009.
Sales to residential customers rose 28%, and sales to commercial customers rose 11%, reflecting warmer weather as well as underlying growth. The improving economy also contributed to the 18% increase in kilowatt-hour sales to industrial customers.
A significant portion of this 18% increase was due to the return to full capacity in March 2010 of our Missouri utility’s largest electric customer, the Noranda Aluminum smelter plant. However, even after excluding Noranda’s contribution, industrial sales rose 10% at our regulated utilities. New utilities rates and lower financing expenses also contributed to the earnings improvement
Our year-over-year results reflect continued disciplined cost management and strong operating performance across all of our business segments. I am pleased to report that our power plants performed well during the hot weather of the third quarter.
Our coal and nuclear units were available for service 90% of the time, equaling the solid availability achieved in the prior year quarter. The favorable impact of these factors on the third quarter earnings comparison was mitigated by an expected reduction in Merchant Generation segment margins. Lower realized power prices and higher fuel and related transportation costs contributed to this decrease.
Turning to page four, I am pleased to announce that for the second quarter in a row, we have our raised our 2010 core earnings guidance reflecting strong year-to-date core earnings. We now expect core earnings to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.80 per share, an increase from our prior guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share.
Marty will provide further details on our third quarter results and our updated guidance in a few minutes.
Moving now to page five on October 1, we completed the reorganization of our Illinois businesses by merging our three Illinois electric and natural gas delivery utilities into a single legal entity now called Ameren Illinois Company
We also moved the generation subsidiary that had been held under AmerenCILCO under Ameren Energy Resources Company with other Merchant Generation assets.
We believe consolidation of our Illinois utilities will over time lower cost and increase our efficiency, provide greater convenience to our customers, and improve financial reporting transparency for our investors.
Also on October 1, we applied the geographic naming convention to our Missouri utility. Union Electric Company is now doing business as Ameren Missouri. We believe the use of the Ameren Illinois and Ameren Missouri names will bring greater clarity to our communications with customers in the two states.
Turning to page six, I would like to highlight regulatory proceedings that are pending in our various jurisdictions. At Ameren Missouri, we filed an electric rate case on September 3 this year.
In this case we’re requesting a $263 million or 11% annual revenue increase. The request is primarily driven by the need to recover investments made to improve the reliability of our energy infrastructure, comply with environmental regulations, and recover higher net fuel costs.
By the time new rates from this case go into effect more than $1 billion of new energy infrastructure will be in operation and serving customers as compared to our last rate case. This includes investments related to the scrubber project at the Sioux power plant
A decision for the Missouri Public Service Commission is required by August of 2011. Earlier this year, Ameren Missouri also requested a $12 million or 7% annual increase in natural gas delivery rates. A Missouri Public Service Commission decision on that request is required by May of 2011.
For details regarding these pending Missouri rate cases, I’ll refer you to our September 2010 investor presentations, which are archived on our Web site and to our filings with the SEC.
We also have an important regulatory matter pending in Illinois. We are in the midst of the Illinois Commerce Commission’s rehearing of several significant issues related to the rate order our Ameren Illinois electric and natural gas delivery businesses received this past spring.
You may recall that we significantly reduced planned spending levels at our Illinois utility to align such spending with the revenues and related cash flows resulting from that order.
The total additional annual revenue, we’re now requesting in conjunction with the rehearing is $32 million. Our prior request had been for $52 million. The reduction in our request reflects a recent Illinois Public Court decision involving Commonwealth Edison on an issue that was also in dispute in our rehearing case
On October 6, the ICC administrative law judges issued their proposed order in the case. ALJs recommended that Ameren Illinois be granted an additional $25 million of annual revenue beyond the $15 million annual authorized in the May order. If the ICC adopts the ALJ’s proposed order, the 2010 delivery rate increase would total $40 million annually.
You may recall that the ICC’s May order also provided for recovery of an additional estimated $13 million annually of electric and gas supply related cost via riders. The ICC is not bound by ALJ’s proposed order. The ICC must issue a decision by November 12.
We stand ready to restore important reliability enhancements we cut from our plans based on the additional revenues we received as a result of the rehearing process. In addition to these rate cases in Missouri and Illinois we have a transmission case pending at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Specifically, we have applied for pre-approval of supportive rate treatment for phase 1 Grand River’s electric transmission projects, a series of proposed Greenfield regional projects we announced in early August. We filed our response to intervener’s comments on September 15 and we are awaiting an order.
As discussed on our August call, the investment associated with the Grand River’s phase 1 project could total more than $1.3 billion through 2021, with a potential investment of $125 million over the 2011 to 2014 period.
Our investment is contingent upon constructive FERC action in the pending case. In addition for us to move forward the projects would need to be approved by the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator or MISO. Where appropriate we will also seek state approvals for the projects. We are excited about the customer and investor benefits we expect to achieve with these projects.
On the environmental controls front, Ameren’s Missouri scrubber project at the Sioux power plant is near completion. We anticipate the scrubbers for both Sioux units will be in service by the end of the year. These scrubbers are expected to remove nearly 100% of the sulfur dioxide emissions resulting from coal burned at the plant or about 45,000 tons per year.
The scrubbers are also expected to materially reduce nitrogen oxide and mercury emissions. We believe that the operation of the Sioux scrubbers will significantly improve our Missouri utility’s ability to comply with more stringent environmental standards.
Before I conclude my comments I would like to emphasize that at our Missouri and Illinois utilities our management teams remain committed to improving earned returns and exercising disciplined management of both operating and capital costs.
As I discussed, we’re also aggressively but prudently pursuing strategic investment opportunities in regional electric transmission projects.
Further, at our Merchant Generation business we continue to aggressively manage operating and capital costs, so that this business remains well positioned to weather current low power prices and benefit from an expected power price recovery, and at both our regulated and merchant businesses we remained focused on operating safely and reliably.
Now I’ll turn the call over to Marty."
373264,114812603,2469339,"Ameren Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks Tom. Turning to page seven, and the third quarter 2010 column. Today we reported a third quarter 2010 net loss in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP of $167 million or $0.70 per share compared to third quarter 2009 GAA",1389,"Thanks Tom. Turning to page seven, and the third quarter 2010 column. Today we reported a third quarter 2010 net loss in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP of $167 million or $0.70 per share compared to third quarter 2009 GAAP net income of $227 million or $1.04 per share.
Excluding certain items in each year, Ameren recorded third quarter 2010 core net income of $333 million or $1.40 per share compared to third quarter 2009 core net income of $255 million or $1.16 per share.
Third quarter 2010 core earnings exclude two items that are included in GAAP earnings. The first item is goodwill and other asset impairment charges associated with our Merchant Generation business. These charges reduced third quarter 2010 GAAP results by $522 million or $2.19 per share.
These charges reflected a decline in the market value of Merchant Generation businesses including our own, principally as a result of sustained lower forward power prices as well as the potential enactment of more stringent environmental regulations.
All of the goodwill formerly assigned to the Merchant Generation segment was written off as part of this charge. These charges also included the reduction in the carrying amounts of certain of our merchant generating asset and our SO2 allowance inventory.
The goodwill and other asset impairment charges are non-cash and did not result in the violation of any Ameren or Ameren subsidiary debt covenants or counterparty agreements. These charges did not have an impact on current liquidity and are not expected to affect future operations.
The second item excluded from third quarter 2010 results in arriving at core earnings is $0.09 per share of gains representing the net effect of unrealized mark-to-market accounting. The net unrealized mark-to-market activity is primarily caused by power and fuel hedges for our Merchant Generation segment that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
Moving then to page eight, we highlight the key factors that drove the $0.24 per share increase in third quarter 2010 core earnings, compared to the third quarter of 2009 core earnings. Regulated electric and gas margins excluding the impact of rate changes, increased $0.40 per share compared to the year ago quarter reflecting higher electricity sales.
We estimate that warm weather increased third quarter 2010 results by $0.10 per share compared to normal weather. New utility rates over the past year in Missouri, Illinois, and for FERC electric transmission increased earnings by a combined $0.19 per share compared to the third quarter of 2009.
Financing costs declined $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the year ago quarter, partially reflecting increased capitalization of construction financing costs, and improved cash flow.
The factors negatively impacting the comparison of third quarter 2010 core earnings to third quarter 2009 core earnings included a decline in Merchant Generation margins of $0.16 per share. This margin decline reflected lower realized power prices and higher fuel and related transportation costs compared to the third quarter 2009.
An increased average number of common shares outstanding primarily due to our September 2009 FAC offering reduced third quarter 2010 results by $0.16 per share compared to the third quarter of 2009.
Because the additional common shares issued in the September 2009 public offering are now fully reflected in the average share count, prospective 2010 per share dilution will be limited to the relatively small number of shares issued through our dividend reinvestment and 401(k) plan.
Non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses increased $0.08 per share in the quarter, excluding non-core items. This increase in expenses primarily reflects the absence in the third quarter of 2010 of a benefit from anticipated recovery of previously expensed bad debt that was recognized in the third quarter of 2009.
Moving to page nine, and a discussion of our increased 2010 core earnings guidance, we now expect 2010 core earnings from our Missouri and Illinois regulated utility businesses to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share. This new range is $0.10 per share higher at the bottom and $0.05 per share higher at the top of the range reflecting stronger than expected third quarter results driven by warm summer weather.
Key drivers and assumptions behind our updated earnings guidance are listed on this page. We continue to expect our regulated utility businesses to achieve a 2010 weather normalized return on equity of approximately 8% to 8.5% on a combined basis.
This expected return on equity range is still well below our allowed returns of approximately 10% in both states, but is an improvement over our 2009 earned return on equity of approximately 7%.
Turning to page 10, we now expect our Merchant Generation business segment to post core earnings of $0.35 to $0.45 per share in 2010. This represents a reduction of $0.05 per share at the top end of the range and reflects refined margin expectations as year-end approaches. This page lists the key drivers and assumptions behind our 2010 Merchant Generation core earnings guidance.
The assumptions are largely unchanged from those disclosed during our second quarter 2010 earnings call. Our 2010 core earnings guidance excludes the first quarter 2010 charge of $0.06 per share related to the deferred tax impact of new federal healthcare laws, and the third quarter 2010 charge of $2.19 per share related to goodwill and other asset impairment associated with the Merchant Generation business.
Any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses recorded in 2010 will impact GAAP results, but will be excluded from our core earnings. I want to remind you that our earnings guidance for 2010 assumes normal weather for the fourth quarter of the year and is subject to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties outlined or referred to in today’s press release.
Moving to page 11, we provide an update of our cash flow outlook for 2010. I’m pleased to report we are raising our cash flow outlook for the second quarter in a row.
As you can see we now expect positive free cash flow of approximately $415 million, an increase from our August 5 guidance of $330 million. This improvement in our expected free cash flow is the result of additional expected cash tax savings and the previously discussed increase in earnings expectation.
Moving from 2010 earnings and cash flow to a discussion of our Merchant Generation segment, please now turn to page 12. Here we provide an update on our forward power sales hedges as of September 30. As you can see, we have significant hedges in place for 2012 at power prices greater than current market prices.
As we noted on our Merchant Generation core earnings guidance page for 2010, we have sold or hedged approximately 28.5 million megawatt hours at an average price of $47 per megawatt hour. For 2011, we’ve now hedged approximately $24 million megawatt hours at an average price of $46 per megawatt hour and for 2012, we have hedged approximately 14.5 million megawatt hours at an average price of $51.
Our capacity sales are approximately 86% hedged in 2010, approximately 67% hedged in 2011, and approximately 40% hedged in 2012. Our ownership of iron in the ground, low cost coal fired base load, and coal and gas fired intermediate and peaking generation gives us a solid position from which to work to achieve premiums greater than visible forward power prices through negotiated customized contracts.
As we move forward to hedge our open positions in 2011 and beyond, we continue to target wholesale and large retail opportunities with customized and value added load-shape products that allow us to enhance margins by leveraging our capabilities.
On page 13, we update our Merchant Generation segment’s fuel and related transportation hedges. As we disclosed on our Merchant Generation core earnings guidance page for 2010, our expected base load all-in fuel costs are hedged at approximately $22.50 per megawatt hour.
For 2010, we have now hedged approximately 23 million megawatt hours at about $25 per megawatt hour. For 2012, we have hedged approximately 13 million megawatt hours at about $26 per megawatt hour.
After funding expected capital expenditures of $120 million in 2010, we continue to anticipate that free cash flow from our Merchant Generation segment will be positive in 2010 allowing us to reduce outstanding Merchant Generation borrowings.
This completes our prepared remarks. And we will now be happy to take your questions."

Really, it does have to do with the things that we outlined in our call. You’re right, we mentioned anticipated environmental regulations, and I guess the thing I’d point you there that had the pronounced effect is that we did have proposed rules, transportation rules that came out from EPA in July.
I think you saw that those did have a negative impact on the value of emission allowances. The charge we took which was gross $589 million charge, of that about $68 million was for an emission allowance write-down. Obviously those transport rules aren’t finalized yet, but the market value of emission allowances did drop and our estimation the allowances we had plus the allowances we would be granted in the future would not be fully utilized in operations and as a result we did write those down to their fair value."

Obviously we’re able to raise our guidance which we are happy with.
One of the things, you’ll see in the slide I think from the bottom of slide 10 is we are experiencing a little bit of a higher expected effective tax rate than we expected at the end of the second quarter and that’s really very much a function of two things. One, the higher earnings; as your earnings go up, your effective tax rate goes up a little bit because of the impact of the permanent items.
The other thing that you see there is we have as I said before taken advantage of opportunities to reduce our cash taxes, most recently with [indiscernible] signing of law that allows for additional bonus depreciation. We’re certainly taking advantage of that. That’s a timing item, which on a present value basis is going to help us because of the cash that it provides, but it actually wipes out a permanent deduction, manufacturing deduction, which also raises the effective tax rate. In terms of cost savings, we’re laser-focused on that and continue to be locked in, but our effective tax rate has come up a little bit from earlier expectation."

I am pleased to report that third quarter 2010 core earnings were $1.40 per share, a $0.24 per share increase over third quarter 2009 core earnings.These strong results driven by warm weather and",1379,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to report that third quarter 2010 core earnings were $1.40 per share, a $0.24 per share increase over third quarter 2009 core earnings.
These strong results driven by warm weather and a continued focus on cost control raised our expectations for full year 2010 core earnings. Our GAAP results for the third quarter of 2010 included after-tax non-cash charges of $522 million or $2.19 per share related to goodwill and other asset impairments associated with the Ameren’s Merchant Generation operations.
These charges did not impact the company’s liquidity position and have been excluded from core earnings. Key drivers of the increase in our third quarter core earnings included a 16% increase in kilowatt hour sales of electricity to native load utility customers compared to the third quarter of 2009.
Sales to residential customers rose 28%, and sales to commercial customers rose 11%, reflecting warmer weather as well as underlying growth. The improving economy also contributed to the 18% increase in kilowatt-hour sales to industrial customers.
A significant portion of this 18% increase was due to the return to full capacity in March 2010 of our Missouri utility’s largest electric customer, the Noranda Aluminum smelter plant. However, even after excluding Noranda’s contribution, industrial sales rose 10% at our regulated utilities. New utilities rates and lower financing expenses also contributed to the earnings improvement.
Our year-over-year results reflect continued disciplined cost management and strong operating performance across all of our business segments. I am pleased to report that our power plants performed well during the hot weather of the third quarter.
Our coal and nuclear units were available for service 90% of the time, equaling the solid availability achieved in the prior year quarter. The favorable impact of these factors on the third quarter earnings comparison was mitigated by an expected reduction in Merchant Generation segment margins. Lower realized power prices and higher fuel and related transportation costs contributed to this decrease.
Turning to page four, I am pleased to announce that for the second quarter in a row, we have our raised our 2010 core earnings guidance reflecting strong year-to-date core earnings. We now expect core earnings to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.80 per share, an increase from our prior guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share.
Marty will provide further details on our third quarter results and our updated guidance in a few minutes.
Moving now to page five on October 1, we completed the reorganization of our Illinois businesses by merging our three Illinois electric and natural gas delivery utilities into a single legal entity now called Ameren Illinois Company.
We also moved the generation subsidiary that had been held under AmerenCILCO under Ameren Energy Resources Company with other Merchant Generation assets.
We believe consolidation of our Illinois utilities will over time lower cost and increase our efficiency, provide greater convenience to our customers, and improve financial reporting transparency for our investors.
Also on October 1, we applied the geographic naming convention to our Missouri utility. Union Electric Company is now doing business as Ameren Missouri. We believe the use of the Ameren Illinois and Ameren Missouri names will bring greater clarity to our communications with customers in the two states.
Turning to page six, I would like to highlight regulatory proceedings that are pending in our various jurisdictions. At Ameren Missouri, we filed an electric rate case on September 3 this year.
In this case we’re requesting a $263 million or 11% annual revenue increase. The request is primarily driven by the need to recover investments made to improve the reliability of our energy infrastructure, comply with environmental regulations, and recover higher net fuel costs.
By the time new rates from this case go into effect more than $1 billion of new energy infrastructure will be in operation and serving customers as compared to our last rate case. This includes investments related to the scrubber project at the Sioux power plant.
A decision for the Missouri Public Service Commission is required by August of 2011. Earlier this year, Ameren Missouri also requested a $12 million or 7% annual increase in natural gas delivery rates. A Missouri Public Service Commission decision on that request is required by May of 2011.
For details regarding these pending Missouri rate cases, I’ll refer you to our September 2010 investor presentations, which are archived on our Web site and to our filings with the SEC.
We also have an important regulatory matter pending in Illinois. We are in the midst of the Illinois Commerce Commission’s rehearing of several significant issues related to the rate order our Ameren Illinois electric and natural gas delivery businesses received this past spring.
You may recall that we significantly reduced planned spending levels at our Illinois utility to align such spending with the revenues and related cash flows resulting from that order.
The total additional annual revenue, we’re now requesting in conjunction with the rehearing is $32 million. Our prior request had been for $52 million. The reduction in our request reflects a recent Illinois Public Court decision involving Commonwealth Edison on an issue that was also in dispute in our rehearing case.
On October 6, the ICC administrative law judges issued their proposed order in the case. ALJs recommended that Ameren Illinois be granted an additional $25 million of annual revenue beyond the $15 million annual authorized in the May order. If the ICC adopts the ALJ’s proposed order, the 2010 delivery rate increase would total $40 million annually.
You may recall that the ICC’s May order also provided for recovery of an additional estimated $13 million annually of electric and gas supply related cost via riders. The ICC is not bound by ALJ’s proposed order. The ICC must issue a decision by November 12.
We stand ready to restore important reliability enhancements we cut from our plans based on the additional revenues we received as a result of the rehearing process. In addition to these rate cases in Missouri and Illinois we have a transmission case pending at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Specifically, we have applied for pre-approval of supportive rate treatment for phase 1 Grand River’s electric transmission projects, a series of proposed Greenfield regional projects we announced in early August. We filed our response to intervener’s comments on September 15 and we are awaiting an order.
As discussed on our August call, the investment associated with the Grand River’s phase 1 project could total more than $1.3 billion through 2021, with a potential investment of $125 million over the 2011 to 2014 period.
Our investment is contingent upon constructive FERC action in the pending case. In addition for us to move forward the projects would need to be approved by the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator or MISO. Where appropriate we will also seek state approvals for the projects. We are excited about the customer and investor benefits we expect to achieve with these projects.
On the environmental controls front, Ameren’s Missouri scrubber project at the Sioux power plant is near completion. We anticipate the scrubbers for both Sioux units will be in service by the end of the year. These scrubbers are expected to remove nearly 100% of the sulfur dioxide emissions resulting from coal burned at the plant or about 45,000 tons per year.
The scrubbers are also expected to materially reduce nitrogen oxide and mercury emissions. We believe that the operation of the Sioux scrubbers will significantly improve our Missouri utility’s ability to comply with more stringent environmental standards.
Before I conclude my comments I would like to emphasize that at our Missouri and Illinois utilities our management teams remain committed to improving earned returns and exercising disciplined management of both operating and capital costs.
As I discussed, we’re also aggressively but prudently pursuing strategic investment opportunities in regional electric transmission projects.
Further, at our Merchant Generation business we continue to aggressively manage operating and capital costs, so that this business remains well positioned to weather current low power prices and benefit from an expected power price recovery, and at both our regulated and merchant businesses we remained focused on operating safely and reliably.
Now I’ll turn the call over to Marty."
373264,114812603,2469340,"Ameren Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks Tom. Turning to page seven, and the third quarter 2010 column. Today we reported a third quarter 2010 net loss in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP of $167 million or $0.70 per share compared to third quarter 2009 GAA",1389,"Thanks Tom. Turning to page seven, and the third quarter 2010 column. Today we reported a third quarter 2010 net loss in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP of $167 million or $0.70 per share compared to third quarter 2009 GAAP net income of $227 million or $1.04 per share.
Excluding certain items in each year, Ameren recorded third quarter 2010 core net income of $333 million or $1.40 per share compared to third quarter 2009 core net income of $255 million or $1.16 per share.
Third quarter 2010 core earnings exclude two items that are included in GAAP earnings. The first item is goodwill and other asset impairment charges associated with our Merchant Generation business. These charges reduced third quarter 2010 GAAP results by $522 million or $2.19 per share.
These charges reflected a decline in the market value of Merchant Generation businesses including our own, principally as a result of sustained lower forward power prices as well as the potential enactment of more stringent environmental regulations.
All of the goodwill formerly assigned to the Merchant Generation segment was written off as part of this charge. These charges also included the reduction in the carrying amounts of certain of our merchant generating asset and our SO2 allowance inventory.
The goodwill and other asset impairment charges are non-cash and did not result in the violation of any Ameren or Ameren subsidiary debt covenants or counterparty agreements. These charges did not have an impact on current liquidity and are not expected to affect future operations.
The second item excluded from third quarter 2010 results in arriving at core earnings is $0.09 per share of gains representing the net effect of unrealized mark-to-market accounting. The net unrealized mark-to-market activity is primarily caused by power and fuel hedges for our Merchant Generation segment that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
Moving then to page eight, we highlight the key factors that drove the $0.24 per share increase in third quarter 2010 core earnings, compared to the third quarter of 2009 core earnings. Regulated electric and gas margins excluding the impact of rate changes, increased $0.40 per share compared to the year ago quarter reflecting higher electricity sales.
We estimate that warm weather increased third quarter 2010 results by $0.10 per share compared to normal weather. New utility rates over the past year in Missouri, Illinois, and for FERC electric transmission increased earnings by a combined $0.19 per share compared to the third quarter of 2009.
Financing costs declined $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the year ago quarter, partially reflecting increased capitalization of construction financing costs, and improved cash flow.
The factors negatively impacting the comparison of third quarter 2010 core earnings to third quarter 2009 core earnings included a decline in Merchant Generation margins of $0.16 per share. This margin decline reflected lower realized power prices and higher fuel and related transportation costs compared to the third quarter 2009.
An increased average number of common shares outstanding primarily due to our September 2009 FAC offering reduced third quarter 2010 results by $0.16 per share compared to the third quarter of 2009.
Because the additional common shares issued in the September 2009 public offering are now fully reflected in the average share count, prospective 2010 per share dilution will be limited to the relatively small number of shares issued through our dividend reinvestment and 401(k) plan.
Non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses increased $0.08 per share in the quarter, excluding non-core items. This increase in expenses primarily reflects the absence in the third quarter of 2010 of a benefit from anticipated recovery of previously expensed bad debt that was recognized in the third quarter of 2009.
Moving to page nine, and a discussion of our increased 2010 core earnings guidance, we now expect 2010 core earnings from our Missouri and Illinois regulated utility businesses to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share. This new range is $0.10 per share higher at the bottom and $0.05 per share higher at the top of the range reflecting stronger than expected third quarter results driven by warm summer weather.
Key drivers and assumptions behind our updated earnings guidance are listed on this page. We continue to expect our regulated utility businesses to achieve a 2010 weather normalized return on equity of approximately 8% to 8.5% on a combined basis.
This expected return on equity range is still well below our allowed returns of approximately 10% in both states, but is an improvement over our 2009 earned return on equity of approximately 7%.
Turning to page 10, we now expect our Merchant Generation business segment to post core earnings of $0.35 to $0.45 per share in 2010. This represents a reduction of $0.05 per share at the top end of the range and reflects refined margin expectations as year-end approaches. This page lists the key drivers and assumptions behind our 2010 Merchant Generation core earnings guidance.
The assumptions are largely unchanged from those disclosed during our second quarter 2010 earnings call. Our 2010 core earnings guidance excludes the first quarter 2010 charge of $0.06 per share related to the deferred tax impact of new federal healthcare laws, and the third quarter 2010 charge of $2.19 per share related to goodwill and other asset impairment associated with the Merchant Generation business.
Any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses recorded in 2010 will impact GAAP results, but will be excluded from our core earnings. I want to remind you that our earnings guidance for 2010 assumes normal weather for the fourth quarter of the year and is subject to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties outlined or referred to in today’s press release.
Moving to page 11, we provide an update of our cash flow outlook for 2010. I’m pleased to report we are raising our cash flow outlook for the second quarter in a row.
As you can see we now expect positive free cash flow of approximately $415 million, an increase from our August 5 guidance of $330 million. This improvement in our expected free cash flow is the result of additional expected cash tax savings and the previously discussed increase in earnings expectation.
Moving from 2010 earnings and cash flow to a discussion of our Merchant Generation segment, please now turn to page 12. Here we provide an update on our forward power sales hedges as of September 30. As you can see, we have significant hedges in place for 2012 at power prices greater than current market prices.
As we noted on our Merchant Generation core earnings guidance page for 2010, we have sold or hedged approximately 28.5 million megawatt hours at an average price of $47 per megawatt hour. For 2011, we’ve now hedged approximately $24 million megawatt hours at an average price of $46 per megawatt hour and for 2012, we have hedged approximately 14.5 million megawatt hours at an average price of $51.
Our capacity sales are approximately 86% hedged in 2010, approximately 67% hedged in 2011, and approximately 40% hedged in 2012. Our ownership of iron in the ground, low cost coal fired base load, and coal and gas fired intermediate and peaking generation gives us a solid position from which to work to achieve premiums greater than visible forward power prices through negotiated customized contracts.
As we move forward to hedge our open positions in 2011 and beyond, we continue to target wholesale and large retail opportunities with customized and value added load-shape products that allow us to enhance margins by leveraging our capabilities.
On page 13, we update our Merchant Generation segment’s fuel and related transportation hedges. As we disclosed on our Merchant Generation core earnings guidance page for 2010, our expected base load all-in fuel costs are hedged at approximately $22.50 per megawatt hour.
For 2010, we have now hedged approximately 23 million megawatt hours at about $25 per megawatt hour. For 2012, we have hedged approximately 13 million megawatt hours at about $26 per megawatt hour.
After funding expected capital expenditures of $120 million in 2010, we continue to anticipate that free cash flow from our Merchant Generation segment will be positive in 2010 allowing us to reduce outstanding Merchant Generation borrowings.
This completes our prepared remarks. And we will now be happy to take your questions."

Really, it does have to do with the things that we outlined in our call. You’re right, we mentioned anticipated environmental regulations, and I guess the thing I’d point you there that had the pronounced effect is that we did have proposed rules, transportation rules that came out from EPA in July.
I think you saw that those did have a negative impact on the value of emission allowances. The charge we took which was gross $589 million charge, of that about $68 million was for an emission allowance write-down. Obviously those transport rules aren’t finalized yet, but the market value of emission allowances did drop and our estimation the allowances we had plus the allowances we would be granted in the future would not be fully utilized in operations and as a result we did write those down to their fair value."

Obviously we’re able to raise our guidance which we are happy with.
One of the things, you’ll see in the slide I think from the bottom of slide 10 is we are experiencing a little bit of a higher expected effective tax rate than we expected at the end of the second quarter and that’s really very much a function of two things. One, the higher earnings; as your earnings go up, your effective tax rate goes up a little bit because of the impact of the permanent items.
The other thing that you see there is we have as I said before taken advantage of opportunities to reduce our cash taxes, most recently with [indiscernible] signing of law that allows for additional bonus depreciation. We’re certainly taking advantage of that. That’s a timing item, which on a present value basis is going to help us because of the cash that it provides, but it actually wipes out a permanent deduction, manufacturing deduction, which also raises the effective tax rate. In terms of cost savings, we’re laser-focused on that and continue to be locked in, but our effective tax rate has come up a little bit from earlier expectation."

As you look at the various estimates that have occurred for the Sioux scrubber we think frankly, we’ve given good estimates and any changes to the overall scope of the project have been driven frankly by good learnings from other projects, from scrubber projects so we’ve increased the scope as well as certainly changes in the capital markets has certainly affected the overall project costs. Overall, we expect a thorough review, but we look forward to having that discussion as part of the overall rate case process."

One of the things we’ve pointed to is we do have a rehearing process in Illinois to the extent that we have additional revenues that are produced as a result of that. We’re certainly going to put some of the spending back in that we had reduced earlier this year. So, that is something that we’ve talked about doing. Otherwise I think some of the spending that you’ll have from a year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter will be driven by plant outages.
As we look at the fourth quarter at Union Electric for example, we do have the Sioux scrubber tie-ins and so as a result you’d expected to see a little bit higher O&M around an outage like that. And our O&M spending next year will certainly be influenced by that type of thing as well."
