It was three years ago, January 27, when I first had the privilege of announcing and trying to explain results here at Bristol-Myers Squibb. I'm very pleased every quarter, we've delivered on what we said we do. Fourt",855,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. It was three years ago, January 27, when I first had the privilege of announcing and trying to explain results here at Bristol-Myers Squibb. I'm very pleased every quarter, we've delivered on what we said we do. Fourth quarter last year is no exception to that. Before reviewing our fourth quarter performance, which was very strong, both strategically and operationally, I want to step back, highlight some of the key steps we took in 2009. The most recent, in December, we split off our remaining ownership in Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, making us a fully-focused biopharma company. As you notice, strategic decision and complex transaction was very well-received and has created significant shareholder value in a tax-efficient way and lowered the number of Bristol-Myers Squibb shares outstanding, as we go forward.Also of importance, we extended our ABILIFY agreement with Otsuka, giving us 29 additional months of ABILIFY contribution to our sales and earnings. Just as a reminder, we expect that extension will be accretive by at least $0.30 per share in both 2013 and 2014, probably when we need it the most. We acquired Medarex, our largest pearl to date in our String of Pearls. In addition to the full rights to the immuno-oncology compound ipilimumab, we gain access to novel technology platforms, scientific knowledge and outstanding research people.We launched ONGLYZA in six countries, including the U.S. and U.K,  as we advanced our robust innovative pipeline. The past year was truly transformational for Bristol-Myers Squibb. I can now say definitively that we've gone from becoming BioPharma to being BioPharma. With that as a background, let me turn to our fourth quarter results, which capped a year excellent execution across the company.In the fourth quarter, our revenues grew 11%, or if I adjust those for the tailwind of foreign exchange, a 7% growth rate globally, that's compared to the same period a year ago. Our key drivers PLAVIX and ABILIFY continue to have double-digit global growth. BARACLUDE, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA, all grew 30% or more in the quarter indicating how the customers positively the value of these recent launches. In our HIV portfolio, REYATAZ and Sustiva franchise both had solid growth of nearly 20%.Along with top line growth, we remain focused on executing our productivity initiatives, and we are seeing improvements in our operating and pretax margins, as well as in net income. Our non-GAAP operating margin improved by 300 basis points, and our pretax margins are up over 200 basis points compared to a year ago. By executing at both the top and bottom line for the fourth quarter, we realized an 18% increase in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from the continuing operations.  We also grew our full year non-GAAP EPS from continuing operation by 24%. Financially, as you know, we've focused on cash flow management, and that is reflected by our year-end cash position or approximately $10 billion in cash and marketable securities, which is comparative among our peer group. Translating that into net cash, that's a positive $3.5 billion and very strong. As a result, we've continue to pursue acquisitions, licensing deals and partnerships through our String of Pearls strategy. In the fourth quarter, we entered the global agreement with Alder, another pearl, ALD518 promising monoclonal antibody for rheumatoid arthritis. You will also note from our press release that we're going to collaborate with our partners in Indianapolis, that is the Eli Lilly and Company to co-develop and to co-commercialize what we used to be called ImClone 11F8, a Phase III cancer compound. We hope to leverage our shared learnings working ERBITUX to help bring this novel biologic to patients.Few weeks ago, we submitted a filing to the FDA for a fixed dose combination of ONGLYZA plus metformin extended-release tablets. We believe this represents a future opportunity to further demonstrate the value of ONGLYZA.  We're currently executing plans with our partners at AstraZeneca to improve ONGLYZA's growth trajectory. We're working to ensure patients and physicians understand ONGLYZA's an important treatment option for Type II diabetes. Looking ahead in 2010, we're confident we can sustain our operational performance. We're providing a 2010 GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.94 to $2.04 and a non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $2.15 to $2.25 per share. Importantly, this guidance excludes the potential impact of Comprehensive U.S. Healthcare Reform.On the near-term horizon, we have a May PDUFA date  for our novel kidney transplant plantation biologic, belatacept. We also expect to submit an application in the EU for the approval of apixaban for the; prevention of venous thromboembolism in the first half of this year.  Our R&D continues to be very productive and is preparing our company for leadership in a number of areas, all unmet medical need.  With strong operational results, disciplined financial management and a robust pipeline, we have what we need to execute our strategy. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Charlie Bancroft, our acting CFO. Charlie, as you know, is a 25-year veteran of Bristol-Myers Squibb. He knows more than all of us combined. And I welcome him to his first opportunity to address Wall Street."

I'll review our fourth quarter results and our 2010 guidance before we go to your questions.As Jim mentioned, we successfully completed the split off of Mead Johnson during the fourth quarter. As a result, we are recording Mead Johnson as a discontinued operation. Therefore, my comments will focus on our continuing operations or what is now solely our BioPharma business.I'm pleased to report that our fourth quarter performance was strong. Non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations increased 18% versus last year. Solid operational performance reflected by sales driven by our BioPharma business, along with continued focus on productivity resulted in yet another great quarter. The company posted fourth quarter net sales of $5 billion. Compared to last year, this is an increase of 11% or 7% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Our fourth quarter net sales include a positive 3% impact from price and a 4% increase in volume. U.S. net sales grew 11% to $3.1 billion compared to last year and internationally, our net sales were $1.9 billion, which represents an increase of 11% or 2% net of foreign exchange. Our underlying business is strong, and we have had consistent sales growth this year. Now let me walk you through some highlights of our products.In our Cardiovascular franchise, PLAVIX sales were up 10% globally or 8% net of foreign exchange. In the U.S., our fourth quarter sales for PLAVIX were up 11% versus last year. This increase was driven by price and volume gains as prescription growth in the U.S. was up 4%.  To date, Efient has had numeral impact on PLAVIX sales. At the end of December, generic [indiscernible]  Was available in 14 European countries, and we have seen significant share in price erosion in certain markets, notably France and the U.K.  In our P&L, this is primarily reflected in equity net income of affiliates.In Neuroscience, ABILIFY worldwide sales were up 17% in the quarter or 15% x FX. About 2/3 of our sales growth in the U.S. comes from our indications for bipolar and major depressive disorder. Our strong clinical program for ABILIFY has led to the broadest set of indications for any atypical. As part of the extension agreement we signed in April last year, reported alliance revenue is lower by $16 billion this quarter and that reflects the amortization of a $400 million upfront payment to Otsuka. Our Virology portfolio has global sales of 21% versus prior year, and that's led by BARACLUDE, which is up 39%,  the Sustiva franchise, which is up 19%, and REYATAZ, which is up 18% or 13% net of FX. REYATAZ global sales growth is steady in the face of competition from new [indiscernible] inhibitors launched in 2009. Nearly seven out of 10 newly treatment patients are prescribed either SUSTIVA or REYATAZ as part of their initial antiretroviral regimen. BARACLUDE global sales were $212 million in a quarter, and BARACLUDE has market leadership in the EU, China and Japan.ORENCIA sales were $168 million in the fourth quarter. That's an increase of 30% or 28% excluding FX. In the U.S., ORENCIA sales grew 19%,  and that was driven by an increase in total patients for ORENCIA, although the market for IV patients was down slightly. We plan to submit the subcutaneous administration of ORENCIA later in 2010.In oncology, ERBITUX sales in the U.S. were $163 million, which is down 9% from prior year. ERBITUX sales in colorectal cancer has begun to stabilize, despite the continued decline in the overall colorectal cancer marketplace. Sales in Head/Neck are down, driven by a slowing market. Global SPRYCEL sales were $119 million, that's up 38% or 29% x FX. We expect to present the results from the SPRYCEL, first line study later this year.And finishing with Metabolics, ONGLYZA was approved in the U.S. in July and in Europe in October. We along with our partners at AstraZeneca have launched in the U.S., Mexico and several markets in the EU. We look to launch in a number of additional key markets in the near future.  Fourth quarter sales in the U.S. were impacted by stocking orders in the third quarter. We are making steady progress in our launch. Positive signs include improve the access in reimbursement and increase in brand awareness by physicians and positive trends in physicians intent  to prescribe ONGLYZA.Now let me move to the rest of the P&L. Our non-GAAP gross margin was down 110 basis points to 72.2% compared to fourth quarter 2008. Improvements in mix and productivity were more than offset by unfavorable foreign exchange hedging year-over-year. Full year non-GAAP gross margin was up though 190 basis points to 73.3%. For the quarter, we reduced our non-GAAP total SG&A as a percentage of sales by 400 basis points, from 31% a year ago to 27% in Q4 2009. And this is primarily reflecting our continued productivity efforts. Non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 10% to $935 million. R&D as a percentage of sales was held relatively flat at 18.6% for the quarter. This was accomplished even with the investment in new pearls, which Medarex having the biggest impact. Our effective company non-GAAP tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 15.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 13.4% in 2008. Remember though that our fourth quarter 2008 rate was favorably impacted by accounting for the full-year R&D tax credit in that quarter. The 2009 fourth quarter tax rate is lower than expected based on various items that in part impacted the total year rate, but we're only fully accounted for in the fourth quarter. We don't expect most of these items to carry forward into 2010.A few words on our cash. We continue our focus on cash flow and our employees have fully-embraced this in our culture. We have excellent operating cash flows and continue to make great progress in working capital initiative. This is clearly reflected by our full-year trade working capital improvement of over $800 million, and that is against the good growth in our business.  As Jim mentioned, we currently have $10 billion in cash and marketable securities, and this provides us the financial flexibility we need to invest in  potential business development opportunities to improve the company's earnings profile in 2012 and beyond.Now let me turn to guidance. Our 2010 GAAP EPS guidance is $1.94 to $2.04. That reflects expected milestone payments from existing partnerships and other specified items related to restructuring. Our 2010 non-GAAP EPS guidance from continuing operations is $2.15 to $2.25, This guidance excludes any potential impact of U.S. healthcare reform. The key assumptions for our 2010 non-GAAP guidance include revenue growth of mid-single digits. We expect gross margins to be relatively flat. A&P should decrease in the mid to high single-digits. MS&A should be relatively flat. We expect our investment in R&D to be up in the mid to high single-digit range. And our full year effective tax rate should be in the 23% to 24% range. Now this assumes the extension of Subpart F in the R&D tax credit for 2010.Let me close by restating what has been the case with our past several quarters. Our fourth quarter performance was solid. Strong sales growth was the continued focus on productivity resulted in 18% increase in non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations. Across our organization, we are dedicated to delivering our strategy and our commitment. Thank you. Now we're happy to take your questions."

The primary endpoint's overall survival. Since it is event-driven to achieve the type of statistical significance we are hoping to achieve, I can't predict exactly. Our latest calculations are, on average, we may have information internally in the fall. It could go into next year. It could be earlier in the summer. So the average is in the fall. We do have an independent DSMB. Their charter is one of safety. I don't expect necessarily an early termination. We do feel that we should run this study out to be very clear and characterize the effect of this agent. I will mention, however, that we have another survival study, and this is in second line.

I believe that there is good space for good products for unmet medical needs. And the difference between what we had in the past and what we have now is probably the speed of the uptake is not where the products can. And I think your question is also related to ONGLYZA. And probably exclude if I make a comment about ONGLYZA, which is a good example of what we are talking about. I think nobody should spend too much time on the sales of ONGLYZA in 2009. This was what we consider the beginning of a long journey, a journey that we believe will be successful in a way that is in line with what I was describing before. Slower uptake than what we would have had with similar product 10 years ago. There is still a big significant unmet medical need in diabetes, 40% of Type II diabetes patients are not controlling current therapy. And ONGLYZA has a good efficacy and a good probability profile. So ONGLYZA and the other DPP-4 can help these patients. Despite the overall non-insulin anti-diabetic market remain flat in Q4 versus Q3, and despite this DPP-4 market grew only modestly at 3%, we believe that the class, the DPP-4 class, will grow and become a large and meaningful class. So we had a great product in that class, and we are confident that we will deliver results with that product. Just as a reminder, the benefit, clinical trial program has demonstrated that the benefit of ONGLYZA are there in achieving comprehensive glycemic control. So we believe that ONGLYZA in particular, not to give DPP-4 in general, but ONGLYZA in particular, will play both a role as affect add-on to either metformin or SU [sulphonylurea]. Now we have a number of key indicators that our encouraging. The brand awareness, which is now over 65%,  and when we launched in the U.S., it was zero. And we have made a strategic decision at that moment or until that moment not to pre-market during the regulatory review. So we will move from the zero then to 65% now. The number of physicians that are trying ONGLYZA continues to increase week over week, and those physicians we have prescribed ONGLYZA generally continue to prescribe. And one of the key focus areas that we have is to increase the number of physicians to try, because when they try, they continue. And we have made good progress in accessing reimbursement with over 75% of target life covered and over 40% now in Tier 2. So in a world that is different than the world we knew 10 years ago, we are challenging our plans at all times. We are always identifying the opportunities, and we do it in a very flexible and aggressive way with AstraZeneca, new ways to optimize the market and mix. And our goal is to drive awareness, try it and repeat. So going back to your more generic question, yes, the GP market in the U.S. is not the same market than the new. But we believe that we when you have a good product like this one, in a good class, with a big unmet medical needs is good space for growth. And AstraZeneca is totally convinced of the same."

Our goal is to replace calcineurin inhibitors were possible in order to achieve long-term improved renal function, graft and patient survival. That's the nature medical need in this area. And the CNIs the standard of care are nephrotoxic and elevate risk factors in cardiovascular disease. We presented our one-year data last year at May at the American Transplant Congress. You will no doubt see our two-year data at the Advisory Committee, and that will also be presented in May at the American Transplant Congress again. We are presenting and advocating as we do with many of our medicines, a risk-management plan and enhanced pharma call vigilance to appropriately, responsively follow in this specialty area, any the risks. The risks of PTLB that we've talked about and CNS infections will be discussed and their balance against the benefit. In this particular area, launching a product in a specialty group, I think lends itself to the new tools the FDA has, and the sponsor can avail themselves of to ensure appropriate use and the maximum benefit. And that's what we intend to layout March 1."

Our competitors data was just announced at the end of the year. So I would anticipate, if these were positive data, that we would go into review around the same time. These trials are somewhat different. I think since our competitor is suggesting that there can be improvements on the standard of care SPRYCEL by running the study that they ran. This is an important opportunity for patients and for us to present options as GLEEVEC drawbacks perhaps become more in focus. And I don't feel that it is purely an opportunity of the new diagnosed patients. It is the opportunity to redefine what is developing resistance or inadequate treatment to GLEEVEC. And that is the reason we included in our studies both complete cytogenetic response head-to-head with GLEEVEC, from which we have so much experience and therefore, is the only approved treatment and therefore, the only approved and reasonable competitor right now. And why we also took advantage of looking to major molecular response. And when you see data and we will present the data at ASCO this year, I think people will get excited about the evolving treatment in this area and there may be one or two new opportunities against GLEEVEC."

And therefore, Novartis themselvs with Tasigna and with SPRYCEL believe that there is a space, not only to compete with GLEEVEC but to displace it. But we don't have that direct comparison with Tasigna. What we see is that in the indications that we both have now, specially in the U.S., we are doing much better than Tasigna and I think the ratio of us to them is 2:1. And my understanding is Tasigna is more and more a centerline product, it's a failure of GLEEVEC and a failure of SPRYCEL. Now first line data that they announced need to be analyzed. We will have our own first line data. We will know that direct comparison, but I think we will be able to position SPRYCEL for what it is, a various effective drug with an important role and easy use of administration once a day and without any food effect. And therefore, there is a good space for SPRYCEL, all things first line if the data that we'll see and will make public confirm what we expect. As far as the ONGLYZA positioning, we are not against JANUVIA. We're not trying to get patients out of the JANUVIA. I will go at least to establish a good product with a great profile in both efficacy and safety. It will both be safety and efficacy in the marketplace. And we can say that JANUVIA has done a good job so far in establishing the DPP-4 class but we can do a good job too in establishing that class more. When we speak to doctors, we don't speak about JANUVIA, we speak about glycemic control, safety and I think that we think we talk to them about their understanding but only in a few and not always the possible single solutions to the problems of diabetes."

No more comments on financial flexibility. We're committed to cash dividends, aggressive look for the pearls and then let me close with just a short story.

Let me start by acknowledging once again the great contributions that Jim Cornelius has made in leading Bristol-Myers Squibb for the past several years. I now look forward to the opportunity to take the baton from Jean and lead the company with the ambition of having Bristol-Myers Squibb become a new benchmark for the industry. 
During the past six weeks since we met at our March 4 investment community event, I focused on making certain that we have the right team and the right governance structure in place to take Bristol-Myers Squibb to the next level. I have confirmed a number of key executives and their roles, but I've also made some senior management changes among my direct subords and their direct subords. And with our pure biopharma focus now in place, I've also simplified our governance structure with the goal to improve the speed and quality of our decision-making. We are now fully ready to accelerate the delivery of our strategy. And let me remind you that the key elements of our strategy include: One, a profitable and quality growth driven by an innovative and diversified pipeline; two, a continued focus on productivity; three, a good attention to our balance sheet and capital structure; and four, the fulfillment of expectations of shareholders, patients, prescribers, payers and employees.
Now moving to our first quarter update, I'm sure you expect my comments about healthcare reform, the topic on everyone's mind since the U.S. legislation was enacted. As we noted in our press release this morning, the 2010 EPS guidance we announced in January excluded the potential impact of U.S. health care reform simply because at that time, there were no details on which to base any realistic estimates. 
With the approval of the reform legislation, we now know that the increases in Medicaid-related rebates and the changes in the retiree health care costs deductibility taken together had a $0.03 a share impact on our EPS in the first quarter. And as we seek continued implementation of the reform during the rest of the year, we anticipate its negative impact to amount to about $0.12 a share. However, our updated non-GAAP EPS guidance does not reduce the range by $0.12, but only by $0.05. We started taking mitigating actions earlier in the year in anticipation of the approval of the reform. We have plans to take additional measures during the rest of 2010, and our business is performing strongly. As a consequence, we expect to be able to absorb about half of the health care reform impact this year. I'd like now to turn to our first quarter results and how I view them.
We had a strong first quarter. I am glad, very glad of our 11% top line growth or 8% net of foreign exchange. One of my biggest priorities is on revenue growth, both in short and longer term. The strong sales increases in this first quarter are encouraging, and the emphasis on top line growth will continue, not just for the rest of this year, but certainly as we navigate through health care reform and the patent expirations. 
Charlie Bancroft will give you, later on, additional details around the good performance of our key brands. I only want to say a few words about ONGLYZA. ONGLYZA, our most recent product launch, did not do as well in terms of revenues as we were originally projecting. I must acknowledge that we were expecting a steeper sales update, also counting on a faster growth of the DPP-4 class that has not instead happened. However, we are not giving up on ONGLYZA at all. This is a great medicine, with significant glycemic efficacy and a low rate of side effects. And we are continuing to see solid progress in generating new prescriptions and getting additional physicians to try it. All leading indicators on patient uptake and physicians response are moving in the right direction, and we have fine-tuned our messages on endocrinologists. We are initiating a DPP campaign in the U.S, and the FDA has accepted our sNDA for a fixed dose combination of ONGLYZA with metformin, which we hope to launch by the end of this year.
Moving from sales to the rest of the P&L, you have seen that we have continued to improve our operating margin and increased our net income. We have been able to gain that kind of leverage by adding our, by now established cost discipline to strong topline growth. As I told you back in March, we have no intention at this time of creating a third wave of formal productivity initiatives. Instead, we are relying on the fact that productivity and careful cost management are now part of our operating culture. As a result, we continually improve our cost base without touching in investments that are necessary to support top line growth. 
We will have an interesting ASCO this year, a very interesting ASCO. We have, among other things, the presentation of data for ipilimumab in advanced melanoma, and SPRYCEL in first-line CML. Both products, ipilimumab and SPRYCEL first line are on track for global submissions in 2010. And ADA will be also interesting, as we expect to present in August, Phase III study of dapagliflozin for Type 2 diabetes. As you know, the PDUFA date for belatacept is just a few days from now, and we are waiting for news. The agency is digesting a great deal of information we have submitted to them, and we are respectful of the fact that these requires work and time. What counts and counts a lot is that we had a positive recommendation for belatacept's approval from the FDA Advisory Committee in early March and a confidence about its risk-benefit profile for patients. 
And in April, we presented very encouraging Phase II data on our NS5A as well, an inhibitor for Hepatitis C, at the European Liver Congress. BMS' NS5A as well as the PEG-Interferon lambda that we acquired from ZymoGenetics are significant compounds in what we believe is a well-differentiated Hepatitis C portfolio in earlier stages of development. Business development continues to be a key component in our strategy to grow the top line and help ensure pipeline sustainability. In early March, we acquired an asset ready for Phase II from Allergan to address neuropathic pain, a condition that bridges two of our therapeutic areas, metabolic disorders and neuroscience. 
So conclusion, a good quarter. We have results that were better than we had originally planned, and I understand, also better than what you expected. Health care reform affects our results, but does change the underlying strength of our business and the focus of our strategy. 
Now, Charlie Bancroft will provide additional insights into our first quarter performance. Before turning the call over to Charlie, to him, I want to congratulate Charlie on having gone from interim CFO to official CFO, and give him thanks to his capabilities and track record. Charlie?"

We did have a very strong quarter. We delivered a non-GAAP EPS of $0.56, that's up 33%, despite a negative impact of $0.03 from U.S. health care reform. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by good sales growth,",1363,"Thank you very much, Lamberto. We did have a very strong quarter. We delivered a non-GAAP EPS of $0.56, that's up 33%, despite a negative impact of $0.03 from U.S. health care reform. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by good sales growth, continued expense management and fewer shares outstanding due to the Mead Johnson split off in December last year. 
Now, I want to give you some highlights from our first quarter financial results, discuss the impact of U.S. health care reform and talk about guidance before we go to your questions. The company reported first quarter net sales from continuing operations of $4.8 billion, an increase of 11% or 8%, excluding foreign exchange. Health care reform had a 1% negative impact on net sales in the quarter and volume was up 4%. 
The first quarter sales performance was powered, in large part, by double-digit increases in our cardiovascular and virology franchises. PLAVIX grew 18% in the U.S., confirming its established strength and continuing potential. U.S. sales were driven by a 2% increase in prescription demand, a higher average selling price, and we did see some inventory build in the retail channel year-over-year. 
In Europe, generic clopidogrel was available in most of the countries. We already see the majority of our business in important countries like France, Germany and the U.K. impacted by generics. We expected erosion of PLAVIX sales in Europe to begin to slow, but it will continue. The impact is primarily recorded in equity income from affiliate in our P&L. Second, our virology franchise demonstrated strong global sales growth, up 19% from the year ago. This sales strength demonstrates the continued strong demand for REYATAZ, the SUSTIVA franchise and BARACLUDE across both our U.S. and international markets. 
Finally, we had another solid quarter for ABILIFY, with global net sales up 5%. In the U.S., sales of ABILIFY were down 2% despite a 9% increase in prescription demand. That was fueled by our indications for bipolar and major depressive disorder. When comparing ABILIFY'S U.S. sales for the first quarter of 2010 with last year, there are three things to keep in mind: First, due to the extension and revision of our contractual turns with Otsuka last April, our share of net sales was reduced to 58% from 65%. Second, we are amortizing the $400 million upfront payment to Otsuka as reduction of net sales. So there is an approximately $16 million quarterly charge that was not in the first quarter last year.  And then lastly, ABILIFY sales in the Medicaid channel were negatively  impacted by health care reform. 
Now, let me give you some highlights from the rest of our P&L. Our non-GAAP gross margin remain relatively flat at 73.5% compared to the first quarter of 2009. Improvements in product mix, price and productivity were offset by changes in the way we account for the agreement with Otsuka and the impact from foreign exchange. Advertising and promotion expenses were down 15% to $212 million for the quarter. The decrease is due to less spending on the promotion of certain products at the end of their life cycle and to Otsuka's reimbursement of certain ABILIFY, SPRYCEL and exemplary expenses. This was partially offset by increased spending for the ONGLYZA launch and other pipeline products. Non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 12% to $855 million. This growth rate is higher than our full year guidance, as we are absorbing the R&D spend from Pearls acquired during the second half of 2009, most notably Medarex. We expect this growth rate to slow in the second half of 2010.
Non-GAAP other income was $87 million, approximately $16 million higher than last year. There are a lot of small items that impacted this number, which vary from quarter-to-quarter. Two of the more significant items that drove the favorability in the first quarter for manufacturing profits from partners and a one-time foreign exchange gain indirectly related to the sale of the manufacturing plant in Latina, Italy. These are not recurring items. Equity income declined 34%, driven by continued erosion of PLAVIX sales in Europe from generic clopi as I mentioned earlier. 
The effective overall non-GAAP tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 24.8% in the first quarter. This rate was negatively impacted by the one-time health care reform charge and the lack of the R&D tax credit, but was offset by favorable earnings mix and one-time discrete tax items. Our guidance remains between 23% and 24% for the year. However, the tax rate will vary by quarter, depending on when we see the resolution of the R&D tax credit. As a reminder, we will only account for the tax credit in the quarter in which it happens. We continue our focus on cash flow, and we currently have $9.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. This helps provide the financial flexibility we need to support our dividend and invest in potential business development opportunities. As we said in March, we will also consider additional options such as share repurchases or debt restructuring. Now let me turn to financial guidance.
As Lamberto mentioned, the passage of U.S. health care reform is already having an impact on our results, and we expect increasing rebates as the new health care law is implemented. For background, in 2009, Medicaid Fee for Service managed Medicaid and 340B programs together or approximately 12% of U.S. net sales. The products most exposed to Medicaid are ABILIFY and our virology franchise. In addition, in 2009, approximately 30% of U.S. net sales were for Medicare Part D. PLAVIX is a product most exposed to Medicare. And remember, we share the impact with sanofi. 
As we look at the rest of this year, we estimate health care reform to result in a negative impact of $350 million to $400 million in net sales or about $0.12 per share on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. We are updating our 2010 GAAP EPS range to $1.84 to $1.94 and 2010 non-GAAP EPS guidance range from $210 million to $220 million, including the impact of U.S. health care reform, which was explicitly excluded from our original guidance.
The $0.12 per share negative impact from health care reform in 2010 is expected to be partially offset by the strength of our underlying business and mitigating actions we are taking. As a result, on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, we expect to offset approximately half of the $0.12 impact. In 2011, we estimate the impact to roughly double at both the top and bottom line as the donut hole coverage in pharma fee take effect. Remember that the sales impact will be relatively higher than earnings due to the accounting treatment for PLAVIX, where we record 100% of sales that share profits with sanofi. 
Looking at 2011 and beyond, it is important to note that there's a range of impact, given uncertainties on the health care reform implementation guideline and on the eventual volume of patients under utilization within some of other programs. As Lamberto has indicated, we will be looking to maximize our revenue opportunities as well as identifying mitigating actions consistent with our track record of delivering on productivity. At our Investors Meeting in March, we also provided 2013 minimum non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.95. That guidance also excluded the potential impact of U.S. health care reform. Now that we have more visibility on how health care reform could affect our business, we are reviewing and updating our strategic plan and expect to be able to update you on our outlook for 2013 in the coming months. We are confident in the strength of our underlying business and the opportunities we have both on the revenue and cost side. 
In closing, by any measure, Bristol-Myers Squibb had a great first quarter, double-digit sales growth driven by key products and franchises and good management of expenses led the solid operating margin improvement. We remain focused on managing the impact of U.S. health care reform and at the same time, we are committed to making the right investments to ensure the sustainability of our pipeline. I would now like to turn it over to your questions."

And it is true, there are a number of countries that are under pressure. Greece, obviously is under everybody's attention.

And obviously, similar measures are being studied in other countries. Now, we have been dealing with that for years. And what is important in those countries, and really important in the U.S., is to have enough innovative products to offer to the marketplace.

So patients, since this is an insulin-independent mechanism and unique in that regard, we're very excited to present data on patients that seem to have a lot of insulin resistance and large doses of insulin. And the question of the study is, ""Can the addition of dapagliflozin decrease the amount insulin and insulin dependence, and what would be the improvement and what we're after of the triad of clinical benefits with regard to glycemic control, blood pressure control and weight control with dapagliflozin?"" We've now completed eight Phase III studies in dapagliflozin and the emerging profile is as we have been reporting it. We will roll out three more Phase III studies in September of 2010 in Europe, data from the add-on to the sulfonylurea study, data from an add-on to metformin versus sulfonylurea and data from an add-on to the insulin Phase III study actually, similarly as we will do in ADA, we'll do this in Europe. So we remain excited about that. You asked about infection risk. To date in the program, the rate of signs, symptoms and other reports suggested of urinary tract infections is about similar to placebo, while the rates of signs, symptoms and other reports suggested of genital infections, these are usually Canada infections, are higher than placebo and educating the patient and being proactive to deal with this, what we think of this and tolerability issue is our focus.

I did refer to the fact that there were ongoing health authority discussions then, which we always do to make sure that we are in line with what the agency expects in the content and the form of the submission. We've had these discussions now in the U.S. and Europe and expect to submit applications for regulatory approval of ipilimumab in both the U.S. and Europe over the next couple of months. These are discussions with the regulatory authorities who focused on the data we have on hand, from the 020 study and the indication would be appropriate to the data in that regard.

But we have worked out with the agencies around the world that the first-tier read-out of important markers that are correlated with survival in this disease will be acceptable for potential approval on a conditional basis, on an accelerated basis, and then full approval will be available to either agent that shows the proper results at five years. So we will have data on an ongoing basis out to five years with  these patients with regard to durability. We also will be investigating switch information for this. The two trials are different. Our primary endpoint is a major cytogenetic response, which was what GLEEVEC showed for its approval and is the accepted primary end-point recommended by health care authorities. Major molecular responses and other important emerging biomarker, the secondary endpoint for us. Our trial also differs in the fact that we did include cardiac patients and this is very important for the community. We did not exclude them as the case in the CIGNA trial and of course, the CIGNA already has black box warning.

I think the $4 script has clearly driven patients and physicians to that at the moment. And when we see our abandonment rate, i.e. patients going into the pharmacy with a prescription and then walking away not filling that prescription, it's clear that cost in today's environment is an issue. It's an issue we're addressing as far as we can, and they can link back towards to what Lamberto was saying around selling the value proposition of this product in combination with metformin. Once the entire environment starts to understand that to treat diabetes, which is a chronic disease that patients will either die from or die with, importance of early intervention with a number of compounds with different modes of action is going to be the most essential and specific way of treating patients. So we have looked very clear at the market in terms of what's required to drive an uptick. We obviously would like a steeper curve at the moment. But we do, as Lamberto said, continue to see good progress with our leading indicators, which make us feel fairly confident about our ability to grow ONGLYZA in this marketplace. Physicians have tried the product, generally continue to use it and to accelerate this option, we are refocusing our efforts in specialists, with a more targeted clinical campaign to endocrinologists. In addition, we make pretty good progress with access and reimbursement, and almost 85% of total lies on our [indiscernible](48:02) with almost 60% in Tier 1 and Tier 2. We'd have a value program in place for those patients not covered by Tier 2, and in a couple of weeks, will strengthen the offering to address the deceived access barriers. Finally, our brand awareness is almost 65% with physicians, and to further this awareness from point of care to point of compliance and adherence, we've launched a new patient education DTC print campaign and we'll be launching a TV campaign in May. The two things we watch carefully, of course, are new naive RXs and new physician trials, and in both cases, we see week-by-week increases. Our share of new naive DPP-4 prescriptions is now reaching about 6% and the number of new physicians having prescribed ONGLYZA is around 20,000. I think we continue to believe that with more than 40% of Type 2 diabetes patients not achieving treatment goal on monotherapy that we really owe an opportunity to continue focusing on this product and ensuring the patient, the physician understand the dramatic opportunity of putting them together and helping patients."

And then just a follow on with SPRYCEL, without survival datum, do you still expect that SPRYCEL and to CIGNA combined could become standard of care in front-line CML?

Let me start by acknowledging once again the great contributions that Jim Cornelius has made in leading Bristol-Myers Squibb for the past several years. I now look forward to the opportunity to take the baton from Jim and lead the company with the ambition of having Bristol-Myers Squibb become a new benchmark for the industry. 
During the past six weeks since we met at our March 4 investment community event, I focused on making certain that we have the right team and the right governance structure in place to take Bristol-Myers Squibb to the next level. I have confirmed a number of key executives and their roles, but I've also made some senior management changes among my direct subords and their direct subords. And with our pure biopharma focus now in place, I've also simplified our governance structure with the goal to improve the speed and quality of our decision-making. We are now fully ready to accelerate the delivery of our strategy. And let me remind you that the key elements of our strategy include: One, a profitable and quality growth driven by an innovative and diversified pipeline; two, a continued focus on productivity; three, a good attention to our balance sheet and capital structure; and four, the fulfillment of expectations of shareholders, patients, prescribers, payers and employees.
Now moving to our first quarter update, I'm sure you expect my comments about healthcare reform, the topic on everyone's mind since the U.S. legislation was enacted. As we noted in our press release this morning, the 2010 EPS guidance we announced in January excluded the potential impact of U.S. health care reform simply because at that time, there were no details on which to base any realistic estimates. 
With the approval of the reform legislation, we now know that the increases in Medicaid-related rebates and the changes in retiree health care costs tax deductibility taken together had a $0.03 a share impact on our EPS in the first quarter. And as we see continued implementation of the reform during the rest of the year, we anticipate its negative impact to amount to about $0.12 a share. However, our updated non-GAAP EPS guidance does not reduce the range by $0.12, but only by $0.05. We started taking mitigating actions earlier in the year in anticipation of the approval of the reform. We plan to take additional measures during the rest of 2010, and our business is performing strongly. As a consequence, we expect to be able to absorb about half of the health care reform impact this year. I'd like now to turn to our first quarter results and how I view them.
We had a strong first quarter. I am glad, very glad, of our 11% top line growth or 8% net of foreign exchange. One of my biggest priorities is on revenue growth, both in short and longer term. The strong sales increases in this first quarter are encouraging, and the emphasis on top line growth will continue, not just for the rest of this year, but certainly as we navigate through health care reform and the patent expirations. 
Charlie Bancroft will give you, later on, additional details around the good performance of our key brands. I only want to say a few words about ONGLYZA. ONGLYZA, our most recent product launch, did not do as well in terms of revenues as we were originally projecting. I must acknowledge that we were expecting a steeper sales update, also counting on a faster growth of the DPP-4 class that has not instead happened. However, we are not giving up on ONGLYZA at all. This is a great medicine, with significant glycemic efficacy and a low rate of side effects. And we are continuing to see solid progress in generating new prescriptions and getting additional physicians to try it. All leading indicators on patient uptake and physicians response are moving in the right direction, and we have fine-tuned our messages on endocrinologists. We are initiating a DPP campaign in the U.S, and the FDA has accepted our sNDA for a fixed dose combination of ONGLYZA with metformin, which we hope to launch by the end of this year.
Moving from sales to the rest of the P&L, you have seen that we have continued to improve our operating margin and increased our net income. We have been able to gain that kind of leverage by adding our, by now established cost discipline to strong topline growth. As I told you back in March, we have no intention at this time of creating a third wave of formal productivity initiatives. Instead, we are relying on the fact that productivity and careful cost management are now part of our operating culture. As a result, we continually improve our cost base without touching in investments that are necessary to support top line growth. 
We will have an interesting ASCO this year, a very interesting ASCO. We have, among other things, the presentation of data for ipilimumab in advanced melanoma, and SPRYCEL in first-line CML. Both products, ipilimumab and SPRYCEL first line are on track for global submissions in 2010. And ADA will be also interesting, as we expect to present in August, Phase III study of dapagliflozin for Type 2 diabetes. As you know, the PDUFA date for belatacept is just a few days from now, and we are waiting for news. The agency is digesting a great deal of information we have submitted to them, and we are respectful of the fact that these requires work and time. What counts and counts a lot is that we had a positive recommendation for belatacept's approval from the FDA Advisory Committee in early March and a confidence about its risk-benefit profile for patients. 
And in April, we presented very encouraging Phase II data on our NS5A as well, an inhibitor for Hepatitis C, at the European Liver Congress. BMS' NS5A as well as the PEG-Interferon lambda that we acquired from ZymoGenetics are significant compounds in what we believe is a well-differentiated Hepatitis C portfolio in earlier stages of development. Business development continues to be a key component in our strategy to grow the top line and help ensure pipeline sustainability. In early March, we acquired an asset ready for Phase II from Allergan to address neuropathic pain, a condition that bridges two of our therapeutic areas, metabolic disorders and neuroscience. 
So conclusion, a good quarter. We have results that were better than we had originally planned, and I understand, also better than what you expected. Health care reform affects our results, but does change the underlying strength of our business and the focus of our strategy. 
Now, Charlie Bancroft will provide additional insights into our first quarter performance. Before turning the call over to Charlie, to him, I want to congratulate Charlie on having gone from interim CFO to official CFO, and give him thanks to his capabilities and track record. Charlie?"

We did have a very strong quarter. We delivered a non-GAAP EPS of $0.56, that's up 33%, despite a negative impact of $0.03 from U.S. health care reform. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by good sales growth,",1363,"Thank you very much, Lamberto. We did have a very strong quarter. We delivered a non-GAAP EPS of $0.56, that's up 33%, despite a negative impact of $0.03 from U.S. health care reform. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by good sales growth, continued expense management and fewer shares outstanding due to the Mead Johnson split off in December last year. 
Now, I want to give you some highlights from our first quarter financial results, discuss the impact of U.S. health care reform and talk about guidance before we go to your questions. The company reported first quarter net sales from continuing operations of $4.8 billion, an increase of 11% or 8%, excluding foreign exchange. Health care reform had a 1% negative impact on net sales in the quarter and volume was up 4%. 
The first quarter sales performance was powered, in large part, by double-digit increases in our cardiovascular and virology franchises. PLAVIX grew 18% in the U.S., confirming its established strength and continuing potential. U.S. sales were driven by a 2% increase in prescription demand, a higher average selling price, and we did see some inventory build in the retail channel year-over-year. 
In Europe, generic clopidogrel was available in most of the countries. We already see the majority of our business in important countries like France, Germany and the U.K. impacted by generics. We expected erosion of PLAVIX sales in Europe to begin to slow, but it will continue. The impact is primarily recorded in equity income from affiliate in our P&L. Second, our virology franchise demonstrated strong global sales growth, up 19% from the year ago. This sales strength demonstrates the continued strong demand for REYATAZ, the SUSTIVA franchise and BARACLUDE across both our U.S. and international markets. 
Finally, we had another solid quarter for ABILIFY, with global net sales up 5%. In the U.S., sales of ABILIFY were down 2% despite a 9% increase in prescription demand. That was fueled by our indications for bipolar and major depressive disorder. When comparing ABILIFY's U.S. sales for the first quarter of 2010 with last year, there are three things to keep in mind: First, due to the extension and revision of our contractual terms with Otsuka last April, our share of net sales was reduced to 58% from 65%. Second, we are amortizing the $400 million upfront payment to Otsuka as reduction of net sales. So there is an approximately $16 million quarterly charge that was not in the first quarter last year.  And then lastly, ABILIFY sales in the Medicaid channel were negatively  impacted by health care reform. 
Now let me give you some highlights from the rest of our P&L. Our non-GAAP gross margin remain relatively flat at 73.5% compared to the first quarter of 2009. Improvements in product mix, price and productivity were offset by changes in the way we account for the agreement with Otsuka and the impact from foreign exchange. Advertising and promotion expenses were down 15% to $212 million for the quarter. The decrease is due to less spending on the promotion of certain products at the end of their life cycle and to Otsuka's reimbursement of certain ABILIFY, SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA expenses. This was partially offset by increased spending for the ONGLYZA launch and other pipeline products. Non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 12% to $855 million. This growth rate is higher than our full year guidance, as we are absorbing the R&D spend from Pearls acquired during the second half of 2009, most notably Medarex. We expect this growth rate to slow in the second half of 2010.
Non-GAAP other income was $87 million, approximately $60 million higher than last year. There are a lot of small items that impacted this number, which vary from quarter-to-quarter. Two of the more significant items that drove the favorability in the first quarter for manufacturing profits from partners and a one-time foreign exchange gain indirectly related to the sale of the manufacturing plant in Latina, Italy. These are not recurring items. Equity income declined 34%, driven by continued erosion of PLAVIX sales in Europe from generic clopi as I mentioned earlier. 
The effective overall non-GAAP tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 24.8% in the first quarter. This rate was negatively impacted by the one-time health care reform charge and the lack of the R&D tax credit, but was offset by favorable earnings mix and one-time discrete tax items. Our guidance remains between 23% and 24% for the year. However, the tax rate will vary by quarter, depending on when we see the resolution of the R&D tax credit. As a reminder, we will only account for the tax credit in the quarter in which it happens. We continue our focus on cash flow, and we currently have $9.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. This helps provide the financial flexibility we need to support our dividend and invest in potential business development opportunities. As we said in March, we will also consider additional options such as share repurchases or debt restructuring. Now let me turn to financial guidance.
As Lamberto mentioned, the passage of U.S. health care reform is already having an impact on our results, and we expect increasing rebates as the new health care law is implemented. For background, in 2009, Medicaid Fee for Service managed Medicaid and 340B programs together or approximately 12% of U.S. net sales. The products most exposed to Medicaid are ABILIFY and our virology franchise. In addition, in 2009, approximately 30% of U.S. net sales were for Medicare Part D. PLAVIX is a product most exposed to Medicare. And remember, we share the impact with sanofi. 
As we look at the rest of this year, we estimate health care reform to result in a negative impact of $350 million to $400 million in net sales or about $0.12 per share on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. We are updating our 2010 GAAP EPS range to $1.84 to $1.94 and 2010 non-GAAP EPS guidance range from $210 million to $220 million, including the impact of U.S. health care reform, which was explicitly excluded from our original guidance.
The $0.12 per share negative impact from health care reform in 2010 is expected to be partially offset by the strength of our underlying business and mitigating actions we are taking. As a result, on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, we expect to offset approximately half of the $0.12 impact. In 2011, we estimate the impact to roughly double at both the top and bottom line as the donut hole coverage in pharma fee take effect. Remember that the sales impact will be relatively higher than earnings due to the accounting treatment for PLAVIX, where we record 100% of sales that share profits with sanofi. 
Looking at 2011 and beyond, it is important to note that there's a range of impact, given uncertainties on the health care reform implementation guideline and on the eventual volume of patients under utilization within some of other programs. As Lamberto has indicated, we will be looking to maximize our revenue opportunities as well as identifying mitigating actions consistent with our track record of delivering on productivity. At our Investors Meeting in March, we also provided 2013 minimum non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.95. That guidance also excluded the potential impact of U.S. health care reform. Now that we have more visibility on how health care reform could affect our business, we are reviewing and updating our strategic plan and expect to be able to update you on our outlook for 2013 in the coming months. We are confident in the strength of our underlying business and the opportunities we have both on the revenue and cost side. 
In closing, by any measure, Bristol-Myers Squibb had a great first quarter, double-digit sales growth driven by key products and franchises and good management of expenses led the solid operating margin improvement. We remain focused on managing the impact of U.S. health care reform and at the same time, we are committed to making the right investments to ensure the sustainability of our pipeline. I would now like to turn it over to your questions."

And again, I think we have a track record at Bristol-Myers Squibb for dealing with those situations. So I don't see anything particularly different from what we have been dealing with in the past in the various accounts. Let me add one point, that all of us here have an international background and I tell you, the international background is becoming very useful in the U.S., dealing with these different access situations we have here, and we are using some of the experience we accumulated outside of the U.S. in the U.S. itself."

So patients, since this is an insulin-independent mechanism and unique in that regard, we're very excited to present data on patients that seem to have a lot of insulin resistance and large doses of insulin. And the question of the study is, ""Can the addition of dapagliflozin decrease the amount insulin and insulin dependence, and what would be the improvement and what we're after of the triad of clinical benefits with regard to glycemic control, blood pressure control and weight control with dapagliflozin?"" We've now completed eight Phase III studies in dapagliflozin and the emerging profile is as we have been reporting it. We will roll out three more Phase III studies in September of 2010 in Europe, data from the add-on to the sulfonylurea study, data from an add-on to metformin versus sulfonylurea and data from an add-on to the insulin Phase III study actually, similarly as we will do in ADA, we'll do this in Europe. So we remain excited about that. You asked about infection risk. To date in the program, the rate of signs, symptoms and other reports suggested of urinary tract infections is about similar to placebo, while the rates of signs, symptoms and other reports suggested of genital infections, these are usually Canada infections, are higher than placebo and educating the patient and being proactive to deal with this, what we think of this and tolerability issue is our focus. And more of this data will be presented in the forthcoming year. With regard to ipilimumab, yes, March 4, you detected my enthusiasm about immunotherapy in oncology in general, Ipilimumab's potential in melanoma and we remain enthused and looking forward to ASCO. I did refer to the fact that there were ongoing health authority discussions then, which we always do to make sure that we are in line with what the agency expects in the content and the form of the submission. We've had these discussions now in the U.S. and Europe and expect to submit applications for regulatory approval of ipilimumab in both the U.S. and Europe over the next couple of months. These are discussions with the regulatory authorities who focused on the data we have on hand, from the 020 study and the indication would be appropriate to the data in that regard.

But we have worked out with the agencies around the world that the first-tier read-out of important markers that are correlated with survival in this disease will be acceptable for potential approval on a conditional basis, on an accelerated basis, and then full approval will be available to either agent that shows the proper results at five years. So we will have data on an ongoing basis out to five years with  these patients with regard to durability. We also will be investigating switch information for this. The two trials are different. Our primary endpoint is a major cytogenetic response, which was what GLEEVEC showed for its approval and is the accepted primary end-point recommended by health care authorities. Major molecular responses and other important emerging biomarker, the secondary endpoint for us. Our trial also differs in the fact that we did include cardiac patients and this is very important for the community. We did not exclude them as the case in the CIGNA trial and of course, the CIGNA already has black box warning.

I think the $4 script has clearly driven patients and physicians to that at the moment. And when we see our abandonment rate, i.e. patients going into the pharmacy with a prescription and then walking away not filling that prescription, it's clear that cost in today's environment is an issue. It's an issue we're addressing as fast as we can, and they can link back to what Lamberto was saying around selling the value proposition of this product in combination with metformin. Once the entire environment starts to understand that to treat diabetes, which is a chronic disease that patients will either die from or die with, the importance of early intervention with a number of compounds with different modes of action is going to be the most essential and specific way of treating patients. So we have looked very clear at the market in terms of what's required to drive an uptake. We obviously would like a steeper curve at the moment. But we do, as Lamberto said, continue to see good progress with our leading indicators, which make us feel fairly confident about our ability to grow ONGLYZA in this marketplace. Physicians have tried the product, generally continue to use it and to accelerate this adoption, we are refocusing our efforts in specialists, with a more targeted clinical campaign to endocrinologists. In addition, we made pretty good progress with access and reimbursement, and almost 85% of targeted lives are now covered, with almost 60% in Tier 1 and Tier 2. We'd have a value program in place for those patients not covered by Tier 2, and in a couple of weeks, will strengthen the offering to address the deceived access barriers. Finally, our brand awareness is almost 65% with physicians, and to further this awareness from point of care to point of compliance and adherence, we've launched a new patient education DTC print campaign and we'll be launching a TV campaign in May. The two things we watch carefully, of course, are new naive RXs and new physician trials, and in both cases, we see week-by-week increases. Our share of new naive DPP-4 prescriptions is now reaching about 6% and the number of new physicians having prescribed ONGLYZA is around 20,000. I think we continue to believe that with more than 40% of Type 2 diabetes patients not achieving treatment goal on monotherapy that we really owe an opportunity to continue focusing on this product and ensuring the patient, the physician understand the dramatic opportunity of putting them together and helping patients."

Yes, you're correct. It is more complicated to launch a new product nowadays. I don't think that the slow uptakes of the new products are related to less sales forces. I think they are related to a number of factors that had changed the marketplace and that we had started addressing. It is more complicated to launch products that perceived as less differentiated and they are the new things we need to do. They need to be increased and accelerated, but there is a number of elements that apply also to very differentiated products that we are offering talking about. Beatrice, why don't you expand on that?"

We have other regulatory and access hurdles and it gets critical [indiscernible](53:15) clinically to function it to drugs but we need to go beyond and create value for the patient, the physician and the payers. And the value needs to be perceived by those three constituents independently. So once it's already launched, clearly, you have a lot of planning to be done and there are also more [ph](59:56) to be done to communicate those comparative effectiveness data to gain the aspects at those three levels and the reimbursement. As Tony mentioned, you can gain the first two and then the patient at the end rejects the prescription that the pharmacy labels. So clearly working the value for the patient, the physician and the payers is chief. So if you look at BMS strategy and our pipeline, we feel very well-positioned to deliver a number of potential first-in class and very well-differentiated and meaningfully differentiated products. But we have already taken steps to ensure that we are very well prepared to launch all our future products. And one of the key steps was to reinforce the close collaboration with our R&D teams and our commercial organization, while spending a lot of time very early on in what we call shapes of products to include, as I would call them in the transition to Excel Data [ph](54:28) in early clinical trial design to provide the best benefit tissue for multiple spec order and outside carried along so they'd ]indiscernible] unto the products.

So we're also learning up very quickly a lot of the learnings with the organization and redefining our launch effective in the standards with all that learning we are capturing.

But there's a large pool of patients, a 100,000 patients in various stages of the disease, thanks to initial success of GLEEVEC. And therefore, second-line therapy is also an opportunity, and we see that market growing as people understand that we can improve upon the very important advance that was GLEEVEC with agents such as SPRYCEL, both in first-line and in second-line and the earlier recognition of when a patient is failing GLEEVEC. This campaign with two companies pointing out the scientific data will increase the awareness of the limitations of GLEEVEC that we have been targeting to improve.

Good morning, everyone. We have completed another quarter in which our efforts have been successfully devoted to the key elements of our strategy: Profitable and quality growth, driven by an innovative and diversified portfolio and pipeline; productivity; attention to balance sheet and capital structure; and fulfillment of the expectations of shareholders, customers and employees.
Our solid second quarter financial results, along with the progress we are making in advancing our pipeline clearly demonstrated our focus and contributes not only to positive short-term performance, but also establishes a strong foundation for future growth and future profitability. 
Our performance is good despite the headwind resulting from the implementation of the healthcare reform in the U.S. and from the economic crisis in Europe. Both had an impact on our prices and our earnings, and Charlie, later on, will speak more about these impacts in his comments.
For my part this morning, I would like to talk mostly about the significant data reported over the past several months for both in-line and pipeline products. They reinforce the confidence we have in our extremely productive R&D as a key pillar to continue to build the new biopharma company that we are becoming. The news from ASCO [American Society of Clinical Oncology], ADA [American Diabetes Association] and elsewhere was encouraging for several key molecules, including ipilimumab for metastatic melanoma, SPRYCEL for first-line CML, dapagliflozin for Type II diabetes and apixaban for strong stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.
ASCO was a very successful meeting for us this year. First, we presented positive data for ipilimumab from Study 020, in second-line metastatic melanoma. This study demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival at both one and two years. Based on this data, we have submitted our filing in both Europe and the U.S. The EU filing has been validated, while we are waiting for the acceptance of the BLA [Biologics License Application] in the U.S.
In addition, based on the results of the positive Phase II study, we also decided to initiate Phase III development in non-small cell lung cancer later this year. As a reminder, ipilimumab is already in Phase III for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma for prostate cancer.
Also at ASCO, in the head-to-head trial comparing SPRYCEL to GLEEVEC in first-line CML, the primary endpoint was met, with SPRYCEL demonstrating superior efficacy compared to GLEEVEC in complete cytogenic response at 12 months. SPRYCEL also showed significantly higher rates of major molecular response, as well as faster responses versus GLEEVEC. Our submission in Europe has been validated and in the U.S., we have been granted a priority review, with an action date of October 28. For the second-line indication that is already approved, we now have positive four-year follow-up results for both overall survival and progression free survival.
At the ADA Meeting, we presented Phase III results for dapagliflozin as an add-on to insulin in patients inadequately controlled on insulin. Results showed that the addition of dapagliflozin resulted in significant reductions in both HbA1c levels and insulin doses. This is the third Phase III study that we have presented for DAPA, with two additional Phase III studies to be presented at the EASD Meeting [European Association for the Study of Diabetes] in September. The product is shaping up as an important potential new treatment in diabetes, with benefits in glucose control, weight loss and blood pressure control. 
Finally, just last month, we announced the early termination of the Phase III AVERROES trial for apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation. The study's data monitoring committee saw clear evidence of a clinically important reduction in stroke and embolism in patients who received apixaban when compared to aspirin. 
Now that the study has been stopped early, we are focusing on three items moving forward. First, the initial scientific presentation of the results is scheduled for the ESC Meeting [European Society of Cardiology Meeting] at the end of August. Second, we are working toward the publication of the data. And third, we are assessing our regulatory options based on these positive developments.
In summary, a lot of good and exciting data for many of our products, which grow our confidence in our future. As you've seen this morning in our release, we, in addition to reaffirming our 2010 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance, we have confirmed our target for a 2013 non-GAAP EPS floor of $1.95.
We first provided this guidance in March and that time, specifically excluded any impact from U.S. healthcare reform. The effects of the U.S. healthcare reform, as well as the deteriorating EU pricing environment, will indeed negatively impact our 2013. However, the progress we have made in our pipeline and an expanded commitment to productivity gives us confidence that in 2013, we can believe in a non-GAAP EPS at or above the same floor announced in March. Our press release contains important information regarding the assumptions and exclusions underlying this guidance.
As far as 2010 is concerned, I'm pleased with the solid second quarter results, including good sales growth and a 13% increase in non-GAAP EPS. We remain in a very strong financial position, with approximately $10.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. Our priority for capital remains business development and even though we have not completed any major deals in this quarter, we continue to go after multiple opportunities that can potentially strengthen our late-stage pipeline and/or our business in 2013 and beyond.
We also remain committed to the dividend which, of course, is a quarterly decision by our Board of Directors. And as an additional sign of attention to our shareholders, during the quarter, we have initiated our $3 billion share repurchase program. 
Charlie Bancroft now will provide additional details around the quarter."

We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.54 or a 13% increase over last year, supported by sales growth in our key products and continued expense management. Included in our second quarter EPS is a negative $0.02 impact of U.S. healthcare reforms. I want to give you some brief highlights from our second quarter financial results and talk about guidance before we go to your questions.
The company reported second quarter net sales from continuing operations of $4.8 billion, an increase of 2%. U.S. healthcare reform had a 1.5% negative impact on net sales in the quarter and volume was up 1%. Foreign exchange was neutral compared to last year. The second quarter sales performance was driven in large part by strength in our virology franchise and PLAVIX. Our virology franchise demonstrated solid global sales growth, up 10% from a year ago. This sales strength demonstrates the continued strong demand for REYATAZ, the SUSTIVA franchise and BARACLUDE across both our U.S. and international markets. PLAVIX grew 7% in the U.S. in the second quarter as the retail inventory builds, which we saw in the first quarter, was worked down.
In Europe, we saw continued erosion of PLAVIX as generic clopidogrel was available in most of the countries. As we've said, we expect erosion of PLAVIX sales in Europe to begin to slow, but it will continue. The impact is primarily recorded in equity income from affiliates in our P&L. 
In the U.S., ABILIFY prescription demand increased 5%. This is 2.5x greater than the overall antipsychotic market. The increase in U.S. prescription demand was fueled by our indications for bipolar and major depressive disorder. However, ABILIFY reported sales in the U.S. were down 5% due to the negative impact of U.S. healthcare reform and the reduction in our share of net sales under the revised contractual terms with Otsuka. Excluding these items, ABILIFY sales would've been up 11% in the U.S.
Lastly, divestitures and rationalization of our non-strategic mature brands portfolio had a negative impact year-over-year of approximately $45 million. So U.S. healthcare reform, the ABILIFY contract extension and mature brands divestitures had a combined negative 4% impact on reported total company sales in the quarter.
Now let me give you some highlights from the rest of the P&L. Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased 50 basis points to 73.8% compared to the second quarter of 2009. Improvements in product mix were offset by changes in the way we account for the agreement with Otsuka. Advertising and promotion expenses were down 12% to $263 million for the quarter. The decrease is due to less spending on the promotion of certain products at the end of their life-cycle and to Otsuka's reimbursement of certain ABILIFY, SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA expenses. This was partially offset by increased spending for the ONGLYZA launch and other pipeline products.
Equity income from affiliates declined 43%, driven by continued erosion of PLAVIX sales in Europe from generic clopidogrel, as I mentioned earlier. The expected overall non-GAAP tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 23.8% in the second quarter. Our guidance remains between 23% and 24% for the year, assuming the R&D tax credit. As a reminder, we would only account for the tax credit in the quarter it happened. In regard to our new $3 billion share buyback program, we repurchased 7.3 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $173 million.
Let me turn to guidance. As Lamberto mentioned, the economic crisis in Europe has led to incremental pricing pressure. We typically realized a 2% to 2.5% price decline across our European businesses, but based on various governmental measures implemented, we will see a larger impact in 2010. Despite this pressure, we are confirming our 2010 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance, and there are no changes to our line item guidance. There is also no changes to our estimates of the impact of U.S. healthcare reform. However, the European pricing measures, along with the broader U.S. healthcare reform changes, will create a headwind for 2011 beyond what we typically budget as we balance productivity and investments to maximize the value of our portfolio.
In closing, we had a solid second quarter: Double-digit EPS growth, supported by key products and franchises, good management of expenses, a strong cash position and confirmation of our non-GAAP 2010 guidance and 2013 floor guidance. 
I would now like to turn it over to your questions."

You asked about timing for apixaban, studies of ipilimumab, 024, our first-line study, I believe, was asked and dapagliflozin filing in the U.S. Well, we're most excited about the AVERROES trial, which is on patients that can't tolerate or cannot take Coumadin and that's a superiority trial that will be presented in Stockholm, August 31, at a late-breaking session. And that's the first of our large A-fib studies. It's over 5,500 patients. It's in a special population. We think it's an area of unmet medical need. This was stopped early by an outside group, and so we're gathering all the final data and look forward to that presentation. The AVERROES trial is a more all cumbered trial for A-fib. It is a broad spectrum of risk factors. That is event-driven and by our best estimate, we should that information in the first half of '11. The AVERROES trials are very unique part of our program, and I feel it may give information and confirmation about our overall profile and balancing benefit risk, targeting unmet medical need and having the right dose. Ipilimumab, of course, the first survival study in pretreated metastatic melanoma patients was presented not only in the New England Journal of Medicine, but at ASCO. And with that data, we have filed in Europe and that's been accepted. We are announcing today, we have submitted, at the end of June, an application for the U.S, and we're working with the FDA to finalize that. And it's up to them to file that data. The first-line study for ipilimumab is also event-driven, and there's no change in the comments that I've made before. There has been slowing of the events which is good news, we believe, for patients. Perhaps by the end of the year or early next year, we will see that data. Dapagliflozin is progressing well in terms of its emerging profile, of the triad of benefits, with novel mechanism. We'll have two important studies presented in Europe. We'll have more studies that we're reading out now that will be presented next year, and we are on track as an alliance to file in Europe. We have not performed the analysis that's required in the U.S. to determine the filing yet, but this is an ongoing process for this year. We'll have more to say later."

You will see, and I cannot preempt the scientists and the data, you will see August 31 in Stockholm, the design of the trial, the exact number percent of patients that were refractory or how they were determined to be unsuitable for Coumadin, which is for a variety of reasons. They may have been on Coumadin, couldn't be monitored properly, couldn't be titrated properly, had drug-drug interactions or high risk. Or patients that the physician, for a variety of those reasons, felt that it was unwise and they were unwilling to put the patient on Coumadin.

Let me comment on the PLAVIX question you had in Europe, and then Beatrice can talk about emerging markets. Except for a few countries in Europe, most of the PLAVIX business in Europe is co-promoted with sanofi.

Can we -- without asking what the plan is necessarily, can you just talk about what those potential safety issues would be? Is that confine just to infections? Could there be other elements as well like cardiovascular safety? And then last question is, just looking at pressure and as it grows in established markets like the U.S., we have healthcare reform, like Europe, we have price cuts. A fair number of companies will argue for these reasons that you want to be diversified and you want to push them to new geographies like emerging markets. But Bristol is taking an opposite approach there, which is kind of paired back a little bit of presence in emerging markets and certainly concentrated just on the branded Rx business. Is there any hesitation internally that you've seen in the pharma landscape of all that you're still pursuing the right strategy?"

As part of the emerging markets in concern, I think that our choice of being concentrating on high-tech products and not competing with local companies and generic companies in low priced, low margin, big volumes products, I think for us -- I don't want to discuss the strategy of other companies [indiscernible] (1:03:15), so I'm convinced that our strategy hold. As far as PLAVIX is concerned, my colleagues will speak about DAPA. We will see what comes out of the ASCO on Brilinta in a few days. I've still convinced -- what I've seen is good data there. I mean, what they announce is good data. But PLAVIX is a very consolidated phrase and seen in a lot of indications and what we have in front of us between now and the end of exclusivity of PLAVIX is a huge consolidated product and Brilinta good luck to them, but it's for one of the indication.

And as a new class, when we get the large number of patient safety database integrated, we will go over the usual analysis for safety signals. I've been asked most commonly about lower urinary tract infections. In some trials, we see no difference from the control and in some cases, we see some elevation. We'll know when we combine the database where we stand, the concern with these which are often seen in diabetes patients unfortunately. And then many diabetic trials is whether there's an upper kidney urogenital infection like pyelonephritis. In the last study, I was asked about two cases. But I can tell you that I am not concerned about any imbalance across the program, and we do monitor this very carefully and we will look at the integrated safety. The tolerability issue of having excess glucose is something we're working with patients to deal with, but I think it's more tolerability than safety and that is the yeast infections, they can develop in diabetic patients are at increasing rates, with this particular agent but we're working out ways to address that tolerability issue and hope the benefits far outweigh them."

We have completed another quarter in which we continued to successfully deliver against the execution of our strategy. Let me walk you through the highlights.
Our financial performance in the quarter was solid. Double-digit growth in earnings per share demonstrate our ability to operate in a very challenging environment as we continue to see the impact of U.S. healthcare reform and are beginning to see an impact from incremental pricing pressures in Europe. Despite these challenges, operationally, we are completely focused on growing our portfolio of innovative products and preparing for the potential launch of new products during the fourth quarter and into 2011, all while continuing to deliver on productivity initiatives across the entire company.
As you have seen in our release, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2010 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS. Strategic and disciplined capital allocation remains a key part of our BioPharma strategy. We finished the quarter in a very strong financial position, with approximately $10.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. Business development remains a top priority for capital allocation, and we also remain committed to the dividends, and are actively engaged in the share repurchase program begun in the second quarter.
In October, we completed the acquisition of ZymoGenetics, the transaction built on our long-term commitment to virology by giving up full ownership of PEG-Interferon lambda currently in development for Hepatitis C. We are looking forward to present 12-week Phase IIb data on lambda and our small molecule antivirals in development for Hepatitis C, at AASLD [American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases] between October 29 and November 2.
In addition, we are excited by the seven early clinical and preclinical programs from ZymoGenetics that expands our strong biologic capability in oncology and immunoscience and by the FDA-approved specialty surgical biologic, RECOTHROM. 
On a less positive note, we received a warning letter from the FDA about certain processes and practices to be improved or remediated at our manufacturing facility in Manati, Puerto Rico. We have provided a response to the FDA warning letter, including details of the actions that we are taking, and we expect that Manati facility will be inspection-rated by the end of the year. Manufacturing continues uninterrupted at Manati, and I want to assure you that resolving the issues in Manati is one of our top priorities.
This was another good, very good quarter for clinical data. We presented key data from our cardiovascular and diabetic franchises at important medical meetings. At the European Society of Cardiology meeting in August, we presented the preliminary results of the Phase III AVERROES trial for apixaban, or ELIQUIS, as we will market it, in patients with atrial fibrillation, who are unsuitable for treatment with warfarin. The preliminary results demonstrated that apixaban significantly reduced the relative risk of a composite of stroke or systemic embolism by 54% compared with aspirin, without a significant increase in major bleeding. We believe this is an area of significant unmet medical need and is up to 40% to 50% of patients are identified as unsuitable for treatment with warfarin.
Today, now I'm glad to inform you that based on the strength of these data, we, along with our partner Pfizer, have already initiated a rolling submission with the FDA. We expect the submission to be complete in the early part of 2011. 
For dapagliflozin, we have now presented results from five of the total 11 Phase III studies for this novel, first-in-class diabetes compound. We are excited by its potential emerging profile that balances a triad of benefits: good HbA1c control, improvements in blood pressure and increased weight loss, with what appears to be a manageable safety and tolerability profile.
We and our partner AstraZeneca are on track to submit, as previously announced, our application for the marketing authorization of dapagliflozin in Europe by the end of 2010, early 2011. Today, now I have also good news for dapagliflozin in the U.S. I am pleased to announce that we have completed the analysis of cardiovascular data mandated by the new FDA guidelines. And based on that analysis, we plan to submit also in the U.S. at the end of 2010, early 2011.
We also submitted a response to the FDA, a complete response letter regarding the BLA [Biologics License Application] for neurologics. We have been advised that we must resolve the issue at Manati prior to gaining approval of the pending BLA. And based on our assumptions, when Manati will be inspection-rated by the end of the year, we hope to hear the decision on the BLA in the second quarter of 2011. 
On the regulatory front, last week, we achieved a positive opinion from the CHMP [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use] in Europe for SPRYCEL first line, and we look forward to progressing there. We are anticipating there are other key regulatory decisions in the coming months. In the U.S., we expect to hear the FDA's decision for both SPRYCEL first line and for the fixed-dose combination of ONGLYZA and metformin by the end of this month, the month of October. Additionally, we feel very positive about the prospects for ipilimumab, and we'll continue to work with the FDA and other regulatory agencies on its approval.
Now let me turn it over to Charlie."

We did have another quarter of solid growth. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.59 or 26% increase over last year, supported by sales growth in most of our key products and continued expense management. Includ",913,"Thank you, Lamberto, and good morning, everyone. We did have another quarter of solid growth. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.59 or 26% increase over last year, supported by sales growth in most of our key products and continued expense management. Included in our third quarter EPS is a negative $0.02 impact of U.S. healthcare reform. I want to give you some brief highlights from our third quarter financial results and talk about guidance before we go to your questions.
The company reported third quarter net sales from continuing operations of $4.8 billion, flat compared to last year, or up 1% net of foreign exchange. U.S. healthcare reform had a 1.6% negative impact on net sales in the quarter and incremental EU measures had a negative impact of just under 1%. Volume was up 1%. 
The third quarter sales performance was driven in large part by strength in our Virology Franchise, PLAVIX, ORENCIA and SPRYCEL. Growth in these brands was primary offset by declines in our mature brands. Our Virology Franchise had solid global sales growth, up 8% from a year ago. This sales strength demonstrates the continued strong demand for REYATAZ  and SUSTIVA franchise, and BARACLUDE across both our U.S. and international markets. U.S. PLAVIX sales grew 9% in the quarter. In Europe, we saw a continued erosion of PLAVIX as generic clopidogrel was available in most of the countries. As we said, we expect erosion of PLAVIX sales in Europe to begin to slow, but it will continue. The impact is primarily recorded in equity income from affiliates in our P&L.
In the U.S., ABILIFY prescription demand increased to 3%. And while lower growth than Q2, ABILIFY continues to grow faster than the market. However, ABILIFY reported sales in the U.S. were down 11% due to the negative impact of U.S. healthcare reform and reduction in our share of net sales under the revised contractual terms sales with Otsuka. Lastly, our mature brands declined 19% or $169 million compared to last year. Divestitures in and rationalization of our non-strategic mature brands portfolio had a negative impact year-over-year of approximately $65 million.
In aggregate, U.S. healthcare reform, EU pricing measures, the ABILIFY contract extension and mature brands divestitures had a combined negative 4% impact on our reported total company sales in the quarter. 
The impact from U.S. healthcare reform has been slightly less than our original estimate, and we now expect a $0.10 impact for 2010. Our estimated impact for 2011 EPS has not changed, given the annualization of managed Medicaid, expected 340B hospital expansion and the new impacts from the Part D Donut Hole coverage and the pharma fee.
Now let me give you some highlights from the rest of our P&L. I will focus my comments on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations to our GAAP results are available in our press release and our website. 
Gross margin increased 80 basis points to 73.9% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Improvements  in product mix, productivity and impact from foreign exchange were only partially offset by the impact from the changes in the contractual agreement with Otsuka. 
Advertising and promotion expenses were down 10% to $231 million for the quarter. The decrease is due to less spending on the promotion of those products at the end of their life cycle and to Otsuka's reimbursement of certain ABILIFY, SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA expenses. This was partially offset by increased prelaunch spending on new products and indications. 
Equity income from affiliates declined 50%, driven by continued erosion of PLAVIX sales in Europe, as I mentioned earlier. The effective overall non-GAAP tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 20% in the third quarter. The lower tax rate was primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain tax audits. You should note that this reserve release was assumed when we gave our full year guidance. Our guidance remains between 23% and 24% for the year, assuming passage of the R&D tax credit. As a reminder, we only account for the tax credit in the quarter in which it happened.
Let me turn to guidance. As Lamberto mentioned, we are operating in challenging times. Macroeconomic issues, U.S. healthcare reform and incremental pricing pressure in Europe are all having an impact on our business. As demonstrated by our third quarter results, we have been very efficient in managing our expenses to help offset some of this impact. However, moving forward, these challenges will create a headwind. We believe we have a very attractive portfolio and while we remain keenly focused on productivity, we are also committed to making the appropriate investments required to maximize the long-term value of our assets. 
We are confirming our previous 2010 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance with a few adjustments to our non-GAAP line item guidance. We expect Q4 sales growth to be consistent with Q3, resulting in low to mid-single-digit growth for the year. Advertising and promotion should decrease in the low double-digits as compared to our original guidance of a high single-digit decrease. R&D will increase in the mid-single-digit range. As I said, we expect our tax rate to remain between 23% to 24%, assuming the R&D tax credit is passed in Q4. 
In closing, we have a solid third quarter, double-digit EPS growth supported by key brands, good management of expenses, a strong cash position, confirmation of our 2010 EPS guidance and the continued positive of our innovative pipeline. 
I would now like to turn it over to your questions."

Let me just correct my statement that if the first-line study is event-driven, we have been continually projecting when we would have it. And I think it would be probably towards the end of the first quarter of '11. But the application in front of the agencies have to do with the benefit/risk around the second-line patients, and I think the data is robust with a survival benefit. And that is the data that we are engaged in discussing with the FDA and those regulatory authorities abroad. Let me just say that with regard to anticoagulants, in general, I think both Beatrice and I, representing the company, agree that this is a huge new opportunity. There will be different profiles of drugs out there. Our belief medically and commercially from the very beginning was that doctors and patients wanted a safer Coumadin, so to speak. The big unmet medical need is the less bleeding so that we can administer this drug to patients and achieve some benefit. We are struck by the large percentage of patients that go untreated, even though efficacy of Coumadin is known, and often offered aspirin, a less efficacious drug, because of the fear of the benefit/risk in the narrow therapeutic window of Coumadin. And hence, AVERROES was performed in patients that could not tolerate or could not take Coumadin. Based on that data that we presented to European Society of Congress, we think that, that stands on its own. We are in a fast-track procedure with a rolling submission and hope to complete that by the beginning of next year, sometime in '11 of the first quarter. Meanwhile, we await the profiles. We still see major opportunity. I'll let Beatrice comment further. And we are anxiously awaiting the ROCKET data --"

Overall market research and also discussion with patient, physician, from generalist to our European leaders, clearly emphasize the need for a product at least as efficacious as warfarin, but is easier to use in addition to safer to use. So what we see there is a strong role for more usage, and you see a number of patients that are not treated to date, not just the warfarin patients that can be switched, it's also all the patients that are not treated at all or were treated by aspirin previously. You see large discontinuation in those trials for aspirin, for warfarin. So we know very likely, we'll be coming served, but you may have surprise, you never know after November. Obviously, being served doesn't mean that untapped potentials, that is not room for you. We believe we have a large opportunity there. And our profile, as you probably heard, in ESC [European Society of Cardiology] was very well-received and is very encouraging in terms of having fully demonstrated versus aspirin our benefit/risk with a very good bleeding profile. So the BID question, which was a specific question, product size BID, we don't know what their profile is going to be from efficacy, safety. So it's also a population with multiple probabilities and they are taking drugs. They are taking several of those drugs and some of them are also BID. So we don't believe BID would be a -- it would really be a risk/benefit in the various population will be what drive our potential."

We're pretty satisfied with how apixaban is targeting this particular area. So I don't have any update on the modified release. With regard to the gamma secretase program, I thought I had indicated that the Phase III might start early next year. Maybe at the beginning of the year, I got very optimistic. I would not signal that as a major concern other than we want to be very, very careful in this field. We are pioneers in this field. There is risk in this field with the new mechanism, but the unmet need is unbelievable and our company has to be in this area in some of our portfolio. We are still reviewing our Phase II data. And we are going to take another look at our Phase II data because one of the studies continues are early in the year. I will say that the compound that has gone before is non-selective, and I think a lot of the concerns they had was because of a lack of a therapeutic window. We had a non-selective compound maybe 10 years ago in the clinic. We spent a long time developing a more selective compound. We have a selective compound and hence, a possibility of a therapeutic window. That's not to say I know whether or not the beta amyloid hypothesis is going to work, but I do believe we'll have an ability to test it in Phase III and are making that decision next year."

Let me talk first a bit about the data seen from organizations like WK and IMS are showing that the market in the U.S. from a volume perspective has declined to pretty much a flat 1% during the entire 2010. This compares with a growth in 2009. It went from about 1% to about 3%, so clearly, a flat market at the moment. When you decompose that, you see that the branded products are probably declining at about 13% and the generics are growing at about 5% or so. So net-net, an overall decline in the marketplace. The healthcare reform itself is not playing that much of a role at the moment. The economic situation, obviously, yes. One, I think a lot of patients have come out of COBRA, extended benefits are now having to struggle to find access to healthcare. Number two, we are seeing an increase in the level of abandonment at the pharmacy level, i.e. patients who take prescription to the pharmacy and then decide not to fill it. When you decompose that data, you see there's quite a dramatic difference between new RXs versus continued RXs. New RXs in some categories, such as ABILIFY, have gone high as 22%, 23%. So patients are really having a problem to manage that. Obviously, we've stepped in as quickly as we can to assist patients from a co-pay perspective to drive that forward. I think that the Medicaid Part D healthcare reform for next year will obviously help us, as more patients will be able to afford the drugs as they move through the donut hole. Beatrice?"

One is basically through government measures, pricing pressure and also encouragement of generic prescription. So you see a shift of volume most generally. You see also some effect of the crisis in some of the market, like Spain, obviously, where you have high unemployment. So you see some volume pressure. For BMS per se, what to see is a shift of some large GP brand, like PLAVIX, where we lost the patent, to our specialty care innovative compound, where we have less volume but a mix of price volumes very differently. So in that overall situation, I think, look at the open situation, we feel that with the launch of specialty care as far as we have, we'll be able to protect with all the appropriate price volume relation that we have in excess, our growth potential on the specialty brand. So we feel comfortable that, that will help us. But you'll certainly see it declining to a little bit to the environment and also to our own portfolio evolution."

On apixaban, when we looked at the market of patients that are not taking warfarin, some of them are patients that were treated by the specialist and then discontinuing because of side effects or because it's not fully monitored and they had to make trade-offs. So we feel that market segment is going to be accessible relatively quickly because it goes to the normal prescription of the specialist. The area where the patient are not treated at all and we certainly need to have a business model that links very closely the specialist and the general practitioner, and we are working on those aspects with all our teams around the world to understand how to build a model that captures those population quickly. That's why we are very encouraged by our overall data because actually, it clearly shows  that they were thinking of fast appearing the product that is significantly superior in efficacy and safer in term of the usage. So we believe with that data, we will have a unique opportunity to accelerate the usage of A-fib. A-fib is very concerning the number of stroke and very severe and debilitating strokes. So the whole message for all the companies around the disease itself is going to help with that segment. So we feel confident that it may appear that it may be still worth to start it, that we have form the ways to generate prescription quickly."

The product will and is arching independently from insulin, providing a very different pathway to completing the diabetes patient treatment with additional benefit that we are concerning more and more in our clinical trials on the possible weight loss as well as possible blood pressure benefit. So when we look at the market, we believe that with the unmet need and the growth and the noise in the market and the education on diabetes and the large number of diabetic program across government around the world and the heightened awareness of what needs to be done, there will be a large potential for a category of that providing that available benefit. So when we compare DPP-4 and dapagliflozin sales, we believe this will be a full class on its own and we'll take a significant share, and there should not be too direct competition when you start segmenting the patient population."

We have completed another quarter in which we continued to successfully deliver against the execution of our strategy. Let me walk you through the highlights.
Our financial performance in the quarter was solid. Double-digit growth in earnings per share demonstrate our ability to operate in a very challenging environment as we continue to see the impact of U.S. healthcare reform and are beginning to see an impact from incremental pricing pressures in Europe. Despite these challenges, operationally, we are completely focused on growing our portfolio of innovative products and preparing for the potential launch of new products during the fourth quarter and into 2011, all while continuing to deliver on productivity initiatives across the entire company.
As you have seen in our release, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2010 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS. Strategic and disciplined capital allocation remains a key part of our BioPharma strategy. We finished the quarter in a very strong financial position, with approximately $10.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. Business development remains a top priority for capital allocation, and we also remain committed to the dividends, and are actively engaged in the share repurchase program begun in the second quarter.
In October, we completed the acquisition of ZymoGenetics, the transaction built on our long-term commitment to virology by giving up full ownership of PEG-Interferon lambda currently in development for Hepatitis C. We are looking forward to present 12-week Phase IIb data on lambda and our small molecule antivirals in development for Hepatitis C, at AASLD [American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases] between October 29 and November 2.
In addition, we are excited by the seven early clinical and preclinical programs from ZymoGenetics that expands our strong biologic capability in oncology and immunoscience and by the FDA-approved specialty surgical biologic, RECOTHROM. 
On a less positive note, we received a warning letter from the FDA about certain processes and practices to be improved or remediated at our manufacturing facility in Manati, Puerto Rico. We have provided a response to the FDA warning letter, including details of the actions that we are taking, and we expect that Manati facility will be inspection-rated by the end of the year. Manufacturing continues uninterrupted at Manati, and I want to assure you that resolving the issues in Manati is one of our top priorities.
This was another good, very good quarter for clinical data. We presented key data from our cardiovascular and diabetic franchises at important medical meetings. At the European Society of Cardiology meeting in August, we presented the preliminary results of the Phase III AVERROES trial for apixaban, or ELIQUIS, as we will market it, in patients with atrial fibrillation, who are unsuitable for treatment with warfarin. The preliminary results demonstrated that apixaban significantly reduced the relative risk of a composite of stroke or systemic embolism by 54% compared with aspirin, without a significant increase in major bleeding. We believe this is an area of significant unmet medical need and is up to 40% to 50% of patients are identified as unsuitable for treatment with warfarin.
Today, now I'm glad to inform you that based on the strength of these data, we, along with our partner Pfizer, have already initiated a rolling submission with the FDA. We expect the submission to be complete in the early part of 2011. 
For dapagliflozin, we have now presented results from five of the total 11 Phase III studies for this novel, first-in-class diabetes compound. We are excited by its potential emerging profile that balances a triad of benefits: good HbA1c control, improvements in blood pressure and increased weight loss, with what appears to be a manageable safety and tolerability profile.
We and our partner AstraZeneca are on track to submit, as previously announced, our application for the marketing authorization of dapagliflozin in Europe by the end of 2010, early 2011. Today, now I have also good news for dapagliflozin in the U.S. I am pleased to announce that we have completed the analysis of cardiovascular data mandated by the new FDA guidelines. And based on that analysis, we plan to submit also in the U.S. at the end of 2010, early 2011.
We also submitted a response to the FDA, a complete response letter regarding the BLA [Biologics License Application] for neurologics. We have been advised that we must resolve the issue at Manati prior to gaining approval of the pending BLA. And based on our assumptions, when Manati will be inspection-rated by the end of the year, we hope to hear the decision on the BLA in the second quarter of 2011. 
On the regulatory front, last week, we achieved a positive opinion from the CHMP [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use] in Europe for SPRYCEL first line, and we look forward to progressing there. We are anticipating there are other key regulatory decisions in the coming months. In the U.S., we expect to hear the FDA's decision for both SPRYCEL first line and for the fixed-dose combination of ONGLYZA and metformin by the end of this month, the month of October. Additionally, we feel very positive about the prospects for ipilimumab, and we'll continue to work with the FDA and other regulatory agencies on its approval.
Now let me turn it over to Charlie.

We did have another quarter of solid growth. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.59 or 26% increase over last year, supported by sales growth in most of our key products and continued expense management. Includ",913,"Thank you, Lamberto, and good morning, everyone. We did have another quarter of solid growth. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.59 or 26% increase over last year, supported by sales growth in most of our key products and continued expense management. Included in our third quarter EPS is a negative $0.02 impact of U.S. healthcare reform. I want to give you some brief highlights from our third quarter financial results and talk about guidance before we go to your questions.
The company reported third quarter net sales from continuing operations of $4.8 billion, flat compared to last year, or up 1% net of foreign exchange. U.S. healthcare reform had a 1.6% negative impact on net sales in the quarter and incremental EU measures had a negative impact of just under 1%. Volume was up 1%. 
The third quarter sales performance was driven in large part by strength in our Virology Franchise, PLAVIX, ORENCIA and SPRYCEL. Growth in these brands was primary offset by declines in our mature brands. Our Virology Franchise had solid global sales growth, up 8% from a year ago. This sales strength demonstrates the continued strong demand for REYATAZ  and SUSTIVA franchise, and BARACLUDE across both our U.S. and international markets. U.S. PLAVIX sales grew 9% in the quarter. In Europe, we saw a continued erosion of PLAVIX as generic clopidogrel was available in most of the countries. As we said, we expect erosion of PLAVIX sales in Europe to begin to slow, but it will continue. The impact is primarily recorded in equity income from affiliates in our P&L.
In the U.S., ABILIFY prescription demand increased to 3%. And while lower growth than Q2, ABILIFY continues to grow faster than the market. However, ABILIFY reported sales in the U.S. were down 11% due to the negative impact of U.S. healthcare reform and reduction in our share of net sales under the revised contractual terms sales with Otsuka. Lastly, our mature brands declined 19% or $169 million compared to last year. Divestitures in and rationalization of our non-strategic mature brands portfolio had a negative impact year-over-year of approximately $65 million.
In aggregate, U.S. healthcare reform, EU pricing measures, the ABILIFY contract extension and mature brands divestitures had a combined negative 4% impact on our reported total company sales in the quarter. 
The impact from U.S. healthcare reform has been slightly less than our original estimate, and we now expect a $0.10 impact for 2010. Our estimated impact for 2011 EPS has not changed, given the annualization of managed Medicaid, expected 340B hospital expansion and the new impacts from the Part D Donut Hole coverage and the pharma fee.
Now let me give you some highlights from the rest of our P&L. I will focus my comments on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations to our GAAP results are available in our press release and our website. 
Gross margin increased 80 basis points to 73.9% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Improvements  in product mix, productivity and impact from foreign exchange were only partially offset by the impact from the changes in the contractual agreement with Otsuka. 
Advertising and promotion expenses were down 10% to $231 million for the quarter. The decrease is due to less spending on the promotion of those products at the end of their life cycle and to Otsuka's reimbursement of certain ABILIFY, SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA expenses. This was partially offset by increased prelaunch spending on new products and indications. 
Equity income from affiliates declined 50%, driven by continued erosion of PLAVIX sales in Europe, as I mentioned earlier. The effective overall non-GAAP tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 20% in the third quarter. The lower tax rate was primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain tax audits. You should note that this reserve release was assumed when we gave our full year guidance. Our guidance remains between 23% and 24% for the year, assuming passage of the R&D tax credit. As a reminder, we only account for the tax credit in the quarter in which it happened.
Let me turn to guidance. As Lamberto mentioned, we are operating in challenging times. Macroeconomic issues, U.S. healthcare reform and incremental pricing pressure in Europe are all having an impact on our business. As demonstrated by our third quarter results, we have been very efficient in managing our expenses to help offset some of this impact. However, moving forward, these challenges will create a headwind. We believe we have a very attractive portfolio and while we remain keenly focused on productivity, we are also committed to making the appropriate investments required to maximize the long-term value of our assets. 
We are confirming our previous 2010 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance with a few adjustments to our non-GAAP line item guidance. We expect Q4 sales growth to be consistent with Q3, resulting in low to mid-single-digit growth for the year. Advertising and promotion should decrease in the low double-digits as compared to our original guidance of a high single-digit decrease. R&D will increase in the mid-single-digit range. As I said, we expect our tax rate to remain between 23% to 24%, assuming the R&D tax credit is passed in Q4. 
In closing, we have a solid third quarter, double-digit EPS growth supported by key brands, good management of expenses, a strong cash position, confirmation of our 2010 EPS guidance and the continued positive of our innovative pipeline. 
I would now like to turn it over to your questions.

Let me just correct my statement that if the first-line study is event-driven, we have been continually projecting when we would have it. And I think it would be probably towards the end of the first quarter of '11. But the application in front of the agencies have to do with the benefit/risk around the second-line patients, and I think the data is robust with a survival benefit. And that is the data that we are engaged in discussing with the FDA and those regulatory authorities abroad. Let me just say that with regard to anticoagulants, in general, I think both Beatrice and I, representing the company, agree that this is a huge new opportunity. There will be different profiles of drugs out there. Our belief medically and commercially from the very beginning was that doctors and patients wanted a safer Coumadin, so to speak. The big unmet medical need is the less bleeding so that we can administer this drug to patients and achieve some benefit. We are struck by the large percentage of patients that go untreated, even though efficacy of Coumadin is known, and often offered aspirin, a less efficacious drug, because of the fear of the benefit/risk in the narrow therapeutic window of Coumadin. And hence, AVERROES was performed in patients that could not tolerate or could not take Coumadin. Based on that data that we presented to European Society of Congress, we think that, that stands on its own. We are in a fast-track procedure with a rolling submission and hope to complete that by the beginning of next year, sometime in '11 of the first quarter. Meanwhile, we await the profiles. We still see major opportunity. I'll let Beatrice comment further. And we are anxiously awaiting the ROCKET data --

Overall market research and also discussion with patient, physician, from generalist to our European leaders, clearly emphasize the need for a product at least as efficacious as warfarin, but is easier to use in addition to safer to use. So what we see there is a strong role for more usage, and you see a number of patients that are not treated to date, not just the warfarin patients that can be switched, it's also all the patients that are not treated at all or were treated by aspirin previously. You see large discontinuation in those trials for aspirin, for warfarin. So we know very likely, we'll be coming served, but you may have surprise, you never know after November. Obviously, being served doesn't mean that untapped potentials, that is not room for you. We believe we have a large opportunity there. And our profile, as you probably heard, in ESC [European Society of Cardiology] was very well-received and is very encouraging in terms of having fully demonstrated versus aspirin our benefit/risk with a very good bleeding profile. So the BID question, which was a specific question, product size BID, we don't know what their profile is going to be from efficacy, safety. So it's also a population with multiple probabilities and they are taking drugs. They are taking several of those drugs and some of them are also BID. So we don't believe BID would be a -- it would really be a risk/benefit in the various population will be what drive our potential.

We will have to bear the impact of ZymoGenetics and the revised terms of Otsuka. But we will continue to keep 2013 well in mind, but at the same time, use our skills and experience and productivity to invest where we need to invest, that means the products of the future, and take money away from a more mature brand and continuing productivity.

Let me talk first a bit about the data seen from organizations like WK and IMS are showing that the market in the U.S. from a volume perspective has declined to pretty much a flat 1% during the entire 2010. This compares with a growth in 2009. It went from about 1% to about 3%, so clearly, a flat market at the moment. When you decompose that, you see that the branded products are probably declining at about 13% and the generics are growing at about 5% or so. So net-net, an overall decline in the marketplace. The healthcare reform itself is not playing that much of a role at the moment. The economic situation, obviously, yes. One, I think a lot of patients have come out of COBRA, extended benefits are now having to struggle to find access to healthcare. Number two, we are seeing an increase in the level of abandonment at the pharmacy level, i.e. patients who take prescription to the pharmacy and then decide not to fill it. When you decompose that data, you see there's quite a dramatic difference between new RXs versus continued RXs. New RXs in some categories, such as ABILIFY, have gone high as 22%, 23%. So patients are really having a problem to manage that. Obviously, we've stepped in as quickly as we can to assist patients from a co-pay perspective to drive that forward. I think that the Medicaid Part D healthcare reform for next year will obviously help us, as more patients will be able to afford the drugs as they move through the donut hole. Beatrice?

One is basically through government measures, pricing pressure and also encouragement of generic prescription. So you see a shift of volume most generally. You see also some effect of the crisis in some of the market, like Spain, obviously, where you have high unemployment. So you see some volume pressure. For BMS per se, what to see is a shift of some large GP brand, like PLAVIX, where we lost the patent, to our specialty care innovative compound, where we have less volume but a mix of price volumes very differently. So in that overall situation, I think, look at the open situation, we feel that with the launch of specialty care as far as we have, we'll be able to protect with all the appropriate price volume relation that we have in excess, our growth potential on the specialty brand. So we feel comfortable that, that will help us. But you'll certainly see it declining to a little bit to the environment and also to our own portfolio evolution.

Should we anticipate a change in message around the franchise as we anticipate your introduction of your metformin combo, given the more modest growth in the entire DPP-4 market? Would you consider switching your message to focus more on market share as compared to market growth with the combination approval?

On apixaban, when we looked at the market of patients that are not taking warfarin, some of them are patients that were treated by the specialist and then discontinuing because of side effects or because it's not fully monitored and they had to make trade-offs. So we feel that market segment is going to be accessible relatively quickly because it goes to the normal prescription of the specialist. The area where the patient are not treated at all and we certainly need to have a business model that links very closely the specialist and the general practitioner, and we are working on those aspects with all our teams around the world to understand how to build a model that captures those population quickly. That's why we are very encouraged by our overall data because actually, it clearly shows  that they were thinking of fast appearing the product that is significantly superior in efficacy and safer in term of the usage. So we believe with that data, we will have a unique opportunity to accelerate the usage of A-fib. A-fib is very concerning the number of stroke and very severe and debilitating strokes. So the whole message for all the companies around the disease itself is going to help with that segment. So we feel confident that it may appear that it may be still worth to start it, that we have form the ways to generate prescription quickly.

So if we now go to your question on the dapagliflozin and its potential, especially as it relates to DPP-4. The product profile is unique and we have a very differentiated model faction. The product will and is arching independently from insulin, providing a very different pathway to completing the diabetes patient treatment with additional benefit that we are concerning more and more in our clinical trials on the possible weight loss as well as possible blood pressure benefit. So when we look at the market, we believe that with the unmet need and the growth and the noise in the market and the education on diabetes and the large number of diabetic program across government around the world and the heightened awareness of what needs to be done, there will be a large potential for a category of that providing that available benefit. So when we compare DPP-4 and dapagliflozin sales, we believe this will be a full class on its own and we'll take a significant share, and there should not be too direct competition when you start segmenting the patient population.

We have completed another quarter in which we continued to successfully deliver against the execution of our strategy. Let me walk you through the highlights.
Our financial performance in the quarter was solid. Double-digit growth in earnings per share demonstrates our ability to operate in a very challenging environment as we continue to see the impact of U.S. healthcare reform and are beginning to see an impact from incremental pricing pressures in Europe. Despite these challenges, operationally, we are completely focused on growing our portfolio of innovative products and preparing for the potential launch of new products during the fourth quarter and into 2011, all while continuing to deliver on productivity initiatives across the entire company.
As you have seen in our release, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2010 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS. Strategic and disciplined capital allocation remains a key part of our BioPharma strategy. We finished the quarter in a very strong financial position, with approximately $10.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. Business development remains a top priority for capital allocation, and we also remain committed to the dividends, and are actively engaged in the share repurchase program begun in the second quarter.
In October, we completed the acquisition of ZymoGenetics. The transaction built on our long-term commitment to virology by giving up full ownership of PEG-Interferon lambda currently in development for Hepatitis C. We are looking forward to present 12-week Phase IIb data on lambda and our small molecule antivirals in development for Hepatitis C, at AASLD [American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases] between October 29 and November 2.
In addition, we are excited by the seven early clinical and preclinical programs from ZymoGenetics that expand our strong biologic capability in oncology and immunoscience and by the FDA-approved specialty surgical biologic, RECOTHROM. 
On a less positive note, we received a warning letter from the FDA about certain processes and practices to be improved or remediated at our manufacturing facility in Manati, Puerto Rico. We have provided a response to the FDA warning letter, including details of the actions that we are taking, and we expect that Manati facility will be inspection-rated by the end of the year. Manufacturing continues uninterrupted at Manati, and I want to assure you that resolving the issues in Manati is one of our top priorities.
This was another good, very good quarter for clinical data. We presented key data from our cardiovascular and diabetes franchises at important medical meetings. At the European Society of Cardiology meeting in August, we presented the preliminary results of the Phase III AVERROES trial for apixaban, or ELIQUIS, as we will market it, in patients with atrial fibrillation, who are unsuitable for treatment with warfarin. The preliminary results demonstrated that apixaban significantly reduced the relative risk of a composite of stroke or systemic embolism by 54% compared with aspirin, without a significant increase in major bleeding. We believe this is an area of significant, unmet medical need as up to 40% to 50% of patients are identified as unsuitable for treatment with warfarin.
Today, now I'm glad to inform you that based on the strength of these data, we, along with our partner Pfizer, have already initiated a rolling submission with the FDA. We expect the submission to be complete in the early part of 2011. 
For dapagliflozin, we have now presented results from five of the total 11 Phase III studies for this novel, first-in-class diabetes compound. We are excited by its potential emerging profile that balances a triad of benefits: good HbA1c control, improvements in blood pressure and increased weight loss, with what appears to be a manageable safety and tolerability profile.
We and our partner AstraZeneca are on track to submit, as previously announced, our application for the marketing authorization of dapagliflozin in Europe by the end of 2010, early 2011. Today, now I have also good news for dapagliflozin in the U.S. I am pleased to announce that we have completed the analysis of cardiovascular data mandated by the new FDA guidelines. And based on that analysis, we plan to submit also in the U.S. at the end of 2010, early 2011.
We also submitted a response to the FDA, a complete response letter regarding the BLA [Biologics License Application] for neurologics. We have been advised that we must resolve the issue at Manati prior to gaining approval of the pending BLA. And based on our assumptions, when Manati will be inspection-rated by the end of the year, we hope to hear the decision on the BLA in the second quarter of 2011. 
On the regulatory front, last week we achieved a positive opinion from the CHMP [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use] in Europe for SPRYCEL first line, and we look forward to progressing there. We are anticipating several other key regulatory decisions in the coming months. In the U.S., we expect to hear the FDA's decision for both SPRYCEL first line and for the fixed-dose combination of ONGLYZA and metformin by the end of this month, the month of October. Additionally, we feel very positive about the prospects for ipilimumab, and we'll continue to work with the FDA and other regulatory agencies on its approval.
Now let me turn it over to Charlie."
25798,114404565,81838,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Bristol-Myers Squibb Company","Executives","Thank you, Lamberto, and good morning, everyone. We did have another quarter of solid growth. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.59 or 26% increase over last year, supported by sales growth in most of our key products and continued expense management. Includ",912,"Thank you, Lamberto, and good morning, everyone. We did have another quarter of solid growth. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.59 or 26% increase over last year, supported by sales growth in most of our key products and continued expense management. Included in our third quarter EPS is a negative $0.02 impact of U.S. healthcare reform. I want to give you some brief highlights from our third quarter financial results and talk about guidance before we go to your questions.
The company reported third quarter net sales from continuing operations of $4.8 billion, flat compared to last year, or up 1% net of foreign exchange. U.S. healthcare reform had a 1.6% negative impact on net sales in the quarter and incremental EU measures had a negative impact of just under 1%. Volume was up 1%. 
The third quarter sales performance was driven in large part by strength in our Virology Franchise, PLAVIX, ORENCIA and SPRYCEL. Growth in these brands was primary offset by declines in our mature brands. Our Virology Franchise had solid global sales growth, up 8% from a year ago. This sales strength demonstrates the continued strong demand for REYATAZ, the Sustiva franchise, and BARACLUDE across both our U.S. and international markets. U.S. PLAVIX sales grew 9% in the quarter. In Europe, we saw a continued erosion of PLAVIX as generic clopidogrel was available in most of the countries. As we said, we expect erosion of PLAVIX sales in Europe to begin to slow, but it will continue. The impact is primarily recorded in equity income from affiliates in our P&L.
In the U.S., ABILIFY prescription demand increased 3%. And while lower growth than Q2, ABILIFY continues to grow faster than the market. However, ABILIFY reported sales in the U.S. were down 11% due to the negative impact of U.S. healthcare reform and reduction in our share of net sales under the revised contractual terms with Otsuka. Lastly, our mature brands declined 19% or $169 million compared to last year. Divestitures in and rationalization of our non-strategic mature brands portfolio had a negative impact year-over-year of approximately $65 million.
In aggregate, U.S. healthcare reform, EU pricing measures, the ABILIFY contract extension and mature brands divestitures had a combined negative 4% impact on our reported total company sales in the quarter. 
The impact from U.S. healthcare reform has been slightly less than our original estimate, and we now expect a $0.10 impact for 2010. Our estimated impact for 2011 EPS has not changed, given the annualization of managed Medicaid, expected 340B hospital expansion and the new impacts from the Part D Donut Hole coverage and the pharma fee.
Now let me give you some highlights from the rest of our P&L. I will focus my comments on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations to our GAAP results are available in our press release and in our website. 
Gross margin increased 80 basis points to 73.9% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Improvements in product mix, productivity and impact from foreign exchange were only partially offset by the impact from the changes in the contractual agreement with Otsuka. 
Advertising and promotion expenses were down 10% to $231 million for the quarter. The decrease is due to less spending on the promotion of those products at the end of their life cycle and to Otsuka's reimbursement of certain ABILIFY, SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA expenses. This was partially offset by increased pre-launch spending on new products and indications. 
Equity income from affiliates declined 50%, driven by continued erosion of PLAVIX sales in Europe, as I mentioned earlier. The effective overall non-GAAP tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 20% in the third quarter. The lower tax rate was primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain tax audits. You should note that this reserve release was assumed when we gave our full year guidance. Our guidance remains between 23% and 24% for the year, assuming passage of the R&D tax credit. As a reminder, we only account for the tax credit in the quarter in which it happens.
Let me turn to guidance. As Lamberto mentioned, we are operating in challenging times. Macroeconomic issues, U.S. healthcare reform and incremental pricing pressure in Europe are all having an impact on our business. As demonstrated by our third quarter results, we have been very efficient in managing our expenses to help offset some of this impact. However, moving forward, these challenges will create a headwind. We believe we have a very attractive portfolio and while we remain keenly focused on productivity, we are also committed to making the appropriate investments required to maximize the long-term value of our assets. 
We are confirming our previous 2010 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance with a few adjustments to our non-GAAP line item guidance. We expect Q4 sales growth to be consistent with Q3, resulting in low to mid-single-digit growth for the year. Advertising and promotion should decrease in the low double-digits as compared to our original guidance of a high single-digit decrease. R&D will increase in the mid-single-digit range. As I said, we expect our tax rate to remain between 23% to 24%, assuming the R&D tax credit is passed in Q4. 
In closing, we have a solid third quarter, double-digit EPS growth supported by key brands, good management of expenses, a strong cash position, confirmation of our 2010 EPS guidance and the continued positive of our innovative pipeline. 
I would now like to turn it over to your questions."

Let me just correct my statement that if the first-line study is event-driven, we have been continually projecting when we would have it. And I think it would be probably towards the end of the first quarter of '11. But the application in front of the agencies have to do with the benefit/risk around the second-line patients, and I think the data is robust with a survival benefit. And that is the data that we are engaged in discussing with the FDA and those regulatory authorities abroad. Let me just say that with regard to anticoagulants, in general, I think both Beatrice and I, representing the company, agree that this is a huge new opportunity. There will be different profiles of drugs out there. Our belief medically and commercially from the very beginning was that doctors and patients wanted a safer Coumadin, so to speak. The big unmet medical need is the less bleeding so that we can administer this drug to patients and achieve some benefit. We are struck by the large percentage of patients that go untreated, even though efficacy of Coumadin is known, and often offered aspirin, a less efficacious drug, because of the fear of the benefit/risk in the narrow therapeutic window of Coumadin. And hence, AVERROES was performed in patients that could not tolerate or could not take Coumadin. Based on that data that we presented to European Society of Congress [ph], we think that, that stands on its own. We are in a fast-track procedure with a rolling submission and hope to complete that by the beginning of next year, sometime in '11 of the first quarter. Meanwhile, we await the profiles. We still see major opportunity. I'll let Beatrice comment further. And we are anxiously awaiting the ROCKET data."

Overall market research and also discussion with patients, physicians, from generalists to our European leaders, clearly emphasize the need for a product at least as efficacious as warfarin, but also is easier to use in addition to safer to use. So what we see there is a strong role for more usage, and you see a number of patients that are not treated to date, not just the warfarin patients that can be switched, it's also all the patients that are not treated at all or were treated by aspirin previously. You see large discontinuation in those trials for aspirin, for warfarin. So we know very likely, we'll be coming served, but you may have surprise, you never know after November. But obviously, being served doesn't mean that untapped potentials, that is not room for you. We believe we have a large opportunity there. And our profile, as you probably heard, in ESC [European Society of Cardiology] was very well-received and is very encouraging in terms of having fully demonstrated versus aspirin our benefit/risk with a very good bleeding profile. So the BID question, which was a specific question, product size BID, we don't know what their profile is going to be from efficacy, safety. So it's also a population with multiple probabilities and they are taking drugs. They are taking several of those drugs and some of them are also BID. So we don't believe BID would be on the cap [ph]. We believe the risk/benefit in the various populations will be what drives our potential success."

Let me talk first a bit about the data seen from organizations like WK and IMS are showing that the market in the U.S. from a volume perspective has declined to pretty much a flat 1% during the entire 2010. This compares with a growth in 2009. It went from 1% to about 3%, so clearly a flat market at the moment.
When you decompose that, you see that the branded products are probably declining at about 13% and the generics are growing at about 5% or so. So net-net, an overall decline in the marketplace. The healthcare reform itself is not playing that much of a role at the moment. The economic situation, obviously, yes. One, I think a lot of patients have come out of COBRA, out of extended benefits, are now having to struggle to find access to healthcare.
Number two, we are seeing an increase in the level of abandonment at the pharmacy level, i.e. patients who take a prescription to the pharmacy and then decide not to fill it. When you decompose that data, you see there's quite a dramatic difference between new RXs versus continued RXs. New RXs in some categories, such as ABILIFY, have gone high as 22%, 23%. So patients are really having a problem to manage that. Obviously, we've stepped in as quickly as we can to assist patients from a co-pay perspective to drive that forward. I think the Medicaid Part D healthcare reform for next year will obviously help us, as more patients will be able to afford the drugs as they move through the donut hole. Beatrice?"

One is basically through government measures, pricing pressure and also encouragement of generic prescription. So you see a shift of volume most generally. You see also some effect of the crisis in some of the market, like Spain, obviously, where you have high unemployment. So you see some volume pressure. For BMS per se, what to see is a shift of some large GP brand, like PLAVIX, where we lost the patent to our specialty care innovative compound, where we have less volume but a mix of price volumes very differently. So in that overall situation, I think, look at the open situation, we feel that with the launch of specialty care products we have, we'll be able to protect with all the appropriate price volume relation that we have in excess, our growth potential on the specialty brand. So we feel comfortable that, that will help us. But you'll certainly see it declining to a little bit to the environment and also to our own portfolio evolution."

Would you consider switching your message to focus more on market share as compared to market growth with the combination approval?

On apixaban, when we looked at the market of patients that are not taking warfarin, some of them are patients that were treated by the specialist and then discontinuing because of side effects or because it's not fully monitored and they had to make trade-offs. So we feel that market segment is going to be accessible relatively quickly because it goes to the normal prescription of the specialist. The area where the patients are not treated at all and we certainly need to have a business model that links very closely the specialist and the general practitioner, and we are working on those aspects with all our teams around the world to understand how to build a model that captures those population quickly.
That's why we are very encouraged by our overall data because actually, it clearly shows that they were thinking of fast appearing [ph] the product that is significantly superior in efficacy and safer in term of the usage. So we believe with that data, we will have a unique opportunity to accelerate the usage of A-fib. A-fib is very concerning the number of stroke and very severe and debilitating strokes. So the whole message of all the companies around the disease itself is going to help with that segment. So we feel confident that it may appear that it may be still worth [ph] to start with, but that we have found the ways to generate prescriptions quickly."

So if we now go to your question on the dapagliflozin and its potential, especially as it relates to DPP-4 [indiscernible].

The product will and is arching independently from insulin, providing a very different pathway to completing the diabetes patient treatment with additional benefit that we are concerning more and more in our clinical trials on the possible weight loss as well as possible blood pressure benefit. So when we look at the market, we believe that with the unmet need and the growth and the noise in the market and the education on diabetes and the large number of diabetic program across government around the world and the heightened awareness of what needs to be done, there will be a large potential for a category of providing that level of benefit. So when we compare DPP-4 and dapagliflozin sales, we believe this will be a full class on its own and we'll take a significant share, and there should not be too direct competition when you start segmenting the patient population."

Let me walk you through the highlights.Our financial performance in the quarter was solid. Do",885,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. We have completed another quarter in which we continued to successfully deliver against the execution of our strategy. Let me walk you through the highlights.
Our financial performance in the quarter was solid. Double-digit growth in earnings per share demonstrate our ability to operate in a very challenging environment as we continue to see the impact of U.S. healthcare reform and are beginning to see an impact from incremental pricing pressures in Europe. Despite these challenges, operationally, we are completely focused on growing our portfolio of innovative products and preparing for the potential launch of new products during the fourth quarter and into 2011, all while continuing to deliver on productivity initiatives across the entire company.
As you have seen in our release, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2010 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS. Strategic and disciplined capital allocation remains a key part of our BioPharma strategy. We finished the quarter in a very strong financial position, with approximately $10.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. Business development remains a top priority for capital allocation, and we also remain committed to the dividends, and are actively engaged in the share repurchase program begun in the second quarter.
In October, we completed the acquisition of ZymoGenetics, the transaction built on our long-term commitment to virology by giving up full ownership of PEG-Interferon lambda currently in development for Hepatitis C. We are looking forward to present 12-week Phase IIb data on lambda and our small molecule antivirals in development for Hepatitis C, at AASLD [American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases] between October 29 and November 2.
In addition, we are excited by the seven early clinical and preclinical programs from ZymoGenetics that expands our strong biologic capability in oncology and immunoscience and by the FDA-approved specialty surgical biologic, RECOTHROM. 
On a less positive note, we received a warning letter from the FDA about certain processes and practices to be improved or remediated at our manufacturing facility in Manati, Puerto Rico. We have provided a response to the FDA warning letter, including details of the actions that we are taking, and we expect that Manati facility will be inspection-rated by the end of the year. Manufacturing continues uninterrupted at Manati, and I want to assure you that resolving the issues in Manati is one of our top priorities.
This was another good, very good quarter for clinical data. We presented key data from our cardiovascular and diabetic franchises at important medical meetings. At the European Society of Cardiology meeting in August, we presented the preliminary results of the Phase III AVERROES trial for apixaban, or ELIQUIS, as we will market it, in patients with atrial fibrillation, who are unsuitable for treatment with warfarin. The preliminary results demonstrated that apixaban significantly reduced the relative risk of a composite of stroke or systemic embolism by 54% compared with aspirin, without a significant increase in major bleeding. We believe this is an area of significant unmet medical need and is up to 40% to 50% of patients are identified as unsuitable for treatment with warfarin.
Today, now I'm glad to inform you that based on the strength of these data, we, along with our partner Pfizer, have already initiated a rolling submission with the FDA. We expect the submission to be complete in the early part of 2011. 
For dapagliflozin, we have now presented results from five of the total 11 Phase III studies for this novel, first-in-class diabetes compound. We are excited by its potential emerging profile that balances a triad of benefits: good HbA1c control, improvements in blood pressure and increased weight loss, with what appears to be a manageable safety and tolerability profile.
We and our partner AstraZeneca are on track to submit, as previously announced, our application for the marketing authorization of dapagliflozin in Europe by the end of 2010, early 2011. Today, now I have also good news for dapagliflozin in the U.S. I am pleased to announce that we have completed the analysis of cardiovascular data mandated by the new FDA guidelines. And based on that analysis, we plan to submit also in the U.S. at the end of 2010, early 2011.
We also submitted a response to the FDA, a complete response letter regarding the BLA [Biologics License Application] for neurologics. We have been advised that we must resolve the issue at Manati prior to gaining approval of the pending BLA. And based on our assumptions, when Manati will be inspection-rated by the end of the year, we hope to hear the decision on the BLA in the second quarter of 2011. 
On the regulatory front, last week, we achieved a positive opinion from the CHMP [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use] in Europe for SPRYCEL first line, and we look forward to progressing there. We are anticipating there are other key regulatory decisions in the coming months. In the U.S., we expect to hear the FDA's decision for both SPRYCEL first line and for the fixed-dose combination of ONGLYZA and metformin by the end of this month, the month of October. Additionally, we feel very positive about the prospects for ipilimumab, and we'll continue to work with the FDA and other regulatory agencies on its approval.
Now let me turn it over to Charlie."
25798,114404565,108926,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Bristol-Myers Squibb Company","Executives","Thank you, Lamberto, and good morning, everyone. We did have another quarter of solid growth. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.59 or 26% increase over last year, supported by sales growth in most of our key products and continued expense management. Includ",913,"Thank you, Lamberto, and good morning, everyone. We did have another quarter of solid growth. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.59 or 26% increase over last year, supported by sales growth in most of our key products and continued expense management. Included in our third quarter EPS is a negative $0.02 impact of U.S. healthcare reform. I want to give you some brief highlights from our third quarter financial results and talk about guidance before we go to your questions.
The company reported third quarter net sales from continuing operations of $4.8 billion, flat compared to last year, or up 1% net of foreign exchange. U.S. healthcare reform had a 1.6% negative impact on net sales in the quarter and incremental EU measures had a negative impact of just under 1%. Volume was up 1%. 
The third quarter sales performance was driven in large part by strength in our Virology Franchise, PLAVIX, ORENCIA and SPRYCEL. Growth in these brands was primary offset by declines in our mature brands. Our Virology Franchise had solid global sales growth, up 8% from a year ago. This sales strength demonstrates the continued strong demand for REYATAZ  and SUSTIVA franchise, and BARACLUDE across both our U.S. and international markets. U.S. PLAVIX sales grew 9% in the quarter. In Europe, we saw a continued erosion of PLAVIX as generic clopidogrel was available in most of the countries. As we said, we expect erosion of PLAVIX sales in Europe to begin to slow, but it will continue. The impact is primarily recorded in equity income from affiliates in our P&L.
In the U.S., ABILIFY prescription demand increased to 3%. And while lower growth than Q2, ABILIFY continues to grow faster than the market. However, ABILIFY reported sales in the U.S. were down 11% due to the negative impact of U.S. healthcare reform and reduction in our share of net sales under the revised contractual terms sales with Otsuka. Lastly, our mature brands declined 19% or $169 million compared to last year. Divestitures in and rationalization of our non-strategic mature brands portfolio had a negative impact year-over-year of approximately $65 million.
In aggregate, U.S. healthcare reform, EU pricing measures, the ABILIFY contract extension and mature brands divestitures had a combined negative 4% impact on our reported total company sales in the quarter. 
The impact from U.S. healthcare reform has been slightly less than our original estimate, and we now expect a $0.10 impact for 2010. Our estimated impact for 2011 EPS has not changed, given the annualization of managed Medicaid, expected 340B hospital expansion and the new impacts from the Part D Donut Hole coverage and the pharma fee.
Now let me give you some highlights from the rest of our P&L. I will focus my comments on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations to our GAAP results are available in our press release and our website. 
Gross margin increased 80 basis points to 73.9% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Improvements  in product mix, productivity and impact from foreign exchange were only partially offset by the impact from the changes in the contractual agreement with Otsuka. 
Advertising and promotion expenses were down 10% to $231 million for the quarter. The decrease is due to less spending on the promotion of those products at the end of their life cycle and to Otsuka's reimbursement of certain ABILIFY, SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA expenses. This was partially offset by increased prelaunch spending on new products and indications. 
Equity income from affiliates declined 50%, driven by continued erosion of PLAVIX sales in Europe, as I mentioned earlier. The effective overall non-GAAP tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 20% in the third quarter. The lower tax rate was primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain tax audits. You should note that this reserve release was assumed when we gave our full year guidance. Our guidance remains between 23% and 24% for the year, assuming passage of the R&D tax credit. As a reminder, we only account for the tax credit in the quarter in which it happened.
Let me turn to guidance. As Lamberto mentioned, we are operating in challenging times. Macroeconomic issues, U.S. healthcare reform and incremental pricing pressure in Europe are all having an impact on our business. As demonstrated by our third quarter results, we have been very efficient in managing our expenses to help offset some of this impact. However, moving forward, these challenges will create a headwind. We believe we have a very attractive portfolio and while we remain keenly focused on productivity, we are also committed to making the appropriate investments required to maximize the long-term value of our assets. 
We are confirming our previous 2010 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance with a few adjustments to our non-GAAP line item guidance. We expect Q4 sales growth to be consistent with Q3, resulting in low to mid-single-digit growth for the year. Advertising and promotion should decrease in the low double-digits as compared to our original guidance of a high single-digit decrease. R&D will increase in the mid-single-digit range. As I said, we expect our tax rate to remain between 23% to 24%, assuming the R&D tax credit is passed in Q4. 
In closing, we have a solid third quarter, double-digit EPS growth supported by key brands, good management of expenses, a strong cash position, confirmation of our 2010 EPS guidance and the continued positive of our innovative pipeline. 
I would now like to turn it over to your questions."

It is comparing, adding to standard of care dacarbazine versus dacarbazine alone. And we are estimating that we will have results in early '11. With regard to belatacept, we have answered the complete response, including the submission of the 36-month data. I'm encouraged by the data. I believe it supports the benefit/risk profile of belatacept, and we expect this data at the American Transplant Congress meeting in May of '11."

Obviously, you're a twice-a-day drug versus XARELTO, which is a once-a-day drug. So if you could elaborate on that, please? And then secondly again, on ipilimumab, FDA is holding a panel meeting on December 2 related to the '20 study, what is the strategy around the balancing the front-line study with the second-line study, given that just around the PDUFA [Prescription Drug User Fee Act] date, December 25, Elliott, you said that the front-line study would be reporting out?"

Let me just correct my statement that if the first-line study is event-driven, we have been continually projecting when we would have it. And I think it would be probably towards the end of the first quarter of '11. But the application in front of the agencies have to do with the benefit/risk around the second-line patients, and I think the data is robust with a survival benefit. And that is the data that we are engaged in discussing with the FDA and those regulatory authorities abroad. Let me just say that with regard to anticoagulants, in general, I think both Beatrice and I, representing the company, agree that this is a huge new opportunity. There will be different profiles of drugs out there. Our belief medically and commercially from the very beginning was that doctors and patients wanted a safer Coumadin, so to speak. The big unmet medical need is the less bleeding so that we can administer this drug to patients and achieve some benefit. We are struck by the large percentage of patients that go untreated, even though efficacy of Coumadin is known, and often offered aspirin, a less efficacious drug, because of the fear of the benefit/risk in the narrow therapeutic window of Coumadin. And hence, AVERROES was performed in patients that could not tolerate or could not take Coumadin. Based on that data that we presented to European Society of Congress, we think that, that stands on its own. We are in a fast-track procedure with a rolling submission and hope to complete that by the beginning of next year, sometime in '11 of the first quarter. Meanwhile, we await the profiles. We still see major opportunity. I'll let Beatrice comment further. And we are anxiously awaiting the ROCKET data --"

Overall market research and also discussion with patient, physician, from generalist to our European leaders, clearly emphasize the need for a product at least as efficacious as warfarin, but is easier to use in addition to safer to use. So what we see there is a strong role for more usage, and you see a number of patients that are not treated to date, not just the warfarin patients that can be switched, it's also all the patients that are not treated at all or were treated by aspirin previously. You see large discontinuation in those trials for aspirin, for warfarin. So we know very likely, we'll be coming served, but you may have surprise, you never know after November. Obviously, being served doesn't mean that untapped potentials, that is not room for you. We believe we have a large opportunity there. And our profile, as you probably heard, in ESC [European Society of Cardiology] was very well-received and is very encouraging in terms of having fully demonstrated versus aspirin our benefit/risk with a very good bleeding profile. So the BID question, which was a specific question, product size BID, we don't know what their profile is going to be from efficacy, safety. So it's also a population with multiple probabilities and they are taking drugs. They are taking several of those drugs and some of them are also BID. So we don't believe BID would be a -- it would really be a risk/benefit in the various population will be what drive our potential."

Let me talk first a bit about the data seen from organizations like WK and IMS are showing that the market in the U.S. from a volume perspective has declined to pretty much a flat 1% during the entire 2010. This compares with a growth in 2009. It went from about 1% to about 3%, so clearly, a flat market at the moment. When you decompose that, you see that the branded products are probably declining at about 13% and the generics are growing at about 5% or so. So net-net, an overall decline in the marketplace. The healthcare reform itself is not playing that much of a role at the moment. The economic situation, obviously, yes. One, I think a lot of patients have come out of COBRA, extended benefits are now having to struggle to find access to healthcare. Number two, we are seeing an increase in the level of abandonment at the pharmacy level, i.e. patients who take prescription to the pharmacy and then decide not to fill it. When you decompose that data, you see there's quite a dramatic difference between new RXs versus continued RXs. New RXs in some categories, such as ABILIFY, have gone high as 22%, 23%. So patients are really having a problem to manage that. Obviously, we've stepped in as quickly as we can to assist patients from a co-pay perspective to drive that forward. I think that the Medicaid Part D healthcare reform for next year will obviously help us, as more patients will be able to afford the drugs as they move through the donut hole. Beatrice?"

And then finally, when we consider the peak sales opportunity for dapa [dapagliflozin] as compared to ONGLYZA, I guess, any thoughts on how you compare the two of those?"

On apixaban, when we looked at the market of patients that are not taking warfarin, some of them are patients that were treated by the specialist and then discontinuing because of side effects or because it's not fully monitored and they had to make trade-offs. So we feel that market segment is going to be accessible relatively quickly because it goes to the normal prescription of the specialist. The area where the patient are not treated at all and we certainly need to have a business model that links very closely the specialist and the general practitioner, and we are working on those aspects with all our teams around the world to understand how to build a model that captures those population quickly. That's why we are very encouraged by our overall data because actually, it clearly shows  that they were thinking of fast appearing the product that is significantly superior in efficacy and safer in term of the usage. So we believe with that data, we will have a unique opportunity to accelerate the usage of A-fib. A-fib is very concerning the number of stroke and very severe and debilitating strokes. So the whole message for all the companies around the disease itself is going to help with that segment. So we feel confident that it may appear that it may be still worth to start it, that we have form the ways to generate prescription quickly."

Nobody will be able to do a study comparing aspirin if apixaban is approved. That will not be something that people will ever be able to try. They will all have to do non-inferiority studies against apixaban. In this day and age, we value that information. We tested it with payers. And we see a great contribution and that's why I think we're getting fast-track status. Major bleeding, aspirin-like safety, measure-by-measure bleeding with Coumadin-like efficacy should be a powerful message. And Beatrice and I are working hard to prepare the market on that."

When you look at monotherapy situation, we take about one in three patients. And as we evolve towards the launch of the fixed-dose, it becomes pretty clear that the growth of the DPP-4 market has not met our expectations. When you assume that more than 40% of diabetic patients are not being properly controlled, there continues to be a huge need for us to educate physicians and patients about the need to add product to the existing regiments. So I think when we come to market with fixed-dose combination, it will be a combination of looking to drive market growth and then, of course, to compete within that market for market share."

So if we now go to your question on the dapagliflozin and its potential, especially as it relates to DPP-4. The product profile is unique and we have a very differentiated model faction. The product will and is arching independently from insulin, providing a very different pathway to completing the diabetes patient treatment with additional benefit that we are concerning more and more in our clinical trials on the possible weight loss as well as possible blood pressure benefit. So when we look at the market, we believe that with the unmet need and the growth and the noise in the market and the education on diabetes and the large number of diabetic program across government around the world and the heightened awareness of what needs to be done, there will be a large potential for a category of that providing that available benefit. So when we compare DPP-4 and dapagliflozin sales, we believe this will be a full class on its own and we'll take a significant share, and there should not be too direct competition when you start segmenting the patient population."
