I'll then discuss our sales to JPMorgan of a portion of our Commodities business and provide some additional color with respect to our next steps. And then finally, I'll give you an operational update at our Utilities and Infrastructure businesses.Now the financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $288 million or $1.16 per share compared with $319 million or $1.30 in the same period last year. For the full-year 2009, earnings increased to $1.12 billion or $4.52 per share, up from $1.1 billion or $4.43 per share. Earnings per share for 2009, without the impact of a $0.26 per share write-off earlier this year, improved 8% over last year's results.Last week, when we announced the sale of a portion of the Commodities joint venture, we provided guidance for 2010 of $4.25 to $4.50 per share. This guidance assumes the sale of the Metals, Oil and European Energy business flows by midyear and a full-year earnings contribution from the Commodities joint venture of $150 million to $250 million. Now let me hand it over to Mark so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results beginning with Slide 4."

At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the fourth quarter was $67 million compared with earnings of $81 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to $9 million of reduced incentive awards and $4 million of higher wild fire-related insurance expense in the fourth quarter of 2009. Full year 2009 earnings increased to $344 million from $339 million in the previous year. At Southern California Gas, fourth quarter 2009 earnings were $75 million, up from $54 million in the fourth quarter of '08. The increase was due to $10 million of higher margin and $7 million of lower litigation expense in the fourth quarter of '09.  For the full year 2009, SoCal earnings was up $273 million, up from $244 million in 2008. The 12% increase in earnings for the year was due to continued strong operating performance. Now let's go to Slide 5. Sempra Commodities' earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $71 million compared to $164 million in last year's fourth quarter. The last quarter of 2008 benefited from great performance across all of our product lines. This year, the business performed modestly in the fourth quarter of 2009. It was led by oil and metals. Power also performed well but results in the gas book were weak due to low volatility and a flat basis differentials during the final quarter of the year. The quarter was also impacted by retention costs and higher foreign taxes within the joint venture.  For the full-year 2009, commodity earnings of $345 million were in line with '08 results. Now let's move to Slide 6.  Here, we show how income is allocated at the joint venture for the last quarter and for the full year of 2009. Couple of highlights. First, the joint venture had income of $28 million during the quarter. After applying the income allocation methodology, the distributable income to Sempra was $24 million. After adjusting to U.S. GAAP and for the impact of taxes, Sempra's joint venture income for the quarter was $74 million, that down from $162 million in the same quarter in '08. For the year, the joint venture had distributable income of $407 million, and Sempra's after-tax share was $352 million. The U.S. GAAP conversion adjustment of $55 million for the quarter and $163 million for the year is primarily the recognition of storage and transportation earnings from 2008 that could not be recognized under U.S. GAAP until 2009. Now let's move to Slide 7. Fourth quarter earnings for our Generation business were $43 million compared with $60 million in the same quarter in '08. The decrease for the quarter is primarily the result of $16 million of Mexican income tax benefits in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full-year 2009, the Generation business recorded earnings of $162 million compared to $222 million in the prior year. The decrease was due to $31 million in reduced earnings due to lower gas prices in '09, the Mexican tax benefit in 2008 that I just mentioned and $9 million of solar investment tax credits in 2008. Now let's move to Slide 8.  Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $37 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. That's up from earnings of $22 million in the same quarter of 2008. Fourth quarter 2009 results includes $5 million of higher earnings from natural gas operations in Mexico, $5 million of higher earnings from investments in South America and $2 million of higher earnings from Domestic Pipeline & Storage assets. For the full year, 2009 earnings were $101 million compared to $106 million in 2008. The decrease was due to a $64 million write-off related to the Liberty Gas Storage project. The write-off was largely offset by $29 million in higher earnings from North American operations, $13 million of favorable tax benefits in 2009 compared with $9 million of unfavorable tax adjustments in 2008 and $8 million of higher earnings from South American investments during 2009.Now please turn to Slide 9. This slide provides a summary of our business unit results. I'd like to highlight a couple of things here. Sempra LNG had earnings of $35 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with a loss of $13 million in the prior year's period. The increase for the quarter was primarily due to the startup of marketing and terminal operations. I point out that the fourth quarter of 2009 was the first full quarter that we received revenue from all of our long-term contracts. For the full year 2009, Sempra LNG recorded earnings of $16 million compared with a loss of $46 million in 2008. For 2010, we expect the annual earnings to be in the range of $70 million to $90 million. At Parent & Other, we recorded a loss of $40 million in the fourth quarter compared with the loss of $49 million in the same quarter in '08. For the full year 2009, the Parent recorded a loss of $122 million compared to a loss of $97 million in 2008. This increase is primarily due to increased interest expense.Please turn to Slide 10. Overall, our results for the quarter and for the year were very strong. Earnings at our California utilities were up a combined 6% for the full year, operating cash flow during 2009 was up 57% over the prior year and from a liquidity perspective, we still have $3.6 billion availability under our committed bank lines at the end of the year. And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Don who will begin with Slide 11."

Now let me update you on our business activities starting with our Commodities joint venture. Lastly week, and RBS announced an agreement to sell the Metals, Oil and European Energy segments of RBS-Sempra Commodities to JPMorgan for an expected $1.7 billion. Sempra's share of the proceeds is expected to be $941 million. We also expect to distribute approximately $500 million of excess cash in the business, of which Sempra would receive half. Please go to Slide 12.  Last week, I commented that we were still exploring options related to the remaining North American Gas and Power business. These options included selling the remaining business or finding a new partner or other relationship to provide liquidity and financial support that would cap our exposure to the business and allow us to reacquire RBS' share without issuing equity. We have continued to explore several options for a third-party support but in this market, we no longer believe we can find a cost-effective, long-term alternative to equity. Because of this, a sale of the business is now our preferred outcome. We have several interested parties and believe a transaction can be completed quickly in a fashion that delivers the best results for our shareholders. Please go to the next slide.  In a sale, we anticipate receiving 49% of the remaining book value, which equates to approximately $800 million plus a premium. This assumes all the previously discussed distributions have been made. The combination of the sale to JPMorgan, the subsequent cash distribution and the expected proceeds from the sale of a North American Natural Gas and Power business should mean total cash proceeds to Sempra in the neighborhood of $2 billion or more. Please go to Slide 14.  We plan to use these proceeds to fund new growth, reduce debt and upon an exit of the business, a share repurchase. If you assume we complete our exit of the business before year end, and we earned $150 million to $250 million in the Commodity business in 2010, we would expect our earnings for 2010 to be between $4.25 and $4.50 per share. For 2011, assuming we repurchased $500 million to $1 billion in equity before the start of the year, and given the growth in our Utility and Infrastructure businesses, we expect to earn between $4.35 and $4.65 per share in 2011. Now go to Slide 15 please.  What I'd like to do now is update you on the activities at our California utilities. Our largest project, the Sunrise PowerLink transmission line, is scheduled to be in service and the second half of 2012, we're awaiting the final approval from the U.S. Forest Service, which we expect to receive in the next couple of months. A number of activities are underway to support the start of construction later this year. We placed orders for key components, including powers and underground cable and are now focused on completing the construction agreements and acquiring land rights. Turning to our Smart Meters programs, at SDG&E, we're well underway with the installation of Smart Meters and have now installed almost 600,000. The Meters are being installed at a rate out about 7,000 per day. We expect to have 1.4 million meters installed by year end and to complete installation of all 2.3 million gas and electric meters by year end 2011.At SoCalGas, proposed an alternate decisions were issued earlier this month by the CPUC on our proposed gas Smart Meter project. This is a $900 million capital project that involves installing $6 million gas Smart Meters in phases from 2012 to year-end 2017. While the proposed decision issued by the administrative law judge didn't support the project, the alternate decision issued by the assigned commissioner in the preceding recommended approval, provided certain conditions are met. We think this is a workable outcome and we look forward to receiving a final decision from the commission by midyear. At San Diego Gas & Electric, the CPUC recently approved our request to defer the next cost of capital proceeding by two years.We were originally scheduled to file a cost of capital application with the commission this year but will now file in 2012. The cost of capital would be effective in 2013. SDG&E's current CPUC authorize return on equity is 11.1%.Before moving on, I'd like to update you on SDG&E's litigation regarding the 2007 wildfires. After considering the amounts incurred for homeowner settlements, additional reserves and estimated defense cost, SDG&E's remaining insurance coverage is approximately $20 million. Although additional cost necessary to resolve the remaining claims are likely to exceed the remaining insurance, the ultimate economic impact will be determined after taking to account amounts we expect to recover from other potentially-responsible parties, including Cox Communication and amounts SDG&E will file to recover in rates. SDG&E's rate recovery mechanisms, along with regulatory treatment of previously-incurred large and unusual costs such as environmental liabilities and the court's application of the strict liability standard to these fire-related damages all support cost recovery. From an accounting perspective, the timing and our ability to accrue recovery for this cost, either from utility customers or other third parties, may vary from the time the cost is known and recordable and the time of our payment and subsequent recovery. While this may have an effect on our reported results in cash flows, we expect to recover the vast majority of these costs. Please now go to Slide 16.  At Sempra Generation, we have now began construction our Copper Mountain Solar project in Boulder City, Nevada. This project is a 48-megawatt expansion of the existing 10-megawatt El Dorado Solar facility. The power generated by this expansion will be sold under a 20 year contract to PG&E. We'll bring this project online in phases and expect to complete construction later this year.  Also last year, Sempra Generation acquired a 50% interest in the Fowler Ridge II Wind Farm located in Indiana. Legal partners there with VP and this 200-megawatt project, which began operations in December. Moving to our LNG business unit, we have completed construction on a $125 million nitrogen injection plant at our Energia Costa Azul terminal. This project became operational in December and provides us with another source of contracted revenue.  On our Cameron LNG terminal in Louisiana, we have received two spot cargoes from RasGas, one in the fourth quarter of last year and was so far in this quarter. The U.S. is seeing an increase in LNG flows and were optimistic about receiving additional cargoes this year from Cutter under our agreement with RasGas. Both of our LNG terminals are supported by a 20-year contracts that represent nearly 65% of their total capacity. At our Pipelines & Storage business, the Rockies Express Pipeline project was completed in November and is now fully operational. And in our natural gas storage development program in the Gulf Coast region, we expect to bring an additional $12.5 million cubic feet of storage capacity online by the end of this year at our Mississippi Hub facilities. Now please go to Slide 17. Yesterday, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire El Paso's pipelines in Mexico. We'll acquire interest in two natural gas pipelines connected to the U.S., a natural gas pipeline connected to PEMEX system in Northern Mexico and a pipeline near Monterey. Three of the four assets are coned with PEMEX in a 50-50 joint venture and one will be wholly owned by us. The Mexican government has announced its desire for our new partner PEMEX to dispose of their ownership interest in these assets. PEMEX will hold an open auction to facilitate the sale, which is subject to our Right of First Refusal. PEMEX long-term contracts to utilize these Pipeline capacity. Will remain unchanged. The assets are all in operation and provide stable revenue streams under long-term contracts representing a weighted average length of 13 years with PEMEX and the Mexican Federal Energy company or the CFE. The acquisition, which will be part of our Pipelines & Storage business, extends Sempra's existing infrastructure footprint in Mexico, which currently includes natural gas pipelines, distribution companies, a power plant and our Energia Costa Azul LNG terminal.  The total purchase price for the acquisition of the assets from El Paso is $300 million or $260 million net of cash and debt. We expect the transaction to close midyear and to be slightly accretive to earnings this year and attribute $0.10 per share in 2011. Now the next slide please. Let me just wrap up by saying I'm pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and for the full year. I'm also proud of our accomplishments in 2009, which include the completion of a five-year construction program in our Natural Gas business and the continued progress of our major utility projects. We have decided on our approach for the remaining business at RBS-Sempra Commodities and as we exit the Trading business, the proceeds will help fund our robust capital program of $14.5 billion over the next five years and lead to strong predictable growth. We'll be giving you more detail on that capital program and our earnings projections at our upcoming conference in San Diego on March 25 and with that, let me stop, open up the call and take any questions you may have."

Now your new guidance for 2011, which is going to have no earnings in the business, no earnings from the Commodities business. Actually, we're seeing upward trajectory in earnings from 2010 to '11. Should we, I'm trying to reconcile that in my head. Does that mean that maybe 2010 was conservative and including the -- when you include the commodities, you were trying to be extra conservative? Or is there just this big share buyback that's creating accretion even though you're selling another half of the business when the first half was dilutive, something is numerically is difficult to reconcile."

We have two things going on. One, the 2010 guidance adjusts for the fact that we have a very much reduced commodities expectation in that number and we're getting the monies for the proceeds from the sales towards the middle to the end of the year. And with 2011, we can redeploy those proceeds and some of them which will instant earnings accretion, which is like, for instance, the share buyback. And we'll have some new investments coming online like our Mexican pipeline assets. And then also just reflective of the fact that our other businesses have fairly good growth. Our utilities are going to grow, our other businesses are going to grow and so that's all reflected in the 2011 guidance. So I think from a -- one of the things that we're showing here is yes, we are kind of resetting the bar where we're going from a move forward position, but we're absolutely going to grow this business robustly into the future, and this is where, and this is the direction it's going to be in.

California like the rest of the country for the last 20 or 30 years hasn't had an energy policy. And customers have kind of swung up and down depending on the price of oil and natural gas because of that. California adopted a policy about four or five years ago to go its own way and to become less dependent upon fossil fuels and to have a higher buildout of renewables along with energy efficiency and demand side management. And that direction had support, not just from the regulators at the Commission, but also from the elected officials in Sacramento. And even today, there's no doubt that we have a tough economic climate in California. When you look at the fact that the one thing that we're blessed with in California is fairly decent weather and we don't have a large base of industrial customers. This has not been an issue. Now that doesn't mean it can't be at some point in the future, but everything today says we're going to stay the course, we're going to continue down this path we've been on for the last five or 10 years because what we want longer term is price stability in California from the energy sector.

So I think from that perspective, it's a relatively low risk, kind of perspective. And one of the reasons I cast a lot of comfort in that is as we have discussed previously, those North America Gas and Power business right now because of a relatively flat basis across the country and with the contangos that have come in lately, I think you'll find that we don't have as large in that investment in that business as we've had in the past. And so we're sitting on a fair amount of cash and we've talked about some distributions already and there's still a cushion in the business. So I don't think it would be a tough thing to do.

We've managed to a coverage ratio and when we are in a growth mode as we are currently in and building projects ahead of their cash flow, we tend to have to manage to a slightly better leverage, less leverage just to maintain our coverage ratios. And that's really where we operate now.

And now with that, I'd like to turn it over to Don who will begin with Slide 3."

I'll then discuss our sales to JPMorgan of a portion of our Commodities business and provide some additional color with respect to our next steps. And then finally, I'll give you an operational update at our Utilities and Infrastructure businesses.Now the financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $288 million or $1.16 per share compared with $319 million or $1.30 in the same period last year. For the full-year 2009, earnings increased to $1.12 billion or $4.52 per share, up from $1.1 billion or $4.43 per share. Earnings per share for 2009, without the impact of a $0.26 per share write-off earlier this year, improved 8% over last year's results.Last week, when we announced the sale of a portion of the Commodities joint venture, we provided guidance for 2010 of $4.25 to $4.50 per share. This guidance assumes the sale of the Metals, Oil and European Energy business flows by midyear and a full-year earnings contribution from the Commodities joint venture of $150 million to $250 million. Now let me hand it over to Mark so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results beginning with Slide 4."

At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the fourth quarter was $67 million compared with earnings of $81 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to $9 million of reduced incentive awards and $4 million of higher wild fire-related insurance expense in the fourth quarter of 2009. Full year 2009 earnings increased to $344 million from $339 million in the previous year. At Southern California Gas, fourth quarter 2009 earnings were $75 million, up from $54 million in the fourth quarter of '08. The increase was due to $10 million of higher margin and $7 million of lower litigation expense in the fourth quarter of '09.  For the full year 2009, SoCal earnings was up $273 million, up from $244 million in 2008. The 12% increase in earnings for the year was due to continued strong operating performance. Now let's go to Slide 5. Sempra Commodities' earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $71 million compared to $164 million in last year's fourth quarter. The last quarter of 2008 benefited from great performance across all of our product lines. This year, the business performed modestly in the fourth quarter of 2009. It was led by oil and metals. Power also performed well but results in the gas book were weak due to low volatility and a flat basis differentials during the final quarter of the year. The quarter was also impacted by retention costs and higher foreign taxes within the joint venture.  For the full-year 2009, commodity earnings of $345 million were in line with '08 results. Now let's move to Slide 6.  Here, we show how income is allocated at the joint venture for the last quarter and for the full year of 2009. Couple of highlights. First, the joint venture had income of $28 million during the quarter. After applying the income allocation methodology, the distributable income to Sempra was $24 million. After adjusting to U.S. GAAP and for the impact of taxes, Sempra's joint venture income for the quarter was $74 million, that down from $162 million in the same quarter in '08. For the year, the joint venture had distributable income of $407 million, and Sempra's after-tax share was $352 million. The U.S. GAAP conversion adjustment of $55 million for the quarter and $163 million for the year is primarily the recognition of storage and transportation earnings from 2008 that could not be recognized under U.S. GAAP until 2009. Now let's move to Slide 7. Fourth quarter earnings for our Generation business were $43 million compared with $60 million in the same quarter in '08. The decrease for the quarter is primarily the result of $16 million of Mexican income tax benefits in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full-year 2009, the Generation business recorded earnings of $162 million compared to $222 million in the prior year. The decrease was due to $31 million in reduced earnings due to lower gas prices in '09, the Mexican tax benefit in 2008 that I just mentioned and $9 million of solar investment tax credits in 2008. Now let's move to Slide 8.  Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $37 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. That's up from earnings of $22 million in the same quarter of 2008. Fourth quarter 2009 results includes $5 million of higher earnings from natural gas operations in Mexico, $5 million of higher earnings from investments in South America and $2 million of higher earnings from Domestic Pipeline & Storage assets. For the full year, 2009 earnings were $101 million compared to $106 million in 2008. The decrease was due to a $64 million write-off related to the Liberty Gas Storage project. The write-off was largely offset by $29 million in higher earnings from North American operations, $13 million of favorable tax benefits in 2009 compared with $9 million of unfavorable tax adjustments in 2008 and $8 million of higher earnings from South American investments during 2009.Now please turn to Slide 9. This slide provides a summary of our business unit results. I'd like to highlight a couple of things here. Sempra LNG had earnings of $35 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with a loss of $13 million in the prior year's period. The increase for the quarter was primarily due to the startup of marketing and terminal operations. I point out that the fourth quarter of 2009 was the first full quarter that we received revenue from all of our long-term contracts. For the full year 2009, Sempra LNG recorded earnings of $16 million compared with a loss of $46 million in 2008. For 2010, we expect the annual earnings to be in the range of $70 million to $90 million. At Parent & Other, we recorded a loss of $40 million in the fourth quarter compared with a loss of $49 million in the same quarter in '08. For the full year 2009, the Parent recorded a loss of $122 million compared to a loss of $97 million in 2008. This increase is primarily due to increased interest expense.Please turn to Slide 10. Overall, our results for the quarter and for the year were very strong. Earnings at our California utilities were up a combined 6% for the full year. Operating cash flow during 2009 was up 57% over the prior year. And from a liquidity perspective, we still have $3.6 billion availability under our committed bank lines at the end of the year. And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Don, who will begin with Slide 11."

Now let me update you on our business activities starting with our Commodities joint venture. Last week, we and RBS announced an agreement to sell the Metals, Oil and European Energy segments of RBS Sempra Commodities to JPMorgan for an expe",1552,"Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on our business activities starting with our Commodities joint venture. Last week, we and RBS announced an agreement to sell the Metals, Oil and European Energy segments of RBS Sempra Commodities to JPMorgan for an expected $1.7 billion. Sempra's share of the proceeds is expected to be $941 million. We also expect to distribute approximately $500 million of excess cash in the business, of which Sempra would receive half. Please go to Slide 12.  Last week, I commented that we were still exploring options related to the remaining North American Gas and Power business. These options included selling the remaining business or finding a new partner or other relationship to provide liquidity and financial support that would cap our exposure to the business and allow us to reacquire RBS' share without issuing equity. We have continued to explore several options for a third-party support, but in this market, we no longer believe we can find a cost-effective, long-term alternative to equity. Because of this, a sale of the business is now our preferred outcome. We have several interested parties and believe a transaction can be completed quickly and in a fashion that delivers the best result for our shareholders. Please go to the next slide.  In a sale, we anticipate receiving 49% of the remaining book value, which equates to approximately $800 million plus a premium. This assumes all the previously discussed distributions have been made. The combination of the sale to JPMorgan, the subsequent cash distribution and the expected proceeds from the sale of a North American Natural Gas and Power business should mean total cash proceeds to Sempra in the neighborhood of $2 billion or more. Please go to Slide 14.  We plan to use these proceeds to fund new growth, reduce debt, and upon an exit of the business, a share repurchase. If you assume we complete our exit of the business before year end, and we earned $150 million to $250 million in the Commodity business in 2010, we would expect our earnings for 2010 to be between $4.25 and $4.50 per share. For 2011, assuming we repurchased $500 million to $1 billion in equity before the start of the year, and given the growth in our Utility and Infrastructure businesses, we expect to earn between $4.35 and $4.65 per share in 2011. Now go to Slide 15 please.  What I'd like to do now is update you on the activities at our California utilities. Our largest project, the Sunrise Powerlink transmission line, is scheduled to be in service in the second half of 2012. We're awaiting the final approval from the US Forest Service, which we expect to receive in the next couple of months. A number of activities are underway to support the start of construction later this year. We placed orders for key components, including towers and underground cable and are now focused on completing the construction agreements and acquiring land rights. Turning to our Smart Meters programs, at SDG&E, we're well underway with the installation of Smart Meters and have now installed almost 600,000. The Meters are being installed at a rate out about 7,000 per day. We expect to have 1.4 million meters installed by year end and to complete installation of all 2.3 million gas and electric meters by year end 2011.At SoCalGas, proposed and alternate [alternate proposed] decisions were issued earlier this month by the CPUC on our proposed gas Smart Meter project. This is a $900 million capital project that involves installing $6 million gas Smart Meters in phases from 2012 to year-end 2017. While the proposed decision issued by the administrative law judge didn't support the project, the alternate decision issued by the assigned commissioner in the preceding recommended approval, provided certain conditions are met. We think this is a workable outcome and we look forward to receiving a final decision from the commission by midyear. At San Diego Gas & Electric, the CPUC recently approved our request to defer the next cost of capital proceeding by two years.We were originally scheduled to file a cost of capital application with the commission this year but will now file in 2012. The cost of capital would be effective in 2013. SDG&E's current CPUC authorize return on equity is 11.1%.Before moving on, I'd like to update you on SDG&E's litigation regarding the 2007 wildfires. After considering the amounts incurred for homeowner settlements, additional reserves and estimated defense cost, SDG&E's remaining insurance coverage is approximately $20 million. Although additional cost necessary to resolve the remaining claims are likely to exceed the remaining insurance, the ultimate economic impact will be determined after taking to account amounts we expect to recover from other potentially-responsible parties, including Cox Communication and amounts SDG&E will file to recover in rates. SDG&E's rate recovery mechanisms, along with regulatory treatment of previously-incurred large and unusual costs such as environmental liabilities and the court's application of the strict liability standard to these fire-related damages all support cost recovery. From an accounting perspective, the timing and our ability to accrue recovery for this cost, either from utility customers or other third parties, may vary from the time the cost is known and recordable and the time of our payment and subsequent recovery. While this may have an effect on our reported results in cash flows, we expect to recover the vast majority of these costs. Please now go to Slide 16.  At Sempra Generation, we have now began construction our Copper Mountain Solar project in Boulder City, Nevada. This project is a 48-megawatt expansion of the existing 10-megawatt El Dorado Solar facility. The power generated by this expansion will be sold under a 20 year contract to PG&E. We'll bring this project online in phases and expect to complete construction later this year.  Also last year, Sempra Generation acquired a 50% interest in the Fowler Ridge II Wind Farm located in Indiana. Legal partners there with VP and this 200-megawatt project, which began operations in December. Moving to our LNG business unit, we have completed construction on a $125 million nitrogen injection plant at our Energia Costa Azul terminal. This project became operational in December and provides us with another source of contracted revenue.  On our Cameron LNG terminal in Louisiana, we have received two spot cargoes from RasGas, one in the fourth quarter of last year and was so far in this quarter. The U.S. is seeing an increase in LNG flows and were optimistic about receiving additional cargoes this year from Cutter under our agreement with RasGas. Both of our LNG terminals are supported by a 20-year contracts that represent nearly 65% of their total capacity. At our Pipelines & Storage business, the Rockies Express Pipeline project was completed in November and is now fully operational. And in our natural gas storage development program in the Gulf Coast region, we expect to bring an additional $12.5 million cubic feet of storage capacity online by the end of this year at our Mississippi Hub facilities. Now please go to Slide 17. Yesterday, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire El Paso's pipelines in Mexico. We'll acquire interest in two natural gas pipelines connected to the U.S., a natural gas pipeline connected to PEMEX system in Northern Mexico and a pipeline near Monterey. Three of the four assets are coned with PEMEX in a 50-50 joint venture and one will be wholly owned by us. The Mexican government has announced its desire for our new partner PEMEX to dispose of their ownership interest in these assets. PEMEX will hold an open auction to facilitate the sale, which is subject to our Right of First Refusal. PEMEX long-term contracts to utilize these Pipeline capacity. Will remain unchanged. The assets are all in operation and provide stable revenue streams under long-term contracts representing a weighted average length of 13 years with PEMEX and the Mexican Federal Energy company or the CFE. The acquisition, which will be part of our Pipelines & Storage business, extends Sempra's existing infrastructure footprint in Mexico, which currently includes natural gas pipelines, distribution companies, a power plant and our Energia Costa Azul LNG terminal.  The total purchase price for the acquisition of the assets from El Paso is $300 million or $260 million net of cash and debt. We expect the transaction to close midyear and to be slightly accretive to earnings this year and attribute $0.10 per share in 2011. Now the next slide please. Let me just wrap up by saying I'm pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and for the full year. I'm also proud of our accomplishments in 2009, which include the completion of a five-year construction program in our Natural Gas business and the continued progress of our major utility projects. We have decided on our approach for the remaining business at RBS-Sempra Commodities and as we exit the Trading business, the proceeds will help fund our robust capital program of $14.5 billion over the next five years and lead to strong predictable growth. We'll be giving you more detail on that capital program and our earnings projections at our upcoming conference in San Diego on March 25 and with that, let me stop, open up the call and take any questions you may have."

One, the 2010 guidance adjusts for the fact that we have a very much reduced commodities expectation in that number, and we're getting the monies or the proceeds from the sales towards the middle to the end of the year. And with 2011, we can redeploy those proceeds in some of them which will give instant earnings accretion, which is like, for instance, the share buyback. And we'll have some new investments coming online like our Mexican pipeline assets. And then also just reflective of the fact that our other businesses have fairly good growth. Our utilities are going to grow, our other businesses are going to grow and so that's all reflected in the 2011 guidance. So I think from a -- one of the things that we're showing here is yes, we are kind of resetting the bar where we're going from a move-forward position, but we're absolutely going to grow this business robustly into the future, and this is where, and this is the direction it's going to be in. It's going to be growth in things that I think our shareholders are going to appreciate, give a higher multiple to and we think it'll be a better stock."

At what point, do we think about California potentially as a regulatory environment for utilities mean reverting? It was not 10 years ago where people would have looked, maybe it's 11 or 12 years ago that people would have looked at California and said, it was the worst in the country. It's probably spent the last five or seven years at the very best in the country. Is what's happening in California as a state financially or economically the driver that over the next couple of years, maybe not sends it right back down to number 50, but mean reverts it back from being kind of the best regulatory environment in the nation?"

California like the rest of the country for the last 20 or 30 years hasn't had an energy policy. And customers have kind of swung up and down depending on the price of oil and natural gas because of that. California adopted a policy about four or five years ago to go its own way and to become less dependent upon fossil fuels and to have a higher buildout of renewables along with energy efficiency and demand side management. And that direction had support, not just from the regulators at the Commission, but also from the elected officials in Sacramento. And even today, there's no doubt that we have a tough economic climate in California. When you look at the fact that the one thing that we're blessed with in California is fairly decent weather and we don't have a large base of industrial customers. This has not been an issue. Now that doesn't mean it can't be at some point in the future, but everything today says we're going to stay the course, we're going to continue down this path we've been on for the last five or 10 years because what we want longer term is price stability in California from the energy sector.

So I think from that perspective, it's a relatively low risk, kind of perspective. And one of the reasons I cast a lot of comfort in that is as we have discussed previously, those North America Gas and Power business right now because of a relatively flat basis across the country and with the contangos that have come in lately, I think you'll find that we don't have as large in that investment in that business as we've had in the past. And so we're sitting on a fair amount of cash and we've talked about some distributions already and there's still a cushion in the business. So I don't think it would be a tough thing to do.

We've managed to a coverage ratio and when we are in a growth mode as we are currently in and building projects ahead of their cash flow, we tend to have to manage to a slightly better leverage, less leverage just to maintain our coverage ratios. And that's really where we operate now. And with that, I will say the fact that we're selling the commodity business give us a little more flexibility in our coverage ratios because our earnings are now a lot more predictable and a lot more certain.

This guidance assumes the sale of the Metals, Oil and European Energy business close by midyear and a full year earnings contribution from the Commodities joint venture of $150 million to $250 million. Now let me hand it over to Mark, so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results, beginning with Slide 4."

At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the fourth quarter were $67 million compared with earnings of $81 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to $9 million of reduced incentive awards and $4 million of higher wildfire-related insurance expense in the fourth quarter of 2009. Full year 2009 earnings increased to $344 million from $339 million in the previous year. At Southern California Gas, fourth quarter 2009 earnings were $75 million, up from $54 million in the fourth quarter of '08. The increase was due to $10 million of higher margin and $7 million of lower litigation expense in the fourth quarter of '09. For the full year 2009, SoCal earnings was up $273 million, up from $244 million in 2008. The 12% increase in earnings for the year was due to continued strong operating performance. Now let's go to Slide 5. Sempra Commodities' earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $71 million compared to $164 million in last year's fourth quarter. The last quarter of 2008 benefited from great performance across all of our product lines. This year, the business performed modestly in the fourth quarter of 2009. It was led by oil and metals. Power also performed well but results in the gas book were weak, due to low volatility and a flat basis differentials during the final quarter of the year. The quarter was also impacted by retention costs and higher foreign taxes within the joint venture. For the full year 2009, commodity earnings of $345 million were in line with '08 results. Now let's move to Slide 6. Here, we show how income is allocated at the joint venture for the last quarter and for the full year of 2009. A couple of highlights: First, the joint venture had income of $28 million during the quarter. After applying the income allocation methodology, the distributable income to Sempra was $24 million. After adjusting to U.S. GAAP and for the impact of taxes, Sempra's joint venture income for the quarter was $74 million, that's down from $162 million in the same quarter in '08. For the year, the joint venture had distributable income of $407 million, and Sempra's after-tax share was $352 million. The U.S. GAAP conversion adjustment of $55 million for the quarter and $163 million for the year is primarily the recognition of storage and transportation earnings from 2008 that could not be recognized under U.S. GAAP until 2009. Now let's move to Slide 7. Fourth quarter earnings for our Generation business were $43 million compared with $60 million in the same quarter in '08. The decrease for the quarter is primarily the result of $16 million of Mexican income tax benefits in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year 2009, the Generation business recorded earnings of $162 million compared to $222 million in the prior year. The decrease was due to $31 million in reduced earnings due to lower gas prices in '09, the Mexican tax benefit in 2008 that I just mentioned and $9 million of solar investment tax credits in 2008. Now let's move to Slide 8. Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $37 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. That's up from earnings of $22 million in the same quarter of 2008. Fourth quarter 2009 results include $5 million of higher earnings from natural gas operations in Mexico, $5 million of higher earnings from investments in South America and $2 million of higher earnings from domestic pipeline and storage assets. For the full year, 2009 earnings were $101 million compared to $106 million in 2008. The decrease was due to a $64 million write-off related to the Liberty Gas Storage project. The write-off was largely offset by $29 million in higher earnings from North American operations, $13 million of favorable tax benefits in 2009 compared with $9 million of unfavorable tax adjustments in 2008 and $8 million of higher earnings from South American investments during 2009.Now please turn to Slide 9. This slide provides a summary of our business unit results. I'd like to highlight a couple of things here. Sempra LNG had earnings of $35 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with a loss of $13 million in the prior year's period. The increase for the quarter was primarily due to the startup of marketing and terminal operations. I point out that the fourth quarter of 2009 was the first full quarter that we received revenue from all of our long-term contracts. For the full year 2009, Sempra LNG recorded earnings of $16 million compared with a loss of $46 million in 2008. For 2010, we expect the annual earnings to be in the range of $70 million to $90 million. At Parent & Other, we recorded a loss of $40 million in the fourth quarter compared with a loss of $49 million in the same quarter in '08. For the full year 2009, the Parent recorded a loss of $122 million compared to a loss of $97 million in 2008. This increase is primarily due to increased interest expense.Please turn to Slide 10. Overall, our results for the quarter and for the year were very strong. Earnings at our California utilities were up a combined 6% for the full year. Operating cash flow during 2009 was up 57% over the prior year. And from a liquidity perspective, we still have $3.6 billion availability under our committed bank lines at the end of the year. And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Don, who will begin with Slide 11."

Now let me update you on our business activities starting with our Commodities joint venture. Last week, we and RBS announced an agreement to sell the Metals, Oil and European Energy segments of RBS Sempra Commodities to JPMorgan for an expected $1.7 billion. Sempra's share of the proceeds is expected to be $941 million. We also expect to distribute approximately $500 million of excess cash in the business, of which Sempra would receive half. Please go to Slide 12.  Last week, I commented that we were still exploring options related to the remaining North American Gas and Power business. These options included selling the remaining business or finding a new partner or other relationship to provide liquidity and financial support that would cap our exposure to the business and allow us to reacquire RBS' share without issuing equity. We have continued to explore several options for a third-party support, but in this market, we no longer believe we can find a cost-effective, long-term alternative to equity. Because of this, a sale of the business is now our preferred outcome. We have several interested parties and believe a transaction can be completed quickly and in a fashion that delivers the best result for our shareholders. Please go to the next slide.  In a sale, we anticipate receiving 49% of the remaining book value, which equates to approximately $800 million plus a premium. This assumes all the previously discussed distributions have been made. The combination of the sale to JPMorgan, the subsequent cash distribution and the expected proceeds from the sale of a North American Natural Gas and Power business should mean total cash proceeds to Sempra in the neighborhood of $2 billion or more. Please go to Slide 14.  We plan to use these proceeds to fund new growth, reduce debt, and upon an exit of the business, a share repurchase. If you assume we complete our exit of the business before year end, and we earned $150 million to $250 million in the Commodity business in 2010, we would expect our earnings for 2010 to be between $4.25 and $4.50 per share. For 2011, assuming we repurchased $500 million to $1 billion in equity before the start of the year, and given the growth in our Utility and Infrastructure businesses, we expect to earn between $4.35 and $4.65 per share in 2011. Now go to Slide 15 please.  What I'd like to do now is update you on the activities at our California utilities. Our largest project, the Sunrise Powerlink transmission line, is scheduled to be in service in the second half of 2012. We're awaiting the final approval from the US Forest Service, which we expect to receive in the next couple of months. A number of activities are underway to support the start of construction later this year. We placed orders for key components, including towers and underground cable and are now focused on completing the construction agreements and acquiring land rights. Turning to our Smart Meters programs, at SDG&E, we're well underway with the installation of Smart Meters and have now installed almost 600,000. The Meters are being installed at a rate out about 7,000 per day. We expect to have 1.4 million meters installed by year end and to complete installation of all 2.3 million gas and electric meters by year end 2011.At SoCalGas, proposed and alternate [alternate proposed] decisions were issued earlier this month by the CPUC on our proposed gas Smart Meter project.This is a $900 million capital project that involves installing $6 million gas Smart Meters in phases from 2012 to year end 2017. While the proposed decision issued by the administrative law judge didn't support the project, the alternate decision issued by the assigned commissioner in the proceeding recommended approval, provided certain conditions are met. We think this is a workable outcome, and we look forward to receiving a final decision from the commission by mid-year. At San Diego Gas & Electric, the CPUC recently approved our request to defer the next cost of capital proceeding by two years. We were originally scheduled to file a cost of capital application with the commission this year, but will now file in 2012. The cost of capital would be effective in 2013. SDG&E's current CPUC authorized return on equity is 11.1%.Before moving on, I'd like to update you on SDG&E's litigation regarding the 2007 wildfires. After considering the amounts incurred for homeowner settlements, additional reserves and estimated defense cost, SDG&E's remaining insurance coverage is approximately $20 million. Although additional cost necessary to resolve the remaining claims are likely to exceed the remaining insurance, the ultimate economic impact will be determined after taking to account amounts we expect to recover from other potentially responsible parties, including Cox Communication, an amount SDG&E will file to recover in rates. SDG&E's rate recovery mechanisms, along with regulatory treatment of previously incurred large and unusual costs, such as environmental liabilities and the court's application of the strict liability standard to these fire-related damages, all support cost recovery. From an accounting perspective, the timing and our ability to accrue recovery for these costs, either from utility customers or other third parties, may vary from the time the cost is known and recordable, and the time of our payment and subsequent recovery. While this may have an effect on our reported results and cash flows, we expect to recover the vast majority of these costs. Please now go to Slide 16. At Sempra Generation, we have now began construction on our Copper Mountain Solar project in Boulder City, Nevada. This project is a 48-megawatt expansion of the existing 10-megawatt El Dorado Solar facility. The power generated by this expansion will be sold under a 20-year contract to PG&E. We'll bring this project online in phases and expect to complete construction later this year. Also last year, Sempra Generation acquired a 50% interest in the Fowler Ridge II Wind Farm located in Indiana. Legal partners there with DP [ph](27:38) in those 200-megawatt project, which began operations in December. Moving to our LNG business unit, we have completed construction on a $125 million nitrogen-injection plant at our Energia Costa Azul terminal. This project became operational in December and provides us with another source of contracted revenue. At our Cameron LNG terminal in Louisiana, we've received two spot cargoes from RasGas, one in the fourth quarter of last year, and one so far in this quarter. The U.S. is seeing an increase in LNG flows and were optimistic about receiving additional cargoes this year from Cutter under our agreement with RasGas. Both of our LNG terminals are supported by 20-year contracts that represent nearly 65% of their total capacity. At our Pipelines & Storage business, the Rockies Express Pipeline project was completed in November and is now fully operational. And in our natural gas storage development program in the Gulf Coast region, we expect to bring an additional $12.5 billion cubic feet of storage capacity online by the end of this year at our Bay Gas and Mississippi Hub facilities. Now please go to Slide 17. Yesterday, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire El Paso's pipelines in Mexico. We'll acquire interest in two natural gas pipelines connected to the U.S., a natural gas pipeline connected to PEMEX system in Northern Mexico and a propane pipeline near Monterey. Three of the four assets are co-owned with PEMEX in a 50/50 joint venture and one will be wholly owned by us. The Mexican government has announced its desire for our new partner, PEMEX, to dispose of their ownership interest in these assets. PEMEX will hold an open auction to facilitate the sale, which is subject to our right of first refusal. PEMEX long-term contracts to utilize these pipeline capacities will remain unchanged. The assets are all in operation and provide stable revenue streams under long-term contracts, representing a weighted average length of 13 years with PEMEX and the Mexican federal energy company, or the CFE. The acquisition, which will be part of our Pipelines & Storage business, extends Sempra's existing infrastructure footprint in Mexico, which currently includes natural gas pipelines, distribution companies, a power plant and our Energia Costa Azul LNG terminal. The total purchase price for the acquisition of the assets from El Paso is $300 million or $260 million net of cash and debt. We expect the transaction to close midyear and to be slightly accretive to earnings this year and contribute $0.10 per share in 2011. Now the next slide please. Let me just wrap up by saying I'm pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and for the full year. I'm also proud of our accomplishments in 2009, which include the completion of a five-year construction program in our Natural Gas business and the continued progress of our major utility projects. We have decided on our approach for the remaining business at RBS Sempra Commodities. And as we exit the Trading business, the proceeds will help fund our robust capital program of $14.5 billion over the next five years and lead to strong predictable growth. We'll be giving you more detail on that capital program and on our earnings projections at our upcoming conference in San Diego on March 25. And with that, let me stop, open up the call and take any questions you may have."

The state of California is having pretty difficult financial time right now. I mean, I think even in the last 24 hours, there was some news flow about bond issuances. At what point, do we think about California potentially as a regulatory environment for utilities mean reverting? It was not 10 years ago where people would have looked, maybe it's 11 or 12 years ago that people would have looked at California and said, it was the worst in the country. It's probably spent the last five or seven years at the very best in the country. Is what's happening in California as a state financially or economically the driver that over the next couple of years, maybe not sends it right back down to number 50, but mean reverts it back from being kind of the best regulatory environment in the nation?"

California like the rest of the country for the last 20 or 30 years hasn't had an energy policy. And customers have kind of swung up and down depending on the price of oil and natural gas because of that. California adopted a policy about four or five years ago to go its own way and to become less dependent upon fossil fuels and to have a higher buildout of renewables along with energy efficiency and demand side management. And that direction had support, not just from the regulators at the Commission, but also from the elected officials in Sacramento. And even today, there's no doubt that we have a tough economic climate in California. When you look at the fact that the one thing that we're blessed with in California is fairly decent weather and we don't have a large base of industrial customers. This has not been an issue. Now that doesn't mean it can't be at some point in the future, but everything today says we're going to stay the course, we're going to continue down this path we've been on for the last five or 10 years because what we want longer term is price stability in California from the energy sector.

So I think from that perspective, it's a relatively low risk, kind of perspective. And one of the reasons I cast a lot of comfort in that is as we have discussed previously, those North America Gas and Power business right now because of a relatively flat basis across the country and with the contangos that have come in lately, I think you'll find that we don't have as large in that investment in that business as we've had in the past. And so we're sitting on a fair amount of cash and we've talked about some distributions already and there's still a cushion in the business. So I don't think it would be a tough thing to do.

And so when you average the two, we still kind of come out around 50-50. And to be honest, really, we frankly don't manage to a capital structure from that perspective. We've managed to a coverage ratio and when we are in a growth mode as we are currently in and building projects ahead of their cash flow, we tend to have to manage to a slightly better leverage, less leverage just to maintain our coverage ratios. And that's really where we operate now. And with that, I will say the fact that we're selling the commodity business give us a little more flexibility in our coverage ratios because our earnings are now a lot more predictable and a lot more certain.

And again, thank you all for joining us. On today's call, I would like to accomplish several things. First review with you our first quarter financial results, then give you an operational update on our utilities and infrastructure businesses. Before I get into our financial results, I would like to spend a moment on the litigation settlement we announced last week.
I realize that some of you may have been surprised by this but I strongly believe the settlement was the best solution to put to rest litigation that has gone on for nearly a decade and could have continued for years to come. I'll discuss the settlement in more detail later in the call.
Now to the financial results. Earlier this morning we reported first quarter earnings of $106 million, or $0.42 per share, compared with $316 million, or $1.29 per share in the same period last year. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to $ 96 million or $0.38 per share impact of the litigation settlement and reduced results from the RBS Sempra Commodities joint venture. Earnings, excluding the settlement amount were $202 million or $0.81 per share. Due to the impact of the litigation settlements and assuming break-even performance at RBS Sempra Commodities, we now expect earnings of $3.15 to $3.40 per share in 2010.
Now, let me hand it over to Mark so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results beginning with slide 4.

At San Diego gas and electric, earnings for the first quarter were $83 million, compared with earnings of $99 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to $5 million of higher wildfire insurance premiums and a $3 million charge due to the elimination of a tax benefit that was associated with the recent passage of the healthcare bill.
The first quarter of 2009 benefited $5 million from the favorable resolution of a litigation matter. During the first quarter, STG&E recorded a $107 million regulatory asset relating to reserves for wildfire claims that exceeded our $1.1 billion of insurance. We believe that STG&E will ultimately recover substantially all wildfire costs in excess of its insurance limits.
There are codefendants in the litigation and other responsible parties that STG&E has a claim against. In addition, based on our regulatory experience, we believe STG&E will be able to recover substantially all wildfire related costs that exceed our coverage and are not recovered from other responsible parties.
At Southern California gas, first quarter 2010 earnings were $65 million, up from $59 million in the first quarter of 2009. The increase was due to $9 million of higher margin, $3 million of higher regulatory awards and $2 million of lower bad debt expense. These benefits were offset by a $13 million charge due to the passage of the healthcare bill.
Now let's go to slide 5. Our generation business recorded a loss of $53 million in the first quarter, compared with earnings of $43 million in the same quarter in 2009. The decrease for the quarter is primarily the result of an $84 million charge related to the energy crisis litigation settlement. The quarter was also impacted by $12 million of lower earnings from operations, primarily due to increased scheduled maintenance and associated downtime.
Now, please move to slide 6. Sempra pipeline and storage recorded earnings of $38 million in the first quarter of 2010, up from earnings of $37 million in the same quarter of 2009. The quarter benefited from $6 million of higher earnings from foreign currency exchange rate effects, offset by $4 million of lower earnings from its storage operations.
Now turn to slide 7. Sempra LNG had earnings of $32 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared with a loss of $7 million in the prior year's period. The increase for the quarter was primarily due to the start up of marketing and terminal operations. We also benefited in the quarter from $11 million of payments related to non delivery of cargoes and from $7 million of mark to market earnings.
Let's move to slide 8. Sempra Commodities recorded a loss of $5 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to earnings of $114 million in the last year's first quarter. The loss was due primarily to reduced margins in oil in European natural gas marketing, as well as higher costs for employer retention and a $12 million charge related to the energy crisis litigation settlement. Just in the last few days, we received $197 million cash distribution from the joint venture related to 2009 earnings. This distribution will be reflected in our second quarter results.
Now let's move to slide 9. This slide provides a summary of our business unit results. I would like to highlight our results at Parent & Other where we recorded a loss of $54 million in the first quarter, compared with a loss of $29 million in the same quarter in 2009. The increase in loss is primarily due to the impact of $17 million of higher Mexican taxes. The quarter was also impacted by a higher consolidated tax adjustment and additional interest expense.
And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Don who will begin with slide 10.

Before I get into an update on our business activities, I want to provide some additional color on the energy crisis litigation settlement we announced last week. The $410 million settlement ends two main pieces of litigation, each of which",1116,"Thanks, Mark. Before I get into an update on our business activities, I want to provide some additional color on the energy crisis litigation settlement we announced last week. The $410 million settlement ends two main pieces of litigation, each of which is funded separately.
$260 million will be funded from RBS Sempra Commodities and $150 million from Sempra Energy and Sempra Generation. The after tax cash effect to Sempra is $96 million. This settlement ends the FERC refund proceeding. As many of you may recall, this proceeding relates to the FERC's formulaic adjustment of market prices for short term energy sales in the years 2000 and 2001.
The settlement also ends the litigation related to Sempra Generation's contract with the California department of water resources. Although we have successfully defended this contract numerous times, this settlement will put an end to the continued litigation, appeals, and arbitrations.
As many of you know, we've been dealing with energy price litigation for nearly a decade. This settlement gives us the opportunity to put to an end this litigation which could have continued for many more years and had unforeseen risk. We can now move to a more constructive relationship with all of the California parties.
And, with that, I'll have you go to slide 11. Let me now update you on the activities at our California utilities. We still expect the Sunrise Powerlink transmission line to be in service in the second half of 2012. We're awaiting the final approval from the U.S. forest service which is expected to this quarter. Procurement and (inaudible) work still continue. We have now locked in half of the material and roughly 80% of the construction costs.
Turning to our Smart-Meter Programs, at STG&E, we have now installed more than 800,000 meters and we expect to have all 2.3 million gas and electric meters installed by year end 2011. At SoCalGas, in April, our $900 million gas smart meter project was approved. We will be installing 6 million smart gas meters in phases from 2012 to 2017.
The CPUC approved our $900 million gas Smart-Meter project and we will be installing in 6 million gas smart-meters in phases from 2012 to year end 2017. At San Diego Gas & Electric and SoCalGas, we will be filing our applications for both utilities 2012, general rate cases in the second half of this year. The CPUC rate case plan calls for decision by year-end 2011.
Now please go to slide 12. At Sempra Generation, we've began construction on our Copper Mountain solar project in Boulder City, Nevada. This project is a 47 megawatt expansion of existing 10 megawatt El Dorado solar facility. The power generated by this expansion will be sold under a 20 year contract to PG&E. We'll bring the project online in phases and expect to complete construction by the end of this year or at the very latest, very early in 2011.
Moving to our LNG business unit, we have recently announced a supply agreement with Gazprom. Under this multiyear agreement, Gazprom will play Sempra LNG for the right to deliver up to two LNG cargoes per month at the Cameron LNG terminal at a predetermined price formula. This agreement will commence in June of this year.
This agreement, along with our previously announced RasGas arrangement will utilize available capacity at our Cameron LNG terminal. These two agreements are in addition to our 20 year contracts that account for nearly 65% of our combined LNG total capacity.
At our pipelines and storage business, we have now closed on our acquisition of El Paso's pipeline and gas infrastructure assets for $300 million, or $260 million net of cash and debt. The acquisition includes a natural gas pipeline and compression assets in the Mexican state of Sonora and a 50% interest in a joint venture with PMEX, a Mexican state-owned oil company. The joint venture operates two natural gas pipelines and a propane system in Northern Mexico.
PMEX has filed a plan with the Mexican government to dispose of their 50% ownership in the joint venture. Any sale is subject to our right of first refusal. PMEX's long term contracts to utilize the pipelines capacity will remain unchanged. The assets are all in operation and provide stable revenue streams under long term contracts, representing a weighted average length of 13 years with PMEX and the Mexican federal electricity company.
In early April, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit the Mexicali region of Northern Baja, Mexico. Our pipeline, LNG and power plants located in that area did not suffer any major damage. Our Mexicali power plant has been out of service since that time, waiting for replacement parts for some relatively inexpensive, but critical equipment that was damaged during the quake. We expect the plant to be back in service later this month.
Before we move on, I would like to update you on the progress of our sales process at RBS Sempra Commodities. We are moving forward in obtaining the necessary approvals for the sale of our metals, oil, and European energy segments to JPMorgan. We anticipate the closing of this estimated $1.7 billion transaction early in the second half of this year. The closing was delayed several weeks because of the inability to schedule meetings with European Union regulatory officials due to a volcanic ash situation that impacted travel and business throughout Europe.
Negotiations for the sale of our North American Power and Gas segments are moving forward as well. We have narrowed the list of successful bidders through a second round of offers and expect to announce a buyer within the next four to six weeks. Our assumption of break even earnings for the joint venture, prior to a sale has not changed our expectations that total proceeds to Sempra Energy from both transactions will be approximately $2 billion.
Now please go to the next slide. While the results for the quarter at our Commodities joint venture were disappointing, our core utility and infrastructure businesses continue to perform well. This year, we have settled major litigation and reduced risk to our shareholders. We're moving forward with major projects at the utilities. Our recent approval of the SoCalGas Smart-Meter program and the progress we've made for the construction of Sunrise Powerlink are very positive.
At our infrastructure businesses, we're focused on the continued development of our storage and solar projects and we're making progress with the completion of the sale transaction RBS Sempra Commodities. The proceeds from those transactions will help fund our robust capital program, facilitate our expected share repurchase program and lead to strong predictable growth.
With that, let me stop now and take any questions that you may have.

So we don't expect any holdup. We're still waiting for approval. We firmly believe we're going to get it, just can't pinpoint the week.

Now to the financial results, earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $222 million or $0.89 per share compared with $198 million or $0.80 per share in the same period last year. All of our core operating businesses performed well in the quarter. We have also announced that we'll begin a $500 million share repurchase later in the quarter.

At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the second quarter were $75 million compared with earnings of $70 million in the year ago quarter. For the first six months of 2010, SDG&E's earnings were $158 million, compared with $169 million last",754,"Thanks, Don. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the second quarter were $75 million compared with earnings of $70 million in the year ago quarter. For the first six months of 2010, SDG&E's earnings were $158 million, compared with $169 million last year. The decrease was primarily due to $11 million of higher liability insurance premiums for wildfire coverage.
At Southern California Gas, the second quarter 2010 earnings were $69 million that's up from $65 million in the second quarter of 2009. For the first half of 2010, SoCalGas's earnings were $134 million, up from $124 million in 2009. The increase was due to improved operating results and a lower effective tax rate on operations that’s offset by $13 million tax charge recorded in the first quarter due to the passage of the healthcare bill.
Now, let's go to slide five. Our Generation business recorded earnings of $48 million in the second quarter, compared with earnings of $33 million in the same quarter of 2009. The increase for the quarter is primarily the result of renewable energy credits from new projects, partially offset by lower earnings due to scheduled plant maintenance on two power plants and from expenditures related to earthquake damage at our Mexicali power plant in Baja, California.
For the first six months of the year, Generation recorded a loss of $5 million compared with earnings of $76 million in the same period in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to an $85 million charge related to a proposed energy crisis litigation settlement. Now, please move to slide six.
Sempra Pipelines and Storage recorded earnings of $39 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared with the loss of $27 million in the same quarter of 2009. The current quarter included $5 million of earnings from the El Paso Pipeline acquisition, which was completed at the end of April. Last year's loss was primarily due to a $64 million asset write-off at our Liberty Gas storage project.
Now turn to slide seven. Sempra LNG had earnings of $13 million in the second quarter of 2010. That compares with the loss of $12 million in the prior year's period. The increase for the quarter was primarily due to higher earnings from operations. You will recall that the Cameron LNG facility became operational and our supply contract with Tangguh Partners for the Energia Costa Azul LNG facility became effective in the second half of 2009.
For the first six months of 2010, Sempra LNG had earnings of $45 million up from a loss of $19 million in 2009. 2010 results benefited from $11 million of earnings recorded in the first quarter related to payment for non-delivery of cargoes.
Now, let's move to slide eight. Sempra Commodities broke even in the second quarter of 2010, compared with earnings of $85 million in last year's second quarter, due primarily to lower results in crude oil, oil products and natural gas, as well as higher costs for employee retention. The breakeven performance during the quarter was consistent with our expectations and is not expected to improve significantly prior to the completion of the joint venture sales process.
Now let’s move to slide nine. Here I’d like to address our progress with the sale of RBS Sempra Commodities joint venture. We concluded the sale of the metals, oil and European gas and power business to J.P. Morgan, which provided Sempra with roughly $1 billion in proceeds, including distributions of earnings related to the sold businesses.
I’ll touch on the remaining JV sales elements in a moment, but given the positive conclusion to the J.P. Morgan transaction, we will be moving up our share buyback plans, and we will begin a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program later this quarter.
As a reminder, there are two segments of our remaining businesses, the North American Gas and Power business and Solutions, our retail marketing business. We are still in active negotiations for these businesses and are on track to sell both. We currently expect to be able to announce something before the end of next month. We recognize this process has taken longer than we expected. This was due in part to the uncertainty around the Financial Reform Legislation coupled with a flat trading and the weak gaps in power markets. Once we finalize the sales process, we will address how and when we intend to deploy the remaining sales proceeds.
And with that, I will turn it back over to Don who will begin with slide 10.

Now let me update you on activities at our California utilities. Last month, San Diego Gas & Electric received approval from the U.S. Forest Service for the Sunrise Powerlink transmission line. Now, that all major approvals have been received",669,"Thanks Mark. Now let me update you on activities at our California utilities. Last month, San Diego Gas & Electric received approval from the U.S. Forest Service for the Sunrise Powerlink transmission line. Now, that all major approvals have been received so we are moving forward with construction on this $1.9 billion project. When completed in the second half of 2012, the 500 kilovolt line will have the capacity to carry 1,000 megawatts of clean, reliable energy.
Turning to our smart meter program at SDG&E, we have now installed more than 1.2 million meters. We have remained on schedule to have all 2.3 million Gas & Electric meter installations completed by the end of next year. Also at SDG&E, we recently filed an application for a $600 million tax equity investment in a proposed 309 megawatt wind farm in Montana. SDG&E had a previously approved power purchase agreement with this project. Financing for the renewable projects is difficult in this economy, and this investment by SDG&E will make this project a reality while providing cost-effective renewable energy to our customers and utility type returns to our investors.
Finally at SDG&E and SoCalGas, we will be filing our applications for both utilities 2012 General Rate Cases later this year. The first step will be the filing of a Notice of Intent this month followed by a final rate case application in the fourth quarter of this year. The CPUCs rate-case plan calls for decisions by the end of next year.
Now, let's go to slide 11. At Sempra Generation, construction continues on our Copper Mountain Solar project. This 48-megawatt project is adjacent to our existing 10 megawatt El Dorado solar facility. The power generated will be sold under a 20-year contract to PG&E. We energize the first block of power in June and currently have 18 megawatts in service. We’ll continue to bring this project online in phases to the end of this year.
Following the April earthquake in Baja, California, Sempra Generation’s Mexicali power plant was out of service for several weeks for inspections and repair of some relatively inexpensive but critical equipment that was damaged during the quake. The repairs were completed ahead of schedule and the plant is now back in service.
At our Pipelines & Storage business, we closed in our acquisition of the Mexican pipeline and gas infrastructure assets from El Paso during the second quarter and our natural gas storage development program, remains on track. We'll bring the first 7.5 billion cubic feet of storage online at Mississippi Hub later this quarter.
At our Bay Gas facility, we expect to put an additional 5 billion cubic feet of storage into service by year end. In total, we expect to have 24 billion cubic feet of storage capacity in service by the end of the year at these two facilities. Now, please go to the final slide.
I'm very pleased with the solid operating results of our core businesses for both the quarter and year-to-date. Last month, two milestones were reached. We received the final major regulatory approval required to move forward with the construction on the Sunrise Powerlink transition line and with this approval, over $3 million of key infrastructure projects at our utilities have been approved, all of which help to solidify the earnings growth projections in our plan.
And we close the sale of RBS Sempra Commodities metals, oil and European gas and power business to J.P. Morgan. This transaction enables us to begin a share repurchase program of $500 million. We continue to work to complete the remaining sales process for the Commodities joint venture and we'll update on you our progress.
And as we discuss with you at the analyst conference earlier this year, we have a number of attractive projects in our development pipeline. We look forward to sharing our progress in the weeks and months ahead on a few of these projects.
And with that, let me stop, open up the call and take any questions you have.

So, remember in the State of California that the Regulatory Commission is its own statutory entity removed from the legislative branch of government. And every signal we get from the Utility Commission, and even from some of the politicians in Sacramento, is that California is doing the right things to avert another energy crisis that took place back in the early part of this decade and so the things that we're doing to build out infrastructure and put in smart meters, to develop renewables and get in the market are all the things that are being pushed at us from both Sacramento and from the utility commission in San Francisco.

But what we're talking about is the 300 megawatt investment. The tax equity at $600 million represents about three quarters of the total cost of it and in the structure that we proposed; SDG&E would make that $600 million tax equity investment and would earn a rate of return on that investment, just like any other utility and investment.
Now, the ratepayers, obviously, have to get a benefit from this and under the structure that’s been proposed, the ratepayers would get a benefit including the tax benefits associated with the renewables and including renewable attributes at a cost of less than what they would have to pay otherwise, because, generally, the power here is going to be cheaper. So this is a very good project, it brings the renewables to the ratepayers less expensively than if SDG&E just went out and contracted but also allows SDG&E to earn a rate of return and now that the general economic state of affairs that allows this to happen is that the rate of return, the tax equity investors are requiring in today's market is considerably in excess of what SDG&E's return would be. So in effect, what we’re able to do is ask that kind of benefit along to our ratepayers.

It’s important to note that all the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Don, who’ll begin with slide #3.

First, review with your our third quarter financial results. We’ll then update you on our exit from the RBS Commodities joint venture, and also discuss some items that may impact our 2011 outlook, and then finally I’ll give you an operational update on our utilities and infrastructure business.
Now to the financial results; earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $131 million or $0.53 per share compared with $372 million or $1.27 per share in the same period last year.
The third quarter results included an after-tax charge of $139 million from the previously announced write-down of our investment in the RBS Sempra Commodities joint venture. Excluding Sempra Commodities, quarterly earnings increased by 10% over the prior year.
Our core businesses continue to perform well, and we are on track to meet our 2010 earnings guidance per share of $3.15 to $3.35 per share excluding the results from Commodities.
I’d also like to mention that we are now in the final stage of exit from our Commodities joint venture. We and RBS agreed to sell the principal assets of the business in three separate transactions. Two of which have already closed. The final sale should close next month and at that time it will essentially be about of a trading business. This was a key goal for us this year.
I’ll remind you that we have a $500 million share repurchase program underway. We were able to start the buyback earlier than anticipated and have already received a large portion of the shares to be retired under the program.
We have said that once we complete this initial $500 million share repurchase and complete our exit from the Commodities joint venture that we would evaluate an additional share repurchase.
Over the course of the past few months, we had the opportunity to hear from new investors about their preferred outcome of an additional share repurchase versus a dividend increase or some combination of the two.
Over the next few months we will complete an annual review of our business with our Board of Directors. As part of this normal planning process, we will evaluate several things including our capital program, earnings growth, credit statistics, dividend payout, and federal tax policy. When completed in the first quarter we will announce any additional share repurchases or changes in our dividend policy at that time.
Now let me turn it back over to Mark, so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results beginning with slide four.

At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the third quarter were $106 million compared with earnings of $108 million in the year ago quarter. For the first nine months of 2010, SDG&E’s earnings were $264 million compared with $277 million l",1122,"Thanks, Don. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the third quarter were $106 million compared with earnings of $108 million in the year ago quarter. For the first nine months of 2010, SDG&E’s earnings were $264 million compared with $277 million last year. The year-to-date results include $16 million of higher wildfire insurance premiums.
At Southern California Gas, third quarter 2010 earnings were $78 million, up from $74 million in the third quarter of 2009. For the first nine months of 2010, earnings for this business were $212 million, up from $198 million in 2009.
The increase was primarily due to improved operating results and a lower effective tax rate on operations, offset by a $13 million tax charge recorded in the first quarter that was due to the passage of the healthcare bill
Now let’s go to slide #5. Our Generation business recorded earnings of $56 million in the third quarter compared with earnings of $43 million in the same quarter 2009. The increase for the quarter is primarily the result of renewable energy credits from the Copper Mountain Solar project.
Generation also benefited from mark to market gains which were offset by $9 million of lower earnings from operations of our natural gas fired power plants.
For the first nine months of the year, Generation recorded earnings of $51 million compared with earnings of $119 million in the same period of 2009. The decrease was primarily due to $86 million of litigation expense this year related to the settlement of the energy crisis litigation.
Now please move to slide #6, Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $43 million in the third quarter of 2010 compared with earnings of $54 million in the same quarter of 2009. The current quarter included $48 million in proceeds from the legal settlement, less the related $17 million tax charge and a $24 million write-down of our investment in Argentina. The third quarter of 2009 included a $15 million benefit from the resolution of prior year’s tax issues.
For the first nine months of the year, Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $120 million compared with earnings of $64 million in the same period in 2009. The increase is primarily due to a $64 million write-off of our Liberty Storage assets last year, as well as the other factors I just mentioned.
Now please turn to slide #7, Sempra LNG had earnings of $5 million in the third quarter of 2010 compared with breakeven earnings in the prior year’s period. The increase for the quarter was primarily due to higher earnings from operations. You’ll recall that our Cameron LNG facility became operational and our supply contract with the Tangguh Partners for Energía Costa Azul LNG facility became effective in the second half of 2009.
For the first nine months of 2010, Sempra LNG had earnings of $50 million, up from a loss of $19 million in 2009. Despite the year-over-year improvement, the results this quarter were lower than expected. The quarter was impacted by three items.
Lower natural gas prices, a reduction in the carrying value of inventory, and mark to market adjustments totaling $5 million, and legal and legal and tax items that negatively impacted the quarter by $4 million. At current gas prices, we would expect the earnings from this business to be about $12 million to $15 million per quarter.
Now let’s move to slide #8, since our last earnings call, we and RBS announced two transactions to sell the remaining principal assets of the RBS Sempra Commodities joint venture. The sale of the retail marketing business to Noble Group and the sale of North American gas and power assets to JP Morgan.
The sale of the retail businesses closed last week and we expect the sale of the North American gas and power assets to close next month. You’ll recall that we already received $1 billion from the sale of the oil, metals and European energy businesses.
We expect that Sempra will receive $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion in proceeds from the exit of the joint venture after taking into consideration ongoing costs related to the sale. As I’ve said, we’ve already collected a large portion of the proceeds and the remainder of the collections will extend into next year, and with that we are now effectively out of the trading business.
Please turn to the next slide. We recently replaced our revolving credit facilities with new four-year facilities. These new lines expire in October of 2014, and replace the lines that were set to expire in August of next year. We have a total of $3 billion of lines at Sempra as well as a combined $800 million line for San Diego Gas & Electric and SoCalGas.
Now I’ll change gears and talk about our outlook for the year. In March of this year, we provided guidance for 2011 of $4.35 and $4.65 per share. We’ll update that guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in February, but as we look out into the next year we are seeing some pressures on our 2011 outlook that I’d like to comment on.
There are three primary drivers that may negatively impact earnings next year. As I mentioned when I talked about LNG’s results, we are in a much lower natural gas price environment. The solar price for 2011 is currently about $2 lower than what our plan was based upon. Its impact for LNG and generation businesses is at the pricing of key contracts.
Next you’ll recall that the guidance we gave you assumed that Sempra Pipelines & Storage would acquire the other half of our pipeline joint venture in Mexico from our partner there, but we now don’t expect this to happen as we have planned.
Finally we have a shift in the timing of the 150 megawatts Mesquite Solar project at Sempra Generation. Our existing guidance had assumed the project will be substantially complete by the end of 2011, but we now expect the project to be complete in early 2013. While 2011 earnings will be lower due to the (inaudible), earnings will move into 2012 and 2013.
Now while there are positives that could offset some of these pressures, we currently believe that the net effect to our 2011 outlook could be a reduction to earnings per share of approximately $0.35 to $0.45.
Again we’ll provide more complete guidance for 2011 on our fourth quarter earnings call and while we still will grow our earnings per share at a double digit rate next year, from what we’re seeing now the outlook is lower than our prior guidance.
With that, I’d like to turn it to back over to Don, who will begin with slide #10.

Now let me update you on activities at our Californian utilities. At San Diego Gas & Electric, construction is underway on the Sunrise Powerlink.

At San Diego Gas & Electric, construction is underway on the Sunrise Powerlink. We are on track to complete this project in the second half of 2012.
Turning to our smart meter program at SDG&E, we’ve now installed more than 1.6 million meters and remain on schedule to essentially complete the installations by year end 2011.
Finally, at SDG&E and SoCalGas, we would be filing full applications for both the utilities 2012 general rate cases next month. The CPUC’s rate case plan calls for decisions by year end 2011.
Now go to slide #11, if you would, at Sempra Generation, construction continues in Nevada on our 48 megawatt Copper Mountain Solar project. We currently have 38 megawatts in operation and expect to complete the project by the end of this year. The power generated by this project is sold under a 20-year contract to Pacific Gas & Electric.
We also continued to advance our Mesquite Solar project. This project is located in our Mesquite natural gas fired plant outside Phoenix, where we have in our plans to ultimately develop about 600 megawatts of solar generating capacity.
Last month we announced an agreement to sell the power produced by the first 150 megawatt phase of the project to PG&E under a 20-year contract. We now plan to start construction next year and to complete all 150 megawatts by early 2013.
In addition to these new solar projects, last week we announced an investment in a new 250 megawatt wind project located in Northern Colorado called Cedar Creek II. This project is a 50/50 partnership with BP Wind Energy, and is already under construction and is our second wind project with BP.
The power produced by the facility will be sold under a 25-year power purchase agreement with the Public Service of Colorado and operations are expected to commence mid-2011.
At our Pipelines & Storage business, we recently added roughly 12 billion cubic feet of operating storage capacity at our Mississippi Hub and Bay Gas storage facilities, and our storage build out program continues to move forward. In total, about 85% of the storage capacity we have in service is contracted forward.
Now move to the final slide if you would. In summary, I am very pleased with the solid operating results of our core businesses for both the quarter and year-to-date.
I also want to remind you that here in California, we continue to see broad support for the types of investments we’re making in renewable energy and enabling infrastructure. This support can be seen from the legislature, the Public Utilities Commission, and just last week the public at large showed their support with the resounding defeat of the ballot initiative that rolled back California’s climate change legislation.
Finally, I’m proud of some of our recent accomplishments which include the startup construction on the Sunrise Powerlink project at SDG&E. This much needed project is now coming to fruition following the completion of a lengthy and extremely thorough regulatory review process. It will enable the transmission of 1,000 megawatts of clean energy from renewable resources and principal liability to the San Diego region and create savings for our customers.
In addition, we’re moving forward with new solar and wind projects at Sempra Generation which continues to demonstrate its leadership position in developing new renewable resources.
Finally, we’re on track to meet our goal of exiting the Commodities business by year end. This has enabled us to initiate a share repurchase program and to focus on our core operations.
With that, let me stop and open up the call, and take any questions that you may have.

When we stand back and look at this, we’re in a long-lived asset business, and we tend to make decisions on the next 15 years to 30 years these project we’re building and we want to make sure that we have the balance sheet to support the activity that we’re involved in, and to the extent that we can also be sensitive to what investors are looking toward in the short-term, we’ll factor that in.

The delay in Mesquite Solar is strictly the backlog at the Public Utility Commission, and having a chance to act on this contract that has gone through all the processes with PG&E, and it’s more than just getting PG&E to sign, but it’s making sure that the prices that they’ve negotiated with us meet all the relevant test.
So this is a timing issue, driven by a kind of a grid lock of some magnitude to the Commission, who is in the process looking at both new projects and repricing of old projects, and we had thought that we would have a faster approval process through PG&E and the Commission, but it is what it is, it’s one of timing.
We have a portfolio of projects that we are bidding into different utilities here in California and in the southwest, and it’s just my expectation going forward that we’re going to develop or buy into between 100 and 200 megawatts a year of renewable projects, and the thing that we can predict is the exact time when those will come online.

On the other hand, one of the things that we’ve seen in the commodity markets is that the volatility in these things eventually is driven by the ups and downs of drilling and so forth. So our long-term view about storage given the potential for volatility in the North American gas market is still pretty good.
I’d make one more comment about the storage, when we look at our outlook for our storage assets, including factoring in some impact of the current prices and what we think will make from those assets in a few years. These storage assets stack up very well compared to some of the recent public offerings that have been done in this area.

On today's call, I'd like to accomplish several things. First, review with you our third quarter financial results. We'll then update you on our exit from the RBS Commodities joint venture and also discuss some items that may impact our 2011 outlook. And then, finally, I'll give you an operational update on our utilities and infrastructure businesses. 
Now the financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $131 million or $0.53 per share, compared with $317 million or $1.27 per share in the same period last year. The third quarter results included an after-tax charge of $139 million from the previously announced write-down of our investment in the RBS Sempra Commodities joint venture. Excluding Sempra Commodities, quarterly earnings increased by 10% over the prior year.
Our core businesses continued to perform well, and we are on track to meet our 2010 earnings guidance per share of $3.15 to $3.45 per share, excluding the results from commodities.
I'd also like to mention that we are now in the final stage of exit from our commodities joint venture. We and RBS agreed to the principal assets of the business in 3 separate transactions, 2 of which have already closed. The final sale should close next month and at that time retired to be retired on the program. We have said that once we complete this initial $500 million share repurchase and complete our exit from the commodities joint venture that we would evaluate an additional share repurchase. 
Over the course of the past few months, we had the opportunity to hear from investors about their preferred outcome of an additional share repurchase versus a dividend increase or some combination of the 2. Over the next few months we will complete an annual review of our business with our Board of Directors. As part of this normal planning process, we will evaluate several things, including our capital program, earnings growth, credit statistics, dividend payout and federal tax policy. When completed in the first quarter, we will announce any additional share repurchases or changes in our dividend policy at that time.
Now let me turn it back over to Mark, so he can take you through some of the detail of the financial results beginning with Slide 4."

At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the third quarter were $106 million, compared with earnings of $108 million in the year-ago quarter. For the first 9 months of 2010, SDG&E's earnings were $264 million compared with $277 million last",1079,"Thanks, Don. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the third quarter were $106 million, compared with earnings of $108 million in the year-ago quarter. For the first 9 months of 2010, SDG&E's earnings were $264 million compared with $277 million last year. The year-to-date results include $16 million of higher wildfire insurance premiums.
At Southern California Gas Co., third quarter 2010 earnings were $78 million, up from $74 million in the third quarter of 2009. For the first 9 months of 2010, earnings for this business were $212 million, up from $198 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to improved operating results and a lower effective tax rate on operations, offset by a $13 million tax charge recorded in the first quarter that was due to the passage of the healthcare bill. Now let's go to Slide 5.
Our generation business recorded earnings of $56 million in the third quarter compared with earnings of $43 million in the same quarter 2009. The increase for the quarter is primarily the result of renewable energy credits from the Copper Mountain Solar Project. Generation also benefited from mark-to-market gains, which were offset by $9 million of lower earnings from operations of our natural gas-fired power plants this year related to the settlement of the energy crisis litigation. 
Now please move to Slide 6.
Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $43 million in the third quarter of 2010 compared with earnings of $54 million in the same quarter of 2009. The current quarter included $48 million in proceeds from the legal settlement, less the related $17 million tax charge and a $24 million write-down of our investments in Argentina. The third quarter of 2009 included a $15 million benefit from the resolution of prior-year's tax issues.
For the first 9 months of the year, Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $120 million, compared with earnings of $64 million in the same period in 2009. The increase is primarily due to a $64 million write-off of our Liberty Storage assets last year, as well as the other factors I just mentioned.
Now please turn to Slide 7. Sempra LNG had earnings of $5 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared with breakeven earnings in the prior-year's period. The increase for the quarter was primarily due to higher earnings from operations. You'll recall that our LNG facility became operational, and our supply contract with the Tangguh partners for the energy Costa Azul LNG facility became effective in the second half of 2009.
For the first 9 months of 2010, Sempra LNG had earnings of $50 million, up from a loss of $19 million in 2009. Despite the year-over-year improvement, the results this quarter were lower than expected. The quarter was impacted by 3 items. Lower natural gas prices, a reduction in the carrying value of inventory and mark-to-market adjustments totaling $5 million and legal and tax items have negatively impacted the quarter by $4 million. At current gas prices we would expect the earnings from this business to be about $12 million to $15 million per quarter.
Now let's move to Slide 8. Since our last earnings call, we and RBS announced 2 transactions to sell the remaining principal assets of the RBS Sempra Commodities joint venture. The sale of the retail marketing business to Noble group and the sale of North American gas and power assets to JP Morgan. The sale of the retail businesses closed last week, and we expect the sale of the North American gas and power assets to close next month. You'll recall that we already received $1 billion from the sale of the oil, metals and European energy businesses. We expect that Sempra will receive $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion in proceeds from the exit of the joint venture after taking into consideration ongoing costs related to the sale. As I said, we've already collected a large portion of the proceeds, and the remainder of the collections will extend into next year. And with that, we are now effectively out of the trading business. Please turn to the next Slide.
We recently replaced our revolving credit facilities with new 4-year facilities. These new lines expire in October of 2014 and replaced the lines that were set to expire in August of next year. We have a total of $3 billion of lines at Sempra as well as a combined $800 million line for San Diego Gas & Electric and SoCalGas. Now, I'll change gears and talk about our outlook for year.
In March of this year, we provided guidance for 2011 of $4.35 and $4.65 dollars per share. We'll update that guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in February, but as we look out into the next year, we are seeing some pressures on our 2011 outlook that I'd like to comment on.
There are 3 primary drivers that may negatively impact earnings next year. As I mentioned when I talked about LNG's results, we are in a much lower natural gas price environment. The solar price for 2011 is currently about $2 lower than what our plan was based upon. This impact for LNG and generation businesses is that the pricing of key contracts.
Next, you'll recall that the guidance we gave you assume that Sempra Pipelines & Storage would acquire the other half of our pipeline joint venture in Mexico from our partner there. But we now don't expect it to happen as we have planned.
And finally, we have a shift in the timing of the 150 megawatts Mesquite Solar project at Sempra Generation. Our existing guidance had assumed the project will be substantially complete by the end of 2011, but we now expect the project to be complete in early 2013. While 2011 earnings will be lower due to the later service, earnings will move into 2012 and 2013.
Now while there are positives that could offset some of these pressures, we currently believe that the net effect to our 2011 outlook could be a reduction to earnings per share of approximately $0.35 to $0.45. Again, we'll provide more complete guidance for 2011 on and our fourth quarter earnings call, and while we still will grow our earnings per share at a double-digit rate next year, from what we are seeing now, the outlook is lower than our prior guidance.
And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Don, who will begin with Slide 10."

Now let me update you on activities in our California utilities. At San Diego Gas & Electric, construction is underway on the Sunrise Powerlink. We are on track to complete this project in the second half of 2012. Turning to our Smart Mete",613,"Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on activities in our California utilities. At San Diego Gas & Electric, construction is underway on the Sunrise Powerlink. We are on track to complete this project in the second half of 2012. 
Turning to our Smart Meter Program at SDG&E, we've now installed more than 1.6 million meters and remain on schedule to essentially complete the installations by year-end 2011.
And finally, at SDG&E and SoCalGas, we would be filing full applications for both utilities 2012 general rate case next month. The CPUC's rate case plan calls for decisions by year-end 2011.
Now let's go to Slide 11, if you would. At Sempra Generation, construction continues in Nevada on our 48-megawatt Copper Mountain Solar project. We currently have 38-megawatts in operation and expect to complete the project by the end of this year. The power generated by this project is sold under a 20-year contract to Pacific Gas & Electric.
We also continue to advance our Mesquite Solar project. This project is located near our Mesquite Natural Gas Plant outside Phoenix, where we have in our plans to ultimately develop about 600 megawatts of solar-generating capacity.
Last month, we announced an agreement to sell the power produced by the first 150-megawatt phase of the project to PG&E under a 20-year contract. We now plan to start construction next year and to complete all 150 megawatts by early 2013.
In addition to these new solar projects, last week we announced an investment in a new 250-megawatt wind project located in Northern Colorado called Cedar Creek II. This project is a 50/50 partnership with BP Wind Energy and is already under construction and is our second wind project with BP. The power produced by the facility will be sold under a 25-year power purchase agreement with the Public Service of Colorado, and operations are expected to commence mid-2011.
At our Pipelines  & Storage business, we recently added roughly 12 billion cubic feet of operating storage capacity at our Mississippi Hub and Bay Gas Storage facilities, and our storage buildout program continues to move forward. In total, about 85% of the storage capacity we have in service was contracted forward.
Now we move to the final slide, if you would. In summary, I am very pleased with the solid operating results of our core businesses for both the quarter and year-to-date. I also want to remind you that here in California, we continue to see broad support for the types of investments we're making in renewable energy and enabling infrastructure. This support can be seen from the legislature, the Public Utilities Commission, and just last week the public at large showed their support with a resounding defeat of a ballot initiative that rollback California's climate change legislation.
And finally, I am proud of some of our recent accomplishments, which include the start of construction on the Sunrise Powerlink Project at SDG&E. This much-needed project is now coming to fruition while in the completion of a lengthy and extremely thorough regulatory review process. It will enable the transmission of 1,000 megawatts of clean energy from renewable resources and liability to the San Diego region and create savings for our customers.
In addition, we are moving forward with new solar and wind project at Sempra Generation, which continues to demonstrate its leadership position in developing new, renewable resources.
And finally, we are on track to meet our goal of exiting the commodities business by year-end. This has enabled us to initiate a share repurchase program and to focus on our core operations. With that, let me stop and open up the call and take any questions that you may have."

So this is a timing issue, driven by a kind of a gridlock of some magnitude to the Commission who is in the process looking at both new projects and repricing of all projects, and we have thought that we would have a faster approval process through PG&E and the commission, but it is what it is, it's one of timing. We have a portfolio of projects that we are getting into different utilities here in California and in the Southwest. And it's just my expectation going forward that we are going to develop or buy into between 100 and 200 megawatts a year of renewable projects, and the thing that we can predict is the exact time when those will come online.

On today's call, I'd like to accomplish several things. First, review with your our third quarter financial results. We’ll then update you on our exit from the RBS Co",443,"Thanks, Steve, and again, thank you all for joining us this morning or this afternoon. On today's call, I'd like to accomplish several things. First, review with your our third quarter financial results. We’ll then update you on our exit from the RBS Commodities joint venture and also discuss some items that may impact our 2011 outlook. And then, finally, I'll give you an operational update on our utilities and infrastructure businesses. 
Now to the financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $131 million or $0.53 per share, compared with $317 million or $1.27 per share in the same period last year. The third quarter results included an after-tax charge of $139 million from the previously announced write-down of our investment in the RBS Sempra Commodities joint venture. Excluding Sempra Commodities, quarterly earnings increased by 10% over the prior year.
Our core businesses continue to perform well, and we're on track to meet our 2010 earnings guidance per share of $3.15 to $3.35 per share, excluding the results from Commodities.
I'd also like to mention that we're now in the final stage of exit from our Commodities joint venture. We and RBS agreed to sell the principal assets of the business in 3 separate transactions, 2 of which have already closed. The final sale should close next month and at that time, we'll essentially be out of the trading business. This is a key goal for us this year. 
And I'll remind you that we have a $500 million share repurchase program underway. We were able to start the buyback earlier than anticipated and have already received a large portion of the shares to be retired under the program. 
We have said that once we complete this initial $500 million share repurchase and complete our exit from the Commodities joint venture that we would evaluate an additional share repurchase. 
Over the course of the past few months, we had the opportunity to hear from many investors about their preferred outcome of an additional share repurchase versus a dividend increase or some combination of the 2. Over the next few months, we will complete an annual review of our business with our Board of Directors. As part of this normal planning process, we will evaluate several things, including our capital program, earnings growth, credit statistics, dividend payout and federal tax policy. When completed in the first quarter, we will announce any additional share repurchases or changes in our dividend policy at that time.
Now let me turn it back over to Mark, so he can take you through some of the detail of the financial results beginning with Slide 4."

At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the third quarter were $106 million, compared with earnings of $108 million in the year ago quarter. For the first 9 months of 2010, SDG&E's earnings were $264 million compared with $277 million last",1118,"Thanks, Don. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the third quarter were $106 million, compared with earnings of $108 million in the year ago quarter. For the first 9 months of 2010, SDG&E's earnings were $264 million compared with $277 million last year. The year-to-date results include $16 million of higher wildfire insurance premiums.
At Southern California Gas, third quarter 2010 earnings were $78 million, up from $74 million in the third quarter of 2009. For the first 9 months of 2010, earnings for this business were $212 million, up from $198 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to improved operating results and a lower effective tax rate on operations, offset by a $13 million tax charge recorded in the first quarter that was due to the passage of the healthcare bill. Now let's go to Slide 5.
Our Generation business recorded earnings of $56 million in the third quarter compared with earnings of $43 million in the same quarter 2009. The increase for the quarter is primarily the result of renewable energy credits from the Copper Mountain Solar project. Generation also benefited from mark-to-market gains, which were offset by $9 million of lower earnings from operations of our natural gas-fired power plants. For the first 9 months of the year, Generation recorded earnings of $51 million compared with earnings of $119 million in the same period of 2009. The decrease was primarily due to $86 million of litigation expense this year related to the settlement of the energy crisis litigation. 
Now please move to Slide 6. Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $43 million in the third quarter of 2010 compared with earnings of $54 million in the same quarter of 2009. The current quarter included $48 million in proceeds from the legal settlement, less the related $17 million tax charge and a $24 million write-down of our investment in Argentina. The third quarter of 2009 included a $15 million benefit from the resolution of prior year's tax issues.
For the first 9 months of the year, Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $120 million, compared with earnings of $64 million in the same period in 2009. The increase is primarily due to a $64 million write-off of our Liberty Storage assets last year, as well as the other factors I just mentioned.
Now please turn to Slide 7. Sempra LNG had earnings of $5 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared with breakeven earnings in the prior year's period. The increase for the quarter was primarily due to higher earnings from operations. You'll recall that our Cameron LNG facility became operational and our supply contract with the Tangguh Partners for the Energía Costa Azul LNG facility became effective in the second half of 2009.
For the first 9 months of 2010, Sempra LNG had earnings of $50 million, up from a loss of $19 million in 2009. Despite the year-over-year improvement, the results this quarter were lower than expected. The quarter was impacted by 3 items. Lower natural gas prices, a reduction in the carrying value of inventory and mark-to-market adjustments totaling $5 million, and legal and tax items have negatively impacted the quarter by $4 million. At current gas prices, we would expect the earnings from this business to be about $12 million to $15 million per quarter.
Now let's move to Slide 8. Since our last earnings call, we and RBS announced 2 transactions to sell the remaining principal assets of the RBS Sempra Commodities joint venture. The sale of the retail marketing business to Noble Group and the sale of North American gas and power assets to JP Morgan. The sale of the retail businesses closed last week, and we expect the sale of the North American gas and power assets to close next month. You'll recall that we already received $1 billion from the sale of the oil, metals and European energy businesses. We expect that Sempra will receive $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion in proceeds from the exit of the joint venture after taking into consideration ongoing costs related to the sale. As I've said, we've already collected a large portion of the proceeds and the remainder of the collections will extend into next year. And with that, we are now effectively out of the trading business. Please turn to the next slide.
We recently replaced our revolving credit facilities with new 4-year facilities. These new lines expire in October of 2014, and replaced the lines that were set to expire in August of next year. We have a total of $3 billion of lines at Sempra, as well as a combined $800 million line for San Diego Gas & Electric and SoCalGas. 
Now I'll change gears and talk about our outlook for the year. In March of this year, we provided guidance for 2011 of $4.35 to $4.65 per share. We'll update that guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in February, but as we look out into the next year, we are seeing some pressures on our 2011 outlook that I'd like to comment on.
There are 3 primary drivers that may negatively impact earnings next year. As I mentioned when I talked about LNG's results, we're in a much lower natural gas price environment. The solar price for 2011 is currently about $2 lower than what our plan was based upon. This impacts our LNG and Generation businesses due to the pricing of key contracts.
Next, you'll recall that the guidance we gave you assume that Sempra Pipelines & Storage would acquire the other half of our pipeline joint venture in Mexico from our partner there. But we now don’t expect this to happen as we had planned.
And finally, we have a shift in the timing of the 150 megawatts Mesquite Solar project at Sempra Generation. Our existing guidance had assumed the project will be substantially complete by the end of 2011, but we now expect the project to be complete in early 2013. While 2011 earnings will be lower due to the later in-service stage [ph], earnings will move into 2012 and 2013.
Now while there are positives that could offset some of these pressures, we currently believe that the net effect to our 2011 outlook could be a reduction to earnings per share of approximately $0.35 to $0.45. Again, we'll provide more complete guidance for 2011 on our fourth quarter earnings call, and while we still will grow our earnings per share at a double-digit rate next year, from what we're seeing now, the outlook is lower than our prior guidance.
And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Don, who will begin with Slide 10."

At San Diego Gas & Electric, construction is underway on the Sunrise Powerlink. We're on track to complete this project in the second half of 2012. 
Turning to our smart meter program at SDG&E, we've now installed more than 1.6 million meters and remain on schedule to essentially complete the installations by year-end 2011.
And finally, at SDG&E and SoCalGas, we would be filing full applications for both utilities 2012 general rate cases next month. The CPUC's rate case plan calls for decisions by year-end 2011.
Now we go to Slide 11, if you would. At Sempra Generation, construction continues in Nevada on our 48-megawatt Copper Mountain Solar project. We currently have 38 megawatts in operation and expect to complete the project by the end of this year. The power generated by this project is sold under a 20-year contract to Pacific Gas & Electric.
We also continue to advance our Mesquite Solar project. This project is located near our Mesquite natural gas-fired plant outside Phoenix, where we have in our plans to ultimately develop about 600 megawatts of solar-generating capacity.
Last month, we announced an agreement to sell the power produced by the first 150-megawatt phase of the project to PG&E under a 20-year contract. We now plan to start construction next year and to complete all 150 megawatts by early 2013.
In addition to these new solar projects, last week we announced an investment in a new 250-megawatt wind project located in Northern Colorado called Cedar Creek II. This project is a 50/50 partnership with BP Wind Energy and is already under construction and is our second wind project with BP. The power produced by the facility will be sold under a 25-year power purchase agreement with the Public Service of Colorado, and operations are expected to commence mid-2011.
At our Pipelines & Storage business, we recently added roughly 12 billion cubic feet of operating storage capacity at our Mississippi Hub and Bay Gas Storage facilities, and our storage buildout program continues to move forward. In total, about 85% of the storage capacity we have in service is contracted forward.
Now we move to the final slide, if you would. In summary, I'm very pleased with the solid operating results of our core businesses for both the quarter and year-to-date. I also want to remind you that here in California, we continue to see broad support for the types of investments we're making in renewable energy and enabling infrastructure. This support can be seen from the legislature, the Public Utilities Commission, and just last week the public at large showed their support with the resounding defeat of a ballot initiative that rolled back California's climate change legislation.
And finally, I'm proud of some of our recent accomplishments, which include the start of construction on the Sunrise Powerlink project at SDG&E. This much-needed project is now coming to fruition following the completion of a lengthy and extremely thorough regulatory review process. It will enable the transmission of 1,000 megawatts of clean energy from renewable resources and principal liability to the San Diego region and create savings for our customers.
In addition, we're moving forward with new solar and wind projects at Sempra Generation, which continues to demonstrate its leadership position in developing new renewable resources.
And finally, we're on track to meet our goal of exiting the Commodities business by year end. This has enabled us to initiate a share repurchase program and to focus on our core operations. 
With that, let me stop and open up the call, and take any questions that you may have."

First, review with you our third quarter financial results. We’ll then update you on our exit from the RBS Commodities joint venture and also discuss some items that may impact our 2011 outlook. And then, finally, I'll give you an operational update on our utilities and infrastructure businesses. 
Now to the financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $131 million or $0.53 per share, compared with $317 million or $1.27 per share in the same period last year. The third quarter results included an after-tax charge of $139 million from the previously announced write-down of our investment in the RBS Sempra Commodities joint venture. Excluding Sempra Commodities, quarterly earnings increased by 10% over the prior year.
Our core businesses continue to perform well, and we're on track to meet our 2010 earnings guidance per share of $3.15 to $3.35 per share, excluding the results from Commodities.
I'd also like to mention that we're now in the final stage of exit from our Commodities joint venture. We and RBS agreed to sell the principal assets of the business in 3 separate transactions, 2 of which have already closed. The final sale should close next month, and at that time, we'll essentially be out of the trading business. This is a key goal for us this year. 
And I'll remind you that we have a $500 million share repurchase program underway. We were able to start the buyback earlier than anticipated and have already received a large portion of the shares to be retired under the program. 
We have said that once we complete this initial $500 million share repurchase and complete our exit from the Commodities joint venture that we would evaluate an additional share repurchase. 
Over the course of the past few months, we had the opportunity to hear from many investors about their preferred outcome of an additional share repurchase versus a dividend increase or some combination of the 2. Over the next few months, we will complete an annual review of our business with our board of directors. As part of this normal planning process, we will evaluate several things, including our capital program, earnings growth, credit statistics, dividend payout and federal tax policy. When completed in the first quarter, we will announce any additional share repurchases or changes in our dividend policy at that time.
Now let me turn it back over to Mark, so he can take you through some of the detail of the financial results beginning with Slide 4."

At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the third quarter were $106 million, compared with earnings of $108 million in the year ago quarter. For the first 9 months of 2010, SDG&E's earnings were $264 million compared with $277 million last",1117,"Thanks, Don. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the third quarter were $106 million, compared with earnings of $108 million in the year ago quarter. For the first 9 months of 2010, SDG&E's earnings were $264 million compared with $277 million last year. The year-to-date results include $16 million of higher wildfire insurance premiums.
At Southern California Gas, third quarter 2010 earnings were $78 million, up from $74 million in the third quarter of 2009. For the first 9 months of 2010, earnings for this business were $212 million, up from $198 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to improved operating results and a lower effective tax rate on operations, offset by a $13 million tax charge recorded in the first quarter that was due to the passage of the healthcare bill. Now let's go to Slide 5.
Our Generation business recorded earnings of $56 million in the third quarter compared with earnings of $43 million in the same quarter of 2009. The increase for the quarter is primarily the result of renewable energy credits from the Copper Mountain Solar project. Generation also benefited from mark-to-market gains, which were offset by $9 million of lower earnings from operations of our natural gas-fired power plants. For the first 9 months of the year, Generation recorded earnings of $51 million compared with earnings of $119 million in the same period of 2009. The decrease was primarily due to $86 million of litigation expense this year related to the settlement of the energy crisis litigation. 
Now please move to Slide 6. Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $43 million in the third quarter of 2010 compared with earnings of $54 million in the same quarter of 2009. The current quarter included $48 million in proceeds from the legal settlement, less the related $17 million tax charge and a $24 million write-down of our investment in Argentina. The third quarter of 2009 included a $15 million benefit from the resolution of prior year's tax issues.
For the first 9 months of the year, Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $120 million, compared with earnings of $64 million in the same period in 2009. The increase is primarily due to a $64 million write-off of our Liberty Storage assets last year, as well as the other factors I just mentioned.
Now please turn to Slide 7. Sempra LNG had earnings of $5 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared with breakeven earnings in the prior year's period. The increase for the quarter was primarily due to higher earnings from operations. You'll recall that our Cameron LNG facility became operational, and our supply contract with the Tangguh Partners for the Energía Costa Azul LNG facility became effective in the second half of 2009.
For the first 9 months of 2010, Sempra LNG had earnings of $50 million, up from a loss of $19 million in 2009. Despite the year-over-year improvement, the results this quarter were lower than expected. The quarter was impacted by 3 items: Lower natural gas prices, a reduction in the carrying value of inventory and mark-to-market adjustments totaling $5 million, and legal and tax items have negatively impacted the quarter by $4 million. At current gas prices, we would expect the earnings from this business to be about $12 million to $15 million per quarter.
Now let's move to Slide 8. Since our last earnings call, we and RBS announced 2 transactions to sell the remaining principal assets of the RBS Sempra Commodities joint venture: the sale of the retail marketing business to Noble Group and the sale of North American gas and power assets to JP Morgan. The sale of the retail businesses closed last week, and we expect the sale of the North American gas and power assets to close next month. You'll recall that we already received $1 billion from the sale of the oil, metals and European energy businesses. We expect that Sempra will receive $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion in proceeds from the exit of the joint venture after taking into consideration ongoing costs related to the sale. As I've said, we've already collected a large portion of the proceeds, and the remainder of the collections will extend into next year. And with that, we are now effectively out of the trading business. Please turn to the next slide.
We recently replaced our revolving credit facilities with new 4-year facilities. These new lines expire in October of 2014 and replace the lines that were set to expire in August of next year. We have a total of $3 billion of lines at Sempra, as well as a combined $800 million line for San Diego Gas & Electric and SoCalGas. 
Now I'll change gears and talk about our outlook for the year. In March of this year, we provided guidance for 2011 of $4.35 to $4.65 per share. We'll update that guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in February, but as we look out into the next year, we are seeing some pressures on our 2011 outlook that I'd like to comment on.
There are 3 primary drivers that may negatively impact earnings next year. As I mentioned when I talked about LNG's results, we're in a much lower natural gas price environment. The solar price for 2011 is currently about $2 lower than what our plan was based upon. This impacts our LNG and Generation businesses due to the pricing of key contracts.
Next, you'll recall that the guidance we gave you assumed that Sempra Pipelines & Storage would acquire the other half of our pipeline joint venture in Mexico from our partner there. But we now don’t expect this to happen as we had planned.
And finally, we have a shift in the timing of the 150-megawatt Mesquite Solar project at Sempra Generation. Our existing guidance had assumed the project will be substantially complete by the end of 2011, but we now expect the project to be complete in early 2013. While 2011 earnings will be lower due to the later in-service date, earnings will move into 2012 and 2013.
Now while there are positives that could offset some of these pressures, we currently believe that the net effect to our 2011 outlook could be a reduction to earnings per share of approximately $0.35 to $0.45. Again, we'll provide more complete guidance for 2011 on our fourth quarter earnings call, and while we still will grow our earnings per share at a double-digit rate next year, from what we're seeing now, the outlook is lower than our prior guidance.
And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Don, who will begin with Slide 10."
120622,115247534,163460,"Sempra Energy, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2010",2010-11-09,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on activities at our Californian utilities. At San Diego Gas & Electric, construction is underway on the Sunrise Powerlink.

At San Diego Gas & Electric, construction is underway on the Sunrise Powerlink. We're on track to complete this project in the second half of 2012. 
Turning to our smart meter program at SDG&E, we've now installed more than 1.6 million meters and remain on schedule to essentially complete the installations by year-end 2011.
And finally, at SDG&E and SoCalGas, we will be filing full applications for both utilities 2012 general rate cases next month. The CPUC's rate case plan calls for decisions by year-end 2011.
Now go to Slide 11, if you would. At Sempra Generation, construction continues in Nevada on our 48-megawatt Copper Mountain Solar project. We currently have 38 megawatts in operation and expect to complete the project by the end of this year. The power generated by this project is sold under a 20-year contract to Pacific Gas & Electric.
We also continue to advance our Mesquite Solar project. This project is located near our Mesquite natural gas-fired plant outside Phoenix, where we have enough land to ultimately develop up to 600 megawatts of solar-generating capacity.
Last month, we announced an agreement to sell the power produced by the first 150-megawatt phase of the project to PG&E under a 20-year contract. We now plan to start construction next year and to complete all 150 megawatts by early 2013.
In addition to these new solar projects, last week we announced an investment in a new 250-megawatt wind project located in Northern Colorado called Cedar Creek II. This project is a 50/50 partnership with BP Wind Energy and is already under construction and is our second wind project with BP. The power produced by the facility will be sold under a 25-year power purchase agreement with the Public Service of Colorado, and operations are expected to commence mid-2011.
At our Pipelines & Storage business, we recently added roughly 12 billion cubic feet of operating storage capacity at our Mississippi Hub and Bay Gas Storage facilities, and our storage buildout program continues to move forward. In total, about 85% of the storage capacity we have in service is contracted forward.
Now move to the final slide, if you would. In summary, I'm very pleased with the solid operating results of our core businesses for both the quarter and year-to-date. I also want to remind you that here in California, we continue to see broad support for the types of investments we're making in renewable energy and enabling infrastructure. This support can be seen from the legislature, the Public Utilities Commission, and just last week the public at large showed their support with the resounding defeat of a ballot initiative that would have rolled back California's climate change legislation.
And finally, I'm proud of some of our recent accomplishments, which include the start of construction on the Sunrise Powerlink project at SDG&E. This much-needed project is now coming to fruition following the completion of a lengthy and extremely thorough regulatory review process. It will enable the transmission of 1,000 megawatts of clean energy from renewable resources in principal liability to the San Diego region and creates savings for our customers.
In addition, we're moving forward with new solar and wind projects at Sempra Generation, which continues to demonstrate its leadership position in developing new renewable resources.
And finally, we're on track to meet our goal of exiting the Commodities business by year end. This has enabled us to initiate a share repurchase program and to focus on our core operations. 
With that, let me stop and open up the call and take any questions that you may have."

When we do that, we obviously deal with the consequences when gas price drops as it has, and we also have upsides when it goes up. I just don't have any confidence that we are able to predict gas prices for the next 5 years. We have a little bit of gas exposure in our natural gas fleet as tied into the DWR contract, but that contract is expiring end of next year.

The delay in Mesquite Solar is strictly the backlog at the Public Utility Commission and having a chance to act on this contract that's been -- has gone through all the processes with PG&E, and it's more than just getting PG&E to sign, but it's making sure that the prices that they've negotiated with us meet all the relevant tests. So this is a timing issue, driven by a kind of a gridlock of some magnitude to the Commission, who is in the process of looking at both new projects and repricing of old projects, and we had thought that we would have a faster approval process through PG&E and the Commission, but it is what it is. It's one of timing. We have a portfolio of projects that we are bidding into different utilities here in California and in the Southwest. And it's just my expectation going forward that we're going to develop or buy into between 100 and 200 megawatts a year of renewable projects, and the thing that we can’t predict is the exact timing of when those will come online. Now let me ask Neal to address your question about storage."

On the other hand, one of the things that we've seen in the commodity markets is that the volatility in these things eventually is driven by the ups and downs of drilling and so forth. And so our long-term view about storage given the potential for volatility in the North American gas markets is still pretty good. And I'd make one more comment about the storage. When we look at our outlook for our storage assets, including factoring in some impact of the current prices and what we think will make from those assets in a few years, these storage assets stack up very well compared to some of the recent public offerings that have been done in this area."
