Welcome everybody to Denbury and Encore's combined fourth quarter conference call. It's obviously been a busy place here at Denbury and a lot of positive things are happening.

It's obviously been a busy place here at Denbury and a lot of positive things are happening. By now you should have received your proxy for shareholder meetings scheduled for March 9. Assuming approval which we expect closing and emerge will happen shortly thereafter. You probably also noticed that we have essentially finished the financing for the Encore acquisition. The banks indication was over sold as well as the $1 billion subordinate debt offering we completed a couple of weeks ago. Now we were pleased with the positive response and the rate we obtained on that debt transaction and glad to have that behind us. 
Our fourth quarter production as previously announced were slightly ahead of forecast, accrued reserves we're either on track or slightly better. If you noticed we had at almost tcf of additional CO2 reserves during 2009, the timing of which couldn't have been better since we need that CO2 for the recently purchased Conroe Field, our 130 million barrel potential EOR flood just north of Houston. We are focused on the Encore acquisition integration of personnel assets and operations that have been dedicating significant resources to that process. We are doing that ground work for our divestiture package which we hope to launch soon after closing. In summary, positive things are happening and things are falling into place. 
Our staff has been extremely busy the last couple of months as all these activities take a tremendous amount of extra work and I want to probably thank them for their extra effort. I countered approximately 45 SEC volumes that Denbury has made since our merger announcement early November in case you haven't found it yet. But that's a lot of paper. 
And today we are here to talk about fourth quarter and 2009 earnings and results. With me today from Denbury I have Tracy Evans, our President and COO; Mark Allen, our Senior VP and CFO; and Bob Cornelius, our Senior VP of Operations.
We also have from Encore, Jonny Brumley, President and CEO; Bob Reeves, Senior Vice President and CFO; Ben Nivens, Senior VP and COO and John Brumley Chairman of the board. These guys will give you more details about our respected companies, operating results as well as provide an operational update. We will start with Mark's review of Denbury's financials. Mark?

As reported in our press release we had net income for the fourth quarter of $3.5 million which included a non-cash charge for the change in fair value of commodity derivative contracts at $59.5 million or $36.9 million after taxes. We al",1399,"Thank you, Phil. As reported in our press release we had net income for the fourth quarter of $3.5 million which included a non-cash charge for the change in fair value of commodity derivative contracts at $59.5 million or $36.9 million after taxes. We also had merger related expenses associated with Encore transaction of $8.7 million or $5.4 million after taxes. When you exclude these items we had adjusted net income in the fourth quarter of $45.8 million or $0.18 per share essentially on top of first call estimates. This adjusted net income amount also included expense of $5.1 million or $3.2 million after taxes related to the Genesis management compensation awards with some analysts may not include in their estimates. 
If you exclude this charge our adjusted net income would have been approximately $49 million or $0.20 per share. In other case, the current quarter results are higher than the prior quarters' adjusted net income of approximately $40.7 million or $0.16 per share. As I had typically done, I will primarily focus on the sequential results of the third and fourth quarters of 2009 rather than the comparative fourth quarter of 2008.
During the fourth quarter of 2009 our tertiary production averaged 26,307 BOEs per day, 8% higher than our Q3 tertiary production and on overall basis our production increased by approximately 6% over Q3 levels. 
In mid-December 2009, we closed on the acquisition of Conroe field at the end of December; we closed on the sale of the remaining 40% of our Barnett Shale properties. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for the sale of the Barnett Shale properties and a full quarter of production from Conroe field our production might have been approximately 42,000 BOEs per day.
Bob is going to discuss more about our production in a moment but I stated in our press release we are reaffirming our tertiary production guidance for 2010 of 27,000 barrels per day. And estimate that our total company 2010 production will average approximately 41,500 BOEs per day after adjusting for the sale of the Barnett Shale and purchase of Conroe field. Approximately at 7% year-over-year annualized increase on a pro forma basis.
Also based on preliminary estimates and before any asset sales we would anticipate our Encore standalone production to increase by approximately 7% of its 2009 average of 42,929 BOEs per day. Please note that when I discuss combined numbers herein, I am generally referring to results for the entire year. However, the semi-completion of the merger in early March, will only report the result on core and our financial results from that point forward.
Our average oil price received for the quarter including derivative settlements were $72.67 per barrel in Q4 as compared to $70.54 per barrel in Q3. But if derivative settlements are excluded, our average oil price received for the fourth quarter was $72.56 per barrel as compared to $64.70 per barrel in Q3. Our NYMEX oil price differential is essentially the same as during the third quarter approximately $3.44 per barrel below NYMEX in Q4. This differential on a standalone basis may improve somewhat in 2010 as a result of a sale of the Barnett Shale which have liquid production reported in our oil sales that sold at a much higher discount to NYMEX.
However, assuming completion of the Encore merger, the combined company's NYMEX differential would be less favorable as the average NYMEX differential for the Encore properties was $8.04 per barrel as in Q4. Our total corporate lease operating expenses were up slightly roughly $900,000 in Q3 to Q4 and our per BOE basis, our overall lease operating cost decreased from $21.22 per barrel in Q3 to $20.34 per BOE in Q4, primarily due to increased production in the fourth quarter.
Our pro forma basis adjusted for the sales of Barnett Shale properties at the end of Q4. Our LOE per BOE in Q4 would have been $22.37 per BOE, as compared to $23.40 per BOE in Q3. Going forward excluding the Encore acquisition, I would expect our LOE per BOE to be at least equivalent to our tertiary production cost and generally as most of our conventional production is about more than our tertiary production cost.
On a combined basis, our LOE per BOE will drop assuming completion of the merger as on course LOE per BOE averages less than ours generally due to higher percentage of natural gas production. Bob will cover few more details on our LOE in a moment.
G&A expenses increased by $12.2 million from Q3 levels, due primarily to $8.7 million in acquisition-related expense, primarily associated with Encore acquisition and $1.5 million incremental compensation expense related to Genesis management incentive compensation of awards. This quarter we recognize expense-related to the Genesis management compensation words of approximately 5.1 million or total of 14. million during 2009. When we saw the GP of Genesis in February 2010, we paid out the compensation awards to Genesis management in aggregate amount of $14.9 million. All, but $700,000 of which has already been recruited in our 2009 financial statements. Although our G&A expense will no longer be burdened from the Genesis management compensation expense after the [pat] in the first quarter, they will have significant transaction cost related to the Encore acquisition and the first quarter that will run through our G&A expense, likely to be significantly higher than what we expensed in Q4. 
Interest expense, net of capitalized interest increased sequentially from $9.9 million to $10.5 million, primarily related to the [Celeste] capitalized interest this quarter. Capitalized interest was $20.9 million last quarter as compared to $19.9 million this quarter, primarily due to the Delhi Pipeline from Tinsley to Delhi Field replacing the service in Q4.
Going forward, we expect that our capitalized interest will continue to increase moderately from Q4 levels until the green pipeline is put into service. Our bank debt at December 31 was $125 million, higher than originally anticipated primarily due to incremental debt of approximately $60 million resulting from the purchase of Conroe field and the sale of Barnett Shale assets in December and approximately $50 million in equipment leasing that we did not complete in the fourth quarter. 
We may least this equipment during 2010, if we're able to find attractive terms. As you are probably aware we recently issued (inaudible) senior subordinated debt due 2020. The proceeds from this issuance for closing as for the pending completion of the Encore acquisition which is subject to approval of both company shareholders on March 9. As a result, our interest expense will increase substantially in the first quarter. Assuming the shareholders of both companies approve the merger, approximately $600 million of the proceeds from this offering will be used to redeem Encore senior subordinated debt and the remainder will be used to close the transaction. 
We also have commitments from a syndicate banks for a new $1.6 billion revolving credit facility that will replace our existing facility and will be used to fund remaining cash portion of the Encore acquisition. We're currently working on deducting (inaudible) for this facility. We currently anticipate that we will have between $900 million drawn on this facility upon closing the merger.
Our total anticipated expenditures for 2009 excluding acquisitions and capitalized interest totaled approximately $815 million. Net of sale as lease backs were approximately $50 million. This was higher than our $750 million in anticipated capital expenditures, due primarily to $50 million of equivalent seeing that we did not complete in 2009.
Our capital expenditure budget for 2010 is $650 million on a standalone basis and approximately $1 billion assuming we complete the Encore acquisition. Our combined basis to $1 billion would exceed our anticipated cash flow by approximately $150 million, $200 million. However previously stated, we anticipate selling at least $500 million in assets 2010 and (inaudible). Our DD&A for oil and gas properties increased slightly on absolute basis and more so on a per daily basis from [highly due] to the Barnett sale. 
With regard to income taxes, we currently anticipate that we will be able to detect a large portion of our green pipeline when replacing the service and begin injecting CO2 and Oyster Bayou have currently anticipated around mid 2010. This should help implement our current tax expense and help shield additional tax asset dispositions. And with that I will pass it to Bob.

Denbury's fourth quarter oil production averaged 45,012 net BOEs per day that was a 5% increase over third quarter of 2009 that EOR fields produced an average of 26,307 net BOEs per day during the quarter that is an 8% increase over third quarter and a 20% increase over the fourth quarter of 2008.
During the fourth quarter, we conducted several major operations that's filled this expansion in key fields imperative for future success. Several of the major projects had advanced completed during the fourth quarter were the commissioning of the Delta Pipeline from Tinsley to Delhi Field we had then allowed it to get first injection into Delhi field while that construction of the 320 mile green pipeline hit a big milestone with the 24 inch pipeline being installed into our Oyster Bayou field during December.
The other tertiary operations we completed were expansions at Tinsley and Heidelberg and in the Jackson Dome area we completed work to increase both our CO2 production rate and dehydration capacities. While the tertiary fields had significant increases during the fourth quarter in fact eight of the 12 operating CO2 facilities showed a quarter-to-quarter increase and five of those tertiary fields actually exhibited a double-digit increase quarter-to-quarter.
In phase 1 that is our Little Creek, Mallalieu, Brookhaven, McComb, Smithdale and Lockhart fields those better performers were the Mallalieu, Little Creek and Lockhart Crossing. At Mallalieu our largest field we completed a facility upgrade by adding compressors, inlet heaters and separation equipment which increased facility recycling capacity from about 160 million cubic feet a day up to 230 million cubic feet a day. That additional CO2 recycling capacity allowed us to increase production during the fourth quarter. We do expect Mallalieu to resume its decline in the near future as it is a fully developed field.
Another fully developed field is Little Creek, but Little Creek producing area had improvement due to initial response from results of the BOE project along with Mississippi state university. The project was a WAG which is Water Alternating Gas cycling where the water contains nutrients to feed natural occurring bacteria in a formation. The nitrate rich water and bacteria grows in the high permeability streaks, causing them to block and forcing water and CO2 into other intervals. The project is shown to increase the areal sweep efficiency and has increased production in the area of injection by over 100 barrels per day. Unit production averaged about [1480] BOEs per day during December and the team is considering expanding the WAG project into additional patterns to determine if they are truly successful.
Now, part crossing average tertiary production increased 16% or 203 net BOEs per day quarter-to-quarter as production improved from 882 BOEs per day to 1025 net BOEs per day over the period. The majority of the production increase is due to opening additional wells in the best part of the reservoir while maintaining the reservoir bottom hole pressure. Our gold of course it has continued to monitor bottom hole pressure and open wells in the channel area or the best area of the reservoir. We also experienced response during the period in the bar sand wells which could add production in future months. The theme plants to add a portable CO2 pump to maintain injection withdrawal rates and certain patterns.
Phase 2 which is Mallalieu, Eucutta, Soso, Martinville and Heidelberg increased 11% quarter-to-quarter. Soso and Heidelberg had double digit increases quarter-to-quarter and Martinville increased approximately 1% and Eucutta had a slight decrease of 4% during the quarter due to a reduction in CO2 injection rates in the prior months.
Although Eucutta decreased through the quarter there has been a steady production increase during November and then again in December. Eucutta December production was slightly higher than the quarterly average and the team is working to maintain CO2 injection rates and reservoir pressure in the duct reservoir. Soso field continues to be one of the best performing tertiary fields. Soso increased over 400 barrels per day or 14% quarter-to-quarter and has further increased production during the month of December. The majority of the production increased is due to the installation of jet pumps. These jet pumps are used to assist the producing wells to kick off and unload the wells and these slow responding wells are coming around much faster than previously what they would.
At the Heidelberg, it is our largest Phase 2 field in terms of reservoir potential. CO2 injection began in Heidelberg about one year ago during December of 2008; first production would begin in May. Heidelberg's field expansion was completed during the fourth quarter and Phase 2 fields expansion continues into the first quarter of 2010. Heidelberg production rates increased each month since its first production sales in May and during the fourth quarter production increased 81% from 828 BOEs to over 1506 BOEs per day from the quarter-to-quarter comparison. Tinsley is our largest tertiary field currently being flooded and is the only field in phase II and has experienced an increase of 11% quarter-to-quarter. Production increase from an average rate of about 3,558 BOEs in the third quarter to 3,942 net BOEs during the fourth quarter. 
During the fourth quarter, we commissioned a second trend of compression continued the expansion of the CO2 facility, we had a water handling capacity and began construction of another production test site and then began recompleting wells in the third phase of this field. Expansion of CO2 recycle facility and addition of CO2 injection well should allow the unit continue to perform. Our 2009 and 2010 capital development plan was not offered and thus we continued to see hopeful for success at Tinsley. 
Cranfield is our phase 4 CO2 project. CO2 ejection began in July 2008; we now have 17 ejection wells placed in approximately a 100 million cubic feet a day of CO2 into that reservoir. Cranfield also saw a nice quarter-to-quarter increase improving 27% during the period. Average quarter production with 728 BOEs per day.
In Delhi our phase five expansion we initiate field two ejection during the fourth quarter of 2009. Reservoir repressurization and pattern development was progressing as planned. We hope to establish first sale during the second quarter of 2010. The main introduction of recycling facility is ready for production.
And during 2010 the team has continued to expand the facility and add additional injection and producing wells during this period. We have total of 29 wells to be drilled.
Jackson Dome our CO2 source produced an average of 788 million cubic feet during the fourth quarter that rate represented a 24% increase over third quarter volumes. The majority of the CO2 was injected in to Eucutta, Soso, Tinsley, Cranfield and Delhi. We completed construction of the phase Delhi facility during the period, which will allow us to produce three additional CO2 wells that we are waiting on that facility. 
With the addition of the Trace Dehy and these existing wells Jackson Dome now has the ability to produce at rate at a BCF per day if required. 2010 capital projects in Jackson Dome includes the drilling of three wells and expansion of a dehydration facilities that will continue to improve our production and add reserves.
The 24 inch green pipeline construction activity began about 13 months ago in November of 2008. Construction of the pipeline reached Oyster Bayou Field the week before Christmas. We laid approximately 257 miles or 80% of the total miles in that 13 months. 
Presently we are installing valves in operating facilities along the Louisiana portion of the pipeline and completing the final tie in into the NEJD Pipeline that will connect the system to Jackson Dome. The work on the existing pipeline should be completed in the second quarter and third projection in to Oyster Bayou around mind-year.
There are three relatively short segments of type to install this year to complete the pipeline to Hastings Field, south of Houston. 20 miles from the Oyster Bayou to the East side of Galveston Bay that will be completed during December month. 
Then we have the Galveston Bay crossing which is a 14 mile water processing that will start during April and be completing approximately six months. And then finally we have the 25 miles on the East side of Galveston Bay to Hastings which should be completed and have injection into Hastings by the fourth quarter of 2010.
We estimate 2010 capital investment to complete the green pipeline at approximately $115 million. The pipeline is still on schedule, during this construction period, largely due to the (inaudible) winter wet weather that we experienced during the fourth quarter.
At Oyster Bayou the initial flood design and injection patterns are being developed. The well work is underway with the initial CO2 wells completed and repairing to [steady] flow line to connected to the main green pipeline. At Hastings Fields, the first new well in the field was spudded in December. The core was taken from the formation to be analyzed to assist in reservoir stimulation, development and management of the Hastings field area under Tertiary flood.
Production recycling facilities are under design and we paired our first production is expected from Hastings during the fourth quarter of 2011.
And with that recap I'll get back to Tracy.

DeGolyer and MacNaughton formed an evaluation of our reserves as of December 31, 2009. During 2009 we added 28.8 million barrels of oil from acquisitions at Hastings and Conroe and added an additional 17.6 million barrels of oil reserves in our CO2 assets. Additions from our adds and decreases to our sale of Barnett of 74.2 million BOEs was also in our prude reserves during 2009 decreasing on an absolute basis the 207.5 million barrel of oil equivalence, which consist of a 193 million barrels of oil condensate and natural gas liquids and 88 BCF of natural gas.
And at present value using at 10% discount rate of our proved reserves was 3.1 billion as of year end, in comparison on net present value of our approved reserves at year-end 2008 was $1.9 billion. The increase in net present value from year-to-year was primarily due to the booking of our additional CO2 reserves, our acquisition and then higher oil prices. 
Pro forma reserves as of 12/31/2009 including the Encore asset are 427.8 million barrel of oil equivalent at a value of $5.2 billion. Then we will provide additional information on Encore's year-end reserves. Denbury's proved reserve estimates at yearend 2009 were based the updated SEC guidelines for reserve estimations which were valued based on the average unweighted first day product price for the preceding 12 month which resulted in an NYMEX oil price of $61.18 per barrel and a gas price of $4.19 per mcf compared to yearend 2008 product prices of $44.60 per barrel and $5.71 per mcf.
The PB10 value of Denbury's December 31, 2009 proved reserves using alternative price deck based on the futures market forward strip as of December 31, 2009 was $5.8 billion. Denbury's net average price contained in this alternative reserve for approximately $85.77 per barrel of oil, $57 per barrel in natural gas liquid and $6.59 per mcf . Proved reserves associated with our CO2 tertiary operations account for approximately 65% of our current proved reserves or 134.5 million barrels of oil as of yearend 2009. In comparison, and our tertiary reserves at year end 2008 were approximately 125.8 million barrels of oil.
We added 44.9 million BOEs of proved reserves during 2009 before netting out 2009 production, property sales and reserve revision replacing approximately 277% of our 2009 production, a majority of which was from our acquisition at Hastings, Conroe in our additional reserves in our CO2 tertiary properties. 
Reserve additions are to CO2 related properties during the year were primarily to Cranfield approximately 11 million barrels, you got 2.5 million barrels and then Heidelberg which was 2.9 million barrel. The reserves added at Heidelberg in our tertiary were actually transferred from the prior water flood. Cranfield is in Phase IV and Eucutta and Heidelberg are in Phase II. As previously mentioned we sold approximately 74.2 million barrels of proved reserves during 2009 already to our Barnett Shale assets. 
Now as of year-end 2009 approximately 93% of our proved reserves are oil condensate or natural gas liquid and 62% of our proved reserves are proved developed reserves. In addition to our proved oil and gas reserves DeGolyer and MacNaughton also performs evaluation of our proved CO2 reserves at Jackson Dome. Our CO2 reserves increased by 940 Bcf of CO2, a total of 6.3 trillion cubic feet of CO2 as of yearend 2009 after accounting of 2009 CO2 production.
Our 2009 CO2 production of 249 Bcf of CO2 was offset by reserve additions during the year. 400 Bcf at Gluckstadt field based on lowering the lowest known CO2 level as a result of our drilling operation from the only well we drilled during the year. 345 Bcf from expanding our acreage ownership and an existing CO2 unit and the remaining reserves were added in existing wells based on performance and a greater understanding of the reservoirs. 
During 2010 as Bob mentioned, we attend to drill three additional wells, the Jackson Dome to further develop additional production reserves. We have spud our first well during 2010, which will attempt a large structure that may contain between one and a half and two tcf of CO2. The large portions are currently booked probable CO2 reserves at Jackson Dome. And with that I'll turn it back over to Phil.

Then I will turn the call over to Ben Nivens, our COO who will update you on the operations. And then Ben will turn the call over to Bob Reeves, our CFO who will discuss Encore energy partners. 
Before I do that I would like to thank our investors who have been very supportive long-term investors, and we appreciate you and I'm glad that we could deliver the profitable results that we set out to do with public in 2001. And also I would also like to thank our employees; who've done a great job. We've refocused the company back in 2006 and transformed it into a company with a large drilling inventory and less taxes the Bakken Shale and the Haynesville Shale and also a large tertiary play with Bell Creek and Cedar Creek and without your ingenuity and dedication that could not have happened and thank you for that as well. 
Now began talking about production. Our production was 45,143 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the fourth quarter of 2009, and that compares to 41,824 barrels a day at the fourth quarter of '08. 
Production was a tad bit lower than we are expecting due to the extremely cold weather throughout the country, but what's important is how well the production hung in there with really hardly any completion and as the temperature warms up our production will increase within. 
We always take winter weather into account, but this winter was unbelievably cold and is just hard to frac wells in negative temperatures, but its times like this that really do highlight our quality asset base and is really shining through now. 
And we also have a exciting Bakken completion early March. This is the Werre Trust well, it's a 19 stage frac, we are really excited about its in a great area, its offsetting a big well that was there just on a single stage this well ought to be really good Ben will talk more about that.
And if you look at our numbers on an annual basis you really can see how well the company is doing. Our annual production averaged 42,929 barrels equivalent day, that's 1767 barrels per day over [budging] our capital expenditures were $33 million under budget. LOE was a $1.76 per barrel under budget and with our hedging program and cashing enter our hedges back to March of 2009 at the low, oil prices, prices were way above expectations. 
So I think this is really what heaven must look like. More production less capital LOE and higher prices. 
Now, I'll turn it over to Ben, thank you for working for us and investing with Encore you have done a great job.

Our reserves were 67% oil and 80% [proved] developed and let me just kind of do a reconciliation from the 2009 year end reserves of 185.7 million barrels. In 2009, we produces 15.7 million barrels and the company acquired 24.1 million in East Texas, Oklahoma and West Texas, we added 21.5 million barrels through the drill bed and had revisions of previous estimates of 4.8 million barrels mostly financial.
And given us the total of again 220.3 million barrels of reserves for year end 2009. Now I'll give you an update on our drilling operations, for the fourth quarter we had no significant operator wells to come online in our major areas of operation, this was due to lower activity in the third quarter and weather delay that Jonny spoke of earlier. As part of our capital reduction program of 2009, our rate cap went down to one rig at one point in the third quarter of 2009, before we began taking up rigs in the fourth quarter.
Currently, we have five rigs running, two in the Bakken, two in West Texas and one in Haynesville and we have several completions coming out in the first quarter of 2010 and I'll discuss those completions in the major operating areas.
Starting with the Bakken, we have four wells that we'll be completing in the first quarter of 2010. Jonny mentioned that we are trust 34 age that is a 1280 acre of well it'll be a 19 stage frac in Bear Creek and its directly offsetting our Werre Trust 213 age that we released results on last quarter that was a single stage 640 and [IP-ed] to 1500 barrels a day.
That frac is scheduled to begin in the first week of March. From there we'll move to two other wells in Bear Creek [45 ridge 1435 age and 45 ridge 11X2 age] these wells were drilled from a common pad and they are going in opposing directions and we will actually be doing these fracs simultaneously, they will not be simultaneous in the sense that they'll be actually fracing at the same time but we will be using the same equipment where we'll frac once while we are proliferating the other and the equipment is there in one common location unless we switch back and forth, so that's pretty exciting too. That work is scheduled to begin in the second week of March.
From there we will be moving Murphy Creek well, the Becker 247H that is a 1280 and will be a 20 stage frac that well will actually be completed in the second quarter of 2010. 
And we currently have two operating rigs going and the Bakken as I mentioned earlier one is drilling in Murphy creek and the other is in the Charleston area. On our [other] places we have four rigs running so it's a very active program going on in the Bakken.
Moving to the Haynesville we have two operated wells that will be coming online in the first quarter in our Greenwood Waskom field. The [EDGAR] 31-1H is already on it (inaudible) 11.7 million was our flowing casing pressure of 5500 pounds so it looks like a very strong well. The [Dunn Number 2-1] is actually completed and should begin production in the first week of March. And that's a 100% operated well as well. We also had three wells in the non-op area come on in the Haynesville and three different fields in Caspiana, Greenwood-Waskom and the Kingston area with IPs ranging from 8.1 million to 23.8 million per day. It should be noted that the 8.1 million IP well is a well that was brought on by a private company that changed to bring their well down more slowly. This is a strong well that had very strong flowing casing pressure and we're still excited about it at the 8.1 million a day range.
In addition, we recently (inaudible) 5-1 well. And that well is way in completion and should come on in the second quarter in 2010. The rig is now drilling another well in the Greenwood-Waskom area and we intend to keep rig going in the Haynesville most of the year and then in the non-op areas really the activity is really picking up there. We have five rigs running on our non-op places and we have three wells waiting on completion in the Haynesville area, in the non-op area. 
Moving on to our West Texas JV, we had two wells coming online this current quarter, our [Howard Hodge B4H] well is a Delaware Basin well and the Waha Field, this well came on at 10 million a day for initial flow back in its field producing in at 9 to 7.5 million a day range as we continue to have to treat that well because of some plant to issue never getting to lined out. But looks like a very strong well. 
Moving on to the Pegasus field in the West Texas JV, we have the [TR wells at 46-1H] that is scheduled to be completed in the first week of March. And that will be our first well in the Pegasus field after dropping a rig and now picking up another one. We have two rigs running in the JV and our budgeting to continue with two rigs for 2010, one rig will operate at Pegasus and then one Rig will operate in the Delaware basin and its currently drilling in our Waha field.
This concludes our update in the operations now I will turn it over to Bob Reeves to give you a financial review.

I am Bob Reeves, CFO. I'd like to go with the results of Encore Energy Partners for this call we'll not only go over the quarter and the year but we'll reflect briefly on the history of the partnership and then take some time to look into the future of ENP and address some of the questions that Kim Weimer, our IR person has got at the last few months. Our production for the quarter was 9254 barrels a day for the fourth quarter which equaled 68% oil by production. This follows up a quarter, in the third quarter that was 9301 barrel a day which equates to just 47 barrel per day drop in production quarter-over-quarter over one half of 1%. We previously stated that we are looking to manage production over a 12 month period rather than quarter-over-quarter with the understanding that timing the drilling completions, seasonal weather problems, well barriers and performance estimates may cause some variance within the production guidance range that we put out from quarter-to-quarter.
For the fourth quarter, however, we were once again very fortunate with our production performance being at the high end of the guidance range. With the operations guys doing a great job to keep in production on line during the extremely cold and harsh winter we've experienced this year which we typically start seeing in the fourth quarter and in somewhere around the end of the first quarter. 
All right some people on the call might not be familiar with the necessity pressed to recast proper period results on Form 8-Ks because of the drop downs from EAC to ENP as a result of GAAP requirements. Our controller Andrea Hunter and Director of Accounting Ron Holcomb, they do a great job of working hard to make these recast on timing in accurate basis. But when you go back and you take a look at these recasts that we've done and you look at the production results for 2009 as if all these drop down that acquisitions took place at January 1, 2009 you see the following results on your production. So the first quarter 9042 barrels a day for the second quarter 9142 barrels a day, for the third quarter 9301 barrel a day and for the fourth quarter 9254 barrels a day. 
Outstanding production by any measure over any period of time. As previously stated, the partnership averaged 68% oil by production for the quarter. Once again this quarter its fantastic to be oil with a staggering 18:1 price ratio for the quarter when comparing oil to natural gas prices based on NYMEX average price. Currently the partnership enjoys 89% of the NYMEX price and its revenues with its differential remaining tied to $8.47 per barrel or a 11% off at just NYMEX prices. LOE of $12.40 for the quarter missed the high end of our guidance range on a per-BOE basis. We incurred a $1 million expense from an outside operator which represented expenses from several prior periods that were not build into the fourth quarter of 2009. Without this one-time expense LOE would have been $11.22 per barrel.
For the first quarter we do expect LOE to be about the same as the fourth quarter levels. With additional expenses associated with keeping the production online during the extremely cold weather that we previously talked about. G&A for the fourth quarter was $2.63 which is back to a more normalized level when you compare it to the third quarter. Our cash available for distribution was $36.7 million for the fourth quarter on EBITDA of $41 million; we maintain our distribution of $53.75 for the quarter or $2.15 annualized per unit. This is $24.6 million paid out to all our unit holders and the remaining amount of $12 million was used to reduce debt. 
Our coverage ratio was 1.5 times for the quarter, our debt outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter was $255 million leaving us ample liquidity of around the $120 million still available under our revolving credit facility.
Now lets briefly reflect on the partnership. As most of you know we created this partnership to be a total return vehicle for our unit holders. When measuring total return, you look at both the quarterly unit distributions and the unit price appreciation as used to calculate the return to the unit shareholder. As we look back to the total return of the partnership from our IPO in September 2007, the partnership has an outstanding total return of 19.8% through February 17, 2010 using a unit price of $20.20. During the period since IPO, we've returned distributions of $4.95 per unit to all our unit holders. If you were able to participate in the two subsequent unit offerings on May 22, and July 6 of 2009, the total returns are even higher at 39.7% and 52.4% respectively. 
In today's market its hard to find many investments that rival these results. We've been able to accomplish these staggering results by sticking to some basic principles in the partnership. Purchase world class long-lived producing properties with flat production profiles grow through acquisitions and drop downs and avoid large drilling programs that's steeping your production decline profile. Execute a long-term and consistent hedging strategy that seeks to protect two-thirds of the down side commodity risk while allowing the investor exposure to two-thirds of the upside from commodity prices. And then utilize a variable distribution policy that such a minimum distribution to our shareholders protect the balance sheet and return the excess to the unit holders. We firmly believe this business strategy has proven and will continue to prove to be the best strategy over the long run for all types of commodity price cycles.
Now lets look into the future of ENP. as we've discussed our strategy over the last couple of months with the Denbury management team has clearly agreed with the business strategy of the partnership and should the merger of EAC and Denbury be approved by their respective shareholders Denbury does not plan to change while its been a very successful strategy. Furthermore, they do plan to utilize the partnership most likely in a manner very similar to the parent-sponsor relationship with EAC at its share with ENP to the greater success of both entities. We have worked together with their management team to identify a number of properties that would make excellent drop down candidate as part of their de-leveraging process post merger.
Right now Denbury has its own ideas for different alternatives to use the partnership and the dropdown suggestions that we've made and they are going to look at these different scenarios over the next few months and do what makes sense to both the ENP unit holders and the Denbury shareholders. Looking to the future of ENP, we have every bit of confidence in the Denbury management team and their ability to continue on a successful path with ENP unit holders. 
Now I will turn it back over to Phil.

You know this program of two rigs is concentrating on some high quality locations in Charleston Bear Creek, Murphy Creek area and there are plans to possibly pick up a third rig in the second quarter of this year.

Welcome, everybody, to Denbury and ENP's first quarter 2010 conference call. We plan to cover Denbury first, then, we'll follow with an update on ENP, and then we'll open up for questions.
With me today, I have Tracy Evans, our President and COO, Mark Allen, our Senior Vice President and CFO, and Bob Cornelius, our Senior Vice President of Operations. As you've probably noticed, we continue to have a lot of activity and lot of several positive events. Since, our last call, we have obviously closed on the Encore acquisition. We have entered into an agreement to sell most of our Encore Southern region properties for $900 million, which will get our leverage back to near pre-acquisition levels.
And we have had earlier than expected EOR production from Delhi Field. If you can sort through all the unusual items in this quarter's financial statements, underneath it all things are on track or ahead of expectations. Mark will cover these numbers in a little bit more detail, but let me briefly hit a couple high points.
As you can see from our first quarter production, operationally things are going well, with total company production at 86,578 BOEs per day if you include a full quarter of results from Encore. And of course, our tertiary averaged 27,023. As a result, we are increasing our tertiary oil production forecasts from 27,000 barrels a day for 2010 to 27,750.
And we plan to update the total company production guidance at the upcoming analyst meeting, adjusting for property sales. Although, I can report that non tertiary production is generally on track with our original forecast. So, things are looking good there also.
Bob will give you more details on production from our EOR properties, and Tracy is going to cover the recent results from our acquired Bakken and Haynesville assets. Our results from the Bakken wells, we recently fact are looking good, but I'll let Tracy give you the details.
With regard to property sales, our initial bids on the Haynesville have been less than we hoped for, so at this point in time, a sale of that property doesn't look too promising. The good part is that there is no pressure to sell, since we have already reduced our leverage, and it shouldn't be any problem to wait a little while and see if we get some help later from natural gas prices.
We do plan to let our operated rig go after it completes the current well in progress, so we are reducing our activity a little bit in this region due to the natural gas prices, although, we will still spend money there this year as much of our acreage is non operated and we are still being AFE. The Haynesville properties are still up for sale, so if things change we could pull the trigger later on.
But with that introduction, let me turn over to Mark to review the numbers.
"
27490,104472256,59984,"Denbury Resources Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-06-2010",2010-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Denbury Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Phil. As reported in our press release, Denbury had net income for the first quarter of $96.9 million. However, as we mentioned in the year end conference call, our first quarter results would have a lot of noise with several unusual or non rec",1555,"Thank you, Phil. As reported in our press release, Denbury had net income for the first quarter of $96.9 million. However, as we mentioned in the year end conference call, our first quarter results would have a lot of noise with several unusual or non recurring items.
First, since we closed on the merger with Encore on March 9, our first quarter results only included the operations of Encore from March 9 through March 31. In connection with the merger, we expensed $45 million in acquisition costs in the first quarter, representing advisory fees, financing, legal, accounting, integration, et cetera, that related specifically to the merger transaction.
Second, we incurred approximately $6.9 million of incremental interest expense for approximately one month due to our early February issuance of $1 billion of senior subordinated notes to finance a portion of the merger and redeem approximately $600 million of Encore's subordinated debt upon completion of the merger.
Third, we sold our GP and LP interest in Genesis Energy during the first quarter, and recognized a gain of $101.6 million on those transactions. Fourth, we had non-cash gains on the change in fair value of our commodity derivative contracts of approximately $101 million, all of these items before income tax effects.
And then, lastly, as a result of the merger, we increased our statutory tax rate due to our mix of new states and applied a new deferred tax rate to our deferred tax balances. In doing this, we increased our deferred tax expense for the quarter by approximately $10 million.
When you adjust for these items on an after tax basis, our adjusted net income for the quarter would have been approximately $17.4 million, principally due to the fact that we had a significant amount of our oil hedged in the first quarter with swaps at an average price of approximately $51.85 per barrel. Those swaps were only in place for the first quarter and going forward we have a much better mix of hedges, primarily collars, with ceiling prices near or above current prices. Please review our 10-K and most recent 10-Q that we will be filing for a complete list of those contracts.
As we have typically done, I will primarily focus on the sequential results for the fourth quarter of 2009 and first quarter of 2010. During the first quarter of 2010, our tertiary production was 27,023 barrels per day, 3% higher than our Q4 tertiary production and on an overall basis, Denbury's legacy production increased by approximately 4%, after adjusting Q4 production for the Barnett Shale, to approximately 41,700 BOEs per day in the fourth quarter.
And again, primarily due to the tertiary increase in production from the Conroe Field, which we acquired in December of 2009. Including Encore's production for the partial month, our total production for the first quarter was 53,125 BOEs per day. If Encore's production would have been included for the entire first quarter, total production would have been approximately 86,578 BOEs per day, roughly 75% oil and 25% gas.
As Phil mentioned, we have increased our tertiary production guidance for the year and would expect our overall production to follow suit. However, we plan to provide more detail on the combined company for the rest of 2010, at our upcoming analyst meeting at the end of this month.
Our average oil price received for the quarter, including derivative settlements, was $60.60 per barrel in Q1, as compared to $72.67 per barrel in Q4. But if settlement, if derivative settlements are excluded, our average oil price received for the first quarter was $76.53 per barrel, as compared to $72.56 per barrel in Q4.
Our NYMEX oil price differential was $2.08 per barrel below NYMEX in the first quarter, as compared to $3.44 below NYMEX in Q4. Assuming we had included Encore's production for the entire first quarter, our NYMEX differential would have been approximately $3.77 per barrel below NYMEX in Q1.
Our total lease operating expense up approximately $12 million from the fourth quarter, and on a per-BOE basis, our overall lease operating expense costs were down slightly from $20.34 per BOE in Q4 to $20.12 per BOE in Q1, primarily due to increased production in the first quarter, in addition of the Encore properties for the partial period.
If Encore had been included in our LOE for the entire quarter, we estimate our LOE per BOE would have been approximately $17.07 per BOE in Q1. Going forward, I would expect our LOE per BOE to increase a couple of dollars from this pro forma number after we sell the Southern assets.
G&A expenses increased by $4.6 million from Q4 levels, due primarily to additional G&A from Encore for a partial month and incremental compensation associated with more employees and higher bonus accruals in Q1. In the first quarter, Encore added approximately $3.7 million to our G&A for the partial month and would likely add $11 million to $12 million to our G&A for an entire quarter.
In addition, we will have some increases to this amount during the year due to severance and other costs associated with integrating the two companies during 2010, possibly $3 million to $6 million per quarter. Interest expense net of capitalized interest increased sequentially from $10.5 million to $26.4 million, primarily related to incremental debt incurred to finance the Encore merger.
As mentioned above, we issued $1 billion of new sub debt in mid February and increased our borrowings under our credit agreement in financing the merger. Average debt outstanding was approximately $2.2 billion in Q1, as compared to $1.3 billion in Q4.
Capitalized interest was $21.3 million this quarter, as compared to $19.9 million last quarter, primarily due to incremental interest capitalized on the green pipeline. Going forward, we expect that our capitalized interest will continue to increase moderately until we put the green pipeline into service. A portion of the line is currently expected to be put into service around mid year 2010. After that, we would expect capitalized interest to decrease to approximately half of the current amount per quarter for the remainder of the year.
Our bank debt at March 31 was $800 million under our new bank credit line and we had $250 million outstanding on ENP's bank line. We also had $2.276 billion of senior subordinated debt outstanding, including approximately $100 million of Encore's subordinated debt that was not tendered in the original tender offer.
All but a few million of this $100 million was put to us in the change and control offer, which ended in mid April and we used $66 million of the remaining escrow from our $1 billion issuance to cover this redemption.
In addition to incremental bank borrowings. Upon completion of the Southern asset divestiture, currently anticipated for mid May, we would expect to have very little bank debt at that time, but based on our anticipated capital spending, which is in excess of cash flow for the remainder of 2010, we would expect to see our bank debt increase throughout the remainder of the year, as we plan to outspend our cash flow by approximately $150 million to $200 million during 2010.
We estimate that our debt to cap ratio of March 31, 2010, pro forma for the pending asset sale and repayment of the sub debt that was tendered in April, would be a respectable 36% and debt to estimated 2010 EBITDA would be in the mid twos to one range on a go forward basis. We are pleased to get our leverage back to these more normal levels.
Our capital expenditure budget for 2010 remains at $1 billion, excluding acquisitions, capitalized interest, and net of anticipated sale leasebacks of approximately $50 million. On a combined basis, the $1 billion would exceed our anticipated cash flow by approximately $150 million to $200 million, assuming 12 months of combined cash flows for the two companies and based on current commodity prices.
Our capital expenditures, assuming a combined company for the entire first quarter are estimated to be approximately $230 million, as compared to $167 million, which was reflected in our financial information for the first quarter.
Our DD&A for the oil and gas properties increased on a per-BOE basis due to the impact of the Encore merger, the purchase of Conroe Field in Q4, and to a lesser extent, the remaining sale of the Barnett Shale properties in Q4.
With regard to our income taxes, we currently anticipate that we will be able to deduct a large portion of the green pipeline when we put it in service and begin injecting CO2 into Oyster Bayou, currently anticipated around midyear 2010. This should help limit our current tax expense and help shield additional tax on asset dispositions.
As a result of the merger, we increased our statutory rate, as I mentioned earlier, due to our mix of new states, and as a result of that we had to apply a new deferred tax rate to our deferred tax balances. In doing this, we increased our deferred tax expense for the quarter and our overall effective tax rate.
Going forward, our tax rate should be at a more normalized 39% or 39.5% rate. However, this could change again, depending on asset sales and other items.
And with that, I'll pass it to Bob.

The EOR fields produced an average of 27,023 net BOEs during the first quarter. That's approximately a 3% increase over the fourth quarter and a 19% increase over the first quarter of 2009.
During the first quarter, we kicked off our 2010 CO2 EOR capital program, in which we plan to invest over $600 million EOR and CO2 development projects during the year. The major capital projects during 2010 are focused on key fields with investment designed to improve our operations and our growth rate during the next 12 months to 18 months.
Highlights of the first quarter were first EOR production and sales at Delhi, and then we also had double digit growth rates at Cranfield, Heidelberg, and Tinsley, as well as others.
First production and sales from Delhi was slightly ahead of schedule. If you recall, the CO2 injection was initiated during the fourth quarter of 2009, and then first CO2 EOR sales occurred during March of 2010. And unit production is ramping up nicely during March, averaging slightly above 300 net BOEs per day in that unit.
Production is expected to continue increasing during the year, as we add additional injection patterns and we see response from previously developed patterns. There is also a 28 well drilling program planned during the year, along with the expansion of the production in recycled facilities. At Cranfield, our Phase 4 CO2 project, production rates increased 28% quarter-to-quarter with an average first quarter production rate of 936 net BOEs per day.
We drilled four CO2 injection wells and one producer during the quarter. That should provide additional production growth later this year. On a side note concerning carbon capture and sequestration at Cranfield, Denbury and the Bureau of Economic Geology from the University of Texas have successfully and safely injected nearly 2 million tons of CO2 into Cranfield.
This joint project is demonstrating that CO2 injection into Saline Aquifers is a viable method of carbon capture and sequestration and we are pleased with the results of both our field operations and the information we were able to provide the scientific community, as well as the information we are receiving from the Bureau of Economic Geology and their important scientific work.
I am moving to Tinsley. Tinsley is our largest tertiary field based on natural production. It is located in Yazoo County, Mississippi, and it was approximately two miles from that devastating tornado that struck Mississippi in Yazoo County approximately two weeks ago.
Let you know our facility was undamaged. Although, we did lose electrical power for a short period, it only had a minor impact on our production rates. Tinsley Field continued to perform well during the first quarter, with a 12% production increase during the period. This is the second straight quarter where the unit experienced double digit growth and production increased from an average rate of approximately 2,390 BOEs per day in the first quarter of 2009 to 4,419 BOEs per day in the first quarter of 2010. That's an 85% increase over a 12 month period.
At the close of the first quarter of 2010, the unit now has over 27 CO2 injection wells and 61 unit producing wells. Injection volumes continue to increase and the Tinsley unit is expected to be one of our top performers during 2010.
Phase 2, consisting of Eucutta, Soso, Martinville, and Heidelberg, increased production approximately 3% quarter-to-quarter. Heidelberg's 13% and Martinville's 28% led the group with double-digit production increases during the period. Eucutta decreased 3% during the quarter, due a slight reduction in CO2 injection rates in prior periods.
The team is working to maintain CO2 injection rates and reserve and reservoir pressures. However, Eucutta is essentially developed, and so it has or is nearing its peak production rate. Soso production rate was flat quarter-to-quarter. The unit expansion continued at Soso with the installation of low pressure compressor and high pressure compression at the facilities.
Heidelberg continues to perform better than expected with an increasing production rate from an average of 1,506 net BOEs during the fourth quarter to 1,708 net BOEs during the first quarter of 2010. The next phase of unit expansion along with other 2010 capital investments should add production rates during the next two quarters.
Our Phase 1 fields, or the most mature areas that we operate, did not show a production increase quarter-to-quarter. They had a slight 2.5 decrease in production during the period. Phase 1 field Little Creek or Little Creek, Mallalieu, Brookhaven, McComb, Smithdale, and Lockhart Crossing. The most unanticipated increase was at Little Creek area, where production improved 12% from 1,480 net BOEs per day to 1,689 net BOEs per day.
Now, that production improvement during the quarter was due in large part to surveillance work conducted during 2009 that redirected CO2 into un-swept areas of the field. We see positive response to this WAG alternating gas, water/gas method test project at Little Creek.
This WAG project involves injecting nutrients to feed natural occurring bacteria into the formation. The nitrate rich water allows the bacteria to grow, which redirects the CO2 into other areas of the reservoir. The project has shown to increase aerial sweep efficiency and improve production. The team is considering expanding this WAG project to additional patterns and duplicate the success, if successful, this process could be applied to other fields in order to redirect CO2 into un-swept areas to recover additional oil.
Lockhart Crossing, Louisiana, tertiary production increased 10% quarter-to-quarter as production improved from 1,025 BOEs per day to 1,127 net BOEs per day over the period. The majority of the production increase is due to lower system pressures across the field, while maintaining reservoir bottom hole pressures. We continue to monitor reservoir performance and injection volumes to improve that production.
Moving to Jackson Dome, that's our CO2 source, it produced an average of 802 million cubic feet per day during the period. That's a 2% increase over the fourth quarter rate. [Phase 3 in Australia] was commissioned during the fourth quarter, and that allowed the addition of three wells that were not already producing. 2010 capital projects at Jackson Dome include the drilling of three wells and expansion or installation of dehydration facilities that we anticipate will improve production performance and add reserves.
Assuming things go as planned, we should have the results of our current well drilling at Jackson Dome by the analyst meeting later this month. This is an exploratory well. They're testing a target up to two tcf.
The Green Pipeline construction, recall that construction began back in November of 2008. The pipeline reached Oyster Bayou during December of 2009. And during the first quarter of 2010, valves, meters, and operation facilities were installed along the Louisiana portion of the pipeline. We completed the final tie in into the NEJD pipeline. That connects the Green Pipeline to the Jackson Dome.
The final commissioning work on this pipeline should be completed during May, with the first CO2 injection into Oyster Bayou commencing by mid year. There are three relative short segments of the pipeline to install this year to connect it to Hastings. There is a 20 mile piece from Oyster Bayou to the east side of Galveston Bay that work will begin during the next two weeks. We are already staging lay barges, moving pipe and equipment to get the 14 mile piece from across Galveston Bay, and that work will be completed in the next four to five months.
And then, we have another small segment 25 miles east of Galveston that will complete the pipeline into Hastings. All that work should be completed by the end of 2010. Going back to Oyster Bayou field, the work there is completed on the first several injection wells, and the team is preparing to lay flow lines to connect it to our CO2 source. Again, first production there is expected in May.
And then at Hastings, the technical team completed the initial pattern design and incorporated the reservoir modeling into the production and recycle facility. Injection is scheduled in early 2010, and Hastings EOR initial production is expected sometime late 2011.
I will turn it over to Tracy.

In the Bakken, we continue to manage two drilling rigs in the Bakken. A third rig is contracted and should be moving into the area within the next several weeks. We are just waiting on the [North Dakota Frost Law] to allow that rig to move into the area.
Our plans for 2010 are to generally drill in the various areas operating throughout our Bakken acreage, but the third rig is planned to be located primarily in the Cherry, Camp, and Indian Hills areas. Our production during the first quarter of 2010 within the Bakken averaged approximately about 3,560 BOEs per day, with a preliminary estimate for April's production averaging approximately 4,200 BOEs per day.
The increase in production from the first quarter to April is primarily due to the three wells that we had fracd in the Bakken during the first quarter in which now we have 30 day average gross production rates. The [Wayor] Trust 4434, which was a 19 stage frac on a 1,280 acre unit, had initial production of 2,532 BOEs per day. That well has first 30 day average of 768 BOEs per day.
The Porcupine Ridge, 14 35H, that's a 12 stage frac on a 640 acre unit at an IP of 1,681 BOEs per day and at a 30 day average of 518 BOEs per day. The final well in the first quarter that was fracd was the Porcupine Ridge, 11X 2H, which had a 12 stage frac again on a 640 acre unit. It had an IP of 1,885 BOEs per day with a 30 day average of 628 BOEs per day.
We are currently in the process of flowing back the [Swenson] 3133 SWH, which is a well in our Charleston area, which has very good early results, and we expected, again, to be, have an IP in the order of 850 BOEs a day. That was a 12 stage frac on a 640 acre unit. The Becker 247H in Murphy Creek was drilled on a 1,288 acre unit and had a 20 stage frac design,, while running down hole tools to perforate the 12th stage, we encountered some difficulties and had to suspend the remaining frac and completion work, we are in the process of preparing the well in order to finish that planned completion in the near future.
The [Gilbert 11-26H], another well in Charleston on a 640 acre unit, is currently drilled and awaiting completion operations. And the [Hensen 11-12H] is currently running a 4.5 inch liner to finish the drilling of that well, the Hensen well is in the Murphy Creek area as well.
The results of these first few wells we have fracd, and the results of the offset operators, we are doing a complete review and assessment of our Bakken acreage. This includes expected reserves, forecasted production rates and our current development plan, and we should have all this updated in the very near future.
Within the Haynesville, we drilled two operated wells, the [Renfro] 5-1H and the [Korbies] 20-2H in 2010. We completed the [Dun] 2-1, which was actually drilled in 2009 in the Renfro, and we are currently drilling a third well, the [Purvis] 20-3H. We have also participated in 10 non-operating wells during the first quarter of 2010.
The two Purvis wells are on the same path and thus the completion of those wells will follow the finalized drilling of the 20-3H probably in early June. First quarter production averaged approximately about 3,200 BOEs per day within the Haynesville, and our preliminary estimated April production averaged over 4,500 BOEs per day.
A total of 12 either 2009 spud wells began selling gas in the first quarter of 2010, two of which were operated wells for Denbury. Production is expected to increase, as we complete our remaining two wells and as the non operated wells and drilling programs continue.
Four wells in the Greenwood Waskom area were completed with average IPs of about 9 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter. Two non operated wells in the Kingston area were completed with average IPs of 25 million a day and one non operated well was completed in Caspiana at just under 9 million cubic feet per day.
In the Exxon joint venture, we maintained activity during the first quarter with two rigs running. One rig is focused on the Pegasus field with the drilling of the Wilson 46 number one and the Pegasus unit 44-7. The second rig was committed into the Delaware basin and drilled the Hodge 8-H during the first quarter. The completion of the Hodge is yet to occur, but should occur in late May. The assets associated with the Exxon joint venture are included in our planned sale of assets and is expected to close this month.
Just a brief note on our sale process. The due diligence on behalf of the purchaser is continuing, and they should be essentially complete in the next several days. Consents, pref rights, and other customer activities associated with a property package the size are ongoing, and that's why we expect to close the transaction by the month, as we had discussed.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Phil.

As most of you saw late last week, we announced that we were reviewing strategic alternatives for ENP. We've received numerous inquiries about the implications of this pending sale on our future plans for ENP, and I'd like to address that briefly.
As you also know, we recently announced that Denbury's entered into the agreement to sell most of the Southern region assets that we acquired through Encore, assets primarily in the Permian, Mid Continent, and East Texas. Several of these properties could have been potential dropdown candidates to ENP, given the nature of their reserves and production. But as a result of the sale, they will no longer be available for dropdowns, assuming the sale closes as expected.
Furthermore, most of Denbury's remaining assets require significant capital expenditures in order to recognize their potential value and therefore would not be appropriate properties to drop down to ENP and given the nature of our focused EOR strategy, it's unlikely we would acquire properties that are appropriate dropdown candidates in the future.
So, from Denbury's point of view, we want to explore growth strategies for ENP other than a traditional series of dropdowns from MLP's general partner. In light of these considerations, we intend to explore a broad range of strategic alternatives to enhance the value of ENP units, including but not limited to those involving a sale or merger of ENP or of Denbury's interest in the general partner. Quite simply, that means, we could possibly merge ENP with another MLP or we may sell the general partner interest of ENP to another entity.
But in either case, the goal would be to do a deal with someone that will continue to manage and grow ENP and we will attempt to structure any possible transaction such that it is not dilutive to cash flow per unit or asset value per unit.
One other thing, we'd like to accomplish in this strategic review is to find a way to recognize the potential value of CO2 tertiary projects that are in ENP, the biggest of which is [Upbasin] field. I think we'd all agree it is not practical to do an EOR flood within an MLP due to the substantial capital investments required for a tertiary flood. So, Denbury is reviewing alternative structures or transactions which could be pursued by ENP, Denbury, or a combination to allow development of this field, again the focus being without diluting the value of ENP's units or reducing ENP's distributions per unit.
Of course, there is no assurance that a review of strategic alternatives will result in the completion of any transaction. We are just getting started in this process, so we wouldn't anticipate having any news or updates on this for some time, and we likely won't announce anything until we have a specific transaction to discuss.
We need to agree on a specific transaction with another party. We need approval from the conflicts committee at the ENP Board, and we need sign off from the various investment bankers, who will be involved looking out for the various interests, as they will be providing fairness opinions. So, obviously, we have a lot to do, but our goal is to find something that will be positive for all concerned.
I think Mark will now review a little bit of the ENP numbers.

In determining this distribution, we continued to apply the variable distribution policy previously established.
Our cash available for distributions was $27.9 million in the first quarter, as compared to $36.7 million in the fourth quarter, the decrease principally due to lower cash receipts on commodity derivative settlements due to the expiration of favorable contracts in 2009 and higher lease operating expense due to work over expenses in the first quarter.
Our coverage ratio for the first quarter remained strong at above 1.2 times. Production for the first quarter totaled 9,034 BOE per day, as compared to 9,254 BOE per day in the fourth quarter of 2009. Going forward, we expect production to continue to be on a low decline for the remainder of 2010.
As mentioned in the press release, our G&A expense was higher in the current quarter due to two non cash items, the expensing of phantom units that vested upon the change of control when Denbury acquired Encore, and approximately $937,000 related to the bank debt waiver paid by Denbury that must be pushed down to the partnership, as an expense even though Denbury will not be reimbursed. We repaid $5 million in bank debt during the quarter, bringing our bank debt to $250 million at March 31.

Just in closing, I'd like to remind you, we have our annual meeting coming up May 19. I appreciate your support on the matters we are putting to a vote in that proxy.
Then later this month, toward the end of May, we are holding our spring analyst meeting during which we will provide more details on each of the operating areas, supplemented by additional financial data. At that time, we also hope to present some numbers showing what the company would look like following our asset sales, and we may also try to pull out ENP, since that is also potentially in progress.
We plan to use a similar approach as we did last spring, group presentation in New York, followed by one-on-ones with our entire senior management team, followed by a day in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles with Tracy and myself. So, if you want to schedule one-on-ones or check on any of the other planned conferences or trips, please contact [Lori Brooks], our IR manager in our office.
But most importantly, stay tuned. A lot of positive things are happening here at Denbury, and we look forward to a great 2010. Thank you.

Welcome everybody to Denbury and ENP second quarter conference call. Similar to last time, we plan to talk about Denbury first, then we’ll follow with an update on ENP and then open it up for questions.With me today, I have Tracy Evans, our",696,"Thank you. Welcome everybody to Denbury and ENP second quarter conference call. Similar to last time, we plan to talk about Denbury first, then we’ll follow with an update on ENP and then open it up for questions.
With me today, I have Tracy Evans, our President and COO; Mark Allen, our Senior VP and CFO; and Bob Cornelius, our Senior VP of Operations.
As you can see, things at Denbury are continuing to go well. As we highlighted in the press release, our production is ahead of forecast, expenses are on track or below and that’s always a nice combination which allowed us to beat the First Call earnings expectations by a few pennies.
Further, as you may notice, a significant portion of the green pipeline is now in service. We are also quite proud that we have replaced the proven reserves that we sold into our produced. As you can see, the value of the Encore assets we acquired are getting better and better as evidenced by our new estimate of the Bakken oil potential.
I might remind you that we didn’t pay much for that upside or non-proved reserves in our Encore transaction, and the fact that we’ve just added over 15 million BOEs of proven reserves in the Bakken, 12 million BOEs in the Haynesville, and now projected we could have up to 350 million BOEs of total Bakken potential, that’s up from Encore’s estimate of approximately 100 million barrels, illustrates the quality of the assets we acquired and, if you will, that the acquisition was a good deal.
The sale of the acquired southern Encore assets for $900 million was also a good value and also concluded sooner than expected. The point I am making is I want to reinforce what several of our shareholders are beginning to realize and that is the Encore acquisition was a good deal for us.
The other guys will walk you through the numbers and give you more details on this quarter’s news, but I think one of the things I am most proud of is that we maintained or exceeded our forecast in budgets during a time when there was an extra strain on our entire organization.
During the last several months, we have been actively moving forward, integrating Encore’s assets, systems, and personnel and we are far from done, but thanks to the diligent efforts of our employees all these extra work has not reduced the quality of our core operations and that is something I think all of us at Denbury can be proud of.
I think Tracy may give you a little update on divestitures, but we are about to send out a set of repackaged Haynesville assets. We have broken it up into smaller pieces, which we hope will be more attracted to the other operators by allowing them to limit the amount of non-operated interests they would be acquiring.
We are also marketing some other minor properties we acquired in the Encore acquisition, and our review of strategic alternatives for ENP is still ongoing. The ENP process has taken a bit longer than expected as we have been focused on a potential transaction on Elk Basin, one of the Rocky Mountain properties that we would like to flood with CO2 someday.
We are hopeful that we would be able to close on enough additional asset sales to fund the projected 2010 cash flow deficit as we are spending a bit more than we are making. If we accomplish this goal we will leave 2010 with very little or no bank debt, unless of course we buy something else. That would give us about $1.6 billon of dry powder for the future.
If these divestitures don’t materialize or close this year, we will simply dip into our almost unused bank credit line. Bottom line there are a lot of good things happening here at Denbury, the oil prices are even cooperating, most recently back in the low 80s in spite of a lethargic economy. It is definitely a good time to be an oil-focused independent.
Now let’s move on to details, Mark will give you a review of the financials.

As reported in our press release, Denbury had net income for the second quarter of $135.4 million, $0.34 per basic common share. However, net income adjusted to exclude fair value hedging changes, the Encore merger-related costs, and the",1283,"Thank you, Phil. As reported in our press release, Denbury had net income for the second quarter of $135.4 million, $0.34 per basic common share. However, net income adjusted to exclude fair value hedging changes, the Encore merger-related costs, and the impact from a change in our tax rate as a result of the southern asset sale was $72.9 million or $0.18 per share.
As we’ve typically done, I’ll primarily focus on the sequential results of the first and second quarters of 2010. During the second quarter of 2010, our tertiary production was 28,507 barrels per day, 5% higher than our Q1 tertiary production.
On a pro forma basis, excluding the production associated with the southern property sale and assuming the acquired Encore properties had been included in our first quarter results for the entire quarter, our overall production increased 5% sequentially to 78,545 BOEs per day in Q2 as compared to 74,489 BOEs per day in Q1. That increased primarily due to our tertiary Bakken and Haynesville production.
As previously discussed in our analyst conference a couple of months ago, our forecasted production for 2010 excluding the divested southern assets for the entire year was estimated at 76,650 BOEs per day.
With the increase in our tertiary production forecast from 27,750 barrels per day to 28,000 barrels per day, and a 5% increase in our Bakken production estimate to an average of 4,600 BOEs per day and a couple other minor changes, we are now increasing our pro forma 2010 production guidance excluding the southern assets to 77,000 BOEs per day.
Our average oil price received for the quarter including derivative settlements was $71.68 per barrel in Q2, as compared to $60.60 per barrel in Q1, but if derivative settlements are excluded our average oil price received for the second quarter was $73.99 per barrel as compared to $76.53 per barrel in Q1.
Our NYMEX oil price differential was $4.13 per barrel below NYMEX in the second quarter as compared to $2.08 per barrel below NYMEX in Q1, due primarily to the acquired Encore properties which typically have higher differentials. Assuming we had included Encore’s production for the entire first quarter, our NYMEX differential would have been $3.77 per barrel below NYMEX in Q1.
Differentials in our northern properties were negatively impacted during one month in the second quarter as a result of a temporary refinery shutdown. Our lease operating expense increased by $31.5 million from the first quarter, but on a per BOE basis, our overall lease operating costs were down from $20.12 per BOE in Q1 to $16.69 per BOE in Q2, primarily due to increased production, and addition of the Encore properties in our results for the full quarter and lower tertiary production costs primarily due to decrease in work over expenses.
If the southern property sales have been excluded from our results for the entire quarter, our LOE per BOE would have been approximately $17.12 per BOE in Q2 as compared to $18.69 per BOE in Q1. I would expect our LOE per BOE to be between these two numbers for the remainder of 2010, but favoring a number on the higher side for the rest of the year.
G&A expenses decreased by $1.5 million from Q1, even though the first quarter only included Encore for a partial period. The decrease between the quarters is due to the higher cost in Q1 associated with bonus and equity compensation, EOR related cost, cost associated with the sale of Genesis and higher overhead recoveries in Q2 related in part to our continued operating of the southern properties that we sold in mid-May.
Going forward, I would expect that our G&A will continue to increase as we add new employees throughout the year. Going forward, I’d expect our G&A per BOE to be more in line with our six-month average in the low-to-mid $5 per BOE range, but this could deviate somewhat.
We’ll continue to have ongoing merger-related cost associated with integration and severance, but we anticipate this amount will reduce significantly going forward to be more in the range of possibly $6 million or $7 million in the third quarter and $3 million to $4 million in the fourth quarter.
The vast majority of the expense in Q2 associated with severance-related costs as we’ve made significant progress with the integration of the Encore employees. Approximately $3.2 million of the Encore merger-related cost were non-cash expense associated with equity compensation for severed employees.
Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased sequentially from $26.4 million to $43.5 million, primarily related to incremental debt incurred to finance the Encore merger.
Average debt outstanding was $3.2 billion in Q2 as compared to $2.2 billion in Q1. Capitalized interest was $23.9 million this quarter as compared to $21.3 million last quarter, primarily due to incremental interest capitalized on the Green Pipeline.
Going forward, we expect our capitalized interest will decrease to around $10 million per quarter until the end of the year when we expect the rest of the Green Pipeline to be placed into service.
Our bank debt at June 30 was $40 million on a $1.6 billion credit line, as we have paid off most of our bank debt with proceeds from the southern property sale, and we had $245 million outstanding on ENP’s bank line. We also ended up with $2.176 billion of senior subordinated debt outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 8.5% after the completion of the tender offers for the Encore’s subordinated debt.
Based on our anticipated capital spending in excess of cash flows for 2010, we would expect to see our bank debt increase throughout the remainder of the year as we plan to outspend our cash flow by approximately $200 million to $300 million.
However, as Phil mentioned, if we are successful in closing on either the Haynesville sale or our ENP ownership the proceeds from either of these transactions would likely cover most of the deficit leaving us with little or no bank debt at year end.
Our debt-to-cap ratio at June 30 is a respectable 36%, and debt to estimated 2010 EBITDA would be in the mid 2 to 1 range going forward. We’re extremely pleased with our financial position, and the improvement of our leverage ratios set soon after the completion of the Encore acquisition.
Our capital expenditure budget for 2010 remains at $1.06 billion, excluding acquisitions and capitalized interest and net of approximately $50 million in anticipated sale leasebacks.
On a combined basis, the $1.06 billion would exceed our anticipated cash flows by approximately $200 million to $300 million, assuming 12 months of combined cash flow for the combined companies based on current commodity prices.
Our DD&A for the oil and gas properties decreased slightly on a per BOA basis from Q1 due primarily to the incremental proved reserves record in Q2, which Tracy will discuss more in a few minutes.
With regard to income taxes, we currently anticipate that we will able to deduct a large portion of our Green Pipeline that we put into service in mid-year when we begin injecting CO2 into Oyster Bayou. This should help to limit our current tax expense and help shield additional tax on asset dispositions.
As result of the sale of our southern properties in May, we’ve slightly lowered our statutory rate due to our mix of states and applied a new deferred tax rate to our deferred tax balance. In doing this, we decreased our deferred tax expense for the quarter and our effective rate. This should normalize to a rate around 39% going forward. However, future asset changes will also impact this rate.
With that, I’ll pass it to Tracy.

As we’ve reported in the press release, we added 65.4 million barrels or BOEs during the second quarter. The majority of these reserved additions were in our CO2 EOR projects at Delhi Field and our other CO2 projects.The largest reserve",958,"Thanks, Mark. As we’ve reported in the press release, we added 65.4 million barrels or BOEs during the second quarter. The majority of these reserved additions were in our CO2 EOR projects at Delhi Field and our other CO2 projects.
The largest reserve estimate we added was at Delhi Field, where we added 30 million barrels of reserves based on observing a significant and sustained response to the CO2. As the past practices, our initial crude reserve bookings were approximately 75%, about 13% recovery factor what we ultimately expect to be able to recover from the field.
If you compare the 30 million barrels to our prior presentations, you’ll notice that the Delhi net potential number was only 33 million barrels on those prior presentations. In addition to the proved bookings at Delhi, we’ve also increased our total potential reserves in Delhi to 38 million barrels, which equates to a 17% recovery factor.
Additional proved reserves were also added in the Heidelberg CO2 project. These reserves were added in areas of the field that were not initially considered to be part of the floodable area. And then based on performance of our CO2 projects at Tinsley and Lockhart Crossing Fields, we added additional proved reserves there as well.
Based on performance, the recovery factors were increased from the original estimates of 13% on a proved basis to 17% as performances dictated. As additional areas of these fields respond and as other fields’ performance dictates, the reserves in these additional areas and other fields will be adjusted accordingly.
We have completed our review of our Bakken acreage position and have estimated that the total potential as proved, probable and possible net reserves to our interest is approximately 350 million BOEs. This potential includes reserves associated with over 2,850 potential locations. The former Encore estimate included only two wells per unit and included only one reservoir. The current estimate includes three wells per reservoir per unit.
A vast majority of these future locations in excess of 90% are estimated to be on 1,280 acre unit. Forecast of the initial 30 day rates varied from 300 to 500 BOEs per day for wells drilled on 640 acre units and 400 to 900 BOEs per day for wells drilled on 1,280 acre units.
The higher 30 day rates are estimated for locations that are within the Nesson Anticline line and the lower rates are estimated for areas that are not located within the Nesson.
Gross estimated reserves for each location vary from a low of just over 200 million BOEs for the Almond and Northeast Foothills area to a high of approximately 675 million BOEs for 1,280 acre unit locations within the Nesson Anticline.
As we have discussed in prior meetings and presentations, Encore had drilled a few unsuccessful wells in the Almond and Northeast Foothills areas, so we have not estimated any additional potential in acreage north or east of these wells. However, about 10% of our total Bakken potential still relates to this area as it could be productive and the industry is moving in this direction.
We continue to monitor all data that is made available within the Bakken area and we’ll continue to review and update the reserves associated with our Bakken position based on new information.
Based on our expected five operated rig program and an estimated 10 plus non-operated rig program, we expect our production rates in the Bakken to increase dramatically over the next 18 months.
Preliminarily, we are estimating our average 2011 net production rate to double our 2010 forecast and have a production rate of 4,600 BOEs per day. As we get greater clarity on other operators’ plans for 2011, we will be able to refine and report our estimated production rate for the Bakken and other properties.
Reserve additions in the Bakken during the second quarter were 15.2 million BOEs based on the results of ours and others drilling operations. This increase essentially doubled our proved reserves associated with our Bakken position. Based on our expected drilling plan over the next several years, we expect to continually add significant proved reserves within the Bakken.
The other area with significant reserve additions during the second quarter was our Haynesville area, where 12 million BOEs were added as a result of our drilling program during the year. While we have released our operated drilling rig there, there are still typically five to six non-operated rigs running in which we are participating.
We have yet to complete our remaining two operated wells that have been drilled and cased. We expect both of these wells to be completed by the end of the quarter and thus expect a production boost from these wells and other non-operated wells during the fourth quarter.
Finally, as Phil mentioned, I’ll give you a brief comment on our divesture efforts. We have closed, as we’ve announced on as August 1st transferred operatorship to Quantum for the assets involved in our southern asset divestiture.
We have begun marketing our remaining East Texas, North Louisiana, and Haynesville assets at this time and should have that out in the next few weeks. Assuming we receive an acceptable offer for these assets, closing is not expected until sometime in the fourth quarter.
We’re also marketing our Cleveland Sand Play in Northwest Oklahoma, which we acquired as part of the Encore acquisition. We’re expecting bids on the Cleveland Sand Play imminently and assuming we receive an acceptable offer, we would expect to close this sale during the third quarter. Assuming we are successful in all these divestiture efforts, we will have essentially completed our rationalization efforts outlined as part of the Encore acquisition strategy.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Bob to talk about operations.

I’ll give you a quick update on the major CO2 EOR fields and some of Bakken activity that we had during the second quarter.Tertiary production averaged 28,507 net BOEs per day for the quarter. That’s an increase of 1,484 net B",1980,"Yes. Thank you, Tracy. I’ll give you a quick update on the major CO2 EOR fields and some of Bakken activity that we had during the second quarter.
Tertiary production averaged 28,507 net BOEs per day for the quarter. That’s an increase of 1,484 net BOEs or about 5% compared to the first quarter of 2010, and then based on this increase in tertiary production rates, we are raising our average daily tertiary production guidance to 28,000 net BOEs average for the year.
We currently have 14 different fields under CO2 injection in six of our eight phases of expansion. With this limited time provided, I can’t go over all of them in detail, but I will touch on the highlights of the major fields. But overall, we continue to have a great success in our CO2 operations, with four of our fields exhibiting double-digit production growth during this quarter.
Phase 1 fields consisting of the six field areas in Southwest Mississippi increased by 382 BOEs per day or 3% increase over the first quarter, with an average daily rate of 12,347 net BOEs per day. The Little Creek area, the most matured area we operate, had a second quarter of double-digit growth.
The field averaged 1,971 net BOEs per day during the quarter, that’s a16.6% increase over the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to response from a long-term non-responding wells and result of the WAG which is a Water Alternating Gas injection test that performed much better than expected.
During the quarter, this WAG program was expanded to two more Little Creek patterns in a high recovery area to test the potential of additional reserve recovery using this method.
At Brookhaven Field, we also established a four-patterned WAG program during May in our area that needs improvement. We are optimizing additional oil production; we will establish WAG in that area, we’d hope to see production by year end.
At McComb Smithdale, we decreased production by 129 net BOEs per day on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but at McComb, we have four wells that were drilled in the expansion area. They are being completed now. These wells should hopefully help us out, as we go through the year, to have positive impact on our production rates.
In the Mallalieu area, we increased production by 185 net BOEs or 5 percentage quarter-to-quarter, and at Lockhart Crossing, it continues to perform better than forecasted with the production growth of 16% plus quarter-to-quarter. Impact from five new wells should allow Lockhart Crossing to continue to increase further during the third and the fourth quarters of 2010.
Phase II experienced a 187 net barrel reduction in rate as compared to the first quarter; however, Heidelberg, about a 149 net BOEs per day increased 8.7% on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Our operational team continues to aggressively expand Heidelberg flood and expect to complete additional well sites and placed over 20 wells on line during the third quarter of this year.
Eucutta experienced 168 net BOE per day decrease. Eucutta is essentially fully developed, so we will continue to exhibit a decline. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, Soso Field was flat to last quarter and isn’t expected to change much for the rest of the year.
Martinville is where the smaller floods in Phase 2 has fluctuated up and down over the last couple of years, it decreased to 163 barrels per day in the second quarter.
For those of you that follow Denbury closely, you know that our Phase 3 EOR CO2 area is Tinsley Field. This reservoir continues to perform better than predicted. Tinsley Field increased 829 net BOEs per day, almost 19% quarter-to-quarter with a second quarter average production rate of 5,248 BOEs per day.
The addition of six wells in the Unit C’s [ph] fault block, there in the quarter along with other responding wells made the third consecutive quarter production increases with double digits.
Tinsley was aggressively expanded during 2009 and we continue to increase well count and our proved facility this year. We plan to invest in excess of $50 million into the Tinsley project during 2010.
Phase 4 is Cranfield, production decreased slightly, 125 net BOEs per day quarter-to-quarter. The decline is partly due to delay in our drilling program. The drilling rig we had under contract we used to develop other Denbury tertiary field during the first and second quarters, but the rig has now returned to Cranfield and it’s now in operations. We will drill and complete the 12 wells 2010 capital drilling program during the third and fourth quarters of this year.
At Delhi, which is our Phase 5, CO2 expansion continues in the (inaudible) Tuscaloosa formations. Purchased CO2 injection increased to an average 84 million cubic feet a day during the quarter. As the reservoir pressure increases, additional oil response is expected during the year.
Second quarter average production was 648 net BOEs per day, that’s up from 63 BOEs per day during the first quarter. The EOR production continues to run above forecast as a result of earlier than expected response and then currently 16 wells are flowing into the production system at various flow rates and oil rates, and we have completed our 20 well 2010 drilling program and we’ll continue to expand the facilities there at Delhi.
Phases 7 and 8 are the Hastings and Oyster Bayou Field respectively, those filed of course are located along the Texas Gulf Coast. Progress in both fields is moving forward and on schedule. Oyster Bayou began injection on June 29. The current injection rate is approximately 44 million cubic feet a day at the three wells. And the first EOR production there is not expected until the second half of 2011.
Development continues with three capital rigs at Oyster Bayou along with the construction of our production and compression facilities. Hastings, we are running five capital rigs there, with current existing wells for CO2 injection, sometime early 2011 or late this year.
Jackson Dome, we need to talk about, our average production was 768 million cubic feet a day during the second quarter, that’s slightly ahead of our forecasted CO2 volumes. The drydock well, which is the Denbury 2916 #1 will be tested in the next few weeks, and this well should be placed in production during late 2010 or early 2011.
Currently, we also have two drilling rigs operated in the Gluckstadt field, which will increase our CO2 production levels later in 2010 or possibly 2011. These wells could also improve or increase our proved reserve if the field is found to have multiple fault blocks or separate compartments. Additional CO2 production from these wells will ensure that we have the deliverability to continue our field expansions along the Gulf Coast and Mississippi.
The 24-inch Green Pipeline construction was completed at the Oyster Bayou field late last year, and the first 260 miles were successfully packed and commissioned and is now transporting about 44 million cubic feet a day into Oyster Bayou. Now we have three remaining segments of the pipeline and those should be completed late this year to the Hastings field.
We have 19 miles from Oyster Bayou to the east side of Galveston Bay, and that will be hydrostatic tested either late August or the first week of September. The 14 miles of Galveston Bay crossing is underway, we have several miles of pipeline already constructed and we’ve already completed the drill on the Houston ship channel.
And then we have the remaining 25 miles on the west side of Galveston Bay, that’s underway. We have about 30% of the pipeline welled in. Like I said, our goal is to have the Green Pipeline in service to Hastings by year end or early 2011.
Moving from the Gulf Coast to Rocky Mountains, our 20 inch Green core pipeline is a 230 mile pipeline running from Lost Cabin, Wyoming up to Bell Creek, Montana. Right of ways in survey are undergoing with 95% of the surveys complete and about 41 of the right of way has been acquired.
We have preliminary engineering, it’s completed, finalizing the design pipe specifications. We work on the environmental assessment and the project should have a target start date of August 2011.
Bell Creek flood in Montana will be the first Rocky Mountain Denbury EOR flood, and we are right now recompleting idle water injection wells to CO2 service. Thus far 17 wells have been prepared for CO2 injection. We expect to have an additional 12 injection wells completed by the year end. That project start date will be sometime late 2012 or early 2013.
Mark mentioned lease operating expenses from the combined company. They decreased on a unit basis from $20.12 of BOE during the first quarter to $16.69 BOEs in second quarter. As we go through the year, we expect them to average slightly above $18 per BOE and we hope to maintain that expense rate.
If you look back and review the legacy Denbury lease operating expenses, they decreased 2% or $0.51 net BOE quarter-to-quarter from $22.86 in net BOE to $22.35 in net BOE. Electrical and fuel cost decreased, mostly that was 3.9%. Work-over cost also decreased 21%, primarily due to the operational improvements and procedures that we’ve instituted related to remedial work on the CO2 injection wells.
Contract labor did increase 22% due to capital activity and the contracting plan op raise during our expansions and startups. We continue to review our LOE cost, like changes to our process and procedures to hopefully maintain those levels.
Moving to the Williston Basin, North Dakota, we currently have three rigs working the Bakken formation. We contracted a fourth rig to commence drilling operations during September of 2010. Our fifth drilling rig is also planned to start drilling operations in the first quarter of 2011.
We have completed five Bakken wells to date and another three are in the process of being completed. One thing that we commonly do with the method of evaluating reserves potential is to just look at the average production rates for the first 30, 60, 90 days of production. The majority of our wells show pretty good response.
Early on, we completed Porcupine wells in March. We had one well that is the Sanish well on 640 acre, 12 stage frac. The 60-day average there was about 385 BOEs per day and the Porcupine also a Bakken well 640 acre, 12 stage at an average rate of over 498 BOEs per day for 60-day average.
The Werre Trust, another well in the Sanish area, which was 1280 acre, 19 stage, had a 60-day average of over 900 barrels oil per day. And then the last two that we have 60-day averages on are the Swenson, Charlson, Bakken completion 640 acre, 12 stage.
That well had a 60-day average of 873 BOEs per day and our Gilbertson, Charlson, Bakken well again a 640 acre, 12 stage at 619 average BOEs per day. I think Mark is going to put this information out on our web page in the next 24 to 48 hours.
Partly the Haynesville, Denbury has drilled three operating wells during 2010. Although we have ceased drilling operations and released our drilling rig there we are continuing to participate in wells operated by Chesapeake, JW, Blackhawk, Chemtura, El Paso, (inaudible) and to-date Denbury has participated in gross 23 wells during the year and expected to participate in additional nine gross wells AP [ph] by these operators.
Haynesville production in the second quarter averaged 3931 net BOEs per day. Production expected to fluctuate in the Haynesville depending on the timing of these completions, but we have two remaining wells Denbury operated that will be fraced before the end of the third quarter and that should also add to our rate during the third quarter.
With that, I’ll return it to Phil.

So that’s all good news for Denbury, let’s turn now to ENP, I’ve already kind of mentioned that the ENP strategic process is ongoing and it’s taken a bit long than we expected because we’ve been focused on the transaction at Elk Basin, but Mark will give you a brief update on the ENP numbers.

Cash available for distribution in Q2 was $25 million as compared to $27.9 million in Q1, lower due primarily to lower production, price realization, and incremental G&A expense of $1 million associated with the hiring of investment advisor by the Conflicts Committee of the Board of Directors.
Our coverage ratio for the first quarter was just under 1.1 times. Production for the second quarter totaled 8,841 BOEs per day as compared to 9,034 BOEs per day in the first quarter of 2010. Going forward, we expect our production to continue to be on a gradual decline for the remainder of 2010. We repaid $5 million in bank debt during the quarter, bringing our bank debt to $245 million at June 30.

Similar to our normal style, we will cover Denbury first, and then follow with an update on ENP, and then open it up for questions. With me today I have Tracy Evans, our President and COO; Mark Allen, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Bob Cornelius, our Senior Vice President of Operations.
Operations and performance at Denbury continue to go well and 2010 is shaping up to be a great year for us. I won’t spend a lot of time reviewing 2010 today, but as I did last time, I want to commend our employees for their hard work in handling and absorbing all of the extra work generated by this constant stream of transactions and activity this year, primarily related to the Encore acquisition in March.
It’s a tribute to our employees that we have been able to outperform and exceed our 2010 projections in almost every way, while still handling all of the transition and other extra work generated by our acquisitions and divestitures.
Our asset sales have exceeded their projected upper limit of $1 billion by $150 million or so, and we still have one potential sale transaction in the works, and that’s the sale of ENP.
We’ve not only cleaned up our balance sheet and reduced the debt incurred for the Encore acquisition, but we’ve provided sufficient capital to fund almost all of our 2010 spending. If ENP closes, we’ll have also raised enough funds to more than cover 2011 as well.
Further, while our asset sales have achieved the desired results, or if you want to put it in another way, we’ve basically sold these assets to more than we paid for them, I think it’s important to note that after raising more than $1 billion from asset sales, we still have more proved reserves today than we did in March when we closed Encore. We plan to provide more details on this at our forthcoming Analyst Meeting, but I thought it might be good just to remind you of these highlights.
Looking more specifically at this quarter, our tertiary production is doing very well, ahead of forecast again. Expenses are on track. So, those always make a nice combination. Our Green Pipeline is almost finished.
We’ve added 1 Tcf of proved reserve this year at Jackson Dome, we just closed on Riley Ridge, which gives us a lot of optionality for CO2 in the Rockies and we expect to close on the Haynesville in early December.
As I mentioned we would last quarter, we remarketed these assets, and as part of that effort, received what we perceive to be a good price for these properties, at least, in today’s natural gas market. Of course, our primary reason to sell these assets is to focus our capital expenditures and attention on our core EOR assets and the Bakken where we believe we have better returns in today’s commodity price environment.
Conceptually, the funds that were invested in Haynesville in 2010 will be reallocated to the Bakken in 2011. This sale will slightly lower our overall 2011 production growth as the Haynesville wells are high rate wells on a Boe basis that we believe that the quality and economics of our investments will be better without these gassy assets. We are still hopeful that we can sell ENP by year-end, although, admittedly, we are getting late in the year, but our goal is still to do that.
So, with that introduction, I’ll let the other guys walk you through the quarter in more details, starting with Mark.

As reported in our press release, Denbury had net income for the third quarter of $29.1 million or $0.07 per basic common share.

As reported in our press release, Denbury had net income for the third quarter of $29.1 million or $0.07 per basic common share. However, our net income adjusted to exclude fair value hedging changes, Encore merger-related costs and the impact from a revision to our accounting for CO2 discovery cost was $52.7 million or $0.13 per share.
As I’ve typically done, I will primarily focus on the sequential results of the second and third quarters of 2010. During the third quarter of 2010, our tertiary production averaged 29,531 barrels per day, 4% higher than our Q2 tertiary production.
As you recall, last quarter we increased our annual 2010 tertiary production guidance to 28,000 barrels per day, and we are now increasing it again to 28,750 barrels per day due to the continued production increases during the third quarter. Bob will discuss more about that momentarily.
As updated at the end of Q2, our forecasted production for 2010, excluding the divested southern assets for the entire year, was estimated at 77,000 Boe per day, which includes 8,600 Boe per day associated with Encore Energy Partners or ENP.
With the announced sale of our Haynesville and East Texas assets and the sale of our Cleveland Sand assets, we have revised our annual 2010 estimated production excluding all asset sales to approximately 70,000 BOE per day, including approximately 8,600 BOE per day associated with ENPs production.
Our production for Q3, adjusted to exclude production associated with all asset divestitures, was approximately 71,824 BOE per day, including 8,630 BOE per day related to ENP.
We anticipate that our fourth quarter production excluding production associated with Haynesville and East Texas asset sale, which will not be included in our results until closing, will be about the same or slightly higher than our adjusted third quarter average. We plan to provide more information regarding our production guidance for the rest of 2010 and 2011 at our upcoming Analyst Meeting.
Our average oil price received for the quarter including derivative settlements was $71.63 per barrel in Q3 as compared to $71.68 per barrel in Q2. Our NYMEX oil price differential was $3.85 per barrel below NYMEX in the third quarter as compared to $4.13 per barrel below NYMEX in Q2.
Differentials in our northern properties were negatively impacted during a portion of both the second and third quarters as a result of a temporary refinery shutdown in pipeline shutdown, although much of the differential was offset by higher net prices for a Gulf Coast production.
Although our lease operating expenses were approximately 3% from Q2 and Q3, our lease operating expenses on a per BOE basis increased more significantly from $16.69 per BOE in Q2 to $18.43 per BOE in Q3. The increase on a per BOE basis was due primarily to higher workover cost in Q3 and the impact of the asset of the sales which had a lower cost per BOE.
Excluding the LOE in production associated with the Haynesville sale from our results, our Q3 LOE per BOE would have been approximately $19.62 per BEO. I would expect our LOE per BOE to be in the low to mid $19 million going forward.
G&A expenses increased by $5.9 million from $4.07 per barrel in Q2 to $5.19 per BEO in Q3, due primarily to higher personnel related costs and/or production as a result of the asset sales. Going forward, I’d expect our G&A to increase slightly as we continue to add new employees.
We’ll continue to have ongoing merger-related cost associated with integration and severance, but we anticipate this month to be lower going forward depending on severance cost which accounted for the best majority of our cost of Q3. Approximately $1.8 million of the Q3 Encore merger-related costs were still associated with non-cash equity compensation expense for severed employees.
Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased sequentially from $43.5 million to $53.3 million, primarily related to lower capitalized interest in Q3 due to a portion of the Green Pipeline being placed into service at the end of the second quarter.
Capitalized interest was $10.9 million this quarter as compared to $23.9 million last quarter. Average debt outstanding was $2.8 billion in Q3 as compared to $3.2 billion in Q2, as our proceeds from the southern asset sale in mid Q2 went to pay down our bank debt.
Going forward, we expect that our capitalized interest will be around $10 million in the fourth quarter depending on when the rest of the Green Pipeline is placed into service.
We currently anticipate that the remaining portion of the Green Pipeline to be placed into service around the end of 2010. For 2011, we expect capitalized interest per quarter to be slightly lower once the Green Pipeline goes into service.
Our bank debt at September 30 was $120 million on a $1.6 billion bank credit line and we had $240 million outstanding on ENP’s bank line. Our bank debt is currently $225 million after closing the Riley Ridge acquisition, but we expect to repay a significant portion of this with the proceeds from the Haynesville sale, which should close by the first part of December.
Our anticipated capital spending for 2010, excluding acquisitions and capitalized interest remains at $1.06 billion, and we currently anticipate that our bank debt would be around $100 million at year end depending of timing of capital expenditures.
For 2011, we preliminary see our capital expenditures around $1 billion, potentially $100 million to $200 million above anticipated cash flows. However, as Phil mentioned, if we are successful in selling our ENP ownership, the proceeds from that would most likely cover all and most of this shortfall.
Our DD&A per BOE was $15.61 per BOE in Q3 as compared to $16.88 per BOE in Q2. As mentioned in our press release, we revised our accounting for CO2 properties in Q3 which resulted in a pre-tax credit of $9.6 million due to the cumulative effect on DD&A related to prior periods. Without this adjustment, our DD&A per BOE would have been $16.95 per BOE slightly higher than our Q2 average.
As a result of our accounting change, we may incur expense in future periods that funds our spent in search of CO2 reserves on properties with no existing proved or probable reserves. We expensed $1.2 million associated with these costs in Q3.
With regard to income taxes, we currently anticipate that during 2010, we will be able to deduct the cost of our Green Pipeline that we put into service mid-year and to deduct the cost of the remaining portion of the Green Pipeline if we put into service before year end. This should help to limit our current tax expense and help to show additional tax on asset dispositions.
We continue to see our current tax increase slightly due primarily to state taxes, but state taxes on asset sales may not be completely offset and our taxable income continues to increase with higher oil prices.
With that, I’ll pass it to Tracy.

As we released several weeks ago, we have added an additional Tcf of CO2 reserves in the Jackson Dome area during 2010, approximately 400 Bcf in our DRI Dock prospect and approximately 600 Bcf as a result of our Anderson well at Gluckstad",1019,"Thank you, Mark. As we released several weeks ago, we have added an additional Tcf of CO2 reserves in the Jackson Dome area during 2010, approximately 400 Bcf in our DRI Dock prospect and approximately 600 Bcf as a result of our Anderson well at Gluckstadt field, which encountered original reservoir pressure, confirming our geological interpretation that faults within the Gluckstadt field are sealing, and therefore, the field may contain even greater volumes of CO2.
3D seismic interpretation of the Gluckstadt field indicates that our additional fault block is similar to the fault block the Anderson well was drilled, but additional drilling will be required to test and prove up the additional CO2 reserves in these unreal fault blocks.
In our DRI Dock prospect, production testing and 3D seismic interpretation resulted in reducing the original reserve potential of the prospect, but the prospect will add additional CO2 deliverability as well as the 400 Bcf of additional proved CO2 reserves.
There continues to be a considerable amount of technical work ongoing in the Jackson Dome area, and while DRI Dock’s potential reserves is reduced based on our additional testing and the three seismic interpretations, the potential reserves at Gluckstadt has increased based on the results of the Anderson well coupled with the 3D seismic over Gluckstadt.
As a result of all these efforts in the Jackson Dome area, we have added an additional Tcf of proved CO2 reserves, while maintaining our probable reserve potential between 2 and 3 Tcf of CO2 reserves in the Jackson Dome area.
We have completed our drilling program for 2010 in Jackson Dome area and we’ll begin additional drilling during the first quarter of 2011. We have delivered an excess of 1 Bcf of CO2 per day from Jackson Dome on several occasions to-date, and thus, we are very confident of delivering the CO2 volumes required for our CO2 EOR operations going forward.
As well with our Jackson Dome work, we continue to work with potential sources of anthropogenic CO2 in the Gulf Coast and the Rocky Mountains. Activity in many of our contract at anthropogenic sources appears to be moving forward again, with hope that several of these projects will reach the financing stage by year-end or early first quarter with construction phase starting shortly thereafter.
As we have previously announced, we have closed our acquisition of a 42.5% non-operated working interest in the Riley Ridge project in Southwest Wyoming. This project is located in the prolific LaBarge field and will produce methane, helium and CO2.
First production is expected in late 2011, but that time all CO2 volumes will be re-injected back into the reservoir. The timing of capture and transportation of the CO2 from the project to the EOR fields remains uncertain at this time as we continue to negotiate for additional CO2 volumes.
At the present time, we have not signed any additional contracts for CO2 volumes, but are working to finalize several contracts and we continue to work with existing and new projects to acquire additional CO2 volumes in the Gulf Coast and in the Rocky Mountains.
Switching to the Bakken, we operated three rigs during the entire third quarter. Initially we expected to complete and bring on five additional wells during the quarter, but due to casing issues we were only able to bring two of the five wells on production. One additional well was completed, but due to a well control incident on another well on the same pad, the completed well remain shut-in at this time.
The fifth well expected to be completed in the quarter developed the casing issue within a liner during stimulation and that stimulation work had to be suspended. The liner has been repaired and we are preparing to finish the stimulation and completion on the well within the next couple of weeks. Although the two completion issues are extremely disappointing, we are certain that we will get both wells completed and put online in the near future.
Obviously, our expected third quarter production was effective substantially, and while we will bring on the three wells planned in the third quarter during the fourth quarter as well as our recently planned fourth quarter wells, it will be difficult to achieve our expected annual average production in the block in the 4,600 BOEs per day.
While we will most likely be short on the industry average, we expect to meet our originally expected exit rate and may actually exceed it, with up to eight wells being completed and brought online during the quarter, barring any other unforeseen delays.
To-date, in the fourth quarter the Jorgenson 34-9 and the Joseph 11-1H were initially tested at 1,472 and 1,329 BOEs per day, respectively, and we expect to have an additional four wells brought on production, hopefully, by the end of the month based on our current completion schedule.
Looking toward 2011, our fourth rig is currently being mobilized to its location in the Cherry area and the fifth rig is expected to arrive during the last week of November and it will be located in the Cherry area as well. While neither of these rigs will contribute to the production in the fourth quarter, our 2011 drilling program appears to be slightly ahead of schedule.
We have secured three fracs per month and are still working to secure the fourth, which is expected to be sufficient to manage our five rig drilling program for 2011.
While the availability of frac crews is still very tight, we have been able to obtain the necessary frac dates for wells that were delayed due to the completion issues we experienced without compromising our completion schedule on future wells.
On the completion side, we are continuing to evaluate our results as well as our results of completions performed and wells where we have a non-operated position. We expect to provide additional information on our expected completions at our upcoming Analyst Meeting as well as in our 2011 expected annual production from the Bakken.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Bob to discuss CO2 EOR operations and operations in general.

27490,114699948,85443,"Denbury Resources Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Denbury Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy. I’ll give you guys a quick update on the major CO2 EOR fields, their production rates and pipeline construction progress during the third quarter.As reported tertiary production averaged 29,531 net BOEs for the quarter, that’s an i",1582,"Thank you, Tracy. I’ll give you guys a quick update on the major CO2 EOR fields, their production rates and pipeline construction progress during the third quarter.
As reported tertiary production averaged 29,531 net BOEs for the quarter, that’s an increase of 1,024 net BOEs a 3%, 4% and 5% compared to the second quarter 2010. Based on this increase in tertiary production, we are raising average daily tertiary production guidance to 28,750 net BOEs for the year, that’s an 18% increase year-over-year in average EOR production rates.
With the addition of the Oyster Bayou field earlier this year, we now have 14 different field areas under CO2 injection in six of our nine CO2 expansion areas. Overall, we continue to have great success in EOR operations with five of our fields exhibiting double digit production growth during the third quarter. I’ll break these down by phases.
Phase 1, which is of course our most mature area consisted of six field in Southwest Mississippi, one in Louisiana. That increased 32 barrels per day over the second quarter with an average daily rate of 12,281 net BOEs per day.
McComb, Smithdale area increased in average of 325 net BOEs per day or 15% quarter-to-quarter. The increase is due to four well drilling program or pattern expansion at West McComb area that was completed during the period.
Brookhaven quarterly production averaged 3,323 net BOEs, a slight increase over the second quarter due to a single well completion during September. That well responded within an initial production rate in excess of 800 BOEs per day on a gross basis and of course, this well is expected to decline from these production rates during the next quarter, but the production rate from this well illustrates a potential of a mature CO2 tertiary program.
Also, in Brookhaven, a four-well WAG pattern, that’s Water Alternating Gas program was initiated during September in an area of the reservoir that required injection profile improvements. Several wells with high GORs, that’s CO2 to oil production rates, were tested to establish a base line production.
In water, CO2 injection cycles began in late June. Now we anticipate additional oil production to be established from this WAG tests started by year end.
Lockhart Crossing, which is a location of our analyst tour, is going to be later this month. That continues to perform better than expected with third quarter production exceeding the second quarter performance by 197 barrels with a growth of 15% quarter-to-quarter.
At Lockhart Crossing, the team continues to closely monitor the reservoir pressure, they have added producing wells, they have also added a booster pump to improve CO2 injection rates. This is seven consecutive quarters that Lockhart Crossing has increased production rates.
The Mallalieu field actually decreased about 349 net BOEs per day or 10% quarter-to-quarter because Mallalieu is a mature CO2 field and most likely continued this decline over time.
Jumping to Page 2, we experienced 261 net BOE or 3% increase in production rate as compared to the second quarter. Heidelberg had a 950 net BOE per day increase or 51% quarter-to-quarter. The team continues to aggressively expand the Heidelberg CO2 field and added approximately 20 wells, they were placed online during the quarter.
On a quarter-to-quarter basis Soso field was 191 net BOEs or 6% less than the second quarter. Soso filed is nearing its peak production with probably only one near-term injection pattern to be developed in the Bailey zone.
Eucutta field produces an average of 341 net BOEs less than the second quarter. That decline was due to a facility downtime associated with maintenance of heat exchangers at that main facility.
In Phase 3, Tinsley increased 776 net BOEs per day or almost 15% quarter-to-quarter. The reservoir continues to perform better than predicted and is now our highest volume EOR field with an average third quarter production rate of 6,024 BOE net barrels.
Tinsley aggressively developed during 2010 with an investment in excess to $50 million. They added well count and expanded separation and recycled facilities during the year. Well work and infrastructure continues in the east fault block, that is the largest fault block during the fourth quarter, and we’ll continue to boost and improve production through the end of the year.
Cranfield is a Phase 4 field. It increased 5%, or 43 net BOEs quarter-to-quarter. As previously reported, the 2010 drilling program was delayed slightly. The drilling rig did return in August to complete the program.
Jet pumps were also installed or will be installed upon initial completion of the producing wells. These jet pumps will allow new wells to be placed on line and on production quicker than waiting for the reservoir itself to respond. We have used jet pumps in other fields to improve response time in oil production so we should see continued improvement in the rates at Cranfield.
Delhi is our Phase 5. We had a 20 well drilling program and that work is being completed. Production flow lines and injection lines will be completed in connected to test sites one, two during the fourth quarter. CO2 injection rates will increase once these injection lines are tied in. So we are expecting improvement in production at Delhi.
Third quarter production averaged 511 net BOEs per day, which was a slight decline over the prior quarter. This decline rate was due to production been shut into a flow line that had to be repaired.
Phase 7 and 8 development is moving forward and on schedule. As stated before, Oyster Bayou began injection in June. Currently CO2 injection in Aneth field averages 77 million cubic feet a day in the five wells. We have two rigs completing wells for both production and injection.
We are waiting for our Corp of Engineers permit to start our CO2 injection facility in the field. That permit has taken slightly longer than anticipated. It’s probably something that’s probably a bit more common these days. We are hoping that that permit will be granted in the next 30 days, and if so, we would expect initial production from Oyster Bayou to be about a year from now, November, December 2011. At our Hastings field we are running six capital rigs, preparing the CO2 injection for December 2010 as the Green Pipeline nears its completion phase.
Shifting to the Green Pipeline, construction is almost finished to Hastings in the Galveston Bay. The pipeline has been completely welded out. It is being filled for hydro testing. The pipeline on the west side of the Bay is also completely welded out.
We are doing a final tie-in and that work should be completed in the next week. The line is scheduled for hydro testing in approximately two weeks. Testing and commissioning the pipeline should be completed and the line completely in service and delivering CO2 to the Hastings field by year-end.
Once the Green line is completed, we’ll move to the Conroe line. We are working right now on the engineering design of that Conroe line. We are looking to pose right away environmental permit for the Conroe line. That Conroe line would be 80 to 85 mile 20-inch line that will go from southwest to Beaumont into the Conroe field. We are currently estimating the pipeline will be completed around 2014, another four-year project.
The 20-inch Greencore Pipeline is the 232 mile pipeline running from Lost Cabin, Wyoming up to Bell Creek field in Montana. The right-of-way survey is ongoing with 97% of the survey completed and offers made to 100% right-of-way owners and about 55% of those owners have been signed up.
Preliminary engineering is completed on that line. We are looking at pipe specifications. We’ve placed an order for about 50% of the 20-inch pipe. We worked on the environmental assessment, which is moving along as scheduled.
The first 115 miles of that pipeline are targeted for construction during August through December of next year, and then the remaining 117 miles will be completed in August through December of 2012. So we should have injection in the Bell Creek sometime late 2012.
We are working with Bell Creek field in Southern Montana. That will be our first Rocky EOR project. We are preparing the idle wells for CO2 injection in service. So far we have 31 injection wells, which have been prepared for injection and we are expecting to complete the additional 10 injection wells to be reworked by year-end.
I want to also point out, Tracy mentioned Jackson Dome, we have produced an average of 866 million cubic feet a day during the third quarter, slightly higher than forecasted, and also as he pointed out, we did have a BCF production out of those wells. So we do have the rate at Jackson Dome to sustain our operations.
Lease operating expense, third quarter consolidated operating expenses were $131 million, which Mark reported, approximately 3% greater than the second quarter of 2010. Our lease operating costs increased $1.74. If you break that in, the reasons for those increases, first one was increased workover expenses at the CO2 fields.
We are trying to accelerate some of that work before cold weather slips in. We also had to re-class of certain salary expenses from G&A to LOE on the Encore legacy properties. And then, finally, the divestiture of the southern assets, which had a lower operating cost per BOE that caused our cost in the third quarter to increase.
With that, I’ll turn it back over to Phil.

Our cash available for distribution in Q3 was $24.7 million as compared to $25 million in Q2, lower due primarily to lower production and price realization.
Our coverage ratio for the third quarter was just under 1.1 times. However, on a year-to-date basis, it was at 1.13 times. Production for the third quarter totaled 8,630 BOE per day as compared to 8,841 BOE per day in the second quarter of 2010. Going forward, we expect production to continue to be on a gradual decline for the remainder of 2010. We repaid $5 million in bank debt during the quarter, bringing our bank debt to $240 million at September 30.

Welcome everybody to Denbury and ENP second quarter conference call. Similar to last time, we plan to talk about Denbury first, then we’ll follow with an update on ENP and then open it up for questions.With me today, I have Tracy Evans, our",696,"Thank you. Welcome everybody to Denbury and ENP second quarter conference call. Similar to last time, we plan to talk about Denbury first, then we’ll follow with an update on ENP and then open it up for questions.
With me today, I have Tracy Evans, our President and COO; Mark Allen, our Senior VP and CFO; and Bob Cornelius, our Senior VP of Operations.
As you can see, things at Denbury are continuing to go well. As we highlighted in the press release, our production is ahead of forecast, expenses are on track or below and that’s always a nice combination which allowed us to beat the First Call earnings expectations by a few pennies.
Further, as you may notice, a significant portion of the green pipeline is now in service. We are also quite proud that we have replaced the proven reserves that we sold into our produced. As you can see, the value of the Encore assets we acquired are getting better and better as evidenced by our new estimate of the Bakken oil potential.
I might remind you that we didn’t pay much for that upside or non-proved reserves in our Encore transaction, and the fact that we’ve just added over 15 million BOEs of proven reserves in the Bakken, 12 million BOEs in the Haynesville, and now projected we could have up to 350 million BOEs of total Bakken potential, that’s up from Encore’s estimate of approximately 100 million barrels, illustrates the quality of the assets we acquired and, if you will, that the acquisition was a good deal.
The sale of the acquired southern Encore assets for $900 million was also a good value and also concluded sooner than expected. The point I am making is I want to reinforce what several of our shareholders are beginning to realize and that is the Encore acquisition was a good deal for us.
The other guys will walk you through the numbers and give you more details on this quarter’s news, but I think one of the things I am most proud of is that we maintained or exceeded our forecast in budgets during a time when there was an extra strain on our entire organization.
During the last several months, we have been actively moving forward, integrating Encore’s assets, systems, and personnel and we are far from done, but thanks to the diligent efforts of our employees all these extra work has not reduced the quality of our core operations and that is something I think all of us at Denbury can be proud of.
I think Tracy may give you a little update on divestitures, but we are about to send out a set of repackaged Haynesville assets. We have broken it up into smaller pieces, which we hope will be more attracted to the other operators by allowing them to limit the amount of non-operated interests they would be acquiring.
We are also marketing some other minor properties we acquired in the Encore acquisition, and our review of strategic alternatives for ENP is still ongoing. The ENP process has taken a bit longer than expected as we have been focused on a potential transaction on Elk Basin, one of the Rocky Mountain properties that we would like to flood with CO2 someday.
We are hopeful that we would be able to close on enough additional asset sales to fund the projected 2010 cash flow deficit as we are spending a bit more than we are making. If we accomplish this goal we will leave 2010 with very little or no bank debt, unless of course we buy something else. That would give us about $1.6 billion of dry powder for the future.
If these divestitures don’t materialize or close this year, we will simply dip into our almost unused bank credit line. Bottom line there are a lot of good things happening here at Denbury, the oil prices are even cooperating, most recently back in the low 80s in spite of a lethargic economy. It is definitely a good time to be an oil-focused independent.
Now let’s move on to details, Mark will give you a review of the financials."
27490,109885904,2468081,"Denbury Resources Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-05-2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Denbury Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Phil. As reported in our press release, Denbury had net income for the second quarter of $135.4 million, $0.34 per basic common share. However, net income adjusted to exclude fair value hedging changes, the Encore merger-related costs, and the",1283,"Thank you, Phil. As reported in our press release, Denbury had net income for the second quarter of $135.4 million, $0.34 per basic common share. However, net income adjusted to exclude fair value hedging changes, the Encore merger-related costs, and the impact from a change in our tax rate as a result of the southern asset sale was $72.9 million or $0.18 per share.
As we’ve typically done, I’ll primarily focus on the sequential results of the first and second quarters of 2010. During the second quarter of 2010, our tertiary production was 28,507 barrels per day, 5% higher than our Q1 tertiary production.
On a pro forma basis, excluding the production associated with the southern property sale and assuming the acquired Encore properties had been included in our first quarter results for the entire quarter, our overall production increased 5% sequentially to 78,545 BOEs per day in Q2 as compared to 74,489 BOEs per day in Q1. That increased primarily due to our tertiary Bakken and Haynesville production.
As previously discussed in our analyst conference a couple of months ago, our forecasted production for 2010 excluding the divested southern assets for the entire year was estimated at 76,650 BOEs per day.
With the increase in our tertiary production forecast from 27,750 barrels per day to 28,000 barrels per day, and a 5% increase in our Bakken production estimate to an average of 4,600 BOEs per day and a couple other minor changes, we are now increasing our pro forma 2010 production guidance excluding the southern assets to 77,000 BOEs per day.
Our average oil price received for the quarter including derivative settlements was $71.68 per barrel in Q2, as compared to $60.60 per barrel in Q1, but if derivative settlements are excluded our average oil price received for the second quarter was $73.99 per barrel as compared to $76.53 per barrel in Q1.
Our NYMEX oil price differential was $4.13 per barrel below NYMEX in the second quarter as compared to $2.08 per barrel below NYMEX in Q1, due primarily to the acquired Encore properties which typically have higher differentials. Assuming we had included Encore’s production for the entire first quarter, our NYMEX differential would have been $3.77 per barrel below NYMEX in Q1.
Differentials in our northern properties were negatively impacted during one month in the second quarter as a result of a temporary refinery shutdown. Our lease operating expense increased by $31.5 million from the first quarter, but on a per BOE basis, our overall lease operating costs were down from $20.12 per BOE in Q1 to $16.69 per BOE in Q2, primarily due to increased production, and addition of the Encore properties in our results for the full quarter and lower tertiary production costs primarily due to decrease in work over expenses.
If the southern property sales have been excluded from our results for the entire quarter, our LOE per BOE would have been approximately $17.12 per BOE in Q2 as compared to $18.69 per BOE in Q1. I would expect our LOE per BOE to be between these two numbers for the remainder of 2010, but favoring a number on the higher side for the rest of the year.
G&A expenses decreased by $1.5 million from Q1, even though the first quarter only included Encore for a partial period. The decrease between the quarters is due to the higher cost in Q1 associated with bonus and equity compensation, EOR related cost, cost associated with the sale of Genesis and higher overhead recoveries in Q2 related in part to our continued operating of the southern properties that we sold in mid-May.
Going forward, I would expect that our G&A will continue to increase as we add new employees throughout the year. Going forward, I’d expect our G&A per BOE to be more in line with our six-month average in the low-to-mid $5 per BOE range, but this could deviate somewhat.
We’ll continue to have ongoing merger-related cost associated with integration and severance, but we anticipate this amount will reduce significantly going forward to be more in the range of possibly $6 million or $7 million in the third quarter and $3 million to $4 million in the fourth quarter.
The vast majority of the expense in Q2 associated with severance-related costs as we’ve made significant progress with the integration of the Encore employees. Approximately $3.2 million of the Encore merger-related cost were non-cash expense associated with equity compensation for severed employees.
Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased sequentially from $26.4 million to $43.5 million, primarily related to incremental debt incurred to finance the Encore merger.
Average debt outstanding was $3.2 billion in Q2 as compared to $2.2 billion in Q1. Capitalized interest was $23.9 million this quarter as compared to $21.3 million last quarter, primarily due to incremental interest capitalized on the Green Pipeline.
Going forward, we expect our capitalized interest will decrease to around $10 million per quarter until the end of the year when we expect the rest of the Green Pipeline to be placed into service.
Our bank debt at June 30 was $40 million on a $1.6 billion credit line, as we have paid off most of our bank debt with proceeds from the southern property sale, and we had $245 million outstanding on ENP’s bank line. We also ended up with $2.176 billion of senior subordinated debt outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 8.5% after the completion of the tender offers for the Encore’s subordinated debt.
Based on our anticipated capital spending in excess of cash flows for 2010, we would expect to see our bank debt increase throughout the remainder of the year as we plan to outspend our cash flow by approximately $200 million to $300 million.
However, as Phil mentioned, if we are successful in closing on either the Haynesville sale or our ENP ownership the proceeds from either of these transactions would likely cover most of the deficit leaving us with little or no bank debt at year end.
Our debt-to-cap ratio at June 30 is a respectable 36%, and debt to estimated 2010 EBITDA would be in the mid 2 to 1 range going forward. We’re extremely pleased with our financial position, and the improvement of our leverage ratios set soon after the completion of the Encore acquisition.
Our capital expenditure budget for 2010 remains at $1.06 billion, excluding acquisitions and capitalized interest and net of approximately $50 million in anticipated sale leasebacks.
On a combined basis, the $1.06 billion would exceed our anticipated cash flows by approximately $200 million to $300 million, assuming 12 months of combined cash flow for the combined companies based on current commodity prices.
Our DD&A for the oil and gas properties decreased slightly on a per BOA basis from Q1 due primarily to the incremental proved reserves record in Q2, which Tracy will discuss more in a few minutes.
With regard to income taxes, we currently anticipate that we will able to deduct a large portion of our Green Pipeline that we put into service in mid-year when we begin injecting CO2 into Oyster Bayou. This should help to limit our current tax expense and help shield additional tax on asset dispositions.
As result of the sale of our southern properties in May, we’ve slightly lowered our statutory rate due to our mix of states and applied a new deferred tax rate to our deferred tax balance. In doing this, we decreased our deferred tax expense for the quarter and our effective rate. This should normalize to a rate around 39% going forward. However, future asset changes will also impact this rate.
With that, I’ll pass it to Tracy."

As we’ve reported in the press release, we added 65.4 million barrels or BOEs during the second quarter. The majority of these reserved additions were in our CO2 EOR projects at Delhi Field and our other CO2 projects.The largest reserve",958,"Thanks, Mark. As we’ve reported in the press release, we added 65.4 million barrels or BOEs during the second quarter. The majority of these reserved additions were in our CO2 EOR projects at Delhi Field and our other CO2 projects.
The largest reserve estimate we added was at Delhi Field, where we added 30 million barrels of reserves based on observing a significant and sustained response to the CO2. As the past practices, our initial crude reserve bookings were approximately 75%, about 13% recovery factor what we ultimately expect to be able to recover from the field.
If you compare the 30 million barrels to our prior presentations, you’ll notice that the Delhi net potential number was only 33 million barrels on those prior presentations. In addition to the proved bookings at Delhi, we’ve also increased our total potential reserves in Delhi to 38 million barrels, which equates to a 17% recovery factor.
Additional proved reserves were also added in the Heidelberg CO2 project. These reserves were added in areas of the field that were not initially considered to be part of the floodable area. And then based on performance of our CO2 projects at Tinsley and Lockhart Crossing Fields, we added additional proved reserves there as well.
Based on performance, the recovery factors were increased from the original estimates of 13% on a proved basis to 17% as performances dictated. As additional areas of these fields respond and as other fields’ performance dictates, the reserves in these additional areas and other fields will be adjusted accordingly.
We have completed our review of our Bakken acreage position and have estimated that the total potential as proved, probable and possible net reserves to our interest is approximately 350 million BOEs. This potential includes reserves associated with over 2,850 potential locations. The former Encore estimate included only two wells per unit and included only one reservoir. The current estimate includes three wells per reservoir per unit.
A vast majority of these future locations in excess of 90% are estimated to be on 1,280 acre unit. Forecast of the initial 30 day rates varied from 300 to 500 BOEs per day for wells drilled on 640 acre units and 400 to 900 BOEs per day for wells drilled on 1,280 acre units.
The higher 30 day rates are estimated for locations that are within the Nesson Anticline line and the lower rates are estimated for areas that are not located within the Nesson.
Gross estimated reserves for each location vary from a low of just over 200 million BOEs for the Almond and Northeast Foothills area to a high of approximately 675 million BOEs for 1,280 acre unit locations within the Nesson Anticline.
As we have discussed in prior meetings and presentations, Encore had drilled a few unsuccessful wells in the Almond and Northeast Foothills areas, so we have not estimated any additional potential in acreage north or east of these wells. However, about 10% of our total Bakken potential still relates to this area as it could be productive and the industry is moving in this direction.
We continue to monitor all data that is made available within the Bakken area and we’ll continue to review and update the reserves associated with our Bakken position based on new information.
Based on our expected five operated rig program and an estimated 10 plus non-operated rig program, we expect our production rates in the Bakken to increase dramatically over the next 18 months.
Preliminarily, we are estimating our average 2011 net production rate to double our 2010 forecast and have a production rate of 4,600 BOEs per day. As we get greater clarity on other operators’ plans for 2011, we will be able to refine and report our estimated production rate for the Bakken and other properties.
Reserve additions in the Bakken during the second quarter were 15.2 million BOEs based on the results of ours and others drilling operations. This increase essentially doubled our proved reserves associated with our Bakken position. Based on our expected drilling plan over the next several years, we expect to continually add significant proved reserves within the Bakken.
The other area with significant reserve additions during the second quarter was our Haynesville area, where 12 million BOEs were added as a result of our drilling program during the year. While we have released our operated drilling rig there, there are still typically five to six non-operated rigs running in which we are participating.
We have yet to complete our remaining two operated wells that have been drilled and cased. We expect both of these wells to be completed by the end of the quarter and thus expect a production boost from these wells and other non-operated wells during the fourth quarter.
Finally, as Phil mentioned, I’ll give you a brief comment on our divesture efforts. We have closed, as we’ve announced on as August 1st transferred operatorship to Quantum for the assets involved in our southern asset divestiture.
We have begun marketing our remaining East Texas, North Louisiana, and Haynesville assets at this time and should have that out in the next few weeks. Assuming we receive an acceptable offer for these assets, closing is not expected until sometime in the fourth quarter.
We’re also marketing our Cleveland Sand Play in Northwest Oklahoma, which we acquired as part of the Encore acquisition. We’re expecting bids on the Cleveland Sand Play imminently and assuming we receive an acceptable offer, we would expect to close this sale during the third quarter. Assuming we are successful in all these divestiture efforts, we will have essentially completed our rationalization efforts outlined as part of the Encore acquisition strategy.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Bob to talk about operations."

I’ll give you a quick update on the major CO2 EOR fields and some of Bakken activity that we had during the second quarter.Tertiary production averaged 28,507 net BOEs per day for the quarter. That’s an increase of 1,484 net B",1980,"Yes. Thank you, Tracy. I’ll give you a quick update on the major CO2 EOR fields and some of Bakken activity that we had during the second quarter.
Tertiary production averaged 28,507 net BOEs per day for the quarter. That’s an increase of 1,484 net BOEs or about 5% compared to the first quarter of 2010, and then based on this increase in tertiary production rates, we are raising our average daily tertiary production guidance to 28,000 net BOEs average for the year.
We currently have 14 different fields under CO2 injection in six of our eight phases of expansion. With this limited time provided, I can’t go over all of them in detail, but I will touch on the highlights of the major fields. But overall, we continue to have a great success in our CO2 operations, with four of our fields exhibiting double-digit production growth during this quarter.
Phase 1 fields consisting of the six field areas in Southwest Mississippi increased by 382 BOEs per day or 3% increase over the first quarter, with an average daily rate of 12,347 net BOEs per day. The Little Creek area, the most matured area we operate, had a second quarter of double-digit growth.
The field averaged 1,971 net BOEs per day during the quarter, that’s a16.6% increase over the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to response from a long-term non-responding wells and result of the WAG which is a Water Alternating Gas injection test that performed much better than expected.
During the quarter, this WAG program was expanded to two more Little Creek patterns in a high recovery area to test the potential of additional reserve recovery using this method.
At Brookhaven Field, we also established a four-patterned WAG program during May in our area that needs improvement. We are optimizing additional oil production; we will establish WAG in that area, we’d hope to see production by year end.
At McComb Smithdale, we decreased production by 129 net BOEs per day on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but at McComb, we have four wells that were drilled in the expansion area. They are being completed now. These wells should hopefully help us out, as we go through the year, to have positive impact on our production rates.
In the Mallalieu area, we increased production by 185 net BOEs or 5 percentage quarter-to-quarter, and at Lockhart Crossing, it continues to perform better than forecasted with the production growth of 16% plus quarter-to-quarter. Impact from five new wells should allow Lockhart Crossing to continue to increase further during the third and the fourth quarters of 2010.
Phase II experienced a 187 net barrel reduction in rate as compared to the first quarter; however, Heidelberg, about a 149 net BOEs per day increased 8.7% on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Our operational team continues to aggressively expand Heidelberg flood and expect to complete additional well sites and placed over 20 wells on line during the third quarter of this year.
Eucutta experienced 168 net BOE per day decrease. Eucutta is essentially fully developed, so we will continue to exhibit a decline. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, Soso Field was flat to last quarter and isn’t expected to change much for the rest of the year.
Martinville is where the smaller floods in Phase 2 has fluctuated up and down over the last couple of years, it decreased to 163 barrels per day in the second quarter.
For those of you that follow Denbury closely, you know that our Phase 3 EOR CO2 area is Tinsley Field. This reservoir continues to perform better than predicted. Tinsley Field increased 829 net BOEs per day, almost 19% quarter-to-quarter with a second quarter average production rate of 5,248 BOEs per day.
The addition of six wells in the Unit C’s [ph] fault block, there in the quarter along with other responding wells made the third consecutive quarter production increases with double digits.
Tinsley was aggressively expanded during 2009 and we continue to increase well count and our proved facility this year. We plan to invest in excess of $50 million into the Tinsley project during 2010.
Phase 4 is Cranfield, production decreased slightly, 125 net BOEs per day quarter-to-quarter. The decline is partly due to delay in our drilling program. The drilling rig we had under contract we used to develop other Denbury tertiary field during the first and second quarters, but the rig has now returned to Cranfield and it’s now in operations. We will drill and complete the 12 wells 2010 capital drilling program during the third and fourth quarters of this year.
At Delhi, which is our Phase 5, CO2 expansion continues in the (inaudible) Tuscaloosa formations. Purchased CO2 injection increased to an average 84 million cubic feet a day during the quarter. As the reservoir pressure increases, additional oil response is expected during the year.
Second quarter average production was 648 net BOEs per day, that’s up from 63 BOEs per day during the first quarter. The EOR production continues to run above forecast as a result of earlier than expected response and then currently 16 wells are flowing into the production system at various flow rates and oil rates, and we have completed our 20 well 2010 drilling program and we’ll continue to expand the facilities there at Delhi.
Phases 7 and 8 are the Hastings and Oyster Bayou Field respectively, those filed of course are located along the Texas Gulf Coast. Progress in both fields is moving forward and on schedule. Oyster Bayou began injection on June 29. The current injection rate is approximately 44 million cubic feet a day at the three wells. And the first EOR production there is not expected until the second half of 2011.
Development continues with three capital rigs at Oyster Bayou along with the construction of our production and compression facilities. Hastings, we are running five capital rigs there, with current existing wells for CO2 injection, sometime early 2011 or late this year.
Jackson Dome, we need to talk about, our average production was 768 million cubic feet a day during the second quarter, that’s slightly ahead of our forecasted CO2 volumes. The drydock well, which is the Denbury 2916 #1 will be tested in the next few weeks, and this well should be placed in production during late 2010 or early 2011.
Currently, we also have two drilling rigs operated in the Gluckstadt field, which will increase our CO2 production levels later in 2010 or possibly 2011. These wells could also improve or increase our proved reserve if the field is found to have multiple fault blocks or separate compartments. Additional CO2 production from these wells will ensure that we have the deliverability to continue our field expansions along the Gulf Coast and Mississippi.
The 24-inch Green Pipeline construction was completed at the Oyster Bayou field late last year, and the first 260 miles were successfully packed and commissioned and is now transporting about 44 million cubic feet a day into Oyster Bayou. Now we have three remaining segments of the pipeline and those should be completed late this year to the Hastings field.
We have 19 miles from Oyster Bayou to the east side of Galveston Bay, and that will be hydrostatic tested either late August or the first week of September. The 14 miles of Galveston Bay crossing is underway, we have several miles of pipeline already constructed and we’ve already completed the drill on the Houston ship channel.
And then we have the remaining 25 miles on the west side of Galveston Bay, that’s underway. We have about 30% of the pipeline welled in. Like I said, our goal is to have the Green Pipeline in service to Hastings by year end or early 2011.
Moving from the Gulf Coast to Rocky Mountains, our 20 inch Green core pipeline is a 230 mile pipeline running from Lost Cabin, Wyoming up to Bell Creek, Montana. Right of ways in survey are undergoing with 95% of the surveys complete and about 41 of the right of way has been acquired.
We have preliminary engineering, it’s completed, finalizing the design pipe specifications. We work on the environmental assessment and the project should have a target start date of August 2011.
Bell Creek flood in Montana will be the first Rocky Mountain Denbury EOR flood, and we are right now recompleting idle water injection wells to CO2 service. Thus far 17 wells have been prepared for CO2 injection. We expect to have an additional 12 injection wells completed by the year end. That project start date will be sometime late 2012 or early 2013.
Mark mentioned lease operating expenses from the combined company. They decreased on a unit basis from $20.12 of BOE during the first quarter to $16.69 BOEs in second quarter. As we go through the year, we expect them to average slightly above $18 per BOE and we hope to maintain that expense rate.
If you look back and review the legacy Denbury lease operating expenses, they decreased 2% or $0.51 net BOE quarter-to-quarter from $22.86 in net BOE to $22.35 in net BOE. Electrical and fuel cost decreased, mostly that was 3.9%. Work-over cost also decreased 21%, primarily due to the operational improvements and procedures that we’ve instituted related to remedial work on the CO2 injection wells.
Contract labor did increase 22% due to capital activity and the contracting plan op raise during our expansions and startups. We continue to review our LOE cost, like changes to our process and procedures to hopefully maintain those levels.
Moving to the Williston Basin, North Dakota, we currently have three rigs working the Bakken formation. We contracted a fourth rig to commence drilling operations during September of 2010. Our fifth drilling rig is also planned to start drilling operations in the first quarter of 2011.
We have completed five Bakken wells to date and another three are in the process of being completed. One thing that we commonly do with the method of evaluating reserves potential is to just look at the average production rates for the first 30, 60, 90 days of production. The majority of our wells show pretty good response.
Early on, we completed Porcupine wells in March. We had one well that is the Sanish well on 640 acre, 12 stage frac. The 60-day average there was about 385 BOEs per day and the Porcupine also a Bakken well 640 acre, 12 stage at an average rate of over 498 BOEs per day for 60-day average.
The Werre Trust, another well in the Sanish area, which was 1280 acre, 19 stage, had a 60-day average of over 900 barrels oil per day. And then the last two that we have 60-day averages on are the Swenson, Charlson, Bakken completion 640 acre, 12 stage.
That well had a 60-day average of 873 BOEs per day and our Gilbertson, Charlson, Bakken well again a 640 acre, 12 stage at 619 average BOEs per day. I think Mark is going to put this information out on our web page in the next 24 to 48 hours.
Partly the Haynesville, Denbury has drilled three operating wells during 2010. Although we have ceased drilling operations and released our drilling rig there we are continuing to participate in wells operated by Chesapeake, JW, Blackhawk, Chemtura, El Paso, (inaudible) and to-date Denbury has participated in gross 23 wells during the year and expected to participate in additional nine gross wells AP [ph] by these operators.
Haynesville production in the second quarter averaged 3931 net BOEs per day. Production expected to fluctuate in the Haynesville depending on the timing of these completions, but we have two remaining wells Denbury operated that will be fraced before the end of the third quarter and that should also add to our rate during the third quarter.
With that, I’ll return it to Phil."

Our coverage ratio for the first quarter was just under 1.1 times. Production for the second quarter totaled 8,841 BOEs per day as compared to 9,034 BOEs per day in the first quarter of 2010.

What you’ll probably see depending on what happens with the sale of Haynesville, the Haynesville number could go away completely or at least go down and maybe a little bit, but you’re going to spend a little bit more in the Bakken because we’re going to add rigs.
So, I mean that’s kind of the high level, but the conceptual deal is just we haven’t given precise numbers. That depending on prices may still be a little bit above our cash flow, but it’s obviously, much less, and we expect it to be less than this year just because we expect some production increases. 2012 that’s a little further out, but I don’t think conceptually that will be too much different either.

Welcome everybody to Denbury and ENP second quarter conference call. Similar to last time, we plan to talk about Denbury first, then we’ll follow with an update on ENP and then open it up for questions.With me today, I have Tracy Evans, our",696,"Thank you. Welcome everybody to Denbury and ENP second quarter conference call. Similar to last time, we plan to talk about Denbury first, then we’ll follow with an update on ENP and then open it up for questions.
With me today, I have Tracy Evans, our President and COO; Mark Allen, our Senior VP and CFO; and Bob Cornelius, our Senior VP of Operations.
As you can see, things at Denbury are continuing to go well. As we highlighted in the press release, our production is ahead of forecast, expenses are on track or below and that’s always a nice combination which allowed us to beat the First Call earnings expectations by a few pennies.
Further, as you may notice, a significant portion of the green pipeline is now in service. We are also quite proud that we have replaced the proven reserves that we sold into our produced. As you can see, the value of the Encore assets we acquired are getting better and better as evidenced by our new estimate of the Bakken oil potential.
I might remind you that we didn’t pay much for that upside or non-proved reserves in our Encore transaction, and the fact that we’ve just added over 15 million BOEs of proven reserves in the Bakken, 12 million BOEs in the Haynesville, and now projected we could have up to 350 million BOEs of total Bakken potential, that’s up from Encore’s estimate of approximately 100 million barrels, illustrates the quality of the assets we acquired and, if you will, that the acquisition was a good deal.
The sale of the acquired southern Encore assets for $900 million was also a good value and also concluded sooner than expected. The point I am making is I want to reinforce what several of our shareholders are beginning to realize and that is the Encore acquisition was a good deal for us.
The other guys will walk you through the numbers and give you more details on this quarter’s news, but I think one of the things I am most proud of is that we maintained or exceeded our forecast in budgets during a time when there was an extra strain on our entire organization.
During the last several months, we have been actively moving forward, integrating Encore’s assets, systems, and personnel and we are far from done, but thanks to the diligent efforts of our employees all these extra work has not reduced the quality of our core operations and that is something I think all of us at Denbury can be proud of.
I think Tracy may give you a little update on divestitures, but we are about to send out a set of repackaged Haynesville assets. We have broken it up into smaller pieces, which we hope will be more attracted to the other operators by allowing them to limit the amount of non-operated interests they would be acquiring.
We are also marketing some other minor properties we acquired in the Encore acquisition, and our review of strategic alternatives for ENP is still ongoing. The ENP process has taken a bit longer than expected as we have been focused on a potential transaction on Elk Basin, one of the Rocky Mountain properties that we would like to flood with CO2 someday.
We are hopeful that we would be able to close on enough additional asset sales to fund the projected 2010 cash flow deficit as we are spending a bit more than we are making. If we accomplish this goal we will leave 2010 with very little or no bank debt, unless of course we buy something else. That would give us about $1.6 billion of dry powder for the future.
If these divestitures don’t materialize or close this year, we will simply dip into our almost unused bank credit line. Bottom line there are a lot of good things happening here at Denbury, the oil prices are even cooperating, most recently back in the low 80s in spite of a lethargic economy. It is definitely a good time to be an oil-focused independent.
Now let’s move on to details, Mark will give you a review of the financials."

As reported in our press release, Denbury had net income for the second quarter of $135.4 million, $0.34 per basic common share. However, net income adjusted to exclude fair value hedging changes, the Encore merger-related costs, and the",1283,"Thank you, Phil. As reported in our press release, Denbury had net income for the second quarter of $135.4 million, $0.34 per basic common share. However, net income adjusted to exclude fair value hedging changes, the Encore merger-related costs, and the impact from a change in our tax rate as a result of the southern asset sale was $72.9 million or $0.18 per share.
As we’ve typically done, I’ll primarily focus on the sequential results of the first and second quarters of 2010. During the second quarter of 2010, our tertiary production was 28,507 barrels per day, 5% higher than our Q1 tertiary production.
On a pro forma basis, excluding the production associated with the southern property sale and assuming the acquired Encore properties had been included in our first quarter results for the entire quarter, our overall production increased 5% sequentially to 78,545 BOEs per day in Q2 as compared to 74,489 BOEs per day in Q1. That increased primarily due to our tertiary Bakken and Haynesville production.
As previously discussed in our analyst conference a couple of months ago, our forecasted production for 2010 excluding the divested southern assets for the entire year was estimated at 76,650 BOEs per day.
With the increase in our tertiary production forecast from 27,750 barrels per day to 28,000 barrels per day, and a 5% increase in our Bakken production estimate to an average of 4,600 BOEs per day and a couple other minor changes, we are now increasing our pro forma 2010 production guidance excluding the southern assets to 77,000 BOEs per day.
Our average oil price received for the quarter including derivative settlements was $71.68 per barrel in Q2, as compared to $60.60 per barrel in Q1, but if derivative settlements are excluded our average oil price received for the second quarter was $73.99 per barrel as compared to $76.53 per barrel in Q1.
Our NYMEX oil price differential was $4.13 per barrel below NYMEX in the second quarter as compared to $2.08 per barrel below NYMEX in Q1, due primarily to the acquired Encore properties which typically have higher differentials. Assuming we had included Encore’s production for the entire first quarter, our NYMEX differential would have been $3.77 per barrel below NYMEX in Q1.
Differentials in our northern properties were negatively impacted during one month in the second quarter as a result of a temporary refinery shutdown. Our lease operating expense increased by $31.5 million from the first quarter, but on a per BOE basis, our overall lease operating costs were down from $20.12 per BOE in Q1 to $16.69 per BOE in Q2, primarily due to increased production, and addition of the Encore properties in our results for the full quarter and lower tertiary production costs primarily due to decrease in work over expenses.
If the southern property sales have been excluded from our results for the entire quarter, our LOE per BOE would have been approximately $17.12 per BOE in Q2 as compared to $18.69 per BOE in Q1. I would expect our LOE per BOE to be between these two numbers for the remainder of 2010, but favoring a number on the higher side for the rest of the year.
G&A expenses decreased by $1.5 million from Q1, even though the first quarter only included Encore for a partial period. The decrease between the quarters is due to the higher cost in Q1 associated with bonus and equity compensation, EOR related cost, cost associated with the sale of Genesis and higher overhead recoveries in Q2 related in part to our continued operating of the southern properties that we sold in mid-May.
Going forward, I would expect that our G&A will continue to increase as we add new employees throughout the year. Going forward, I’d expect our G&A per BOE to be more in line with our six-month average in the low-to-mid $5 per BOE range, but this could deviate somewhat.
We’ll continue to have ongoing merger-related cost associated with integration and severance, but we anticipate this amount will reduce significantly going forward to be more in the range of possibly $6 million or $7 million in the third quarter and $3 million to $4 million in the fourth quarter.
The vast majority of the expense in Q2 associated with severance-related costs as we’ve made significant progress with the integration of the Encore employees. Approximately $3.2 million of the Encore merger-related cost were non-cash expense associated with equity compensation for severed employees.
Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased sequentially from $26.4 million to $43.5 million, primarily related to incremental debt incurred to finance the Encore merger.
Average debt outstanding was $3.2 billion in Q2 as compared to $2.2 billion in Q1. Capitalized interest was $23.9 million this quarter as compared to $21.3 million last quarter, primarily due to incremental interest capitalized on the Green Pipeline.
Going forward, we expect our capitalized interest will decrease to around $10 million per quarter until the end of the year when we expect the rest of the Green Pipeline to be placed into service.
Our bank debt at June 30 was $40 million on a $1.6 billion credit line, as we have paid off most of our bank debt with proceeds from the southern property sale, and we had $245 million outstanding on ENP’s bank line. We also ended up with $2.176 billion of senior subordinated debt outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 8.5% after the completion of the tender offers for the Encore’s subordinated debt.
Based on our anticipated capital spending in excess of cash flows for 2010, we would expect to see our bank debt increase throughout the remainder of the year as we plan to outspend our cash flow by approximately $200 million to $300 million.
However, as Phil mentioned, if we are successful in closing on either the Haynesville sale or our ENP ownership the proceeds from either of these transactions would likely cover most of the deficit leaving us with little or no bank debt at year end.
Our debt-to-cap ratio at June 30 is a respectable 36%, and debt to estimated 2010 EBITDA would be in the mid 2 to 1 range going forward. We’re extremely pleased with our financial position, and the improvement of our leverage ratios set soon after the completion of the Encore acquisition.
Our capital expenditure budget for 2010 remains at $1.06 billion, excluding acquisitions and capitalized interest and net of approximately $50 million in anticipated sale leasebacks.
On a combined basis, the $1.06 billion would exceed our anticipated cash flows by approximately $200 million to $300 million, assuming 12 months of combined cash flow for the combined companies based on current commodity prices.
Our DD&A for the oil and gas properties decreased slightly on a per BOA basis from Q1 due primarily to the incremental proved reserves record in Q2, which Tracy will discuss more in a few minutes.
With regard to income taxes, we currently anticipate that we will able to deduct a large portion of our Green Pipeline that we put into service in mid-year when we begin injecting CO2 into Oyster Bayou. This should help to limit our current tax expense and help shield additional tax on asset dispositions.
As result of the sale of our southern properties in May, we’ve slightly lowered our statutory rate due to our mix of states and applied a new deferred tax rate to our deferred tax balance. In doing this, we decreased our deferred tax expense for the quarter and our effective rate. This should normalize to a rate around 39% going forward. However, future asset changes will also impact this rate.
With that, I’ll pass it to Tracy."

As we’ve reported in the press release, we added 65.4 million barrels or BOEs during the second quarter. The majority of these reserved additions were in our CO2 EOR projects at Delhi Field and our other CO2 projects.The largest reserve",958,"Thanks, Mark. As we’ve reported in the press release, we added 65.4 million barrels or BOEs during the second quarter. The majority of these reserved additions were in our CO2 EOR projects at Delhi Field and our other CO2 projects.
The largest reserve estimate we added was at Delhi Field, where we added 30 million barrels of reserves based on observing a significant and sustained response to the CO2. As the past practices, our initial crude reserve bookings were approximately 75%, about 13% recovery factor what we ultimately expect to be able to recover from the field.
If you compare the 30 million barrels to our prior presentations, you’ll notice that the Delhi net potential number was only 33 million barrels on those prior presentations. In addition to the proved bookings at Delhi, we’ve also increased our total potential reserves in Delhi to 38 million barrels, which equates to a 17% recovery factor.
Additional proved reserves were also added in the Heidelberg CO2 project. These reserves were added in areas of the field that were not initially considered to be part of the floodable area. And then based on performance of our CO2 projects at Tinsley and Lockhart Crossing Fields, we added additional proved reserves there as well.
Based on performance, the recovery factors were increased from the original estimates of 13% on a proved basis to 17% as performances dictated. As additional areas of these fields respond and as other fields’ performance dictates, the reserves in these additional areas and other fields will be adjusted accordingly.
We have completed our review of our Bakken acreage position and have estimated that the total potential as proved, probable and possible net reserves to our interest is approximately 350 million BOEs. This potential includes reserves associated with over 2,850 potential locations. The former Encore estimate included only two wells per unit and included only one reservoir. The current estimate includes three wells per reservoir per unit.
A vast majority of these future locations in excess of 90% are estimated to be on 1,280 acre unit. Forecast of the initial 30 day rates varied from 300 to 500 BOEs per day for wells drilled on 640 acre units and 400 to 900 BOEs per day for wells drilled on 1,280 acre units.
The higher 30 day rates are estimated for locations that are within the Nesson Anticline line and the lower rates are estimated for areas that are not located within the Nesson.
Gross estimated reserves for each location vary from a low of just over 200 million BOEs for the Almond and Northeast Foothills area to a high of approximately 675 million BOEs for 1,280 acre unit locations within the Nesson Anticline.
As we have discussed in prior meetings and presentations, Encore had drilled a few unsuccessful wells in the Almond and Northeast Foothills areas, so we have not estimated any additional potential in acreage north or east of these wells. However, about 10% of our total Bakken potential still relates to this area as it could be productive and the industry is moving in this direction.
We continue to monitor all data that is made available within the Bakken area and we’ll continue to review and update the reserves associated with our Bakken position based on new information.
Based on our expected five operated rig program and an estimated 10 plus non-operated rig program, we expect our production rates in the Bakken to increase dramatically over the next 18 months.
Preliminarily, we are estimating our average 2011 net production rate to double our 2010 forecast and have a production rate of 4,600 BOEs per day. As we get greater clarity on other operators’ plans for 2011, we will be able to refine and report our estimated production rate for the Bakken and other properties.
Reserve additions in the Bakken during the second quarter were 15.2 million BOEs based on the results of ours and others drilling operations. This increase essentially doubled our proved reserves associated with our Bakken position. Based on our expected drilling plan over the next several years, we expect to continually add significant proved reserves within the Bakken.
The other area with significant reserve additions during the second quarter was our Haynesville area, where 12 million BOEs were added as a result of our drilling program during the year. While we have released our operated drilling rig there, there are still typically five to six non-operated rigs running in which we are participating.
We have yet to complete our remaining two operated wells that have been drilled and cased. We expect both of these wells to be completed by the end of the quarter and thus expect a production boost from these wells and other non-operated wells during the fourth quarter.
Finally, as Phil mentioned, I’ll give you a brief comment on our divesture efforts. We have closed, as we’ve announced on as August 1st transferred operatorship to Quantum for the assets involved in our southern asset divestiture.
We have begun marketing our remaining East Texas, North Louisiana, and Haynesville assets at this time and should have that out in the next few weeks. Assuming we receive an acceptable offer for these assets, closing is not expected until sometime in the fourth quarter.
We’re also marketing our Cleveland Sand Play in Northwest Oklahoma, which we acquired as part of the Encore acquisition. We’re expecting bids on the Cleveland Sand Play imminently and assuming we receive an acceptable offer, we would expect to close this sale during the third quarter. Assuming we are successful in all these divestiture efforts, we will have essentially completed our rationalization efforts outlined as part of the Encore acquisition strategy.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Bob to talk about operations."

I’ll give you a quick update on the major CO2 EOR fields and some of Bakken activity that we had during the second quarter.Tertiary production averaged 28,507 net BOEs per day for the quarter. That’s an increase of 1,484 net B",1980,"Yes. Thank you, Tracy. I’ll give you a quick update on the major CO2 EOR fields and some of Bakken activity that we had during the second quarter.
Tertiary production averaged 28,507 net BOEs per day for the quarter. That’s an increase of 1,484 net BOEs or about 5% compared to the first quarter of 2010, and then based on this increase in tertiary production rates, we are raising our average daily tertiary production guidance to 28,000 net BOEs average for the year.
We currently have 14 different fields under CO2 injection in six of our eight phases of expansion. With this limited time provided, I can’t go over all of them in detail, but I will touch on the highlights of the major fields. But overall, we continue to have a great success in our CO2 operations, with four of our fields exhibiting double-digit production growth during this quarter.
Phase 1 fields consisting of the six field areas in Southwest Mississippi increased by 382 BOEs per day or 3% increase over the first quarter, with an average daily rate of 12,347 net BOEs per day. The Little Creek area, the most matured area we operate, had a second quarter of double-digit growth.
The field averaged 1,971 net BOEs per day during the quarter, that’s a16.6% increase over the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to response from a long-term non-responding wells and result of the WAG which is a Water Alternating Gas injection test that performed much better than expected.
During the quarter, this WAG program was expanded to two more Little Creek patterns in a high recovery area to test the potential of additional reserve recovery using this method.
At Brookhaven Field, we also established a four-patterned WAG program during May in our area that needs improvement. We are optimizing additional oil production; we will establish WAG in that area, we’d hope to see production by year end.
At McComb Smithdale, we decreased production by 129 net BOEs per day on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but at McComb, we have four wells that were drilled in the expansion area. They are being completed now. These wells should hopefully help us out, as we go through the year, to have positive impact on our production rates.
In the Mallalieu area, we increased production by 185 net BOEs or 5 percentage quarter-to-quarter, and at Lockhart Crossing, it continues to perform better than forecasted with the production growth of 16% plus quarter-to-quarter. Impact from five new wells should allow Lockhart Crossing to continue to increase further during the third and the fourth quarters of 2010.
Phase II experienced a 187 net barrel reduction in rate as compared to the first quarter; however, Heidelberg, about a 149 net BOEs per day increased 8.7% on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Our operational team continues to aggressively expand Heidelberg flood and expect to complete additional well sites and placed over 20 wells on line during the third quarter of this year.
Eucutta experienced 168 net BOE per day decrease. Eucutta is essentially fully developed, so we will continue to exhibit a decline. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, Soso Field was flat to last quarter and isn’t expected to change much for the rest of the year.
Martinville is where the smaller floods in Phase 2 has fluctuated up and down over the last couple of years, it decreased to 163 barrels per day in the second quarter.
For those of you that follow Denbury closely, you know that our Phase 3 EOR CO2 area is Tinsley Field. This reservoir continues to perform better than predicted. Tinsley Field increased 829 net BOEs per day, almost 19% quarter-to-quarter with a second quarter average production rate of 5,248 BOEs per day.
The addition of six wells in the Unit C’s [ph] fault block, there in the quarter along with other responding wells made the third consecutive quarter production increases with double digits.
Tinsley was aggressively expanded during 2009 and we continue to increase well count and our proved facility this year. We plan to invest in excess of $50 million into the Tinsley project during 2010.
Phase 4 is Cranfield, production decreased slightly, 125 net BOEs per day quarter-to-quarter. The decline is partly due to delay in our drilling program. The drilling rig we had under contract we used to develop other Denbury tertiary field during the first and second quarters, but the rig has now returned to Cranfield and it’s now in operations. We will drill and complete the 12 wells 2010 capital drilling program during the third and fourth quarters of this year.
At Delhi, which is our Phase 5, CO2 expansion continues in the (inaudible) Tuscaloosa formations. Purchased CO2 injection increased to an average 84 million cubic feet a day during the quarter. As the reservoir pressure increases, additional oil response is expected during the year.
Second quarter average production was 648 net BOEs per day, that’s up from 63 BOEs per day during the first quarter. The EOR production continues to run above forecast as a result of earlier than expected response and then currently 16 wells are flowing into the production system at various flow rates and oil rates, and we have completed our 20 well 2010 drilling program and we’ll continue to expand the facilities there at Delhi.
Phases 7 and 8 are the Hastings and Oyster Bayou Field respectively, those filed of course are located along the Texas Gulf Coast. Progress in both fields is moving forward and on schedule. Oyster Bayou began injection on June 29. The current injection rate is approximately 44 million cubic feet a day at the three wells. And the first EOR production there is not expected until the second half of 2011.
Development continues with three capital rigs at Oyster Bayou along with the construction of our production and compression facilities. Hastings, we are running five capital rigs there, with current existing wells for CO2 injection, sometime early 2011 or late this year.
Jackson Dome, we need to talk about, our average production was 768 million cubic feet a day during the second quarter, that’s slightly ahead of our forecasted CO2 volumes. The drydock well, which is the Denbury 2916 #1 will be tested in the next few weeks, and this well should be placed in production during late 2010 or early 2011.
Currently, we also have two drilling rigs operated in the Gluckstadt field, which will increase our CO2 production levels later in 2010 or possibly 2011. These wells could also improve or increase our proved reserve if the field is found to have multiple fault blocks or separate compartments. Additional CO2 production from these wells will ensure that we have the deliverability to continue our field expansions along the Gulf Coast and Mississippi.
The 24-inch Green Pipeline construction was completed at the Oyster Bayou field late last year, and the first 260 miles were successfully packed and commissioned and is now transporting about 44 million cubic feet a day into Oyster Bayou. Now we have three remaining segments of the pipeline and those should be completed late this year to the Hastings field.
We have 19 miles from Oyster Bayou to the east side of Galveston Bay, and that will be hydrostatic tested either late August or the first week of September. The 14 miles of Galveston Bay crossing is underway, we have several miles of pipeline already constructed and we’ve already completed the drill on the Houston ship channel.
And then we have the remaining 25 miles on the west side of Galveston Bay, that’s underway. We have about 30% of the pipeline welled in. Like I said, our goal is to have the Green Pipeline in service to Hastings by year end or early 2011.
Moving from the Gulf Coast to Rocky Mountains, our 20 inch Green core pipeline is a 230 mile pipeline running from Lost Cabin, Wyoming up to Bell Creek, Montana. Right of ways in survey are undergoing with 95% of the surveys complete and about 41 of the right of way has been acquired.
We have preliminary engineering, it’s completed, finalizing the design pipe specifications. We work on the environmental assessment and the project should have a target start date of August 2011.
Bell Creek flood in Montana will be the first Rocky Mountain Denbury EOR flood, and we are right now recompleting idle water injection wells to CO2 service. Thus far 17 wells have been prepared for CO2 injection. We expect to have an additional 12 injection wells completed by the year end. That project start date will be sometime late 2012 or early 2013.
Mark mentioned lease operating expenses from the combined company. They decreased on a unit basis from $20.12 of BOE during the first quarter to $16.69 BOEs in second quarter. As we go through the year, we expect them to average slightly above $18 per BOE and we hope to maintain that expense rate.
If you look back and review the legacy Denbury lease operating expenses, they decreased 2% or $0.51 net BOE quarter-to-quarter from $22.86 in net BOE to $22.35 in net BOE. Electrical and fuel cost decreased, mostly that was 3.9%. Work-over cost also decreased 21%, primarily due to the operational improvements and procedures that we’ve instituted related to remedial work on the CO2 injection wells.
Contract labor did increase 22% due to capital activity and the contracting plan op raise during our expansions and startups. We continue to review our LOE cost, like changes to our process and procedures to hopefully maintain those levels.
Moving to the Williston Basin, North Dakota, we currently have three rigs working the Bakken formation. We contracted a fourth rig to commence drilling operations during September of 2010. Our fifth drilling rig is also planned to start drilling operations in the first quarter of 2011.
We have completed five Bakken wells to date and another three are in the process of being completed. One thing that we commonly do with the method of evaluating reserves potential is to just look at the average production rates for the first 30, 60, 90 days of production. The majority of our wells show pretty good response.
Early on, we completed Porcupine wells in March. We had one well that is the Sanish well on 640 acre, 12 stage frac. The 60-day average there was about 385 BOEs per day and the Porcupine also a Bakken well 640 acre, 12 stage at an average rate of over 498 BOEs per day for 60-day average.
The Werre Trust, another well in the Sanish area, which was 1280 acre, 19 stage, had a 60-day average of over 900 barrels oil per day. And then the last two that we have 60-day averages on are the Swenson, Charlson, Bakken completion 640 acre, 12 stage.
That well had a 60-day average of 873 BOEs per day and our Gilbertson, Charlson, Bakken well again a 640 acre, 12 stage at 619 average BOEs per day. I think Mark is going to put this information out on our web page in the next 24 to 48 hours.
Partly the Haynesville, Denbury has drilled three operating wells during 2010. Although we have ceased drilling operations and released our drilling rig there we are continuing to participate in wells operated by Chesapeake, JW, Blackhawk, Chemtura, El Paso, (inaudible) and to-date Denbury has participated in gross 23 wells during the year and expected to participate in additional nine gross wells AP [ph] by these operators.
Haynesville production in the second quarter averaged 3931 net BOEs per day. Production expected to fluctuate in the Haynesville depending on the timing of these completions, but we have two remaining wells Denbury operated that will be fraced before the end of the third quarter and that should also add to our rate during the third quarter.
With that, I’ll return it to Phil."

Pipelines are still going to be somewhere in that 200 range; instead of the Green Pipeline it’s going to be the Greencore.
What you’ll probably see depending on what happens with the sale of Haynesville, the Haynesville number could go away completely or at least go down and maybe a little bit, but you’re going to spend a little bit more in the Bakken because we’re going to add rigs.
So, I mean that’s kind of the high level, but the conceptual deal is just we haven’t given precise numbers. That depending on prices may still be a little bit above our cash flow, but it’s obviously, much less, and we expect it to be less than this year just because we expect some production increases. 2012 that’s a little further out, but I don’t think conceptually that will be too much different either. So I think you’ll see a budget over $1 billion plus or minus, maybe 10% or something near 15% and the allocation somewhat similar."
