Thank you for joining us on a morning so crowded with several insurer conference calls. As highlighted in our news release, positive third quarter trends continued in the fourth quarter. For the second half of 2009, we had solid earnings and favorable trends. We made an underwriting profit on an all-lines basis with a 96.8% combined ratio for the second half. That period contrasted sharply with our first half, which included the effects of high catastrophe losses. As a result, strong full year 2009 results in many areas were offset by weak workers' compensation and homeowner results, which added almost 12 percentage points for the full year consolidated combined ratio of 104.5%.For purposes of analysis, our combined ratio for the total of all lines of business, except workers' compensation and homeowners, would be in the low- to mid-90% range. We have taken and will continue to take action on workers' compensation and homeowners. In the homeowner line, the changes in our pricing structure have improved the quality of accounts. In workers' compensation, we are using predictive analytics as an underwriting and pricing tool, and we have improved the process of taking claim reports from our insured employers. We're adding to our loss control staff to help serve these accounts and reduce claims. We're optimistic that these efforts are taking us in the right direction to return profitability to these two lines of business overtime. In addition to the $10 million fourth quarter underwriting profit, we saw a healthy growth of our investment income in the fair value of our investment portfolio. We were very pleased to see good growth of pretax investment income which rose almost 5% compared with fourth quarter 2008. We're also preparing to turn the corner on an after-tax basis, which is a right metric to evaluate, given our shift in asset allocation over the past year.We believe the portfolio is positioned for growth of investment income in 2010. And for the full year 2009, unrealized gains in the portfolio nearly doubled even after harvesting a significant amount of gains. We now have more than $1 billion of pretax unrealized gains in the portfolio with the equity portfolio representing 2/3 of that total.A year ago, we told you our plan for improving our capital position. We have accomplished that through prudent management of our investment portfolio, identifying and applying our risk tolerance parameters at the asset-type sector and issue levels. We have positioned the portfolio to benefit from favorable market trends in the future while managing downside risk. Our equity portfolio's total return for 2009 was positive at a double-digit rate, although it lagged the broader indexes mainly because the market rally did not favor the higher quality dividend paying stocks we prefer.Risk management from an enterprise perspective continues to be an important part of our strategy for effectively managing capital. We are watchful of internal risk as well as broader risk, such as potential regulatory changes. Now let's turn to our Property Casualty Insurance business.While premium growth remains a challenge due to the weak economy and soft pricing, our growth initiatives have prepared us to achieve healthy growth as markets improve. These targeted growth initiatives already have created some growth areas during 2009. Now we are being careful to drive growth only where we see the potential until we have an acceptable profit margin. Our 3.3% full year net written premium decline is modestly better than the P&C industry trend of negative 4.8% for the first nine months of 2009.Underwriting discipline slightly lowered our Commercial Lines policy retention to the 89% to 90% range toward the end of 2009. We consider that a healthy sign that we are walking away from under-priced business. While we don't expect to see a significant improvement of industry commercial pricing in 2010, we believe our agents and field representatives are up to the task of identifying quality accounts and competing to get them on the books at an acceptable target profit margin.We showed good growth in Personal Lines and E&S as noted in our news release. Quality is our emphasis in these areas, too. Our pricing changes are producing a shift in our Personal Lines book with more growth in the tiers with lower risk indicators. Our E&S business continues to draw accounts that are typical of our conservative appetite with modest average premiums of about $5,300. Many of these accounts have been long established in our agents' offices so they have no lost histories. Another area where we're growing very selectively is agency appointments. We mentioned in our news release that we will continue in 2010 to research new space and ad agencies to represent us. We select agencies that are a good match philosophically and that have the potential to make us their number one or number two carrier by premium volume as they grow with us over the coming years. We want a meaningful and mutually-beneficial relationship. This approach works for us so we have the number one or number two spot in more than 75% of agencies that have represented us for five years or more. So we have tremendous room to grow in Texas, Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico and Washington, which are states of operation new to us since 2007. We know that all of our agencies, new or established, need to operate efficiently to succeed. And we're committed to delivering technology that helps them grow. Our agents are responding positively to progress we've made in 2009 and early 2010. Last year, our staff successfully accelerated the schedule and delivered our new commercial package and other system to agencies in 11 states. Those states produce approximately 55% of our Commercial Lines premium volume. We'll continue that accelerated pace in 2010. By year end, agencies in a total of 30 states have produced nearly 95% of our Commercial Lines premiums. We'll benefit from this system and its direct-bill capabilities. While it will take some time to move all of our three-year commercial policies to the system at renewal base, we are well on our way.We're working this week to get our agents up and running smoothly on a new dot-net version of our Personal Lines system. It was deployed Monday to all of our Personal Lines agencies in all states. The system offers easy navigation and processes all six of our Personal Lines of business. We are also proceeding with other initiatives to expand our online services for Personal Lines policyholders in 2010. These technology advances are part of our agent-centered strategy. We believe they complement our competitive advantages and strong relationships, great claim service and financial strength, improving our position as the go-to carrier in each agency.To summarize, we're building a portfolio of quality books of insurance and processing systems that can stand the test of time. We're overcoming near-term challenges to assure an infrastructure that creates value for the long term. Now Steve will discuss details for the quarter."

The fourth quarter was profitable with P&C insurance underwriting, life insurance operations and investments contributing to solid book value growth and pushing the full year 2009 value-creati",768,"Thank you, Ken, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. The fourth quarter was profitable with P&C insurance underwriting, life insurance operations and investments contributing to solid book value growth and pushing the full year 2009 value-creation ratio up to 19.7%. The fourth quarter combined ratio of 98.6% reflected no catastrophe losses and benefited from favorable reserve development, including 1.7 points from reserves for catastrophe losses occurring in prior periods. As Ken mentioned, in terms of the full year, 2009 was a tough one for our homeowner line of business. However, increased rates and improved pricing position began taking effect on October 1. Those pricing changes, the absence of catastrophes and the favorable development throughout the fourth quarter homeowners' loss and loss expense ratio to an encouraging 53.0% and contributed to a profitable 90.9% combined ratio for the Personal Lines segment.Total P&C reserves on prior accident years developed favorably, benefiting the fourth quarter combined ratio by 10.4 points. For the full year 2009, prior accident year reserves developed favorably by 6.4 points, which compares with 10.7 points of favorable development during 2008.You'll recall that during the first half of 2009, we strengthened reserves for workers' compensation claims occurring in prior accident years. Removing the impact of workers' compensation, the total of all other lines developed favorably by 9.1 loss ratio point during the full year of 2009. Our reserving philosophy remains unchanged. We continue to target total reserves in the upper half of the actuarial range.Now for some details on investments. The more diversified investment portfolio contributed nicely to net income and book value growth. Pretax investment income increased to $131 million, up $6 million or 4.7% quarter-over-quarter versus 2008 and up $4 million sequentially over this year's third quarter. Of the 46 stocks we owned at year end, 39 increased their dividends in 2009 and by an average of 7.6%. Pretax realized gains increased to $247 million for the quarter and to $336 million for the full year. Gains during the quarter benefited from two notable transactions. At September 30, we held shares of both Wyeth and Pfizer. During the fourth quarter, we received cash and Pfizer shares when Pfizer closed its acquisition of Wyeth. We have then sold approximately 2.2 million shares of Pfizer. The net result was $169 million in pretax realized gains. These transactions helped reduce the percentage of our common stock portfolio in the healthcare sector to 18% at December 31 from 25% at September 30.Also during the fourth quarter, we sold approximately 20% of our position in Verisk at its initial public offering, realizing a pretax gain of $26 million. We continue to be transparent in our entire portfolio at December 31. It's posted on the Investor section of our website.Liquidity, the balance sheet and our overall financial condition remain very strong, putting us in a solid position to grow profitably. The year-end P&C, premium-to-surplus ratio improved to 0.80:1 from 0.89:1 at December 31, 2008, with statutory surplus growing to over $3.6 billion at year end 2009. At the holding company level, we have approximately $1 billion in cash and marketable securities, and our debt-to-total capital ratio also improved to 15%.In terms of capital management during the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders in the form of our regular cash dividend. The stock currently has an attractive dividend yield of approximately 6%. And our Board believes many shareholders value are a long-time tradition of increasing the dividend. While our $0.0395 dividend represents a relatively high 75% payout ratio to operating areas for the most recent quarter, our strong capital and prospects has improved future earnings, provide flexibility for our rewarding shareholders through return of capital.Summing everything up, the contributions to book value per share for the quarter are as follows: Property-casualty underwriting profit contributed $0.05; life insurance operations, $0.06; investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance expenses, net to $0.38; the change in unrealized plus realized capital gains on investments netted $0.71; and as we mentioned, we paid to our shareholders $0.0395 per share in dividends. Totaling it all up, book value increased by $0.81 or 2.8% during the fourth quarter to $29.25 per share. The value-creation ratio, which factors in both growth and book value and dividend contribution, finished 2009 at 19.7% with 13.6 points coming from growth and book value and 6.1 points being contributed by the dividend. Looking longer term, for the five-year period in 2010 through 2014, we continue to target an average value creation ratio of 12% to 15%.  That concludes my comments and I'll turn it back over to Ken."

As was mentioned before, our retention ratio is going down slightly in Commercial Lines so we are walking away from some accounts just choosing not to compete. But really what we're seeing in the marketplace continues to be, I guess, a dual strategy from a lot of carriers back to being that everyone's trying to put through renewal increases. But the same carriers that are doing that or trying to do that are sometimes some of the most competitive carriers you'll find out there in new business. So we're trying to pick our spots, doing our best to weed out the poorer accounts. So that when we've had to be more competitively priced, we are doing it on the highest quality accounts we have."

We think we bring, from a model standpoint, a good model to our agencies. So we are operating direct with only the independent agencies to represent the Cincinatti Insurance Company.

The field claim staff that would be handling the standard claims for our agencies are also the same field staff, that our agencies very much appreciate, would be the ones handling the Excess and Surplus Line of claims as they occur. And then finally, as an exclamation point on our effort towards profitability, the premiums and losses, associated with Excess & Surplus Lines, are included in the profit-sharing contract that we have with our agencies. So lest anyone will be concerned and our agencies would take a throw-it-again-for-the-wall approach on E&S business with us, they're going to be quite careful because our profit-sharing contract is an important part of their compensation with us about what they offer us. And having said that, when you add all of those positives together, we have a tremendous opportunity within our agencies. In many cases, our agencies are offering to allow us to look at their entire book of Excess & Surplus Lines business and pick through it the types of things we think, given our level of development, we're capable of writing profitably. So our approach, as has been mentioned before, is to walk before we run on this. Our agencies write collectively in their agencies about $2.7 billion in Excess and Surplus Lines of business. And though we don't believe that we're going to be a market because some of that's very complex or all of it, we do think we're a market for a fairly decent percentage and we'll be given an opportunity to compete for it."

But what we find in terms of taking with the 65, we do have under consideration some states that are now inactive for us, keeping in mind that we are licensed in all 50 states but inactive in 37. But we've investigated Main, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Oregon, for example, have made no decisions on those, but have satisfied ourselves that we believe the regulatory environment in those states is fair enough for us to consider it. So that will affect the number of appointments we'll make. And then we really do take a look at all of our states. As time goes on, some agencies reach the end of their productive cycles. And so consequently, it could be that in Ohio, we'll be looking for some appointments. But one of the things that drives our interest right now probably more than anything else is the geographic diversification, most especially from a Personal Line standpoint to beef up our activities in states that are less cat [catastrophe] prone, so we'd really take a really close look at those particular states. And as you've already mentioned, out west really we think has some real potential for us."

And we need to wear this out, but the larger the account, the more it attracts a variety of competitors. And I think there's a sense because you have a lot of premium to work with that you've got a lot of margin that you can risk. So I would say that it's simply the larger accounts that seem to be the most competitive. By class of business, obviously, there are carriers out there that are niching, that are going after certain classes, that type of thing. And so when you have a carrier that decide they're going to specialize, for example, in colleges or something of that nature, they're bringing something to the table in terms of more aggressive pricing as well. But I wouldn't characterize the marketplace as in terms of a class of business of one being more competitive than the other."

Thank you for joining us on a morning so crowded with several insurer conference calls. As highlighted in our news release, positive third quarter trends continued in the fourth quarter. For the second half of 2009, we had solid earnings and favorable trends. We made an underwriting profit on an all-lines basis with a 96.8% combined ratio for the second half. That period contrasted sharply with our first half, which included the effects of high catastrophe losses. As a result, strong full year 2009 results in many areas were offset by weak workers' compensation and homeowner results, which added almost 12 percentage points for the full year consolidated combined ratio of 104.5%.For purposes of analysis, our combined ratio for the total of all lines of business, except workers' compensation and homeowners, would be in the low- to mid-90% range. We have taken and will continue to take action on workers' compensation and homeowners. In the homeowner line, the changes in our pricing structure have improved the quality of accounts. In workers' compensation, we are using predictive analytics as an underwriting and pricing tool, and we have improved the process of taking claim reports from our insured employers. We're adding to our loss control staff to help serve these accounts and reduce claims. We're optimistic that these efforts are taking us in the right direction to return profitability to these two lines of business overtime. In addition to the $10 million fourth quarter underwriting profit, we saw a healthy growth of our investment income in the fair value of our investment portfolio. We were very pleased to see good growth of pretax investment income which rose almost 5% compared with fourth quarter 2008. We're also preparing to turn the corner on an after-tax basis, which is a right metric to evaluate, given our shift in asset allocation over the past year.We believe the portfolio is positioned for growth of investment income in 2010. And for the full year 2009, unrealized gains in the portfolio nearly doubled even after harvesting a significant amount of gains. We now have more than $1 billion of pretax unrealized gains in the portfolio with the equity portfolio representing 2/3 of that total.A year ago, we told you our plan for improving our capital position. We have accomplished that through prudent management of our investment portfolio, identifying and applying our risk tolerance parameters at the asset-type sector and issue levels. We have positioned the portfolio to benefit from favorable market trends in the future while managing downside risk. Our equity portfolio's total return for 2009 was positive at a double-digit rate, although it lagged the broader indexes mainly because the market rally did not favor the higher quality dividend paying stocks we prefer.Risk management from an enterprise perspective continues to be an important part of our strategy for effectively managing capital. We are watchful of internal risk as well as broader risk, such as potential regulatory changes. Now let's turn to our Property Casualty Insurance business.While premium growth remains a challenge due to the weak economy and soft pricing, our growth initiatives have prepared us to achieve healthy growth as markets improve. These targeted growth initiatives already have created some growth areas during 2009. Now we are being careful to drive growth only where we see the potential until we have an acceptable profit margin. Our 3.3% full year net written premium decline is modestly better than the P&C industry trend of negative 4.8% for the first nine months of 2009.Underwriting discipline slightly lowered our Commercial Lines policy retention to the 89% to 90% range toward the end of 2009. We consider that a healthy sign that we are walking away from under-priced business. While we don't expect to see a significant improvement of industry commercial pricing in 2010, we believe our agents and field representatives are up to the task of identifying quality accounts and competing to get them on the books at an acceptable target profit margin.We showed good growth in Personal Lines and E&S as noted in our news release. Quality is our emphasis in these areas, too. Our pricing changes are producing a shift in our Personal Lines book with more growth in the tiers with lower risk indicators. Our E&S business continues to draw accounts that are typical of our conservative appetite with modest average premiums of about $5,300. Many of these accounts have been long established in our agents' offices so they have no lost histories. Another area where we're growing very selectively is agency appointments. We mentioned in our news release that we will continue in 2010 to research new space and ad agencies to represent us. We select agencies that are a good match philosophically and that have the potential to make us their number one or number two carrier by premium volume as they grow with us over the coming years. We want a meaningful and mutually-beneficial relationship. This approach works for us so we have the number one or number two spot in more than 75% of agencies that have represented us for five years or more. So we have tremendous room to grow in Texas, Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico and Washington, which are states of operation new to us since 2007. We know that all of our agencies, new or established, need to operate efficiently to succeed. And we're committed to delivering technology that helps them grow. Our agents are responding positively to progress we've made in 2009 and early 2010. Last year, our staff successfully accelerated the schedule and delivered our new commercial package and other system to agencies in 11 states. Those states produce approximately 55% of our Commercial Lines premium volume. We'll continue that accelerated pace in 2010. By year end, agencies in a total of 30 states have produced nearly 95% of our Commercial Lines premiums. We'll benefit from this system and its direct-bill capabilities. While it will take some time to move all of our three-year commercial policies to the system at renewal base, we are well on our way.We're working this week to get our agents up and running smoothly on a new dot-net version of our Personal Lines system. It was deployed Monday to all of our Personal Lines agencies in all states. The system offers easy navigation and processes all six of our Personal Lines of business. We are also proceeding with other initiatives to expand our online services for Personal Lines policyholders in 2010. These technology advances are part of our agent-centered strategy. We believe they complement our competitive advantages and strong relationships, great claim service and financial strength, improving our position as the go-to carrier in each agency.To summarize, we're building a portfolio of quality books of insurance and processing systems that can stand the test of time. We're overcoming near-term challenges to assure an infrastructure that creates value for the long term. Now Steve will discuss details for the quarter."

The fourth quarter was profitable with P&C insurance underwriting, life insurance operations and investments contributing to solid book value growth and pushing the full year 2009 value-creati",768,"Thank you, Ken, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. The fourth quarter was profitable with P&C insurance underwriting, life insurance operations and investments contributing to solid book value growth and pushing the full year 2009 value-creation ratio up to 19.7%. The fourth quarter combined ratio of 98.6% reflected no catastrophe losses and benefited from favorable reserve development, including 1.7 points from reserves for catastrophe losses occurring in prior periods. As Ken mentioned, in terms of the full year, 2009 was a tough one for our homeowner line of business. However, increased rates and improved pricing position began taking effect on October 1. Those pricing changes, the absence of catastrophes and the favorable development throughout the fourth quarter homeowners' loss and loss expense ratio to an encouraging 53.0% and contributed to a profitable 90.9% combined ratio for the Personal Lines segment.Total P&C reserves on prior accident years developed favorably, benefiting the fourth quarter combined ratio by 10.4 points. For the full year 2009, prior accident year reserves developed favorably by 6.4 points, which compares with 10.7 points of favorable development during 2008.You'll recall that during the first half of 2009, we strengthened reserves for workers' compensation claims occurring in prior accident years. Removing the impact of workers' compensation, the total of all other lines developed favorably by 9.1 loss ratio point during the full year of 2009. Our reserving philosophy remains unchanged. We continue to target total reserves in the upper half of the actuarial range.Now for some details on investments. The more diversified investment portfolio contributed nicely to net income and book value growth. Pretax investment income increased to $131 million, up $6 million or 4.7% quarter-over-quarter versus 2008 and up $4 million sequentially over this year's third quarter. Of the 46 stocks we owned at year end, 39 increased their dividends in 2009 and by an average of 7.6%. Pretax realized gains increased to $247 million for the quarter and to $336 million for the full year. Gains during the quarter benefited from two notable transactions. At September 30, we held shares of both Wyeth and Pfizer. During the fourth quarter, we received cash and Pfizer shares when Pfizer closed its acquisition of Wyeth. We have then sold approximately 2.2 million shares of Pfizer. The net result was $169 million in pretax realized gains. These transactions helped reduce the percentage of our common stock portfolio in the healthcare sector to 18% at December 31 from 25% at September 30.Also during the fourth quarter, we sold approximately 20% of our position in Verisk at its initial public offering, realizing a pretax gain of $26 million. We continue to be transparent in our entire portfolio at December 31. It's posted on the Investor section of our website.Liquidity, the balance sheet and our overall financial condition remain very strong, putting us in a solid position to grow profitably. The year-end P&C, premium-to-surplus ratio improved to 0.80:1 from 0.89:1 at December 31, 2008, with statutory surplus growing to over $3.6 billion at year end 2009. At the holding company level, we have approximately $1 billion in cash and marketable securities, and our debt-to-total capital ratio also improved to 15%.In terms of capital management during the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders in the form of our regular cash dividend. The stock currently has an attractive dividend yield of approximately 6%. And our Board believes many shareholders value are a long-time tradition of increasing the dividend. While our $0.0395 dividend represents a relatively high 75% payout ratio to operating areas for the most recent quarter, our strong capital and prospects has improved future earnings, provide flexibility for our rewarding shareholders through return of capital.Summing everything up, the contributions to book value per share for the quarter are as follows: Property-casualty underwriting profit contributed $0.05; life insurance operations, $0.06; investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance expenses, net to $0.38; the change in unrealized plus realized capital gains on investments netted $0.71; and as we mentioned, we paid to our shareholders $0.0395 per share in dividends. Totaling it all up, book value increased by $0.81 or 2.8% during the fourth quarter to $29.25 per share. The value-creation ratio, which factors in both growth and book value and dividend contribution, finished 2009 at 19.7% with 13.6 points coming from growth and book value and 6.1 points being contributed by the dividend. Looking longer term, for the five-year period in 2010 through 2014, we continue to target an average value creation ratio of 12% to 15%.  That concludes my comments and I'll turn it back over to Ken."

As was mentioned before, our retention ratio is going down slightly in Commercial Lines so we are walking away from some accounts just choosing not to compete. But really what we're seeing in the marketplace continues to be, I guess, a dual strategy from a lot of carriers back to being that everyone's trying to put through renewal increases. But the same carriers that are doing that or trying to do that are sometimes some of the most competitive carriers you'll find out there in new business. So we're trying to pick our spots, doing our best to weed out the poorer accounts. So that when we've had to be more competitively priced, we are doing it on the highest quality accounts we have."

We are about $31 million, almost $32 million, in New business last year. Interestingly enough of the 1,180 agencies we have, we wrote at least a policy for over 1,000 of those agencies, so we're getting a lot of good play throughout the country for the E&S business. The average premium, as just mentioned in the remarks, is relatively low. We're not trying to burn our way into the market by a long stretch. We think we bring, from a model standpoint, a good model to our agencies. So we are operating direct with only the independent agencies to represent the Cincinatti Insurance Company. Our field marketing reps on the property and casualty side promote this business. However, I might point out that they are not the underwriters that underwrite the price of the business. We have underwriters here in Cincinatti that are specialists in Excess & Surplus Lines that are doing that. But we are promoting it both from inside and out because we're not doing business with the wholesaler marketplace. There are funds available to pay a higher commission to our agencies. I think they're equally important. The field claim staff that would be handling the standard claims for our agencies are also the same field staff, that our agencies very much appreciate, would be the ones handling the Excess and Surplus Line of claims as they occur. And then finally, as an exclamation point on our effort towards profitability, the premiums and losses, associated with Excess & Surplus Lines, are included in the profit-sharing contract that we have with our agencies. So lest anyone will be concerned and our agencies would take a throw-it-again-for-the-wall approach on E&S business with us, they're going to be quite careful because our profit-sharing contract is an important part of their compensation with us about what they offer us. And having said that, when you add all of those positives together, we have a tremendous opportunity within our agencies. In many cases, our agencies are offering to allow us to look at their entire book of Excess & Surplus Lines business and pick through it the types of things we think, given our level of development, we're capable of writing profitably. So our approach, as has been mentioned before, is to walk before we run on this. Our agencies write collectively in their agencies about $2.7 billion in Excess and Surplus Lines of business. And though we don't believe that we're going to be a market because some of that's very complex or all of it, we do think we're a market for a fairly decent percentage and we'll be given an opportunity to compete for it."

But what we find in terms of taking with the 65, we do have under consideration some states that are now inactive for us, keeping in mind that we are licensed in all 50 states but inactive in 37. But we've investigated Main, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Oregon, for example, have made no decisions on those, but have satisfied ourselves that we believe the regulatory environment in those states is fair enough for us to consider it. So that will affect the number of appointments we'll make. And then we really do take a look at all of our states. As time goes on, some agencies reach the end of their productive cycles. And so consequently, it could be that in Ohio, we'll be looking for some appointments. But one of the things that drives our interest right now probably more than anything else is the geographic diversification, most especially from a Personal Line standpoint to beef up our activities in states that are less cat [catastrophe] prone, so we'd really take a really close look at those particular states.

Good morning to all of you. As highlighted in our news release we reported improving trends in several areas while our industry continues to experience significant challenges particularly in the commercial lines insurance market.Impro",961,"Thank you, Dennis. Good morning to all of you. As highlighted in our news release we reported improving trends in several areas while our industry continues to experience significant challenges particularly in the commercial lines insurance market.
Improvement has occurred over the past year in securities markets and our book value per share reflects that with an increase of 25% while we also increased our shareholder dividend. The mix we have selected for our investment portfolio took advantage of favorable market movement. It is up 24% since this time last year. We also grew our first quarter investment income by 5%. 
Growth in the portfolio and the income it produces reflect good choices made during 2009 as we invested more than $1 billion in cash that was held at the beginning of the year. We continue to add to our common stock portfolio including net purchases of over $60 million during the first quarter with the intention of balancing current income with long-term capital growth. We have a track record of holding attractive stocks with unrealized capital gains making up over 25% of the equities portfolio and we continue to monitor concentrations. 
Our largest common stock position now is about 1% of the total investment portfolio. While our property casualty insurance underwriting results fell short of our goal of a combined ratio under 100% we saw favorable trends in parts of that operation as well. Our personal lines segments combined ratio improved by almost 20 percentage points. While most of that was due to more favorable first quarter weather there also was an improvement in the non-capacity loss ratio reflecting rate increases implemented during 2009 plus better pricing for risk that we attribute in part to our homeowner predictive modeling efforts. 
Last year at this time our large volume of business in the Midwest made our property insurance results lag much of the industry due to weather related losses. Results so far this year demonstrate how weather effects tend to even out over time. Our excess and surplus lines operation made a positive contribution to premium revenue trends with earned premiums more than doubling to $11 million for the quarter. We continue to carefully manage excess and surplus lines exposure not only through policy terms and conditions but also by limiting our loss retention to $1 million per risk after reinsurance. 
Competition for ENS business has been increasing and kept our new business written premium levels flat. Agents continue to give us opportunities to round out client accounts, keeping the non-standard part of the account in the Cincinnati insurance family. Our earned premiums for our life insurance operation grew at a double digit rate in the first quarter and it continues to be a steady contributor to corporate profit and book value. 
Commercial lines is our largest segment and still is experiencing very strong competition making it difficult to achieve price increases. While we achieved price increases on some accounts during the first quarter, on average policies renewed at a price estimated at less than 1% lower than a year ago assuming no change in insured exposures or policy coverage terms. We are staying focused on identifying quality accounts and working to write insurance policies with an acceptable profit margin, walking away from business when necessary. 
Our largest drop in new business premium volumes was from Worker’s Compensation, currently an unprofitable line of business for our commercial lines segment. We aim to restore its profitability by carefully applying our underwriting guidelines along with other initiatives. Lower premium volume is a factor that has put upward pressure on our underwriting expense ratio. Investment in technology also contributes to a higher expense ratio in the short-term but it is justified over the long haul because we are confident there will be future benefits. 
Our company has a long tradition of holding sales meetings the first few months of the year where we meet with agents face to face to renew relationships and discuss our plans for the coming year. This year was no exception as we have hosted 20 meetings across the country. Some of the important things agents told us this year reaffirm our efforts to build out our technology, to maintain our agency focus and to provide local support in the field. 
Our agency centered business model has served us well for decades. We select agencies that are a good match philosophically and that have the potential to make us number one or number two carrier by premium volumes over time. We are able to replicate the benefits of our model for expansion into new states which also will benefit us in the long-term through less earnings volatility from weather related catastrophes. 
Since 2007 we have entered five new states; New Mexico, Washington, Texas, Colorado and Wyoming. Those states generated over 10% of our first quarter 2010 commercial lines new business premiums. In the second half of this year we plan to enter Connecticut and Oregon. Our growth initiatives in new states and agencies are part of a positioning strategy for long-term growth. Agencies we have appointed during the past five years write over $7 billion in aggregate property casualty insurance premiums for all companies they represent. That represents significant growth potential as we generally are able to earn a 10% share of the new agency business within 10 years of its appointment. 
The continuing selective expansion of our agency plan is one of several initiatives that move our business into a very favorable position for the future. By staying focused on quality coverage products, systems and service, we are confident we will bring value to all of the professional agencies that partner with us. 
Now I will turn it over to Steve who will discuss the details of the quarter.

During the first quarter we continued to increase shareholder value. Our primary financial measure, the value creation ratio, was 3.4%. on an annualized basis that falls within our target range of 12-15%. Breaking down the value creation",778,"Thank you Ken. During the first quarter we continued to increase shareholder value. Our primary financial measure, the value creation ratio, was 3.4%. on an annualized basis that falls within our target range of 12-15%. 
Breaking down the value creation ratio, book value per share increased by 2.1% and our dividend to shareholders contributed 1.3% with those two totaling to 3.4%. The first quarter combined ratio while an improvement over the first quarter of 2009 was an unprofitable 102.6. Catastrophes contributed 2.1 loss ratio points during the quarter and that number includes one point of favorable reserve development on prior year’s catastrophe losses. 
Total property and casualty reserves of prior accident years developed favorably benefiting the first quarter loss ratio by 5.6 points. Our reserving philosophy remains unchanged. We continue to target total reserves in the upper half of the actuarial range. The underwriting expense ratio for the quarter increased to 35.6 from 33.3% a year ago and calls for some discussion. The increase was due to a combination of both higher expenses and decreasing earned premiums. The main areas of higher expense include provisions for matters involving prior years related to Note [9] Commitments and Contingent Liabilities as described in our 10Q and also technology related costs. 
We continue to invest in technology to increase the ease of doing business for our agency partners, improve our pricing precision and improve productivity. In terms of specific initiatives we deployed an upgrade to our Diamond Personalized Processing System to all states on February 1. We continue the rollout of our e-class commercial lines processing systems which started with 11 states in 2009 and was planned to go live in another 19 states during 2010. 
We also continue to develop more accurate rating plans. We implemented predictive modeling for Homeowners and Worker’s Compensation in the second half of 2008 and in 2009 and we have plans for personal auto in the third quarter of 2010 to be followed by the remaining commercial lines. In January we established a Worker’s Compensation Claims Reporting Center to more efficiently handle Worker’s Compensation claims and contain costs. 
We are investing in additional loss control associates which we believe will result in better service for our agency partners and lower loss costs. With all of these investments we expect the expense ratio run rate for the remainder of 2010 to be in the 33-34% range. 
Now for some details on investments. Pre-tax investment income increased by 5% to $130 million for the first quarter of this year. Pre-tax realized capital gains contributed $8 million. Also during the quarter we closed out a couple of items that we inherited in the third quarter of 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. We sold the remaining $36 million of collateralized mortgage obligations that we received when we terminated our securities lending program. While we realized a $12 million loss on the sale of the CMOs they had recovered to well above their lows and we feel the action reduces risk in our investment portfolio. 
We also received the final payment of $5 million from the previously frozen primary reserve money market funds which generated a $1 million capital gain from the previously impaired level. Overall, the pre-tax unrealized gain in the investment portfolio increased by $149 million in the quarter to nearly $1.2 billion with the equity portfolio contributing approximately $64 million of the increase and the fixed income portfolio contributing approximately $85 million. 
Liquidity, the balance sheet and our overall financial condition remain very strong putting us in a solid position to grow profitably. The P&C premium to surplus ration stands at a conservative 0.8 to 1 with property and casualty statutory surplus growing by $44 million during the quarter and that is net of a $50 million dividend to the holding company. At the holding company level we have approximately $1 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
Summing everything up the contributions to book value per share for the quarter are as follows; Property and casualty underwriting loss subtracted $0.07. Life insurance operations contributed $0.05. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance expenses netted to $0.40. The change in unrealized plus realized capital gains on investments netted $0.63 and we paid to our shareholders $0.395 per share in dividends. The net effect for the first quarter was an increase in book value per share of $0.61 or 2.1%. 
The value creation ratio which factors in both growth in book value and dividend contribution finished the quarter at 3.4% and builds on the full-year 2009 BCR of 19.7%. 
That concludes my prepared comments. I will turn it back over to you, Ken.

I think it boils down to what we have been seeing in the casualty line and Worker’s Comp for that matter but in the casualty line in terms of audit premium. With audit premium going down it is kind of an indication that exposure was less in those more recent accident years than one would have anticipated at the time. So I think I can see on the one side where there could be some concern reserves might be being released too early but I think it is really a reflection of just lower than anticipated exposure during the period. Again, an emphasis of our comment we are very consistent in our reserving practices and haven’t done anything different in terms of our practice over that period of time.

We think it is nonrecurring so I think you will appreciate the sensitivity of the issue and I can’t give you any more detail on that one event. 
So we have this one-time expense in there. I didn’t want anybody walking away thinking that explained everything. We do have the technology investments that we are seeing payback on.

Going forward we will probably stick to our historical pattern of about a quarter of new money going into the equity portfolio. Right now we are at 25% roughly of the overall portfolio in equities. That is a number we are comfortable with. So we are I think for the first time in a number of years back to a reinvestment pattern that more matches what we have historically done.

We weren’t for several years and our current agencies along with agencies in newer areas out west, North Carolina and several other new states where they have been very pleased with their relationship with us like our claims service have really given us a lot of opportunity in the personal lines area. 
On the commercial lines side as I mentioned earlier it is much tougher on the larger accounts. Maybe to add a little color, the new business for us in property was up 22.5% in the quarter. Policies were up 9.1% and casualty we were up 3.5% in policies but down 2.1% in new business premiums. The big issue for us in terms of affecting our new business growth was Worker’s Comp. We were down 41% in new business in Worker’s Comp but down 20.7% in new policies in comp. 
So we are seeing in the market place we are more comfortable operating in the sub-$100,000 size of accounts. We continue to have some success in that area. It is a bit reckless if you will in terms of pricing of new business at the upper end. We are just having an increasing number of situations where we won’t go there because it doesn’t make sense. In terms of victories and in terms of effectiveness with our agencies, in terms of the numbers of new business policies we are writing for our agencies in that middle area, especially $10,000 to $100,000 range we find ourselves being effective. 
I think our agencies appreciate that. We are defending our position and our agencies in terms of our preferred position and doing what we can to pick off appropriately priced larger accounts. Maybe that is more than you asked for but maybe it is a bit of a picture of what we are facing.

And thank you for joining us today to hear about our second quarter and first half results. While there are no big surprises, we do have updates on some recurrent themes of recent quarters. We've come a long way since this",749,"Thank you, Dennis. Good morning. And thank you for joining us today to hear about our second quarter and first half results. While there are no big surprises, we do have updates on some recurrent themes of recent quarters. We've come a long way since this time last year. And we know we have a lot farther to go. What we see now, midway through 2010, strengthens our confidence that what we've started can raise our profitability to an acceptable level, and then drive it to new heights, creating significant value for shareholders.
First, our premium growth initiatives continue at a good pace. Our strategy has been to seek new growth opportunities to offset the effects of unhealthy price competition in commercial lines, by far our largest business area. We (inaudible) this new evidence for growth. Their contributions in the second quarter allow us to report six-month new business and net written premiums at a level essentially flat with last year despite lower commercial lines volume. With very little positive developments and an ultra competitive commercial insurance market, we've made sure our value proposition is strong in helping drive sales in our other lines of business, in new states, and through additional agencies.
Our premiums for our excess in surplus lines operation, which will soon begin its third year of operation, roughly doubled compared with the 2009 comparable quarter and six months. Our E&S growth is carefully managed with a focus on writing lower limits on risks considered moderate for the E&S markets. Life insurance earned premiums continued healthy growth at a double-digit rate for the first half of the year, and the profit margin remains steady. (inaudible) at our three new western states were an additional $11 million of commercial new business in the first half, offsetting a good portion of the 18% new business decline in our established states.
And in personal lines, a third of our $25 million growth in year-to-date net written premiums came from (inaudible) states activated for personal lines since 2008. As personal lines renewal pricing improves, we're glad to have that larger footprint and more agencies, and established states, too. We saw about a 6% rise in personal renewal of premiums, in part reflecting rate increases. That contrast with commercial lines, where average renewal pricing continues down about 1%, and our policy holders insurable exposures continue under pressure.
With significant growth in other areas, we have taken the opportunity to walk away from under-priced business and commercial lines, protecting future profitability. Just the same, we aren't skipping on our support for commercial lines business. Business insurance tends to be the main focus in our independent agencies positioning them to be centers of influence in their communities. We're increasing the value we bring to agencies and their policy holders by strengthening our local field staff, including loss control representatives, workers compensation claims specialists, and personal lines field marketing representatives. Staff additions are offset by efficiencies at headquarters achieved through technology.
We're keenly aware that local field service distinguishes Cincinnati. And that's even more of a factor than our technology progress in making it easy for agents to do business with us. Additional state roll-outs of our new commercial policy administration system continue on schedule. And feedback from our agents is very favorable.
Balancing our need for growth with consideration of pricing and profitability, we are stabilizing our ex-cat underwriting performance and seeing signs of improving trends. On a consolidated property casualty basis, the combined ratio for accident year 2010 so far is just under accident year 2009 as reported last December.
Steve will elaborate on our continuing care to manage underwriting and expenses in the current environment so those improving trends can go forward. I'll make just a brief comment on investment income, and turn it over to Steve for details.
We are pleased that second quarter investment income is higher than a year ago. As we invest new money and reinvest material securities, it will be very difficult to achieve favorable growth comparisons given today's low yields. One thing working in our favor is the growth potential on our diversified equity portfolio. We continue to direct to share of funds available to invest and equities for long term capital growth. Over time, our equity strategy has been very successful. Unrealized gains still represent 19% of equity portfolio fair value.
Steve is ready to review details, including the effect of reserves on the quarter. So we'll go ahead now with his remarks. Steve?

As Ken mentioned, there were no real surprises this quarter. And that applies to the financial information as well. The second quarter combined ratio improved by nine points over the second quarter of 2009. Still, with average - with higher than average catastrophe losses, it was non-profitable at 170.6%.
Catastrophe losses contributed $99 million or 13.6 loss ratio points during the quarter, almost twice our historical 10-year average of 7.7 points for our second quarter. The largest catastrophe loss was one we previously announced, a $34 million event in Nashville, Tennessee. Our claims associates responded on all of the claims with their hallmark prompt and better service.
Our conservative and consistent reserving philosophy remains unchanged, which is important, giving continued pressure on the property and casualty industry. Total property casualty reserves on prior accident years develop favorably benefiting the second quarter by 10 loss ratio points. Excluding from both periods, the effect of workers compensation that would strengthen reserves in 2009, development on all our other lines of business benefited the second quarter loss ratio by 9.6 points, consistent with the 9.0 point effect in the second quarter of 2009. And we appear to be on track for our 22nd consecutive year with favorable loss reserve development.
Looking at recent accident year loss ratios, excluding catastrophes, the first half 2010 for our commercial lines was fairly stable, compared with the full year 2009 despite the continued competitive market.
For the first line segment, the ex-cat accident year loss ratio improved almost four points in large part due to better pricing. The consolidated property casualty underwriting expense ratio for the quarter improved to 31.6% from 32.1% a year ago. During the first quarter earnings conference call, we communicated an expected full year 2010 run rate of 33% to 34%. And at the midway point, we stand at 33.6%.
In terms of investments, second quarter-over-second quarter, pretax investment income increased by $11 million or 9.3% to $130 million. If one factors out dividends with the regular payment patterns, we've had four consecutive quarters with a sequential quarter increase in dividends and a year-over-year increase just over 3%.
Our equity portfolio strategy is fairly unique for the property casualty industry. Dividend-paying stocks offer short term income growth advantages in a declining interest rate environment, while also providing the potential for long term book value growth through capital appreciation. A high level of liquidity and our overall strong capital, in combination, provide great financial flexible, putting us in a solid position to grow profitability and return capital to shareholders.
In addition to the regular shareholder dividend payment, we repurchased $10 million worth of our shares. But as a relatively a small amount, it is immediately accretive to both value in earnings per share. It works to offset the dilutive effect of Treasury shares used to fund our various stock-based incentive programs. We repurchased the shares at an average price of $26.49 per share, well below book value. And we see that as the best time for this type of repurchasing activity.
At the holding company level, we have just over $1 billion in cash and marketable securities, a total that exceeds our $839 million of debt. And the property casualty subsidiaries also remain extremely well-capitalized, with a 0.8 to 1 premium to surplus ratio.
Summing everything up, book value per share decreased in the second quarter, with components of the decrease as follows, the property casualty underwriting loss reduced book value by $0.22; life insurance operations, which is a core component of the investment strategy added $0.06; investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance expenses contributed a positive $0.435; the change in unrealized plus realized capital gains on investments was a negative $0.61; and, we paid to our shareholders $0.395 per share in dividends.
The net effect for the second quarter was a decrease in book value per share of $0.73 or 2.4%. The value creation ratio, a long term measure that factors in both growth in book value and dividend contribution, finished the first half of 2010 at 2.3%, which compares with 2.0% at the midway point of 2009.
That concludes my prepared comments. And I'll turn it back over to Ken.

So one of the things that we think will have some effect on growth is that we're not going to see quite the significance of the return premium audit. And that as policies renew, really from this point forward, we're not going to see decrease in projected payroll from sales. So it does seem like things are evening out in that regard.
We are seeing still a modest 1% net rate decrease on the new business. We're continuing to do our best to drive that up and get better rates in that regard. Our new business in commercial lines was down. However, interestingly enough, this is consistent with what is - we've seen going on in the industry.
Our policy count for new business was actually up. It was up 3.4%. Property was up to 6.2%. Casualty was up by 4.1%. Worker's comp was actually down 16.9%. And policy count new business is - that's the line of business that we're really digging into. We continue to write some very good business in comp, but we're being very attentive to what we write.
So all of that's consistent with the fact that from the new business standpoint and the pressure on renewals for us, that larger accounts continue to see the greatest competition. Right now, at least through the second quarter, we haven't seen any moderations in that. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of complexion that you're looking for.

I think the thing to stress is a very consistent and analytical approach that we put to the reserves. You're right. Most of the favorable development has been coming from the more recent accident years. And I can see how that ticked up a red flag in a competitive environment. But this is more anecdotal than actuarial. If we look at our exposure, if we look - comparing the four quarters of written premium, and compare the most recent four quarter rolling written premiums to the rolling four quarters ended at June of '08, they're down 5.2%. So exposure over that period of time is down.
At the same time, we increased our cache reserves, such that the cache reserves now that we hold are 5% higher than they were at June of '08. And our IVNR [ph] is actually up 15.7% from June of '08. So we put reserves up in the current year. That's a very consistent pace. And so, everything is playing out in a consistent fashion. But I can't understand why people would ask about releases from the more recent years.

Our buyback program, as you know historically, we do love to repurchase shares when we are below book value. We did stop being active purchasers the last year or so because the capital did drop through the economic challenges that we faced. As you know now, the last couple of quarters, our capital balance has rebounded and we are in a much stronger position.
Along with that - and so, we do have an active interest in that. Along with that though, we are still very proud of the fact - of the cash dividend that we pay shareholders on a quarterly basis. So that's going to be a balance as a return of capital between that and the share repurchase program. So we look at those kinds of things together, and then figure out how actively we'll be in our share repurchase.
The comments that were made in the queue about us buying back enough to offset the dilution, that is valid. And I think the added activity, what we based off of our share purchase - what the share current market value price is and our book value. So I think we're going to use this as a combination going forward. And the activity will just vary just depending on where our stock price is, and how comfortable we feel about our earnings, and what our dividend policy on a quarterly basis will be.

But from where I see it, we needed the technology to really let us be competitive in some of the new states that we entered. And we've held off on those states until we could get the technology. And then on top of that, some agencies that we did, and this was prior to the technology, they've been here quite the same, if you want to say, interest in placing as much business with us because we lack the technology.
A lot of those agents are coming back on board because our products have been priced with the additional pricing tiers you've heard about before, so the pricing is more competitive. And it is easier to do business because of the technology. And we've offered many different additional billing and payment options, all the things that they had an interest in. So we now have those.

So you add all that together, we're getting a significant share of new business from those newer agencies, most particularly the agencies that have already putting commercial - had been using us for commercial lines. They've seen in practice the quality of the claim service that we provide to their commercial lines client. So they've been a bit more anxious to put personal lines with us.
So we've had a big change over the last several years. And as Ken said, the automation has taken the issue of either doing business and direct bill off the table.

Those i",939,"Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear about our third quarter and nine-month results. Results for the third quarter were mixed. While the property casualty underwriting performance was disappointing, we did see some bright spots. Those included strong profitability in commercial casualty, our largest line of business and the beginnings of payback on our pricing precision efforts.
Growth of our insurance business continued where we have targeted initiatives to achieve growth. Our investment portfolio registered strong gains and book value grew at a good pace.
Investment income also rose for the quarter and nine months although it declined slightly compared with one quarter ago and that reflects the low interest rate environment we are currently facing. Beyond the near-term challenges, our capital and operating cash flow are strong. And we see the prospect of increasing benefits from our profitability and growth initiatives.
These factors facilitated the decision made during the third quarter to increase our regular quarterly cash dividend to shareholders. The dividend paid earlier this month marked the 50th year in a row of annual dividend increases, a record of consistency matched by only 10 other public companies.
Initiatives to improve the profitability of our property casualty operations are in progress. We expect over time to see more benefit to our financial results. Our investments in pricing precision and technology are having a positive impact now on our personal lines segments, helping to produce an improved loss ratio as well as premium growth in that area.
We expect our more recent and future introductions of predictive analytics tools to improve future profitability for our other lines of business. That includes workers' compensation or use of predictive models began in the third quarter last year. Personal auto, where we just began use for rates effective in the fourth quarter and ultimately all of our major commercial lines.
Other initiatives to improve profitability of our commercial lines segment focus on workers' compensation. We are addressing it from many sides including expanded loss control services and a more rapid claim reporting and management process.
At the same time, we see our new policy administration systems letting us streamline processes and improve workflows, helping with expense management. The new commercial lines system now is available in 25 states and will go to five more states this quarter.
Steve will review the expense ratio trends shortly. Our new policy administration systems also give our agency some efficiencies and cost savings that encourage them to place and keep their business with Cincinnati.
Growth in commercial lines remains a challenge with pricing declines in the low single digits and reduced insured exposure levels that include negative effects on audit premiums. Our property casualty written premiums increased for the quarter and held steady for the nine-month period.
We are working to win our agents best new and renewal accounts by increasing the value we give them in terms of service, up-to-date technology and broad coverages. Diversification beyond our largest segment, commercial lines, is helping us maintain and increase premiums.
Personal lines net written premiums rose $43 million or 8% for the nine months. Excess and surplus lines rose $15 million or 50%. Net written premiums for Life Insurance products grew 7% to $125 million for the nine months. We are seeing strong retention of our commercial renewing accounts, which helps mute the effects of pricing changes adding to stability.
Our personal lines retention has also remained at a high level even with rate increases for much of that segment. As for property casualty and new business, our marketing territory, agency and product expansion activities helped drive that measure, which rose 2% for the quarter even though new commercial business declined from states where we are more established. As recently announced, we are now marketing through our first Connecticut agency, bringing to 38 the number of states where we actively market. Results continue on track in states where we began marketing in just the past couple of years.
Net written premiums from Texas, Colorado and Wyoming have increased $21 million to $29 million so far in 2010. We had a target to appoint 65 new agencies across our marketing territories in 2010. And we raised the target to 80, having already appointed 71 new agencies in the first nine months.
The agencies we've appointed year-to-date have an aggregate of nearly $1.2 billion in property casualty premiums annually with various carriers. As always, our goal will be to become the number one or number two carrier in each agency by premium volume and generally achieve a 10% share within 10 years.
Our current agencies have spread our reputations, smoothing the way for us to attract the most professional agencies as we expand. They have talked up the exclusivity of the relationship, support they get from our local field teams, our responses to local conditions, our three-year commercial policies and industry-leading claim service. Agencies also are responding favorably to our new target markets initiative including the first new product, our educational institutions program.
Development of additional programs is proceeding on track and our agents are pleased they have access to additional support and expertise for marketing profitable targeted classes of business. We expect all of these efforts in 2010 to move us into a stronger long-term competitive position adding some scale, technology and expertise to our proven advantages in areas such as relationships and local decision-making, disciplined underwriting, solid reserving and outstanding claims service.
We see it happening and are grateful to you for your interest in the potential impact of these growth and profitability initiatives. Now, Steve will give you the CFO report.

The value creation ratio, our primary financial performance measure that combines growth and book value with capital return through dividends was 7.1% for the quarter. That brings the year-to-d",821,"Thank you, Ken and thanks to all of you for joining us today. The value creation ratio, our primary financial performance measure that combines growth and book value with capital return through dividends was 7.1% for the quarter. That brings the year-to-date ratio up to 9.4%, which on a pro rata basis is consistent with our five-year target annualized goal of 12% to 15%.
In the third quarter, the dividend component of the ratio contributed 1.4 points and growth in book value contributed 5.7 points. It was a strong quarter for the balance sheet. GAAP shareholders equity grew to just over $5 billion, reaching that level for the first time since March of 2008. The low point was $3.9 billion at March 2009.
Book value per share finished the quarter at $30.80, up 8.3% from $28.44 at September 30, 2009. Strong gains, realized and unrealized in both the stock and bond portfolio drove the growth in book value.
Contributing to the $155 million in pre-tax realized gains was the sale of the remaining shares of Verisk Analytics. Our cost was approximately $0.13 per share. About a year ago, we sold 20% of our position at the Verisk IPO for approximately $22 per share.
During the third quarter, we sold the remaining 80% for a pre-tax realized gain of approximately $128 million. We plan to invest the after-tax proceeds into stocks that pay a dividends as Verisk did not pay one. Even after realizing considerable gains, our total unrealized gains at September 30 rose 27% to over $1.3 billion, including $748 million from the bond portfolio and $580 million from the stock portfolio.
While the stock market has been volatile in recent quarters, we continue to see value in high-quality dividend paying stocks. They offer both short-term income growth advantages in a low interest rate environment and the potential for long-term book value growth through capital appreciation.
Investment income for the quarter was $128 million, up $1 million from the third quarter a year ago and year-to-date, investment income is up approximately 5%. However, with interest rates remaining very low, we are investing new money that yield much lower than our embedded yield.
In the third quarter, investment income was down $2 million sequentially from the second quarter. Obtaining our goal of the sub 100 combined ratio in a tough environment continues to be a challenge. As Ken noted, we already are profitable in some lines and we have initiatives in place to improve overall underwriting results.
The GAAP combined ratio for the quarter was 103.9%. Through nine months, it was 104.7, an improvement of 1.7 points from a year ago. Catastrophe losses contributed 3.8 points to the quarter and 6.5 points year-to-date. The 3.8 points for the quarter was almost three points higher than unusually low cat points we reported for the last year's third quarter.
Favorable development on prior accident year's reserves contributed 8.2 points to the quarter and 7.9 points year-to-date. The contribution for the third quarter was about four points lower than last year. We continue to be conservative and consistent in our reserving practices.
Looking at the current accident year loss ratio excluding catastrophes, results for the first nine months of 2010 compared with the full year 2009 were mixed. For commercial lines, the ratio is six tenths of a point higher as commercial pricing continues to be competitive. For the personal lines segment, the ex-cat accident year loss ratio improved almost three points in large part due to better pricing.
The consolidated property and casualty underwriting expense ratio was 32.3% for the third quarter and stands at 33.1% year-to-date, which is towards the lower end of the 33% to 34% range we communicated during the first quarter's call. We think a good way to summarize the various components of quarterly financial performance is in terms of changes to book value per share.
The property casualty underwriting loss reduced book value by $0.11. Life Insurance operations, a core component of our agent-centered business model, added $0.04. Investment income other than Life Insurance and reduced by non-insurance expenses, contributed $0.44.
The change in unrealized plus realized capital gains on investments provided growth of $1.70. And we paid to our shareholders $0.40 per share in dividends. The net effect of the third quarter was an increase in book value per share of $1.67 or 5.7%.
We ended the quarter reaching milestones in assets and shareholders equity that reflect our financial strengths. The quality of our balance sheet remains as high as ever and strong liquidity in the parent company is up 8% from the end of last year. We see that actions are paying off.
Our long-term view of our business and the benefits of our unique operating model increase our confidence that we can bring shareholders to rewards of better results in the future. That concludes my prepared comments and I will turn it back over to Ken.

So if there's an observation that we would have made particularly in Texas, where things are going very well, it's that our field underwriters there, all of which have experience in other states, these are experienced field reps, have noticed that they haven't had to be as aggressively priced on accounts. So that has been a bright spot as we've gone into in particular Texas.

In terms of - it seems as though you are getting some rate increases there. Do you feel like you are - for awhile you had always been a little bit below some of the competition? Do you believe that you are kind of back up to kind of in line from a rates standpoint there or maybe even above at this point?

I think that given our growth we would consider that we are certainly in the ballpark competitively. I do think we all feel that we have a ways to go yet in terms of the rate that we need to take. We took some rate here in the fourth quarter of 2010. We plan on continuing that again fourth quarter of 2011 at this point. But at this point I would say given what we are seeing in terms of retention and the ability to grow new business that we are certainly in the ballpark with our competitors.
