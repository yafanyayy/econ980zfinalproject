With me today is and delivering part of the presentation are John Ragan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Gerry Luterman, our Chief Financial Officer. Also available today to answer any questions that you might have in their respective areas are Mauricio Gutierrez, who runs Commercial Operations for the company; and Jason Few, who runs Reliant.So today on the 25th quarterly earnings call in the history of the new NRG, we are pleased to report on the financial results for 2009 that was truly historic in its dimension. The professionals who constitute NRG turned in an extraordinary year in 2009 even though it was the second year of the severe recession. It was a year in which national electricity demand decreased year-on-year for an unprecedented second year in a row. It was a year in which we faced relentlessly declining prices for our key commodities and it was a year in which the capital markets were still in the very early stages of recovery from their near-death experience with previous fall.And in all of that, in all of that was 2009, NRG delivered top quartile performance and safety and plant operations notwithstanding that certain of our coal units were called upon to cycle more frequently; a baseload hedging strategy that insulated the company's financial performance making the record financial year possible; effective and efficient integration of Reliant retail into NRG in all phases of the business, culture or management. And most importantly, in mitigating the risks around Reliant's wholesale supply; and savvy and proactive execution across all phases of our balance sheet program notwithstanding the challenging capital market environment, including completion of a sizable share buyback equating to between 8% and 9% of our market cap; significant pay down of our current corporate debt and the sale of two subsidiaries at significant cash gain for the company.And finally, in 2009, we achieved significant enhancement through the company's asset platform. Enhancements like Reliant that made sense financially and presented investors with the business profile for the overall company that is significantly different and better than the profile of other competitive power generators. Enhancements like Bluewater Wind, the leading offshore wind development in the United States; Blythe, the largest operating photovoltaic plant in the United States; and the eSolar development projects. These are among the first and most visible steps we have taken in preparing our company for success in the new NRG economy.What it all adds up to as you look at Slide 5 is a year that was just phenomenal financially. Indeed, we shattered records on both adjusted EBITDA and cash from operations. It was a year that also positioned us for further success because as we move assertively to point our business at the plethora of opportunities we see open to us in the new energy economy, we do so with a $3.8 billion war chest, $2.3 billion of which represents cash on hand. Now Gerry's going to talk to you about the 2010 Capital Allocation Plan being launched today, but even with the considerable funds being deployed to pay down debt and return capital to shareholders, we retained a lot of firepower to deploy against these new opportunities. We are actively looking to deploy that capital where it makes sense economically as well as strategically. As we have been in the past, we will be transactionally opportunistic but economically disciplined. To talk about how we achieved such impressive results in 2009, I want to turn it over to John Ragan."

NRG operations ended the year with strong fourth quarter performance and concluded 2009 on very solid footing. By most performance measures, 2009 was one of our best years. Even as NRG faced some of the most challenging operating and commercial conditions since 2004. Our relenting focus on safety helped NRG achieve the second safest year in our history with a 1.16 OSHA incident rate, better than the industry's top quartile level of 1.32. As we exited the first quarter of 2009 with a recordable rate of 1.47, we increased our focus on daily safety activities and were successful in improving our performance during the remaining nine months of the year.We believe a disciplined approach and emphasis on safety sets our cultural foundation at NRG and provides the catalyst to achieve superior operating results. In 2009, our baseload equivalent availability, or EAF, the primary measure for plant performance was 90.5%, also above the industry's top quartile measure. 2009 was also a milestone for EPC Group, with a significant increase in projects in scope from a year ago. We started 2009 by successfully delivering into operations two major air emissions projects sequently [ph]. Additionally, we began and completed four more back-end control projects for our units at Dunkirk. We also successfully completed and delivered Cedar Bayou 4 into operations, our first natural gas-fired, combined-cycle project, which is running a 63% net capacity factor since its June commission.On the renewables front, two new projects, the Langford wind project in Texas and our first solar project Blythe Solar in Southern California entered into service in 2009.Currently, our EPC Group has three projects in progress that started during the last year. The Connecticut GennConn Repowering projects at Devon and Middletown, as well as the back-end control project at Indian River for in Delaware.From a commercial operation standpoint, the team also ended the year strong by working with the entire NRG organization to complete the unwind of the Merrill Lynch credit sleeve structure, which reduced specific collateral obligations for the organization, while also continuing to hedge both our wholesale and retail portfolio requirements for 2010.Now turning to Slide 8 for more detail on our performance, net generation continued to trend below 2008 levels although to a lesser extent in the fourth quarter as compared to earlier in the year. 2009 coal generation was lower than 2008 in all regions. This was caused by reduced electric demand triggering more reserve shutdowns than we have seen in the past and increased baseload plant cycling caused by coal to gas displacement as gas became the marginal generation and fuel, especially in the Northeast.While our gas and oil plant generation in the fourth quarter was in line with the year-ago period of 1.5 terrawatt hours, 2009 performance was below 2008 by 4.8%. Baseload EAF was below the 2008 levels for the quarter and the year. During the fourth quarter, this was primarily due to experiencing more planned outages than a year ago and an extended outage for STP Unit 1. The lower EAF for the full year was mostly attributable to an increase in the number of unit trips that were related to the higher level of thermal cycling of our coal units.A couple of our operating highlights for the quarter and the year include the 99.8% availability factor for the Limestone plant during Q4, and the notable 20% improvement for that year-end EAF at the Huntley plant when compared to 2008 performance.While we are currently not seeing the level of coal to gas displacement that we experienced in 2009, one of the primary focused areas during 2010 is to work with our plant operations team to become more proficient at dealing with the cycling of coal plants. Two examples of how we plan to improve on our performance include: Increased monitoring of boiler temperatures during ramping and startup evolutions; and maintaining improved controls over startup water chemistry. Our goal would be to minimize the impact on availability, if and when, we see the same level of cycling that we experienced during the past year.As for our Retail business, the chart on the bottom left of Slide 8 (sic) [9] shows customer sales and counts by segment. Our Q4 sales volumes in the Mass segment showed little impact from weather, as temperatures in ERCOT were on average close to normal over the quarter. Despite selectively lowering customer prices during Q2, we continue to experience some attrition in the fourth quarter and for the year as competitors took more aggressive pricing actions. Offsetting this was lower market power prices which drove solid margins for the Mass segment. Even with lower customer count, our pricing and risk management execution throughout 2009 resulted in financial performance that exceeded our plan.For the Commercial and Industrial segment, the group was active in signing and renewing existing contracts during the fourth quarter. The segment did experience some customer attrition due to lower success in re-signing legacy contracts that were due to expire. However, on the positive side of the ledger, the line improved its performance in winning new customers such as Continental Airlines and American General Life and ended the quarter ahead of its internal new customer plan.This performance was reflective of the changing customer base, coupled with the slowing of the segment's growth that occurred during the first four months of 2009 under prior ownership.As a shown on the bottom right chart, the FORNRG 2.0 program, which began in early 2009 is off to a very good start. The program's goal is to achieve $150 million improvement to return on invested capital by 2012. At the end of 2009, we had achieved slightly more than half of that goal. The continued buy-in from our plant operations was very apparent in 2009 based on the number of projects that were identified at the majority of our plant sites, the diligence of each of our plant managers to make sure their peers were aware of the specific projects, and then determining the applicability of these projects to other plants across the NRG fleet.As with many efficiency programs additional improvements will be more challenging to achieve as we move through time. However, due to our strong start in 2009, we have increased our goal from the previous $70 million to $89 million in 2010. Turning to Slide 9 (sic) [10], you can see that U.S. industrial production, especially in Texas seems to have turned the corner following the deepest economic contraction since the Great Depression. Both the Texas and the U.S. indexes are trending in a positive direction with Texas continuing to lead the recovery from a national perspective. As shown in the chart on the upper left, the Texas region was more resilient during the downturn due to less impact on heavy industry industrial demand along with continued strength shown in residential and commercial sectors. This dynamic led to a faster recovery of electricity demand in Texas relative to the mid-Atlantic region and in general, to most other regions throughout the United States. Texas demand recovered over the course of 2009 and indeed was up an additional 1.3% this past January on a weather normalized basis.Staying with Texas for a moment, as you can see in the chart on the bottom left, forward heat rates have remained stable and well-supported during the fourth quarter and have increased for all forward years during 2009. This market dynamic is primarily driven by the expectations around economic expansion and recent load growth, the impact of capital constraints over the past two years that will affect future generation projects, and the uncertainty around future environmental and legislative actions. In fact, in its December report, ERCOT expects reserve margins will fall to 12.3% in 2014 and 10.2% in 2015, below ERCOT's targeted level of 12.5%.Turning to natural gas economics, we have continued to see growth in unconventional onshore gas supplies despite a lower commodity price environment. However, we still expect the market to rebalance during 2010 with gas demand moving higher in the supply stack for full cycle production costs range between $6 and $8. Additionally, gas prices have been held down this winter due to high storage levels exceeding the five-year average. Nevertheless, we do expect storage to continue to fall due to above normal heating demand.The storage surplus which at one point was over 500 Bcf, above the five-year average at the beginning of December is just 53 Bcf as of last week. As 2010 progresses, gas price fundamentals will continue to be influenced by multiple factors including further delineation of wellbore productivities in the new shale basins, incremental LNG deliveries, demand changes due to extreme weather variances, recovering industrial demand and tropical storm activity.On Slide 10 (sic) [11], as you can see from our baseload and retail hedge chart on the top left, we are completely hedged for our baseload portfolio for 2010 and well hedged for 2011. We are continuing to priced load for our retail position by opportunistically matching generation and load, as well as utilizing a variety of other products to manage both price and volume metric risks. Most of the forward year hedges for retail load comprised longer-term Commercial and Industrial transactions, while the Mass portfolio tends to be shorter dated in nature and will be hedged based on the market fundamentals at the time of contracting.For our baseload generation, we will continue to look for market opportunities to hedge the years 2011 and beyond. Concerning our coal and coal transport hedges, baseload coal fleet is well hedged through 2014 from a transportation viewpoint and well hedged from a coal perspective through 2011. During 2010, we are more than 90% hedged for both the commodity and our transportation requirements for our baseload fleet.As we have shown in the past, the lower left chart illustrates NRG's sensitivity to gas and heat rate changes for the five-year planning horizon. In 2010, we have an inverse gas price exposure based on our current hedge position. This is caused by small changes in expected generation as prices vacillate throughout the quarter. Currently, expected generation is approximately 4% less than when our hedges were executed. Therefore, we are slightly over hedged. We expect this variance will flatten throughout the year. Additionally, we tend to be more leveraged to changes in natural gas prices as compared to heat rate changes as illustrated on the chart.In closing, I want to summarize our primary goals for 2010 from within the operations organization. We will continue to maintain our industry-leading safety and operating performance, and will strive for top decile performance in every area of our business. There is no higher priority for our organization. We'll continue to execute our commercial plan to maximize the value of the Wholesale and Retail businesses in 2010, while balancing collateral requirements of the combined portfolio. Our commercial operations team will continue to keep a keen eye on the market and look for attractive opportunities to hedge the forward portfolio in the most collateral efficient way. We expect to meet or exceed our FORNRG 2.0 targets for this year. And finally, our EPC Group will focus on completing our traditional fossil construction projects on-time and on-budget, while developing new methods to construct our future renewable projects in the most cost effective manner. Now I will turn it over to Gerry, who will discuss our financial results."

Beginning with our 2009 financial summary on Slide 13 (sic) [14], the company delivered strong financial results with a fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $489 million, a",1586,"Thank you, John. Good morning, and thank you, once again, for joining our call today. Beginning with our 2009 financial summary on Slide 13 (sic) [14], the company delivered strong financial results with a fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $489 million, a 21% increase from a year ago. As a result, NRG reported record full year adjusted EBITDA of $2.618 billion (sic) [$2.618 million], marking a 14% increase over the past year.Adjusted cash from operations increased 26% to a record $1.862 billion (sic) [$1.862 million] for the full year. Liquidity for the company continues to grow with the year-end total of $3.8 billion, including $2.3 billion in cash, excluding funds deposited by counterparties.Focusing on the 2009 Capital Allocation Plan, I'm pleased to say that we have successfully completed all of our previous commitments, including the $500 million share repurchase program with 19.3 million shares purchased. In addition, on December 31, we made an early payment on the 2010 Term Loan B sweep, totaling $200 million, which brings the total payment to $429 million for the year.We cannot close 2009 for the financial and capital allocation viewpoint without noting the significant strides made in our business and development profile, including the purchase of Reliant, the acquisition of Blythe, our move into offshore wind through Bluewater, the repowering of Cedar Bayou unit 4 and the development of Langford.Slide 14 (sic) [15] presents the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year adjusted EBITDA bridge or waterfall slide. Looking at the year-over-year results, the significant contribution made by Reliant stands out at $642 million in adjusted EBITDA, excluding the $89 million impact related to the credit sleeve unwind.The Mass and C&I business within Retail combined to bill 38 terawatt hours. 2009 results benefited from warmer than normal weather in the summer with cooling degree days up about 10%. Transaction and integration costs for the year totaled $54 million and are excluded from adjusted EBITDA.Now quickly looking at the individual region, the Texas region's result declined by $214 million from $1.543 billion in 2008 to $1.329 billion in 2009, driven largely by lower realized power prices across the fleet. If you recall, ERCOT experienced congestion prices in May and June of 2008 that led to unusually high prices for the region. In addition to natural gas prices, which were more than doubled those in 2009.In addition, average energy prices for the Houston zone decreased by nearly 60% year-over-year. This decline in energy prices coupled with lower generation of 1.9 million megawatt hours was driven largely by cycling at the region's coal plant negatively impacted results by $174 million.The South Central region had adjusted EBITDA of $81 million in 2009, a decrease of $64 million from the 2008 EBITDA of $145 million. There are a number of factors that contributed to the decline, including an $80 million decline in contract revenue due to the expiration of a contract for the regional utility. Although, the region had increased merchant sales of approximately 800,000 megawatt hours, a 45% lower year-over-year average merchant sales price reduced merchant revenues sharply. Of significant note, during peak periods, the average dark spread declines significantly year-over-year, as average gas prices fell 56%. And finally, 2008 results included unrealized gains related to physical energy sales, which did not repeat in 2009.Out international results were impacted by the sale of MIBRAG in June of 2009. Although, the sale resulted in a gain of $128 million which was excluded from EBITDA, we recognized only six months of equity earnings in 2009 versus a full year of earnings a year earlier. And finally, although we didn't highlight this, adjusted EBITDA for the Northeast region was $468 million, a decrease of $7 million from a year ago. Stronger energy margins were offset by higher property taxes due to diminished Empire Zone tax benefits. Higher operating expenses, including $12 million write-off at Indian River, which is associated with the planned cancellation of environmental construction work at unit 3.Slide 15 (sic) [16] outlines the company's liquidity position as of year end. Total liquidity excluding funds deposited by hedge counterparties stood at $3.8 billion, an increase of $430 million. The increase in liquidity from year-end 2008 was largely driven by the $796 million increase in cash highlighted on the upper right-hand portion of the slide. The drivers of this increase are $1.8 billion from adjusted cash from operations, a $248 million net debt issuance, which includes the June issuance of 8.5% senior notes due 2019 with net proceeds of $678 million. This was offset by the Term Loan B pay down of approximately $429 million, half of which was related to the early payment I mentioned before.  And thirdly, $284 million in net proceeds from the sale of MIBRAG. These items were offset by the Reliant acquisition cost of $360 million, $734 million in CapEx and $500 million in share repurchases.During 2009, NRG issued letters of credit from both the synthetic and the revolver totaling $372 million, primarily to replace collateral held by counterparties following the credit sleeve unwind. Additionally, $59 million was issued in connection with the tax-exempt bonds to help finance environmental CapEx at Dunkirk with the remainder primarily in support of our commercial operation trade positions.Our lean structure indicates we certainly have sufficient capacity. So all in all, we are in a good place with our liquidity position providing us a strong platform for ongoing operations and growth.Turning to Slide 16, illustrates our full year 2009 free cash flow position. Free cash flow from recurring operations came in at $1.579 billion, a 27% increase over 2008 results. This was driven by the $327 million increase in EBITDA, largely due to the performance of our Retail business, with income tax and interest payments essentially flat.  Year-over-year, the large offsetting swings in our collateral posting and working capital are linked and driven by the closeout of commercial positions in the first quarter of this year. Maintenance CapEx rose by $68 million in 2009 and includes $24 million associated with the integration of Reliant Energy. After net environmental and repowering CapEx, our free cash flow increased by $761 million to a record level $1.25 billion.Now turning to Slide 17, the results of our 2009 Capital Allocation Plan shows significant accomplishments. In summary, for the year, we completed the share repurchase of $500 million totaling 19.3 million shares at an average price of $25.88. Since 2004, the company has repurchased $2.4 billion of stock totaling 101.3 million shares at an average cost of $23.92. On October 5, we successfully completed the unwind of our retail credit sleeve, which had a net impact of $157 million increase to our corporate liquidity. Much of this was discussed in the third quarter conference call.And finally, on October 9, we completed a full unwind of the Common Stock Finance II structure, also known as CSF II. In that context, NRG made $181 million payment and received 5.4 million shares of the company, borrowed under the share lending agreement, and released approximately 9.5 million common shares held as collateral for the CSF II debt.Now turning to our 2010 outlook on Slide 18, we are pleased to reaffirm our full year EBITDA guidance of $2.2 billion, and we increased our guidance for free cash flow from recurring operations by $96 million to $1.175 billion. The increase is being driven by lower income taxes of $75 million and a reduction of maintenance CapEx by $21 million.Please note free cash flow, however, is being reduced by $344 million as a result of the planned increase and ownership of STP 3 and 4. This is offset by a lower environmental CapEx, as a result of a planned cancellation of construction work at Indian River unit 3.Looking at our guidance a slightly different way, on Slide 19. Based on last night's closing stock price of $23.07 and shares outstanding of 262 million, the free cash flow per share stood at $4.48 while the yield stood at a not inconsiderable 19.4%.Turning now to Slide 20, the Capital Allocation Plan for 2010. Starting with the share repurchase program, the Board of Directors has approved $180 million in share repurchases for the year, in line with our original commitment of 3% of market cap. Furthermore, the company will invest $468 million in maintenance and environmental CapEx in existing assets. In addition to, $598 million net in repowering projects which includes STP 3 and 4.The company also anticipates making an additional payment to the Term Loan B Facility of approximately $230 million, which would bring the total payments on a 2010 cash flow sweep to approximately $430 million. The paydown of CSF I of $248 million is also reflected in our numbers.And finally, on Slide 21, I'd like to close by taking a moment to briefly review our cap structure, and how the company is positioned to take advantage of the growth initiatives outlined by senior management. Since 2006, NRG's management had a continuous focus on prudent balance sheet management. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, total debt decreased by $400 million while stockholders' equity increased 35% to $7.7 billion, including stock buybacks. Consistent with this, the rating agencies have increased the ratings for the company, and our credit statistics have moved to within targeted range. In closing, the strength of our balance sheet and strong liquidity positions, coupled with our culture of prudent cash flow management creates, I believe, a wonderful platform for our anticipated growth. With that, I'll turn it back to David for our closing comments and questions."

And before I make those comments, I want to thank you for those results. I also want to thank you for pitching in this quarter. If we stick to our previously announced schedule for hiring a new CFO by the end of first quarter, which I fully expect that we will, you won't be here to accept my congratulations at the end -- on the first quarter call. So I want to thank you for all that you've done over the last few months.But now, before we open the telephone line for Q&A, I want to address three important areas of the business, which judging from the questions we have received, have been much on investors' minds over the past several months, as they also have been focused on by me and the rest of the NRG organization over the same period of time.First, Reliant. Obviously, Reliant, led by Jason Few and his team, had a spectacular year in 2009. After such a year, the questions that naturally arise are, are these results sustainable over several years? Are they susceptible to bad years given the boom and bust cycle of the Reliant Retail business under previous ownership? And are the indirect costs of running the Retail business, in terms of credit requirements, prohibited? And I'm looking at Slide 23. Reliant achieved the success that it did in 2009 by realizing retail margins almost doubled per megawatt-hour margin that we expect mid-cycle. Reliant did experience some customer attrition, owing to competition and a lower-priced commodity market. But the rate of net attrition reduced substantially over the course of the year from 2.4% in quarter three to 1.6% in quarter four, a 33% improvement over the final month of the year. And that metric continues to trend positive.Reliant remains the largest C&I provider in the state. And during the year, maintained the best rated rank with respect to customer complaints on powertochoose.com, which is the Texas Electric Choice Education Program website. As we look forward to 2010, our goal for Reliant is to continue our disciplined methodical approach to the market, so that we can deliver gross margins higher than the $15 base case we presented in November. We seek to stabilize, then to begin to grow our customer count in the Mass business through a variety of targeted marketing campaigns, plus a more extensive rollout of our Smart Energy programs, which are being financially supported by the $20 million stimulus funding received from the DOE.  It is our view that the introduction and greater public acceptance of smart metering equipment will benefit premium service-oriented retail providers like Reliant more than their price-only based competitors. With respect to the C&I segment, we remain at a competitively early stage of resurrecting our C&I business, as it was essentially frozen for the better part of the year by our predecessors. We believe a resurgent C&I business in the current market environment can significantly expand C&I volume at/or better than current margins. The C&I business also is the bridge into some potential brand extension for Reliant, through electric-vehicle services or other services that are logically related to retail electricity. We will be looking during 2010 to determine whether there is potential to extend the platform of Reliant as a brand. Through this approach, we are looking to add top-line growth at Reliant, even while we are realizing retail margins well above mid-cycle levels.The financial results of Reliant under NRG ownership tells a compelling story, but it's even more compelling if you consider what lay underneath it. Before our acquisition, the collateral requirement for Reliant was huge. In January 2009, a little bit over a year ago, the collateral requirement was $2 billion, plus a contingent collateral need of 400 Bcf equivalent of gas. We knew over the course of the commodity price cycle we could do better than this. Our plan in general was and continues to be to hedge the retail portfolio in the market when prices are low, and hedge the retail portfolio from internal generation when market prices are high, thus mitigating the collateral burden.Indeed, it's demonstrated by the table on the right side of Slide 24. We have reduced the posted collateral, supporting the retail business by 70% in just the 10 months that we have owned the business. I guess it's actually nine months, maybe.What all this adds up to you and here on Slide 25, I'm repeating the point that we made at our Investor Conference in November is that given the steps that we have taken to make this a sustainable business, given the steps we have taken to eliminate the wholesale supplier where it's traditionally associated with this business by running a flat book, given the steps we have taken to mitigate the risks of extraordinary weather events and above all, given the effective integration of our Texas Wholesale and Retail businesses, we would encourage you and your sum of the parts evaluation of NRG to consider all of Texas Generation and Reliant as one part, and apply one multiple of the multiple you intend to apply to all of NRG to that Texas part.Now second, and turning to environmental concerns and obviously, when we talk about environmental concerns, particularly those that apply to coal power generation. After eight years of hibernation, we have a suddenly resurgent EPA. And while we haven't seen anything particularly concrete or final yet, the power industry and its investors are deeply concerned with what the EPA may do to existing coal-fire generation. From my perspective, while the focus on EPA is certainly appropriate, and the uncertainty of what they might do and when they might do it is unwelcome to investors and CEOs alike, our point of view is that right now, we are at the point of maximum uncertainty and everyone is fearing the worst. Our strongly-held view is that the reality of EPA action, when it comes, will not be nearly as bad as it currently seems to some. The EPA won't be inactive but in our opinion, they will be pragmatic. Indeed, in this regard. I think right now with respect to potential EPA actions across the range of issues depicted on Slide 26, we and you, the investors, are in a position almost exactly analogous to where we were 12 months ago with respect to carbon legislation. Back then, among investors, there was tremendous fear of the unknown. Fear of a climate change bill that would have a Draconian impact on coal-fire powered generators. What we said to you last year, we say to you again this year, ""Don't overreact."" As with Congress and climate change legislation last year, in this fragile economic environment, we don't expect the EPA to act in a precipitous or economically punitive fashion against coal-fire generation. And insofar as NRG is concerned, when you look at the full range of potential EPA action, as illustrated on Slide 26, you will conclude that relative to other coal generators, we are comparatively well placed. Our coal units tend to be bigger, younger and have a lot of back-end controls. A few of our units depend upon unmitigated once through cooling, and none of our units dispose of their coal residue into ash ponds.As a result of our proposed agreement with the State of Delaware, with respect to Indian River 3, our projected environmental CapEx spend presented at the November Analyst Conference has fallen from roughly $900 million to $800 million over the 2010 to 2015 period, about $180 million year on average. Thereafter, we will see, but even though we don't believe in the worst case, we want to quantify for you the worst-case EPA outcome, which for us would be the application of MAC on a per unit basis, which would require us to scrub some additional units at Parish and Big Cajun II. Our current estimate is that the worst-case, if we  had to add back-end controls at all these units, would be an additional environmental CapEx of roughly $925 million. The bulk of which we would expect would have to be expend at some time after 2012. And in the case of the expenditure on BC II, which is close to half of that $925 million, the amount expended would be largely recoverable under the long-term co-op contracts.To me, the bigger point with respect to coal-fire generation today is that the considerable environmental pressure and economic challenge to coal from natural gas that we anticipated in the late 1990s, and which led to the glut of CCGT build to displace coal at that time, is about to happen again, a decade later. But this time, and particularly in some parts of the country, there actually may be some coal retirements, because the 30- to 40-year old coal plants at risk in the year 2000 are now 40- to 50-year old coal plants.What this means for the industry is that a lease in the industrial Midwest through the mid-Atlantic states and up to New England is depicted on Slide 27, I expect over the next few years, we will see a wave of retirements of older and smaller coal units. With the impact being, that supply demand will rebalance itself from the supply-side much quicker than is currently anticipated, which will provide upside from present market conditions for all market participants, including coal generators with back-end controls.What this means for investors is that while back in mid-2008, when natural gas was approaching $15 per million BTU, all coal plants were highly profitable and desirable. In this environmental and natural gas price market, all coal units emphatically are not created equally. We believe that if you look at the coal assets of NRG from both an environmental and an economic perspective, you will agree that we are extremely well-positioned.Now to the third and final issue, which is the CPS settlement around STP 3 and 4. I want to talk to you about the situation as it currently exists, and recognizing that it's a moving picture. As you know, last week our partner CPS announced, and we confirmed in agreement in principle, intended to resolve the long-running dispute between CPS and our subsidiary Nuclear Innovation North America or NINA. I want to describe that settlement, the rationale that underpins it and the management actions that we intend to engage in over the weeks and months ahead to improve the risk reward balance around the anticipated cash spend on STP 3 and 4. But before I do that, I need to emphasize that the agreement announced last week was truly an agreement in principle. That agreement needs to be properly documented by the lawyers and agreed to by the parties. The documentation process, which is complicated and holds within it the potential for further business disagreements to arrive, is as of today, not complete. And I cannot give you assurance as to when it may be completed. But let's talk about the proposed transaction on the assumption that ultimately there is the deal. There are many ways to look at the proposed deal, and since this is my presentation, starting on Slide 28 and particularly on Slide 29, I want to show you how I look at it.To me the deal creates a sequence of options -- and just I'm sorry for the confusion, but actually what I would really like you to focus right now is Slide 30. To me, the deal creates a sequence of options that begin quite inexpensively, but become increasingly expensive to NRG, as the project becomes more certain and consequently, more valuable. At the first stage, we are making a $10 million charitable donation over four years. This donation, which pencils out to about $8 million net present value on a pre-tax basis, results a situation which has been an obstacle, effectively preventing the project from achieving any of its important milestones, like the DOE loan guarantee or the inclusion of a third-party investor. And these obstacles have now existed blocking the project since last October. We don't like to pay a hostage value, but at least the amount being paid is manageable and the causes that's being paid to are good. The second stage option, which in my mind is the absolute crux of the deal, is that if and when a conditional loan guarantee is awarded by the DOE, we will pay CPS $80 million in two installments over six months thereafter, and that's a very significant amount of money. But in return for that payment, we essentially receive all but 7.625% of the project. In other words we received 42.375% of the project, bringing NINA's total ownership to 92.375% and NRG's effective ownership, taking into account the Toshiba minority interest in NINA, into the low 80% range.  While we and the other partners that we have now or would add in the future would have to assume responsibly for funding 100% of the ongoing project development costs, we would have full management control over the project development going forward. That $80 million payment gives us a nuclear development project with a critically important and very valuable government guaranteed debt financing assured. It enables us to push ahead over the course of 2010 to secure the remaining critical elements for project success, new investors, Japanese co-financing, the safety and environmental reports due from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a worthwhile EPC estimate and sufficient PPA cover. We expect to have substantially all of these critical elements in place by the end of 2010, which means we can focus 2011 on bringing in additional development partners and securing the combined operating license from the NRC. The 7.625% interest that CPS retains in the project is indeed valuable and low risk, but the benefit of it is only realized if and when the plant comes into commercial operation, which is currently scheduled to occur in the 2016 to 2017 time frame.In summary, securing an option on 42.375% of a nuclear project, with a very valuable conditional federal loan guarantee for $80 million, is a great deal, if the project goes forward. If the project does not go forward, it's an unsuccessful doubling down on our bid to lead the nuclear renaissance. We recognize that our investors are concerned with the potential of cash burden of carrying forward with 100% of the project development on our shoulders. And I'm sorry, I ask you to flip back to Page 29 to look at this. I want to give each and everyone of you my personal assurance that we are going to be very focused on reducing this cash burden, to at or about the same level that we projected last November for the year 2000 [ph] going to do this. We're going to do this, both by bringing in additional partners to the project and by rationalizing the engineering long-lead time items and other project costs, down to those efforts and items that are absolutely necessary to keep the project on track with the DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. We are adding early stage in this rationalization process, and I expect to report back to you in greater detail, hopefully with the DOE loan guarantee in hand, on our first quarter call at the end of April. Finally, and in conclusion, on the subject of nuclear. Thanks to the CPS dispute, the news around the STP 3 and 4 project has been relentlessly negative for the past several months. And you, the investors, are well justified in asking question about the company's continued commitment to this project. However, I want to make sure that investors do not lose sight of the nuclear opportunity and how much it has been enhanced over the past several weeks by events that have occurred in Washington or about to occur. The award of a loan guarantee to Southern Company proves that after five long years, since the nuclear loan guarantee program was authorized, that the program is for real.Secondly, the real possibility that the Kerry, Lieberman, Graham effort currently underway is going to result in the bipartisan call for a federal clean energy standard that will encompass nuclear and clean coal as well as traditional renewables, thereby creating compelling long-term demand for new nuclear plants. And finally, the request by the Obama administration for a total of $54 billion of nuclear loan guarantees, enough money for eight or nine new units. Meaning that we are talking about a nuclear renaissance that could easily become a $70 billion market. It is not everyday that we have the opportunity to get in on the ground for of the $70 billion market. In conclusion and on Page 32, as we have traditionally done early in the year, we have set forth a checklist of some of the more important milestones we have to achieve in the months ahead. If you look back in milestone checklists from previous first quarter calls, you will find that our track record of achievement is pretty good. This year our goals are ambitious, but attainable. And all of us at NRG are already hard at work to achieve them. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our first quarter call. So with that, Gina, I think we could open the phone for questions. And I think since we've taken a long time, if there's questions out there, we'll try and answer questions for about 15 minutes."

First of all, because of the multiple levels of ownership, we have always tended to talk about the ownership of this project more in terms of how many megawatts would you end up owning for your account. And before we have sort of indicated the market that where we were heading towards under the previous ownership structure was around 1,000 megawatts which was roughly 40% of 2,700 megawatts. The plant that's going to be built is going to be a 3,000-megawatt plant. So if we start with that number, I would say that what we are trying to do now, in general terms, is preserve optionality in terms of our final hold number to be anywhere in the sort of 1,000 megawatts to 1,500 megawatts range. In terms of sell down, I think you should think of sell down in sort of three stages. First, we expect to sell down a piece of the project very shortly after a DOE loan guarantee is received, if everything stays on the timetable that we're hoping for and as I indicated on the call, we would hope to have the DOE loan guarantee by the time of our first quarter call. So we would have one sell down there. And as we've indicated, at least in these sell downs during 2010, we are looking for people who not only will properly value the project opportunity, but also add significantly to the project strength and viability. I think later in 2010, we would look to bring in some more partners in the project in relatively small amounts, but that would also be important partners in the success of the project. When we've gone through that, I would say we would hopefully be down in terms of our net position, NRG in the sort of 65% to 70%. That would then leave a gap as to our whole amount, which we would probably fill in the course of 2011. By 2011, as I indicated, we think that project risk is going to be very substantially reduced, and at that point we might look at financial buyers or other people that just want to be part of one of the first couple of nuclear power plants in the country. So that will be positively more of a financial sell down. That's the way we're looking at it right now."

In terms of sell down of the project, certainly some sell down to a certain strategic partners, I think the DOE would be -- I don't think I know the DOE will be very, very receptive to. If the DOE is concerned that we would sell down the project too extensively, remember that we weren't looking to get before then the first quarter [ph] it's a conditional loan guarantee. They can always put a condition in it in the loan guarantee that restricts what we do. I don't think that they're overly worried on this point, but they certainly have the ability to protect themselves.

Also, with us in Princeton and available to answer any specific questions you might ask on the call are Mauricio Gutierrez, who runs our Commercial Operations business; and Jason Few, who is responsible for our Retail business. So let's begin.
Ladies and gentlemen, the shareholders of NRG, thank you for being patient and waiting until the very end of the first quarter reporting period for our earnings release. Today, we're pleased to bring you exciting news, both about the extraordinary financial results, which we achieved in the first quarter 2010 and also about the agreement signed today here in Tokyo with Tokyo Electric Power Company to invest in the South Texas Project, STP 3 & 4.
First, with respect to the quarter, Gerry and Chris will report to you more fulsomely in a few minutes. But I simply want to emphasize you the magnitude and significance of what the women and men who make up NRG have achieved: a 26% increase in the first quarter compared to what was considered by most to be a very strong first quarter 2009. Our $601 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was fueled by strong operating performance across all regions and all business segments. Of course, the two factors which made this number most possible in the face of a declining commodity price environment and generally weak economic conditions were our effective and farsighted forward hedging program and the exceptional performance, financially and operationally, of our Retail Energy business in Texas.  
We have spoken to the financial community repeatedly in the past about the strength of our wholesale and retail combination in Texas. Our strength that is unique among competitive power generation companies and today, you have another data point which visibly demonstrates that strength. In a quarter that was challenging for our Generation business as a result of macroeconomic conditions, our Retail business more than picked up the slack financially. Indeed, our Retail business, ably led by Jason and his team, not only posted exceptional results, they also largely stabilized the Mass business from a customer-account perspective and took giant strides towards resurrecting our C&I business in Texas. You will hear more about our strength and improved performance across all performance metrics in the Retail segment in the months to come. 
So with ample liquidity and newly simplified capital structure, our core Generation business that's hanging tough in a challenging environment; our Retail business, which has been stabilized with respect to its mass customers and is now growing in C&I; and now with Chris Schade joining us to take up the crucial position in our management structure as CFO, I'm pleased to say that NRG is no longer in transition as we have been for the past several months. We're ready to springboard off our core Wholesale Retail business, which is second to none. So turning to the future, under normal circumstances, I'd be reporting to you at some length about the great strides that we have taken on our renewable initiatives, the exciting opportunities that we are acting upon and the enormous market potential in the renewable space, a market which becomes more exciting and more real these days thanks to the Washington's push towards renewables, with discussions about projects like our DOE award for post-combustion carbon capture, leading to enhanced oil recovery at Parish, or about the enhanced prospects for our NRG Bluewater Wind subsidiary, as a result of Salazar's Cape Wind announcement will have to wait another day, as I want to focus my comments on today's TEPCO [Tokyo Electric Power Company] announcement.
For the reason shown on Slide 4, TEPCO quite simply is the best possible equity partner for us in the STP 3 & 4 project. Their participation will enhance the prospects for success across many critical aspects of the project, including development, financing, construction and of course, operations. With their Kashiwazaki 6 and 7 plants, they were the first nuclear plant owner in the world to bring an advanced nuclear project online, on time and within budget. And of course, the Kashiwazaki units are ABWRs [Advanced Boiling Water Reactors]. TEPCO has been a technical adviser to the STP Project for several years, but now as an owner and development partner, they will be directly and actively involved in all phases of making this project a tremendous success for our shareholders and as a result of today's announcement, for their shoulders as well.
Slide 5, details terms of the investment. TEPCO expects to pay $280 million in two phases over 12 months to acquire an effective 18% interest in the STP 3 & 4 Project. They will also pay their proportionate share of the ongoing cost of project development. They will deploy immediately several commercial and technical personnel deeply and directly experienced in ABWR construction operation to the United States to be part of the project development, including the EPC negotiations. The U.S. team will be backed up all of the very considerable resources of TEPCO in Japan. So in summary, we are very, very pleased and indeed honored to have TEPCO as a partner in the STP 3 & 4 Project.
But of course, the mere participation of TEPCO will not by itself provide an absolute guarantee of the success of STP. This, after all, is project development, and several important steps need to be taken to ensure the success of the project. Indeed, TEPCO's financial participation in STP 3 & 4 is predicated on receipt of a conditional loan guarantee from the Department of Energy. After you hear from John, Gerry and Chris, I will be reporting in greater detail about the current status of our loan guarantee application and our plans to carry this project forward or not, based on the DOE's decision.
So over to you, John Ragan."

During Q1, NRG continue to sustain solid operating and commercial performance. Slide 7, summarizes these events for the quarter. Beginning with safety, the company has started 2010 with a very positive record by a",1906,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. During Q1, NRG continue to sustain solid operating and commercial performance. Slide 7, summarizes these events for the quarter. Beginning with safety, the company has started 2010 with a very positive record by achieving top decile performance with a quarterly OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration] recordable rate of 0.85. We had 31 plants that had no recordable incidents and sustained one of our longest continuous stretches without a recordable incident across the entire fleet. We believe the disciplined commitment and emphasis on safety sets the cultural foundation required at our company and provides the catalyst to achieve superior operating results.
Moving on to our fleet operating performance. Baseload equivalent availability during the quarter was 88%, which was lower than the 2009 operating result. This was due to several unplanned outages in January and February, which I will discuss on the next slide. We continue to make progress on our construction projects in the Northeast. The Indian River environmental control project has been re-scoped for Unit 4 only, following the cancellation of the Unit 3 portion earlier in the quarter. The Devon repowering project is scheduled for completion in June and the commissioning phase of this project is now underway. 
On the renewables front, we have completed all of our operational and commercial due diligence in the South Trent wind project, and awaits the completion of the Texas PUCT [Public Utility Commission of Texas] approval process and certain tax and financing requirements necessary to close this transaction.
Our commercial operations and retail organizations continue to maximize value for NRG by combining the strengths of our Wholesale Generation and Retail portfolios. Additionally, we have continued to be successful in winning additional load contracts in the regions where we have generation resources. These longer-term contracts provide another vehicle to hedge our generation position and the opportunity to develop longer-term relationships with customers.
Turning to Slide 8, our total Generation for the quarter was slightly ahead out of our output from a year ago. The addition of Cedar Bayou 4 and the Elbow Creek and Langford wind farm help to make up for lower generation that occurred due to retirement of Somerset Unit 6 and the unplanned outages in b rates [ph] with some of our baseload plants. These outages occurred at three plants and consisted of boiler and fan issues at Big Cajun II, a stuck-control rod at STP Unit 1 and a generator rotor ground at Dunkirk. All three plants significantly improved their performance in March, moving back into top-quartile operating performance.
Turning to our Retail business. We have continued to see strong results, and customer count has become more stable in the first quarter, as compared to the previous quarters as shown by the continued reduction in customer attrition during Q1. Overall, our Mass sales volumes were higher due to colder-than-normal weather, and stronger margins were achieved due to falling gas prices during the quarter. The Retail group has continued to increase the renewal of existing C&I customers and has won several key customer accounts that extend the term and diversity of our Retail portfolio. Reliant remains the largest C&I provider in Texas and their strategic economic and operational success that the Reliant acquisition has exhibited over the past year, continues to reinforce our belief that combining these two entities creates a highly efficient counter-cyclical business model that enhances the total value for NRG.
Turning to market fundamentals on Slide 9. Quarter-on-quarter demand growth for ERCOT showed greater strength relative to PJM East, indicating a faster recovery from the recession as compared to other parts of the country. ERCOT set a new winter peak demand record of 55,878 megawatts in January, which was 10% higher than the previous winter peak set in 2007. Houston heat rates continue to be well supported due to increase in demand recovery, tighter supply and uncertainty around future regulations. In 2009, coal-to-gas switching was concentrated in the Southeast and Northeast markets. However, due to colder weather and higher gas prices in the first quarter relative to a year ago, this situation was reduced significantly.
Looking forward and under normal weather conditions, we see coal-to-gas switching being particularly concentrated in Eastern PJM due to increasing CAPP [Central Appalachian] coal prices, which reflect a more international price, as well as lower natural gas prices and tighter basis spreads. We expect negligible coal-to-gas switch in ERCOT for the year.
Lastly on the bottom right, I would like to discuss what we consider NRG's coal portfolio advantage. Our coal fleet primarily burns PRB [Powder River Basin] and lignite coal, and our assets are located in regional markets where gas sets the price of power in most hours of the year. Generally speaking, NRG's coal mix is less expensive and cleaner-burning than the CAPP coal that other eastern IPPs [independent power producers] burn. Additionally, concentrated in gas marginal markets allows coal units to earn the spread between the generation cost of a coal unit and a gas unit. This results in NRG achieving a stronger dark spread compared to other IPP fleets concentrated in the coal marginal markets, where prices are closer to the coal-unit market-generation costs.
Before I conclude the operations section, I want to discuss NRG's environmental strategy. As outlined on Slide 10, our current environmental CapEx program is designed to meet the stringent state regulations in New York and Delaware, as well as anticipated federal mercury-control requirements and the original CAIR [Clean Air Interstate Rule] Program. Upon completion of these projects, NRG will be one of the cleanest coal fleets with very low NOx [Nitrogen oxide] and low-to-moderate SO2 [sulphur dioxide] emission rates. Mercury reductions will be state-of-the-art. 
So what projects would be left after this work is complete and additional rules are put in place? Turning to Slide 11, as you know, the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] is creating rules that will cover air emissions for acid gases and mercury, all combustion by-products and a fluent water standards associated with the current 316(b) policies. The likely outcome for the industry is additional investment for air quality controls, the elimination of wet surface impoundments for ash disposal and the mitigation of once-through cooling. 
Because NRG has already invested in environmental control improvements, the potential remaining investment is manageable. The largest impact to NRG energy would be the installation of maximum available control technology for acid gases, which is thought to be an SO2 removal system. EPA is currently collecting data and is not expected to propose a rule until next March. A worst-case analysis for NRG would be to install six-drive scrubbers and an additional baghouse at our remaining unscrubbed units. But we believe there are mitigating factors to be considered. Our current emission rates are relatively low and could be lowered with some operational changes. Additionally, EPA regulations may offer some flexibility. We recently proposed MACT [maximum achievable control technology] standard for industrial boilers, allows facility averaging across the same type of units. A similar provision for electric generators would provide greater flexibility to meet the new stringent limits. Finally, we believe that the demand for controls across the industry result in continued technological advances and lower costs. 
With regard to ash landfills and water, these new rules should have relatively limited impact on NRG. Our coal facilities currently employ dry disposal practices for fly ash. And with one coal unit in Big Cajun II and the Encina and El Segundo gas plants do not have existing or budgeted mitigation for once-through cooling.
In summary, do we have future environmental investments to make? Most likely, yes. When the rules are available, NRG will implement plans to meet the requirements through a mix of repowering, controls, operational flexibility and emissions averaging where possible. However, we don't expect the worst-case scenario to become NRG's base-case scenario for environmental spend. Assessing our current state of environmental controls and any potential future obligations, we see ourselves very well-positioned, as compared to other coal-fired peers within the sector.
Switching now to the hedge profile of our portfolio on Slide 12, our Wholesale and Retail segments continue to be well-hedged over the next few years. Our baseload generation is more than 100% hedged this year, 70% next year and greater than 50% the following. We have continued to actively hedge our Baseload portfolio during Q1. But given the current gas environment, we have been focused on using option structures like we did back in 2006. This strategy helps to protect us from further downward gas price movements, while retaining some upside through positive price movements. We will be in a better position to provide you with more detail on our 2011 hedge strategy during our next earnings call.
Concerning our Retail position, we increased our hedge percentages due to the growth in fully priced retail load. Since we are talking about hedging, let me spend a minute on the potential impact of the Financial Reform Bill on our hedging program. We anticipate that new legislation will require financial derivatives to be traded on exchanges. But we also expect that end-user exemption that will allow us to continue transacting over the counter and therefore, continue using our first lien structure as collateral for hedging. In a very unlikely case that we do not qualify as an end-user, we will rely less on our first lien and more on our matching our Generation and Retail portfolios, which provides NRG a significant competitive advantage by having a natural offsetting position for our supply portfolio.  
The chart at the top right shows our coal and transport hedge positions. While we are well-positioned through 2011, we are currently working on firming up a few contracts, which are rolling off in the near future. The bottom left chart illustrates our baseload gas price, heat rate and coal sensitivities. As you can see, NRG tends to be more leveraged in natural gas changes than equally probable heat rate and PRB coal changes. The negative gas sensitivity in 2010 is caused by NRG being more than 100% hedged for our Generation business. 
Finally, we have added a coal price sensitivity to this chart, which shows our exposure to unhedged market-commodity coal-price movements. The sensitivity describes the gross margin impact of $1.50 per ton upward movement in PRB commodity prices, which is our predominant coal fuel. Given what we have shown on our use of PRB and lignite coal on Slide 9, our sensitivity is fairly limited, particularly through 2012.
In closing, Slide 13, sums up our near-term goals. I want to specifically mention two. First, we will stay very focused on achieving top-quartile to top-decile safety and operational performance throughout our fleet. Based on the tragedies we have all seen in the power generation, coal mining and offshore drilling sectors during the first four months of 2011, it is imperative to continuously improve our safety programs and always keep safety over production as our defining DNA structure within the NRG culture.
Secondly, our Commercial Operations group will continue to look for attractive opportunities to hedge the forward portfolios in the most collaterally efficient way. We continue to believe it is still early in the year and we'll remain vigilant in looking for opportunities to hedge more of 2011 and 2012 portfolio positions, as long as the strategy meets our fundamental price outlook within our different regions. 
Now I will turn it over to Gerry, who will discuss our financial results."

Good morning, and thank you once again for joining us today to discuss NRG's first quarter 2010 financial results. Since this is my last conference call as Interim Chief Financial Officer, a role I greatly enjoyed, I will talk to this quarter's actual results, while Chris Schade, my very able replacement, will address 2010 guidance and his priorities as NRG's new Chief Financial Officer. I will continue to serve on the NRG Board of Directors.
Turning to our financial summary on Slide 15. The company delivered record financial results in the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $601 million, a 26% increase from a year ago. This increase was driven by the excellent performance of Reliant Energy, which contributed $190 million of adjusted EBITDA.  During this quarter, the company made payments on its Term Loan B, as well as settling Common Stock Finance I or CSF I, resulting in its total outflow of $471 million. It should be noted that the decision to settle the CSF I four months earlier than planned resulted in savings of $7 million. Total liquidity now stands at $3.2 billion, including over $1.8 billion in cash. Chris will be discussing in more detail the adjusted 2010 guidance. But in summary, we are leaving EBITDA guidance unchanged at $2.2 billion, and increasing free cash flow guidance by $112 million to $462 million.
Turning to Slide 16. The quarter-over-quarter adjusted EBITDA bridge or waterfall slide is presented. This slide reinforces the complementary benefits of owning both Wholesale Generation and Retail in the state of Texas, as well as the two businesses contributed a net favorable variance of a $142 million quarter-over-quarter. Reliant Energy had a $190 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, driven by colder-than-normal weather with a 31% increase [indiscernible]. Reliant also benefited from improved performance in customer retention, as well as a reduction in bad debt expense as we began to see improved customer payments behavior.
Texas generation declined $48 million from $320 million in the first quarter of 2009 to $272 million for Q1 2010. The combination of a decline in hedge prices on our baseload assets, an 8% decline in nuclear generation and an 18% increase in delivered coal costs at WA Parish and Limestone, led to lower energy margins of $37 million. Additionally, O&M costs were higher this past quarter at STP by $9 million, as the plant prepared for its Unit 2 refueling and maintenance outage that began this past month.
The Northeast EBITDA results for Q1 2010 were lower by $30 million to $76 million from $106 million in 2009. The major drivers of this performance included the decision to retire Indian River Unit 3, lower-average baseload-hedged prices and a decline in generation. The plan to retire in Indian River Unit 3 by December 31, 2013, announced on February 3 resulted in $14 million of costs related to the write-off of construction in progress and termination fees. 
Energy margins meanwhile, were unfavorable, $38 million, driven by a decline in baseload hedge prices and a 9% decline in generation. Partially offsetting these unfavorable variances were capacity price increases in 2010 for New York and PJM totaling $8 million and a favorable operating cost, including lower maintenance and chemical costs of $14 million.
Turning to international results, decline of $11 million quarter-over-quarter is mainly as a result of MIBRAG's first quarter 2009 earnings contribution of $12 million, which were subsequently sold in June of that year. And finally, the sale of the Padoma announced on January 21, resulted in a $23 million positive impact on EBITDA as shown in [indiscernible]. 
Before closing and although not highlighted, adjusted EBITDA for the South Central region was lower by $3 million to $26 million. The decline was as a result of an 8% increase in load requirements, due to colder-than-normal weather and a 2.4% decrease in generation at Big Cajun. 
Slide 17, illustrates our first quarter 2010 free cash flow generation. Cash from operations for the quarter totaled $114 million, $25 million lower than 2009. Driving the decline quarter-over-quarter were both higher interest payments and changes in collateral postings. The $54 million increase in interest payments is related to the early termination of the CSF I, which included accrued interest payments of $52 million. 
Moving to free cash flow from recurring operations, preferred dividend payments were substantially reduced quarter-over-quarter at both the 5 3/4% and 4% convertible preferreds converted to common stock during the past 12 months. 
Turning to free cash flow. Environmental CapEx, net, totaled $38 million in the quarter and was mostly due to spending in Indian River for air quality control system for AQCS controls that are being installed. And finally, RepoweringNRG net cash expenditures are primarily related to STP 3 & 4 nuclear project. Last year, Repowering investments of $115 million included $32 million for NINA, $28 million for Langford and $11 million for Cedar Bayou.
Slide 18, outlines the company's liquidity position as of March 31, which excluding funds deposited by hedge counter-parties, stood at $3.2 billion. The driver of changes in liquidity are as follows: The Term Loan B paydown of $237 million, of which $229 million was related to the 2009 excess cash flow sweep. As you remember, during the fourth quarter conference call, we announced that we made an early payment of $200 million. In total, the 2009 excess cash flow sweep payment was $429 million. And $109 million of debt paydown, excluding interest of $52 million related to the early settlement of CSF I and $185 million of CapEx or capital expenditures. During the quarter, NRG issued $157 million net from the Synthetic LC Facility to support routine business activities, as well as replace Merrill Lynch as guarantor with certain Reliant Energy counter-parties.
These items were offset by cash from operations of $114 million and $29 million of proceeds from the sale of Padoma, as well as $59 million increase in availability of the first lien revolver as a result of finalizing the Dunkirk bonds at 5 7/8%. All in all, the company has sufficient hedging capacity within the lien structure to support its activities.
Turning to Slide 19. At the November 2009 Analyst Day held in Houston, I addressed a number of items that were going to occur that would simplify our capital structure. We've already spoken about the excess cash flow sweep, the early settlement of the CSF I and the conversion of the 4% preferred. But here you can see the impact to NRG's overall capital structure. With the strength of our balance sheet and strong liquidity position, NRG is positioned to take advantage of future growth opportunity. I'm also pleased that recognition of these efforts was confirmed by Fitch last week, as the firm upgraded their ratings on NRG reflecting both the stable outlook and the relative strength of our balance sheet.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the new CFO, Christian."

Before turning to the next slide, I would like to say that I'm very happy to be here at NRG and look forward to working with David and his team, as we continue a proven track record of business execution and prudent financial management. 
I would like to start with our 2010 outlook on Slide 21. The company recorded record results in the first quarter while on a low gas price environment. These results reinforced our Texas-based strategy of owning both wholesale and retail and as such, we are reaffirming our full year EBITDA guidance of $2.2 billion. The company generally has not changed guidance during the first quarter as it is still early in the year, and the summer months can be primary drivers of full year results. With that said, the company is off to a very good start.
I would like just to briefly cover our capital expenditure plans for 2010, our Repowering Investments guidance of $92 million includes $54 million into GenConn Energy, a 50-50 joint venture with United Illuminating as the repowered facility of Devon, Connecticut is expected to soon start commercial operations and contribute to results this year. $40 million for the installation of the combined heat and power system at the new University Medical Center at Princeton at Plainsboro, $10 million for demolition work at our El Segundo, California facility, $7 million for electric vehicles and $5 million for offshore met [meteorological] towers as part of our offshore wind initiative.
As for our nuclear development program, our net cash spend is estimated to be $328 million. With that, free cash flow is forecast to be higher than projected last quarter by $112 million to $462 million, reflecting the anticipated proceeds from Tokyo Electric, which David will cover in greater detail later in the presentation. Finally, based on Friday's closing stock price of $22.64, the recurring free cash flow yield currently stands at just over 18% or $4.10 per share.
Slide 22 provides an update on the company's 2010 capital allocation program. During the first quarter, significant progress was made on the plan including capital management and growth initiatives. While Gerry has already addressed the capital management portion of the plan, I would like to briefly address share repurchases, NRG's growth initiatives and my priorities for the coming year. 
Although there weren't share repurchases completed in the first quarter, NRG is committed to the previously announced $180 million Board-approved repurchase plan and we look to complete it by year end. Second, in the first quarter, the company made significant progress moving its clean energy initiative forward through; the pending acquisition of the South Trent Wind Farm in Texas, which brings the company's wind portfolio to approximately 450 megawatts; the Department of Energy's selection of NRG to receive over $150 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for WA Parish's post-combustion carbon capture demonstration project; and the agreement announced today with Tokyo Electric to invest in NINA's STP 3 & 4 project, which greatly enhances the company's financial flexibility as we move through the second half of 2010.
Now before turning it back over to David I want to address a few of my top priorities for the year. My experience from my 10-year at Medarex is that liquidity is king. And it will be a priority to manage carefully our balance sheet and liquidity requirements. NRG consistently generates strong free cash flow. And in my mind, there is distinct balance between managing liquidity, continuing to invest in the company and returning value to shareholders through share repurchases and debt reductions. To the extent our restricted payments basket covenant on outstanding debt impacts our ability to efficiently or best allocate capital for stakeholders, then NRG must consider solutions to relieve such restrictions. However, in my view, any consideration must also be based on market conditions affecting our operations. 
Second, NRG has a history of financial transparency in its reporting practices and I expect to maintain that level of detail, while improving our practices as needed. And finally, as I continue to integrate myself into NRG's business, I look forward to meeting many of our investors and analysts as possible over the coming weeks and months.
With that, I'll turn it back to David for closing comments and questions."

In particular, I want to thank you, Gerry, for pitching in for the last six months and we look forward to continuing to work with you on the Board. Now turning back to the presentation in nuclear development on Slide 24",1847,"Well, thank you, Chris, and John. In particular, I want to thank you, Gerry, for pitching in for the last six months and we look forward to continuing to work with you on the Board. 
Now turning back to the presentation in nuclear development on Slide 24. The current status of the STP 3 & 4 project is really quite simple. Everything depends on actions, which will be taken in Washington sometime in the next several weeks. Almost two years after we filed our application for a Federal loan guarantee and a full five years after such loan guarantees were authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which is what triggered our development of STP 3 & 4, we are now in the absolute final stage of DOE consideration of our loan guarantee application. As the DOE process has been both very demanding and highly iterative, we are confident that we have done everything reasonably requested of us to satisfy the government's concerns, which have been ably and forcedly expressed by the DOE staff and their consultants on behalf of the American taxpayer. An Act, which has been focused on ensuring the credit quality of the proposed loan guarantee.
As such and while we have no assurance that at this time from the DOE or from any other branch of the U.S. government that we will be awarded a guarantee, we are and we remain confident in our position. The issue that exists is one of appropriations and timing. While the Obama administration is seeking to expand the Nuclear Loan Guarantee Program in the next budget cycle. The next budget cycle is months away and right now, they have two projects, our project and Constellation's Calvert Cliffs project, which are at the same place in the process and each asking for about $7 billion in loan guarantees when there is a little more than $10 billion of currently appropriated and available. 
Moreover, while not NRG and we don't believe Constellation based on statements they have made, are in a position to carry their project through to the next budget cycle at a cash burn rate that will keep their project or our project on track. We believe there is very strong bipartisan support across a broad swath of the executive and legislative branches to make it possible for the U.S. government to support both projects without disruption. We believe our public policymakers in Washington recognize and appreciate that much has been invested by Constellation and NRG in these massive greenhouse gas reducing infrastructure projects, and that these projects represent a large number of present and future American jobs.
As the vanguard of the nuclear renaissance, the success of these projects is essential to the buildout of the domestic nuclear supply chain that will be needed for the United States to be cost competitive in the burgeoning global market for nuclear power plants. But as we all know, it can be a very long way in Washington from good intention to positive outcome. So we at NRG are prepared both for a positive result and a negative result. Our plans for both outcomes is outlined in broad-brushed terms on Slide 25. If we get a full loan guarantee, we move forward to the next steps in a cash-prudent manner. If we do not, we essentially suspend work on the project and reduce the external cash burn to near zero, while we seek to mitigate our exposure to the project today.
Notwithstanding our contingency plan for what we do if we don't win, you should walk away from this conference call knowing that, we, the management of NRG, are very confident that we will secure Federal loan guarantee. It is equally important for you to understand that such a win would indeed be a big win for NRG shareholders and would not be a de facto loss as some of you may be previous to today's announcement might have thought. If we win, we will pursue the project vigorously on all critical path items. But we nonetheless, will significantly reduced our planned burn rate on project engineering. Recognizing that we don't need to be as far along as the time our CLO [collateralized loan obligation] is expected to be granted as we had previously planned. 
Moreover, as depicted on Slide 26, in part due to the buy-in and participation of TEPCO, and as a result of various additional sources of project funding, we expect to fund STP through the critical stages of 2010 with a call on NRG's cash resources, which is while still significant, very manageable relative to the size of the project opportunity. If we get past the loan guarantee, there are two more critical steps in 2010 as outlined on Slide 27.
First, as we outlined at our Analyst Day last November, we need to confirm that Toshiba and Flor [ph] can and will build the project for $10 billion or less. Very detailed work is being done on this issue as we speak and it's progressing satisfactorily. Then armed with a reliable EPC number, we then need to confirm off-take with the off-take partners with whom we currently have Memorandum of Understanding for a significant portion of the new plants output. In this respect, I know there is concern in the market that those off-take agreements will not be available at a viable price level, as a result of the decline in natural gas prices over the past couple of years. While of course, I cannot provide you assurance until binding agreements have been signed, our analysis indicates that if you take into account, first the fact that the natural gas forward curve is in contango. Second, the $18 per megawatt hour production tax credit under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Third, the benefit of fuel diversification to load serving entities in Texas, many of whom are almost entirely dependent on gas-fired generation at this time. And fourth, if you ascribe a modest amount of value to the future value of the full carbon hedge provided by nuclear, we believe we have a very good chance of success at arranging sufficient off-take for this project and ensure project viability at an equity return that makes it worthwhile from the perspective of NRG. And I should say, that's at a risk adjusted return of equity that is appropriate for a nuclear power plant.
Which brings me to the last point, which I wanted to address directly, before opening the lines for questions. And I wanted to address the issue of shareholder value in the context of our nuclear development project. All of us on this call, whether you're a regular shareholder of NRG or an employee shareholder of NRG as all of us from the company are, we can agree on one thing and that's it we're unhappy with the company's share price performance over the past several months. This is particularly frustrating for many of us in the company because as depicted on Slide 29, we feel that our stock has been under pressure over the past months despite several obvious wins, which we have achieved.
It has become increasingly clear to us that we cannot hope to create upward momentum in our share price simply by posting more and more achievements in the win column. We need to address directly the factors which overhang our stock, namely bearish stock price settlement and concern about the cost risk and prospects of our nuclear development. With respect to gas prices, there obviously is nothing we can do about the trajectory of gas prices themselves but we can diversify our expected cash flow streams away from near total dependence directly or indirectly on natural gas prices as existed as was the case for NRG before we bought Reliant. A key differentiation point between us and our current peer group of merchant generators now and increasingly in the future, is that we see the path to maximum shareholder value creation as something different from just lining up as many power plants as you can get your hands on. So that you can sell as many megawatt hours that you can at natural gas derived prices.
We see the future in terms of a dual strategy, which we depicted on Slide 30. That is using our core wholesale generation plus retail strength, as a platform to spring board into a range of non-natural gas correlated revenue and free cash flow streams, such as renewable energy credits, carbon credits, payments for capacity, firming and other auxiliary services and green energy service business, whether associated with smart meters, electric vehicle infrastructure or both. And in most if not all these areas, our unique position in wholesale and retail and in Texas, gives us a substantial competitive advantage. We began the process last November by showing Slide 31 at our Analyst Day, of laying out for you our objective that by the latter part of this decade, we will roughly double the company's recurring free cash flow to our first mover push into the areas I just mentioned. That push is led from a free cash flow perspective by what we hope and expect to achieve in low carbon base load power, principally nuclear and in renewables, principally solar. You can expect that as we go forward on the quarterly calls and Analyst Days to come, that we will fill out this picture and demonstrate to you how we are going about achieving this financial objective. Doubling our recurring free cash flow in a few years may strike you as ambitious. But of course, that is what we achieved from 2006, our first year with Texas Genco through 2009. 
So finally, in conclusion, on Slide 22 (sic)[32], new advanced nuclear power plays a fundamental part in our plan, as I believe it does in the future energy mix of our increasingly low carbon society. Nothing has more confirmed that to me than the Obama Administration's announcement earlier this year that it was seeking $54 billion of nuclear loan guarantee authority, being that support for new nuclear in Washington is now fully bipartisan. $54 billion of loan guarantees mean $70-plus billion of new nuclear projects, enough to fund eight to 10 new plants. I believe that the United States starts to build 10 new nuclear plants, then inevitably, our country will build 100 as we need to do. That means new nuclear power will be a $500-billion to $700-billion market, and we at NRG have the opportunity through the STP 3 & 4 projects to be the first mover in an industry, which certainly will follow the lead of the successful first movers.
That is why we have taken on this challenge in order to access this once-in-a-business-lifetime opportunity.

I mean, I think if we do not get awarded the loan guarantee at this time, probably what we would do and this is first addressing your characterization as a cold stop, is that and we would have to see what the cost of this would be. But we would probably shut down everything except we might keep the license process going. Our initial estimate is just see the license through would cost less than $10 million a year. And given where we are and the fact that certainly, one thing we would be doing would be trying to mitigate the amount we've spent through sort of selling the intellectual property to other people who might want to be pursuing that type of project. We probably would try and carry through to get the license done, unless it was too expensive. Apart from that, if they came back a year from now, when the -- further money has been authorized and said, you can have your loan guarantee now and we basically wound down everything, we would have to look at them. We would have to look at the circumstances at the time. One thing is when you unwind an effort like this, as they say, it's hard to put Humpty Dumpty back together again. So I wouldn't be overly confident that we could come back and resurrect the project a year from now."

I think there are a lot of people in Washington, Certainly, people in our end and I would presume on Constellation, that are suggesting various ways that this dilemma could be solved. And additional appropriations outside the normal budget cycle is probably most prominent on that list, as the government does do appropriations outside of the budget cycle. And while the amount of money that we would be talking about, the shortfall of the $14 billion needed minus the $10 billion they have, $4 billion sounds like a very large number. My understanding of the appropriations that they would actually have to put through the process, would actually just be essentially the cost of the loan premium, which is a number that I've heard -- that less than $100 million. So that is definitely not insurmountable. But at this point, I'm not in a position to preclude any of the variety of ways that people inside and outside the government have suggested that, for the government to resolve this conundrum.

Obviously, TEPCO paying $280 million to get 18% of project, one looks much better than the other. But it's really hard to compare.

Also, with us in Princeton and available to answer any specific questions you might ask on the call are Mauricio Gutierrez, who runs our Commercial Operations business; and Jason Few, who is responsible for our Retail business. So let's begin.
Ladies and gentlemen, the shareholders of NRG, thank you for being patient and waiting until the very end of the first quarter reporting period for our earnings release. Today, we're pleased to bring you exciting news, both about the extraordinary financial results, which we achieved in the first quarter 2010 and also about the agreement signed today here in Tokyo with Tokyo Electric Power Company to invest in the South Texas Project, STP 3 & 4.
First, with respect to the quarter, Gerry and Chris will report to you more fulsomely in a few minutes. But I simply want to emphasize you the magnitude and significance of what the women and men who make up NRG have achieved: a 26% increase in the first quarter compared to what was considered by most to be a very strong first quarter 2009. Our $601 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was fueled by strong operating performance across all regions and all business segments. Of course, the two factors which made this number most possible in the face of a declining commodity price environment and generally weak economic conditions were our effective and farsighted forward hedging program and the exceptional performance, financially and operationally, of our Retail Energy business in Texas.  
We have spoken to the financial community repeatedly in the past about the strength of our wholesale and retail combination in Texas. Our strength that is unique among competitive power generation companies and today, you have another data point which visibly demonstrates that strength. In a quarter that was challenging for our Generation business as a result of macroeconomic conditions, our Retail business more than picked up the slack financially. Indeed, our Retail business, ably led by Jason and his team, not only posted exceptional results, they also largely stabilized the Mass business from a customer-account perspective and took giant strides towards resurrecting our C&I business in Texas. You will hear more about our strength and improved performance across all performance metrics in the Retail segment in the months to come. 
So with ample liquidity and newly simplified capital structure, our core Generation business that's hanging tough in a challenging environment; our Retail business, which has been stabilized with respect to its mass customers and is now growing in C&I; and now with Chris Schade joining us to take up the crucial position in our management structure as CFO, I'm pleased to say that NRG is no longer in transition as we have been for the past several months. We're ready to springboard off our core Wholesale Retail business, which is second to none. So turning to the future, under normal circumstances, I'd be reporting to you at some length about the great strides that we have taken on our renewable initiatives, the exciting opportunities that we are acting upon and the enormous market potential in the renewable space, a market which becomes more exciting and more real these days thanks to the Washington's push towards renewables, with discussions about projects like our DOE award for post-combustion carbon capture, leading to enhanced oil recovery at Parish, or about the enhanced prospects for our NRG Bluewater Wind subsidiary, as a result of Salazar's Cape Wind announcement will have to wait another day, as I want to focus my comments on today's TEPCO [Tokyo Electric Power Company] announcement.
For the reason shown on Slide 4, TEPCO quite simply is the best possible equity partner for us in the STP 3 & 4 project. Their participation will enhance the prospects for success across many critical aspects of the project, including development, financing, construction and of course, operations. With their Kashiwazaki 6 and 7 plants, they were the first nuclear plant owner in the world to bring an advanced nuclear project online, on time and within budget. And of course, the Kashiwazaki units are ABWRs [Advanced Boiling Water Reactors]. TEPCO has been a technical adviser to the STP Project for several years, but now as an owner and development partner, they will be directly and actively involved in all phases of making this project a tremendous success for our shareholders and as a result of today's announcement, for their shoulders as well.
Slide 5, details terms of the investment. TEPCO expects to pay $280 million in two phases over 12 months to acquire an effective 18% interest in the STP 3 & 4 Project. They will also pay their proportionate share of the ongoing cost of project development. They will deploy immediately several commercial and technical personnel deeply and directly experienced in ABWR construction operation to the United States to be part of the project development, including the EPC negotiations. The U.S. team will be backed up all of the very considerable resources of TEPCO in Japan. So in summary, we are very, very pleased and indeed honored to have TEPCO as a partner in the STP 3 & 4 Project.
But of course, the mere participation of TEPCO will not by itself provide an absolute guarantee of the success of STP. This, after all, is project development, and several important steps need to be taken to ensure the success of the project. Indeed, TEPCO's financial participation in STP 3 & 4 is predicated on receipt of a conditional loan guarantee from the Department of Energy. After you hear from John, Gerry and Chris, I will be reporting in greater detail about the current status of our loan guarantee application and our plans to carry this project forward or not, based on the DOE's decision.
So over to you, John Ragan."

During Q1, NRG continue to sustain solid operating and commercial performance. Slide 7, summarizes these events for the quarter. Beginning with safety, the company has started 2010 with a very positive record by a",1906,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. During Q1, NRG continue to sustain solid operating and commercial performance. Slide 7, summarizes these events for the quarter. Beginning with safety, the company has started 2010 with a very positive record by achieving top decile performance with a quarterly OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration] recordable rate of 0.85. We had 31 plants that had no recordable incidents and sustained one of our longest continuous stretches without a recordable incident across the entire fleet. We believe the disciplined commitment and emphasis on safety sets the cultural foundation required at our company and provides the catalyst to achieve superior operating results.
Moving on to our fleet operating performance. Baseload equivalent availability during the quarter was 88%, which was lower than the 2009 operating result. This was due to several unplanned outages in January and February, which I will discuss on the next slide. We continue to make progress on our construction projects in the Northeast. The Indian River environmental control project has been re-scoped for Unit 4 only, following the cancellation of the Unit 3 portion earlier in the quarter. The Devon repowering project is scheduled for completion in June and the commissioning phase of this project is now underway. 
On the renewables front, we have completed all of our operational and commercial due diligence in the South Trent wind project, and awaits the completion of the Texas PUCT [Public Utility Commission of Texas] approval process and certain tax and financing requirements necessary to close this transaction.
Our commercial operations and retail organizations continue to maximize value for NRG by combining the strengths of our Wholesale Generation and Retail portfolios. Additionally, we have continued to be successful in winning additional load contracts in the regions where we have generation resources. These longer-term contracts provide another vehicle to hedge our generation position and the opportunity to develop longer-term relationships with customers.
Turning to Slide 8, our total Generation for the quarter was slightly ahead out of our output from a year ago. The addition of Cedar Bayou 4 and the Elbow Creek and Langford wind farm help to make up for lower generation that occurred due to retirement of Somerset Unit 6 and the unplanned outages in b rates [ph] with some of our baseload plants. These outages occurred at three plants and consisted of boiler and fan issues at Big Cajun II, a stuck-control rod at STP Unit 1 and a generator rotor ground at Dunkirk. All three plants significantly improved their performance in March, moving back into top-quartile operating performance.
Turning to our Retail business. We have continued to see strong results, and customer count has become more stable in the first quarter, as compared to the previous quarters as shown by the continued reduction in customer attrition during Q1. Overall, our Mass sales volumes were higher due to colder-than-normal weather, and stronger margins were achieved due to falling gas prices during the quarter. The Retail group has continued to increase the renewal of existing C&I customers and has won several key customer accounts that extend the term and diversity of our Retail portfolio. Reliant remains the largest C&I provider in Texas and their strategic economic and operational success that the Reliant acquisition has exhibited over the past year, continues to reinforce our belief that combining these two entities creates a highly efficient counter-cyclical business model that enhances the total value for NRG.
Turning to market fundamentals on Slide 9. Quarter-on-quarter demand growth for ERCOT showed greater strength relative to PJM East, indicating a faster recovery from the recession as compared to other parts of the country. ERCOT set a new winter peak demand record of 55,878 megawatts in January, which was 10% higher than the previous winter peak set in 2007. Houston heat rates continue to be well supported due to increase in demand recovery, tighter supply and uncertainty around future regulations. In 2009, coal-to-gas switching was concentrated in the Southeast and Northeast markets. However, due to colder weather and higher gas prices in the first quarter relative to a year ago, this situation was reduced significantly.
Looking forward and under normal weather conditions, we see coal-to-gas switching being particularly concentrated in Eastern PJM due to increasing CAPP [Central Appalachian] coal prices, which reflect a more international price, as well as lower natural gas prices and tighter basis spreads. We expect negligible coal-to-gas switch in ERCOT for the year.
Lastly on the bottom right, I would like to discuss what we consider NRG's coal portfolio advantage. Our coal fleet primarily burns PRB [Powder River Basin] and lignite coal, and our assets are located in regional markets where gas sets the price of power in most hours of the year. Generally speaking, NRG's coal mix is less expensive and cleaner-burning than the CAPP coal that other eastern IPPs [independent power producers] burn. Additionally, concentrated in gas marginal markets allows coal units to earn the spread between the generation cost of a coal unit and a gas unit. This results in NRG achieving a stronger dark spread compared to other IPP fleets concentrated in the coal marginal markets, where prices are closer to the coal-unit market-generation costs.
Before I conclude the operations section, I want to discuss NRG's environmental strategy. As outlined on Slide 10, our current environmental CapEx program is designed to meet the stringent state regulations in New York and Delaware, as well as anticipated federal mercury-control requirements and the original CAIR [Clean Air Interstate Rule] Program. Upon completion of these projects, NRG will be one of the cleanest coal fleets with very low NOx [Nitrogen oxide] and low-to-moderate SO2 [sulphur dioxide] emission rates. Mercury reductions will be state-of-the-art. 
So what projects would be left after this work is complete and additional rules are put in place? Turning to Slide 11, as you know, the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] is creating rules that will cover air emissions for acid gases and mercury, all combustion by-products and a fluent water standards associated with the current 316(b) policies. The likely outcome for the industry is additional investment for air quality controls, the elimination of wet surface impoundments for ash disposal and the mitigation of once-through cooling. 
Because NRG has already invested in environmental control improvements, the potential remaining investment is manageable. The largest impact to NRG energy would be the installation of maximum available control technology for acid gases, which is thought to be an SO2 removal system. EPA is currently collecting data and is not expected to propose a rule until next March. A worst-case analysis for NRG would be to install six-drive scrubbers and an additional baghouse at our remaining unscrubbed units. But we believe there are mitigating factors to be considered. Our current emission rates are relatively low and could be lowered with some operational changes. Additionally, EPA regulations may offer some flexibility. We recently proposed MACT [maximum achievable control technology] standard for industrial boilers, allows facility averaging across the same type of units. A similar provision for electric generators would provide greater flexibility to meet the new stringent limits. Finally, we believe that the demand for controls across the industry result in continued technological advances and lower costs. 
With regard to ash landfills and water, these new rules should have relatively limited impact on NRG. Our coal facilities currently employ dry disposal practices for fly ash. And with one coal unit in Big Cajun II and the Encina and El Segundo gas plants do not have existing or budgeted mitigation for once-through cooling.
In summary, do we have future environmental investments to make? Most likely, yes. When the rules are available, NRG will implement plans to meet the requirements through a mix of repowering, controls, operational flexibility and emissions averaging where possible. However, we don't expect the worst-case scenario to become NRG's base-case scenario for environmental spend. Assessing our current state of environmental controls and any potential future obligations, we see ourselves very well-positioned, as compared to other coal-fired peers within the sector.
Switching now to the hedge profile of our portfolio on Slide 12, our Wholesale and Retail segments continue to be well-hedged over the next few years. Our baseload generation is more than 100% hedged this year, 70% next year and greater than 50% the following. We have continued to actively hedge our Baseload portfolio during Q1. But given the current gas environment, we have been focused on using option structures like we did back in 2006. This strategy helps to protect us from further downward gas price movements, while retaining some upside through positive price movements. We will be in a better position to provide you with more detail on our 2011 hedge strategy during our next earnings call.
Concerning our Retail position, we increased our hedge percentages due to the growth in fully priced retail load. Since we are talking about hedging, let me spend a minute on the potential impact of the Financial Reform Bill on our hedging program. We anticipate that new legislation will require financial derivatives to be traded on exchanges. But we also expect that end-user exemption that will allow us to continue transacting over the counter and therefore, continue using our first lien structure as collateral for hedging. In a very unlikely case that we do not qualify as an end-user, we will rely less on our first lien and more on our matching our Generation and Retail portfolios, which provides NRG a significant competitive advantage by having a natural offsetting position for our supply portfolio.  
The chart at the top right shows our coal and transport hedge positions. While we are well-positioned through 2011, we are currently working on firming up a few contracts, which are rolling off in the near future. The bottom left chart illustrates our baseload gas price, heat rate and coal sensitivities. As you can see, NRG tends to be more leveraged in natural gas changes than equally probable heat rate and PRB coal changes. The negative gas sensitivity in 2010 is caused by NRG being more than 100% hedged for our Generation business. 
Finally, we have added a coal price sensitivity to this chart, which shows our exposure to unhedged market-commodity coal-price movements. The sensitivity describes the gross margin impact of $1.50 per ton upward movement in PRB commodity prices, which is our predominant coal fuel. Given what we have shown on our use of PRB and lignite coal on Slide 9, our sensitivity is fairly limited, particularly through 2012.
In closing, Slide 13, sums up our near-term goals. I want to specifically mention two. First, we will stay very focused on achieving top-quartile to top-decile safety and operational performance throughout our fleet. Based on the tragedies we have all seen in the power generation, coal mining and offshore drilling sectors during the first four months of 2011, it is imperative to continuously improve our safety programs and always keep safety over production as our defining DNA structure within the NRG culture.
Secondly, our Commercial Operations group will continue to look for attractive opportunities to hedge the forward portfolios in the most collaterally efficient way. We continue to believe it is still early in the year and we'll remain vigilant in looking for opportunities to hedge more of 2011 and 2012 portfolio positions, as long as the strategy meets our fundamental price outlook within our different regions. 
Now I will turn it over to Gerry, who will discuss our financial results."

Good morning, and thank you once again for joining us today to discuss NRG's first quarter 2010 financial results. Since this is my last conference call as Interim Chief Financial Officer, a role I greatly enjoyed, I will talk to this quarter's actual results, while Chris Schade, my very able replacement, will address 2010 guidance and his priorities as NRG's new Chief Financial Officer. I will continue to serve on the NRG Board of Directors.
Turning to our financial summary on Slide 15. The company delivered record financial results in the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $601 million, a 26% increase from a year ago. This increase was driven by the excellent performance of Reliant Energy, which contributed $190 million of adjusted EBITDA.  During this quarter, the company made payments on its Term Loan B, as well as settling Common Stock Finance I or CSF I, resulting in its total outflow of $471 million. It should be noted that the decision to settle the CSF I four months earlier than planned resulted in savings of $7 million. Total liquidity now stands at $3.2 billion, including over $1.8 billion in cash. Chris will be discussing in more detail the adjusted 2010 guidance. But in summary, we are leaving EBITDA guidance unchanged at $2.2 billion, and increasing free cash flow guidance by $112 million to $462 million.
Turning to Slide 16. The quarter-over-quarter adjusted EBITDA bridge or waterfall slide is presented. This slide reinforces the complementary benefits of owning both Wholesale Generation and Retail in the state of Texas, as well as the two businesses contributed a net favorable variance of a $142 million quarter-over-quarter. Reliant Energy had a $190 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, driven by colder-than-normal weather with a 31% increase [indiscernible]. Reliant also benefited from improved performance in customer retention, as well as a reduction in bad debt expense as we began to see improved customer payments behavior.
Texas generation declined $48 million from $320 million in the first quarter of 2009 to $272 million for Q1 2010. The combination of a decline in hedge prices on our baseload assets, an 8% decline in nuclear generation and an 18% increase in delivered coal costs at WA Parish and Limestone, led to lower energy margins of $37 million. Additionally, O&M costs were higher this past quarter at STP by $9 million, as the plant prepared for its Unit 2 refueling and maintenance outage that began this past month.
The Northeast EBITDA results for Q1 2010 were lower by $30 million to $76 million from $106 million in 2009. The major drivers of this performance included the decision to retire Indian River Unit 3, lower-average baseload-hedged prices and a decline in generation. The plan to retire in Indian River Unit 3 by December 31, 2013, announced on February 3 resulted in $14 million of costs related to the write-off of construction in progress and termination fees. 
Energy margins meanwhile, were unfavorable, $38 million, driven by a decline in baseload hedge prices and a 9% decline in generation. Partially offsetting these unfavorable variances were capacity price increases in 2010 for New York and PJM totaling $8 million and a favorable operating cost, including lower maintenance and chemical costs of $14 million.
Turning to international results, decline of $11 million quarter-over-quarter is mainly as a result of MIBRAG's first quarter 2009 earnings contribution of $12 million, which were subsequently sold in June of that year. And finally, the sale of the Padoma announced on January 21, resulted in a $23 million positive impact on EBITDA as shown in [indiscernible]. 
Before closing and although not highlighted, adjusted EBITDA for the South Central region was lower by $3 million to $26 million. The decline was as a result of an 8% increase in load requirements, due to colder-than-normal weather and a 2.4% decrease in generation at Big Cajun. 
Slide 17, illustrates our first quarter 2010 free cash flow generation. Cash from operations for the quarter totaled $114 million, $25 million lower than 2009. Driving the decline quarter-over-quarter were both higher interest payments and changes in collateral postings. The $54 million increase in interest payments is related to the early termination of the CSF I, which included accrued interest payments of $52 million. 
Moving to free cash flow from recurring operations, preferred dividend payments were substantially reduced quarter-over-quarter at both the 5 3/4% and 4% convertible preferreds converted to common stock during the past 12 months. 
Turning to free cash flow. Environmental CapEx, net, totaled $38 million in the quarter and was mostly due to spending in Indian River for air quality control system for AQCS controls that are being installed. And finally, RepoweringNRG net cash expenditures are primarily related to STP 3 & 4 nuclear project. Last year, Repowering investments of $115 million included $32 million for NINA, $28 million for Langford and $11 million for Cedar Bayou.
Slide 18, outlines the company's liquidity position as of March 31, which excluding funds deposited by hedge counter-parties, stood at $3.2 billion. The driver of changes in liquidity are as follows: The Term Loan B paydown of $237 million, of which $229 million was related to the 2009 excess cash flow sweep. As you remember, during the fourth quarter conference call, we announced that we made an early payment of $200 million. In total, the 2009 excess cash flow sweep payment was $429 million. And $109 million of debt paydown, excluding interest of $52 million related to the early settlement of CSF I and $185 million of CapEx or capital expenditures. During the quarter, NRG issued $157 million net from the Synthetic LC Facility to support routine business activities, as well as replace Merrill Lynch as guarantor with certain Reliant Energy counter-parties.
These items were offset by cash from operations of $114 million and $29 million of proceeds from the sale of Padoma, as well as $59 million increase in availability of the first lien revolver as a result of finalizing the Dunkirk bonds at 5 7/8%. All in all, the company has sufficient hedging capacity within the lien structure to support its activities.
Turning to Slide 19. At the November 2009 Analyst Day held in Houston, I addressed a number of items that were going to occur that would simplify our capital structure. We've already spoken about the excess cash flow sweep, the early settlement of the CSF I and the conversion of the 4% preferred. But here you can see the impact to NRG's overall capital structure. With the strength of our balance sheet and strong liquidity position, NRG is positioned to take advantage of future growth opportunity. I'm also pleased that recognition of these efforts was confirmed by Fitch last week, as the firm upgraded their ratings on NRG reflecting both the stable outlook and the relative strength of our balance sheet.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the new CFO, Christian."

Before turning to the next slide, I would like to say that I'm very happy to be here at NRG and look forward to working with David and his team, as we continue a proven track record of business execution and prudent financial management. 
I would like to start with our 2010 outlook on Slide 21. The company recorded record results in the first quarter while on a low gas price environment. These results reinforced our Texas-based strategy of owning both wholesale and retail and as such, we are reaffirming our full year EBITDA guidance of $2.2 billion. The company generally has not changed guidance during the first quarter as it is still early in the year, and the summer months can be primary drivers of full year results. With that said, the company is off to a very good start.
I would like just to briefly cover our capital expenditure plans for 2010, our Repowering Investments guidance of $92 million includes $54 million into GenConn Energy, a 50-50 joint venture with United Illuminating as the repowered facility of Devon, Connecticut is expected to soon start commercial operations and contribute to results this year. $40 million for the installation of the combined heat and power system at the new University Medical Center at Princeton at Plainsboro, $10 million for demolition work at our El Segundo, California facility, $7 million for electric vehicles and $5 million for offshore met [meteorological] towers as part of our offshore wind initiative.
As for our nuclear development program, our net cash spend is estimated to be $328 million. With that, free cash flow is forecast to be higher than projected last quarter by $112 million to $462 million, reflecting the anticipated proceeds from Tokyo Electric, which David will cover in greater detail later in the presentation. Finally, based on Friday's closing stock price of $22.64, the recurring free cash flow yield currently stands at just over 18% or $4.10 per share.
Slide 22 provides an update on the company's 2010 capital allocation program. During the first quarter, significant progress was made on the plan including capital management and growth initiatives. While Gerry has already addressed the capital management portion of the plan, I would like to briefly address share repurchases, NRG's growth initiatives and my priorities for the coming year. 
Although there weren't share repurchases completed in the first quarter, NRG is committed to the previously announced $180 million Board-approved repurchase plan and we look to complete it by year end. Second, in the first quarter, the company made significant progress moving its clean energy initiative forward through; the pending acquisition of the South Trent Wind Farm in Texas, which brings the company's wind portfolio to approximately 450 megawatts; the Department of Energy's selection of NRG to receive over $150 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for WA Parish's post-combustion carbon capture demonstration project; and the agreement announced today with Tokyo Electric to invest in NINA's STP 3 & 4 project, which greatly enhances the company's financial flexibility as we move through the second half of 2010.
Now before turning it back over to David I want to address a few of my top priorities for the year. My experience from my 10-year at Medarex is that liquidity is king. And it will be a priority to manage carefully our balance sheet and liquidity requirements. NRG consistently generates strong free cash flow. And in my mind, there is distinct balance between managing liquidity, continuing to invest in the company and returning value to shareholders through share repurchases and debt reductions. To the extent our restricted payments basket covenant on outstanding debt impacts our ability to efficiently or best allocate capital for stakeholders, then NRG must consider solutions to relieve such restrictions. However, in my view, any consideration must also be based on market conditions affecting our operations. 
Second, NRG has a history of financial transparency in its reporting practices and I expect to maintain that level of detail, while improving our practices as needed. And finally, as I continue to integrate myself into NRG's business, I look forward to meeting many of our investors and analysts as possible over the coming weeks and months.
With that, I'll turn it back to David for closing comments and questions."

In particular, I want to thank you, Gerry, for pitching in for the last six months and we look forward to continuing to work with you on the Board. Now turning back to the presentation in nuclear development on Slide 24",1846,"Well, thank you, Chris, and John. In particular, I want to thank you, Gerry, for pitching in for the last six months and we look forward to continuing to work with you on the Board. 
Now turning back to the presentation in nuclear development on Slide 24. The current status of the STP 3 & 4 project is really quite simple. Everything depends on actions, which will be taken in Washington sometime in the next several weeks. Almost two years after we filed our application for a Federal loan guarantee and a full five years after such loan guarantees were authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which is what triggered our development of STP 3 & 4, we are now in the absolute final stage of DOE consideration of our loan guarantee application. As the DOE process has been both very demanding and highly iterative, we are confident that we have done everything reasonably requested of us to satisfy the government's concerns, which have been ably and forcedly expressed by the DOE staff and their consultants on behalf of the American taxpayer. An Act, which has been focused on ensuring the credit quality of the proposed loan guarantee.
As such and while we have no assurance that at this time from the DOE or from any other branch of the U.S. government that we will be awarded a guarantee, we are and we remain confident in our position. The issue that exists is one of appropriations and timing. While the Obama administration is seeking to expand the Nuclear Loan Guarantee Program in the next budget cycle. The next budget cycle is months away and right now, they have two projects, our project and Constellation's Calvert Cliffs project, which are at the same place in the process and each asking for about $7 billion in loan guarantees when there is a little more than $10 billion of currently appropriated and available. 
Moreover, while not NRG and we don't believe Constellation based on statements they have made, are in a position to carry their project through to the next budget cycle at a cash burn rate that will keep their project or our project on track. We believe there is very strong bipartisan support across a broad swath of the executive and legislative branches to make it possible for the U.S. government to support both projects without disruption. We believe our public policymakers in Washington recognize and appreciate that much has been invested by Constellation and NRG in these massive greenhouse gas reducing infrastructure projects, and that these projects represent a large number of present and future American jobs.
As the vanguard of the nuclear renaissance, the success of these projects is essential to the buildout of the domestic nuclear supply chain that will be needed for the United States to be cost competitive in the burgeoning global market for nuclear power plants. But as we all know, it can be a very long way in Washington from good intention to positive outcome. So we at NRG are prepared both for a positive result and a negative result. Our plans for both outcomes is outlined in broad-brushed terms on Slide 25. If we get a full loan guarantee, we move forward to the next steps in a cash-prudent manner. If we do not, we essentially suspend work on the project and reduce the external cash burn to near zero, while we seek to mitigate our exposure to the project today.
Notwithstanding our contingency plan for what we do if we don't win, you should walk away from this conference call knowing that, we, the management of NRG, are very confident that we will secure Federal loan guarantee. It is equally important for you to understand that such a win would indeed be a big win for NRG shareholders and would not be a de facto loss as some of you may be previous to today's announcement might have thought. If we win, we will pursue the project vigorously on all critical path items. But we nonetheless, will significantly reduced our planned burn rate on project engineering. Recognizing that we don't need to be as far along as the time our CLO [collateralized loan obligation] is expected to be granted as we had previously planned. 
Moreover, as depicted on Slide 26, in part due to the buy-in and participation of TEPCO, and as a result of various additional sources of project funding, we expect to fund STP through the critical stages of 2010 with a call on NRG's cash resources, which is while still significant, very manageable relative to the size of the project opportunity. If we get past the loan guarantee, there are two more critical steps in 2010 as outlined on Slide 27.
First, as we outlined at our Analyst Day last November, we need to confirm that Toshiba and Fluor can and will build the project for $10 billion or less. Very detailed work is being done on this issue as we speak and it's progressing satisfactorily. Then armed with a reliable EPC number, we then need to confirm off-take with the off-take partners with whom we currently have Memorandum of Understanding for a significant portion of the new plants output. In this respect, I know there is concern in the market that those off-take agreements will not be available at a viable price level, as a result of the decline in natural gas prices over the past couple of years. While of course, I cannot provide you assurance until binding agreements have been signed, our analysis indicates that if you take into account, first the fact that the natural gas forward curve is in contango. Second, the $18 per megawatt hour production tax credit under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Third, the benefit of fuel diversification to load serving entities in Texas, many of whom are almost entirely dependent on gas-fired generation at this time. And fourth, if you ascribe a modest amount of value to the future value of the full carbon hedge provided by nuclear, we believe we have a very good chance of success at arranging sufficient off-take for this project and ensure project viability at an equity return that makes it worthwhile from the perspective of NRG. And I should say, that's at a risk adjusted return of equity that is appropriate for a nuclear power plant.
Which brings me to the last point, which I wanted to address directly, before opening the lines for questions. And I wanted to address the issue of shareholder value in the context of our nuclear development project. All of us on this call, whether you're a regular shareholder of NRG or an employee shareholder of NRG as all of us from the company are, we can agree on one thing and that's it we're unhappy with the company's share price performance over the past several months. This is particularly frustrating for many of us in the company because as depicted on Slide 29, we feel that our stock has been under pressure over the past months despite several obvious wins, which we have achieved.
It has become increasingly clear to us that we cannot hope to create upward momentum in our share price simply by posting more and more achievements in the win column. We need to address directly the factors which overhang our stock, namely bearish stock price settlement and concern about the cost risk and prospects of our nuclear development. With respect to gas prices, there obviously is nothing we can do about the trajectory of gas prices themselves but we can diversify our expected cash flow streams away from near total dependence directly or indirectly on natural gas prices as existed as was the case for NRG before we bought Reliant. A key differentiation point between us and our current peer group of merchant generators now and increasingly in the future, is that we see the path to maximum shareholder value creation as something different from just lining up as many power plants as you can get your hands on. So that you can sell as many megawatt hours that you can at natural gas derived prices.
We see the future in terms of a dual strategy, which we depicted on Slide 30. That is using our core wholesale generation plus retail strength, as a platform to spring board into a range of non-natural gas correlated revenue and free cash flow streams, such as renewable energy credits, carbon credits, payments for capacity, firming and other auxiliary services and green energy service business, whether associated with smart meters, electric vehicle infrastructure or both. And in most if not all these areas, our unique position in wholesale and retail and in Texas, gives us a substantial competitive advantage. We began the process last November by showing Slide 31 at our Analyst Day, of laying out for you our objective that by the latter part of this decade, we will roughly double the company's recurring free cash flow to our first mover push into the areas I just mentioned. That push is led from a free cash flow perspective by what we hope and expect to achieve in low carbon base load power, principally nuclear and in renewables, principally solar. You can expect that as we go forward on the quarterly calls and Analyst Days to come, that we will fill out this picture and demonstrate to you how we are going about achieving this financial objective. Doubling our recurring free cash flow in a few years may strike you as ambitious. But of course, that is what we achieved from 2006, our first year with Texas Genco through 2009. 
So finally, in conclusion, on Slide 22 (sic)[32], new advanced nuclear power plays a fundamental part in our plan, as I believe it does in the future energy mix of our increasingly low carbon society. Nothing has more confirmed that to me than the Obama Administration's announcement earlier this year that it was seeking $54 billion of nuclear loan guarantee authority, being that support for new nuclear in Washington is now fully bipartisan. $54 billion of loan guarantees mean $70-plus billion of new nuclear projects, enough to fund eight to 10 new plants. I believe that the United States starts to build 10 new nuclear plants, then inevitably, our country will build 100 as we need to do. That means new nuclear power will be a $500-billion to $700-billion market, and we at NRG have the opportunity through the STP 3 & 4 projects to be the first mover in an industry, which certainly will follow the lead of the successful first movers.
That is why we have taken on this challenge in order to access this once-in-a-business-lifetime opportunity. We will pursue this opportunity aggressively but I hope you are convinced after today's presentation, we will not pursue it irrationally or in a manner that is financially imprudent. And we will not proceed without a near-term Federal loan guarantee commitment. With that, Chanel, we'd be very pleased to take any questions."

I mean, I think if we do not get awarded the loan guarantee at this time, probably what we would do and this is first addressing your characterization as a cold stop, is that and we would have to see what the cost of this would be. But we would probably shut down everything except we might keep the license process going. Our initial estimate is just see the license through would cost less than $10 million a year. And given where we are and the fact that certainly, one thing we would be doing would be trying to mitigate the amount we've spent through sort of selling the intellectual property to other people who might want to be pursuing that type of project. We probably would try and carry through to get the license done, unless it was too expensive. Apart from that, if they came back a year from now, when the -- further money has been authorized and said, you can have your loan guarantee now and we basically wound down everything, we would have to look at them. We would have to look at the circumstances at the time. One thing is when you unwind an effort like this, as they say, it's hard to put Humpty Dumpty back together again. So I wouldn't be overly confident that we could come back and resurrect the project a year from now."

I think there are a lot of people in Washington, Certainly, people in our end and I would presume on Constellation, that are suggesting various ways that this dilemma could be solved. And additional appropriations outside the normal budget cycle is probably most prominent on that list, as the government does do appropriations outside of the budget cycle. And while the amount of money that we would be talking about, the shortfall of the $14 billion needed minus the $10 billion they have, $4 billion sounds like a very large number. My understanding of the appropriations that they would actually have to put through the process, would actually just be essentially the cost of the loan premium, which is a number that I've heard -- that less than $100 million. So that is definitely not insurmountable. But at this point, I'm not in a position to preclude any of the variety of ways that people inside and outside the government have suggested that, for the government to resolve this conundrum.

And let me add my welcome to everyone. Good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2010. While I'm speaking to you from Tokyo, joining me in Princeton and speaking on this call are John Ragan, our Chief Operating Officer; Gerry Luterman and Chris Schade, our outgoing and incoming Chief Financial Officers. Also with us in Princeton and available to answer any specific questions you might ask on the call are Mauricio Gutierrez, who runs our Commercial Operations business; and Jason Few, who is responsible for our Retail business. So let's begin.
Ladies and gentlemen, the shareholders of NRG, thank you for being patient and waiting until the very end of the first quarter reporting period for our earnings release. Today, we're pleased to bring you exciting news, both about the extraordinary financial results, which we achieved in the first quarter 2010, and also about the agreement signed today here in Tokyo with Tokyo Electric Power Company to invest in the South Texas Project, STP 3 & 4.
First, with respect to the quarter, Gerry and Chris will report to you more fulsomely in a few minutes. But I simply wanted to emphasize to you the magnitude and significance of what the women and men who make up NRG have achieved: a 26% increase in the first quarter compared to what was considered by most to be a very strong first quarter 2009. Our $601 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was fueled by strong operating performance across all regions and all business segments. Of course, the two factors which made this number most possible in the face of a declining commodity price environment and generally weak economic conditions were our effective and farsighted forward hedging program and the exceptional performance, financially and operationally, of our Retail Energy business in Texas.  
We have spoken to the financial community repeatedly in the past about the strength of our wholesale retail combination in Texas, a strength that is unique among competitive power generation companies and today, you have another data point which visibly demonstrates that strength. In a quarter that was challenging for our Generation business as a result of macroeconomic conditions, our Retail business more than picked up the slack financially. Indeed, our Retail business, ably led by Jason and his team, not only posted exceptional results, they also largely stabilized the Mass business from a customer-account perspective and took giant strides towards resurrecting our C&I business in Texas. You will hear more about our strength and improved performance across all performance metrics in the Retail segment in the months to come. 
So with ample liquidity and newly simplified capital structure, a core Generation business that's hanging tough in a challenging environment; a Retail business, which has been stabilized with respect to its mass customers and is now growing in C&I; and now with Chris Schade joining us to take up the crucial position in our management structure as CFO, I'm pleased to say that NRG is no longer in transition as we have been for the past several months. We're ready to springboard off a core Wholesale Retail business, which is second to none. So turning to the future, under normal circumstances, I'd be reporting to you at some length about the great strides that we have taken on our renewable initiatives, the exciting opportunities that we are acting upon and the enormous market potential in the renewable space, a market which becomes more exciting and more real each day thanks to the Washington's push towards renewables, with discussions about projects like our DOE award for post-combustion carbon capture, leading to enhanced oil recovery at Parish, or about the enhanced prospects for our NRG Bluewater Wind subsidiary, as a result of Salazar's Cape Wind announcement will have to wait another day, as I want to focus my comments on today's TEPCO [Tokyo Electric Power Company] announcement.
For the reason shown on Slide 4, TEPCO quite simply is the best possible equity partner for us in the STP 3 & 4 project. Their participation will enhance the prospects for success across many critical aspects of the project, including development, financing, construction and of course, operations. With their Kashiwazaki 6 and 7 plants, they were the first nuclear plant owner in the world to bring an advanced nuclear project online, on time and within budget. And of course, the Kashiwazaki units are ABWRs [Advanced Boiling Water Reactors]. TEPCO has been a technical adviser to the STP Project for several years, but now as an owner and development partner, they will be directly and actively involved in all phases of making this project a tremendous success for our shareholders and as a result of today's announcement, for their shareholders as well.
Slide 5 details terms of the investment. TEPCO expects to pay $280 million in two phases over 12 months to acquire an effective 18% interest in the STP 3 & 4 Project. They will also pay their proportionate share of the ongoing cost of project development. They will deploy immediately several commercial and technical personnel deeply and directly experienced in ABWR construction operation to the United States to be part of the project development, including the EPC negotiations. The U.S. team will be backed up by all of the very considerable resources of TEPCO in Japan. So in summary, we are very, very pleased and indeed honored to have TEPCO as a partner in the STP 3 & 4 Project.
But of course, the mere participation of TEPCO will not by itself provide an absolute guarantee of the success of STP. This, after all, is project development, and several important steps need to be taken to ensure the success of the project. Indeed, TEPCO's financial participation in STP 3 & 4 is predicated on receipt of a conditional loan guarantee from the Department of Energy. After you hear from John, Gerry and Chris, I will be reporting in greater detail about the current status of our loan guarantee application and our plans to carry this project forward or not, based on the DOE's decision.
So over to you, John Ragan."

During Q1, NRG continue to sustain solid operating and commercial performance. Slide 7, summarizes these events for the quarter. Beginning with safety, the company has started 2010 with a very positive record by a",1906,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. During Q1, NRG continue to sustain solid operating and commercial performance. Slide 7, summarizes these events for the quarter. Beginning with safety, the company has started 2010 with a very positive record by achieving top decile performance with a quarterly OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration] recordable rate of 0.85. We had 31 plants that had no recordable incidents and sustained one of our longest continuous stretches without a recordable incident across the entire fleet. We believe the disciplined commitment and emphasis on safety sets the cultural foundation required at our company and provides the catalyst to achieve superior operating results.
Moving on to our fleet operating performance. Baseload equivalent availability during the quarter was 88%, which was lower than the 2009 operating result. This was due to several unplanned outages in January and February, which I will discuss on the next slide. We continue to make progress on our construction projects in the Northeast. The Indian River environmental control project has been re-scoped for Unit 4 only, following the cancellation of the Unit 3 portion earlier in the quarter. The Devon repowering project is scheduled for completion in June and the commissioning phase of this project is now underway. 
On the renewables front, we have completed all of our operational and commercial due diligence in the South Trent wind project, and awaits the completion of the Texas PUCT [Public Utility Commission of Texas] approval process and certain tax and financing requirements necessary to close this transaction.
Our commercial operations and retail organizations continue to maximize value for NRG by combining the strengths of our Wholesale Generation and Retail portfolios. Additionally, we have continued to be successful in winning additional load contracts in the regions where we have generation resources. These longer-term contracts provide another vehicle to hedge our generation position and the opportunity to develop longer-term relationships with customers.
Turning to Slide 8, our total Generation for the quarter was slightly ahead out of our output from a year ago. The addition of Cedar Bayou 4 and the Elbow Creek and Langford wind farm help to make up for lower generation that occurred due to retirement of Somerset Unit 6 and the unplanned outages in b rates [ph] with some of our baseload plants. These outages occurred at three plants and consisted of boiler and fan issues at Big Cajun II, a stuck-control rod at STP Unit 1 and a generator rotor ground at Dunkirk. All three plants significantly improved their performance in March, moving back into top-quartile operating performance.
Turning to our Retail business, we have continued to see strong results, and customer count has become more stable in the first quarter, as compared to the previous quarters as shown by the continued reduction in customer attrition during Q1. Overall, our Mass sales volumes were higher due to colder-than-normal weather, and stronger margins were achieved due to falling gas prices during the quarter. The Retail group has continued to increase the renewal of existing C&I customers and has won several key customer accounts that extend the term and diversity of our Retail portfolio. Reliant remains the largest C&I provider in Texas and their strategic economic and operational success that the Reliant acquisition has exhibited over the past year, continues to reinforce our belief that combining these two entities creates a highly efficient counter-cyclical business model that enhances the total value for NRG.
Turning to market fundamentals on Slide 9, quarter-on-quarter demand growth for ERCOT showed greater strength relative to PJM East, indicating a faster recovery from the recession as compared to other parts of the country. ERCOT set a new winter peak demand record of 55,878 megawatts in January, which was 10% higher than the previous winter peak set in 2007. Houston heat rates continue to be well supported due to increase in demand recovery, tighter supply and uncertainty around future regulations. In 2009, coal-to-gas switching was concentrated in the Southeast and Northeast markets. However, due to colder weather and higher gas prices in the first quarter relative to a year ago, this situation was reduced significantly.
Looking forward and under normal weather conditions, we see coal-to-gas switching being particularly concentrated in Eastern PJM due to increasing CAPP [Central Appalachian] coal prices, which reflect a more international price, as well as lower natural gas prices and tighter basis spreads. We expect negligible coal-to-gas switch in ERCOT for the year.
Lastly on the bottom right, I would like to discuss what we consider NRG's coal portfolio advantage. Our coal fleet primarily burns PRB [Powder River Basin] and lignite coal, and our assets are located in regional markets where gas sets the price of power in most hours of the year. Generally speaking, NRG's coal mix is less expensive and cleaner-burning than the CAPP coal that other eastern IPPs [independent power producers] burn. Additionally, concentrated in gas marginal markets allows coal units to earn the spread between the generation cost of a coal unit and a gas unit. This results in NRG achieving a stronger dark spread compared to other IPP fleets concentrated in the coal marginal markets, where prices are closer to the coal-unit market-generation costs.
Before I conclude the operations section, I want to discuss NRG's environmental strategy. As outlined on Slide 10, our current environmental CapEx program is designed to meet the stringent state regulations in New York and Delaware, as well as anticipated federal mercury-control requirements and the orginal CAIR [Clean Air Interstate Rule] Program. Upon completion of these projects, NRG will be one of the cleanest coal fleets with very low NOx [Nitrogen oxide] and low-to-moderate SO2 [sulphur dioxide] emission rates. Mercury reductions will be state-of-the-art. 
So what projects would be left after this work is complete and additional rules are put in place? Turning to Slide 11, as you know, the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] is creating rules that will cover air emissions for acid gases and mercury, all combustion by-products and a fluent water standards associated with the current 316(b) policies. The likely outcome for the industry is additional investment for air quality controls, the elimination of wet surface impoundments for ash disposal and the mitigation of once-through cooling. 
Because NRG has already invested in environmental control improvements, the potential remaining investment is manageable. The largest impact to NRG energy would be the installation of maximum available control technology for acid gases, which is thought to be an SO2 removal system. EPA is currently collecting data and is not expected to propose a rule until next March. A worst-case analysis for NRG would be to install six-drive scrubbers and an additional baghouse at our remaining unscrubbed units. But we believe there are mitigating factors to be considered. Our current emission rates are relatively low and could be lowered with some operational changes. Additionally, EPA regulations may offer some flexibility. We recently proposed MACT [maximum achievable control technology] standard for industrial boilers, allows facility averaging across the same type of units. A similar provision for electric generators would provide greater flexibility to meet the new stringent limits. Finally, we believe that the demand for controls across the industry result in continued technological advances and lower costs. 
With regard to ash landfills and water, these new rules should have relatively limited impact on NRG. Our coal facilities currently employ dry disposal practices for fly ash. And with one coal unit in Big Cajun II and the Encina and El Segundo gas plants do not have existing or budgeted mitigation for once-through cooling.
In summary, do we have future environmental investments to make? Most likely, yes. When the rules are available, NRG will implement plans to meet the requirements through a mix of repowering, controls, operational flexibility and emissions averaging where possible. However, we don't expect the worst-case scenario to become NRG's base-case scenario for environmental spend. Assessing our current state of environmental controls and any potential future obligations, we see ourselves very well-positioned, as compared to other coal-fired peers within the sector.
Switching now to the hedge profile of our portfolio on Slide 12, our Wholesale and Retail segments continue to be well-hedged over the next few years. Our baseload generation is more than 100% hedged this year, 70% next year and greater than 50% the following. We have continued to actively hedge our Baseload portfolio during Q1. But given the current gas environment, we have been focused on using option structures like we did back in 2006. This strategy helps to protect us from further downward gas price movements, while retaining some upside through positive price movements. We will be in a better position to provide you with more detail on our 2011 hedge strategy during our next earnings call.
Concerning our Retail position, we increased our hedge percentages due to the growth in fully priced retail load. Since we are talking about hedging, let me spend a minute on the potential impact of the Financial Reform Bill on our hedging program. We anticipate that new legislation will require financial derivatives to be traded on exchanges. But we also expect that end-user exemption that will allow us to continue transacting over the counter and therefore, continue using our first lien structure as collateral for hedging. In a very unlikely case that we do not qualify as an end-user, we will rely less on our first lien and more on our matching our Generation and Retail portfolios, which provides NRG a significant competitive advantage by having a natural offsetting position for our supply portfolio.  
The chart at the top right shows our coal and transport hedge positions. While we are well-positioned through 2011, we are currently working on firming up a few contracts, which are rolling off in the near future. The bottom left chart illustrates our baseload gas price, heat rate and coal sensitivities. As you can see, NRG tends to be more leveraged in natural gas changes than equally probable heat rate and PRB coal changes. The negative gas sensitivity in 2010 is caused by NRG being more than 100% hedged for our Generation business. 
Finally, we have added a coal price sensitivity to this chart, which shows our exposure to unhedged market-commodity coal-price movements. The sensitivity describes the gross margin impact of $1.50 per ton upward movement in PRB commodity prices, which is our predominant coal fuel. Given what we have shown on our use of PRB and lignite coal on Slide 9, our sensitivity is fairly limited, particularly through 2012.
In closing, Slide 13 sums up our near-term goals. I want to specifically mention two. First, we will stay very focused on achieving top-quartile to top-docile safety and operational performance throughout our fleet. Based on the tragedies we have all seen in the power generation, coal mining and offshore drilling sectors during the first four months of 2011, it is imperative to continuously improve our safety programs and always keep safety over production as our defining DNA structure within the NRG culture.
Secondly, our Commercial Operations group will continue to look for attractive opportunities to hedge the forward portfolios in the most collaterally efficient way. We continue to believe it is still early in the year and we'll remain vigilant in looking for opportunities to hedge more of 2011 and 2012 portfolio positions, as long as the strategy meets our fundamental price outlook within our different regions. 
Now I will turn it over to Gerry, who will discuss our financial results."

Good morning, and thank you once again for joining us today to discuss NRG's first quarter 2010 financial results. Since this is my last conference call as Interim Chief Financial Officer, a role I greatly enjoyed, I will talk to this quarter's actual results, while Chris Schade, my very able replacement, will address 2010 guidance and his priorities as NRG's new Chief Financial Officer. I will continue to serve on the NRG Board of Directors.
Turning to our financial summary on Slide 15, the company delivered record financial results in the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $601 million, a 26% increase from a year ago. This increase was driven by the excellent performance of Reliant Energy, which contributed $190 million of adjusted EBITDA.  During this quarter, the company made payments on its Term Loan B, as well as settling Common Stock Finance I or CSF I, resulting in a total outflow of $471 million. It should be noted that the decision to settle the CSF I four months earlier than planned resulted in savings of $7 million. Total liquidity now stands at $3.2 billion, including over $1.8 billion in cash. Chris will be discussing in more detail the adjusted 2010 guidance. But in summary, we are leaving EBITDA guidance unchanged at $2.2 billion, and increasing free cash flow guidance by $112 million to $462 million.
Turning to Slide 16. The quarter-over-quarter adjusted EBITDA bridge or waterfall slide is presented. This slide reinforces the complementary benefits of owning both Wholesale Generation and Retail in the state of Texas, as well as the two businesses contributed a net favorable variance of $142 million quarter-over-quarter. Reliant Energy had a $190 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, driven by colder-than-normal weather with a 31% increase [indiscernible]. Reliant also benefited from improved performance in customer retention, as well as a reduction in bad debt expense as we began to see improved customer payments behavior.
Texas generation declined $48 million from $320 million in the first quarter of 2009 to $272 million for Q1 2010. The combination of a decline in hedge prices on our baseload assets, an 8% decline in nuclear generation and an 18% increase in delivered coal costs at WA Parish and Limestone, led to lower energy margins of $37 million. Additionally, O&M costs were higher this past quarter at STP by $9 million, as the plant prepared for its Unit 2 refueling and maintenance outage that began this past month.
The Northeast EBITDA results for Q1 2010 were lower by $30 million to $76 million from $106 million in 2009. The major drivers of this performance included the decision to retire Indian River Unit 3, lower average baseload hedged prices and a decline in generation. The plan to retire Indian River Unit 3 by December 31, 2013, announced on February 3 resulted in $14 million of costs related to the write-off of construction in progress and termination fees. 
Energy margins meanwhile, were unfavorable, $38 million, driven by a decline in baseload hedge prices and a 9% decline in generation. Partially offsetting these unfavorable variances were capacity price increases in 2010 for New York and PJM totaling $8 million and a favorable operating cost, including lower maintenance and chemical costs of $14 million.
Turning to international results, decline of $11 million quarter-over-quarter is mainly as a result of MIBRAG's first quarter 2009 earnings contribution of $12 million, which were subsequently sold in June of that year. And finally, the sale of the Padoma announced on January 21, resulted in a $23 million positive impact on EBITDA as shown in [indiscernible]. 
Before closing and although not highlighted, adjusted EBITDA for the South Central region was lower by $3 million to $26 million. The decline was as a result of an 8% increase in load requirements, due to colder-than-normal weather and a 2.4% decrease in generation at Big Cajun. 
Slide 17, illustrates our first quarter 2010 free cash flow generation. Cash from operations for the quarter totaled $114 million, $25 million lower than 2009. Driving the decline quarter-over-quarter were both higher interest payments and changes in collateral postings. The $54 million increase in interest payments is related to the early termination of the CSF I, which included accrued interest payments of $52 million. 
Moving to free cash flow from recurring operations, preferred dividend payments were substantially reduced quarter-over-quarter at both the 5 3/4% and 4% convertible preferreds converted to common stock during the past 12 months. 
Turning to free cash flow. Environmental CapEx, net, totaled $38 million in the quarter and was mostly due to spending in Indian River for air quality control system for AQCS controls that are being installed. And finally, RepoweringNRG net cash expenditures are primarily related to STP 3 & 4 nuclear project. Last year, Repowering investments of $115 million included $32 million for NINA, $28 million for Langford and $11 million for Cedar Bayou.
Slide 18, outlines the company's liquidity position as of March 31, which excluding funds deposited by hedge counter-parties, stood at $3.2 billion. The driver of changes in liquidity are as follows: The Term Loan B paydown of $237 million, of which $229 million was related to the 2009 excess cash flow sweep. As you remember, during the fourth quarter conference call, we announced that we made an early payment of $200 million. In total, the 2009 excess cash flow sweep payment was $429 million. And $109 million of debt paydown, excluding interest of $52 million related to the early settlement of CSF I and $185 million of CapEx or capital expenditures. During the quarter, NRG issued $157 million net from the Synthetic LC Facility to support routine business activities, as well as replace Merrill Lynch as guarantor with certain Reliant Energy counter-parties.
These items were offset by cash from operations of $114 million and $29 million of proceeds from the sale of Padoma, as well as $59 million increase in availability of the first lien revolver as a result of finalizing the Dunkirk bonds at 5 7/8%. All in all, the company has sufficient hedging capacity within the lien structure to support its activities.
Turning to Slide 19, at the November 2009 Analyst Day held in Houston, I addressed a number of items that were going to occur that would simplify our capital structure. We've already spoken about the excess cash flow sweep, the early settlement of the CSF I and the conversion of the 4% preferred. But here you can see the impact to NRG's overall capital structure. With the strength of our balance sheet and strong liquidity position, NRG is positioned to take advantage of future growth opportunity. I'm also pleased that recognition of these efforts was confirmed by Fitch last week, as the firm upgraded their ratings on NRG reflecting both the stable outlook and the relative strength of our balance sheet.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the new CFO, Christian."

Before turning to the next slide, I would like to say that I'm very happy to be here at NRG and look forward to working with David and his team, as we continue a proven track record of business execution and prudent financial management. 
I would like to start with our 2010 outlook on Slide 21. The company recorded record results in the first quarter while on a low gas price environment. These results reinforced our Texas-based strategy of owning both wholesale and retail and as such, we are reaffirming our full year EBITDA guidance of $2.2 billion. The company generally has not changed guidance during the first quarter as it is still early in the year, and the summer months can be primary drivers of full year results. With that said, the company is off to a very good start.
I would like just to briefly cover our capital expenditure plans for 2010, our Repowering Investments guidance of $92 million includes $54 million into GenConn Energy, a 50-50 joint venture with United Illuminating as the repowered facility of Devon, Connecticut is expected to soon start commercial operations and contribute to results this year. $40 million for the installation of the combined heat and power system at the new University Medical Center at Princeton at Plainsboro, $10 million for demolition work at our El Segundo, California facility, $7 million for electric vehicles and $5 million for offshore met [meteorological] towers as part of our offshore wind initiative.
As for our nuclear development program, our net cash spend is estimated to be $328 million. With that, free cash flow is forecast to be higher than projected last quarter by $112 million to $462 million, reflecting the anticipated proceeds from Tokyo Electric, which David will cover in greater detail later in the presentation. Finally, based on Friday's closing stock price of $22.64, the recurring free cash flow yield currently stands at just over 18% or $4.10 per share.
Slide 22 provides an update on the company's 2010 capital allocation program. During the first quarter, significant progress was made on the plan including capital management and growth initiatives. While Gerry has already addressed the capital management portion of the plan, I would like to briefly address share repurchases, NRG's growth initiatives and my priorities for the coming year. 
Although there weren't share repurchases completed in the first quarter, NRG is committed to the previously announced $180 million Board-approved repurchase plan and we look to complete it by year end. Second, in the first quarter, the company made significant progress moving its clean energy initiative forward through; the pending acquisition of the South Trent Wind Farm in Texas, which brings the company's wind portfolio to approximately 450 megawatts; the Department of Energy's selection of NRG to receive over $150 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for WA Parish's post-combustion carbon capture demonstration project; and the agreement announced today with Tokyo Electric to invest in NINA's STP 3 & 4 project, which greatly enhances the company's financial flexibility as we move through the second half of 2010.
Now before turning it back over to David I want to address a few of my top priorities for the year. My experience from my 10-year at Medarex is that liquidity is king. And it will be a priority to manage carefully our balance sheet and liquidity requirements. NRG consistently generates strong free cash flow. And in my mind, there is distinct balance between managing liquidity, continuing to invest in the company and returning value to shareholders through share repurchases and debt reductions. To the extent our restricted payments basket covenant on outstanding debt impacts our ability to efficiently or best allocate capital for stakeholders, then NRG must consider solutions to relieve such restrictions. However, in my view, any consideration must also be based on market conditions affecting our operations. 
Second, NRG has a history of financial transparency in its reporting practices and I expect to maintain that level of detail, while improving our practices as needed. And finally, as I continue to integrate myself into NRG's business, I look forward to meeting many of our investors and analysts as possible over the coming weeks and months.
With that, I'll turn it back to David for closing comments and questions."

In particular, I want to thank you, Gerry, for pitching in for the last six months and we look forward to continuing to work with you on the Board. Now turning back to the presentation in nuclear development on Slide 24",1848,"Well, thank you, Chris, and John. In particular, I want to thank you, Gerry, for pitching in for the last six months and we look forward to continuing to work with you on the Board. 
Now turning back to the presentation in nuclear development on Slide 24. The current status of the STP 3 & 4 projects is really quite simple. Everything depends on actions which will be taken in Washington sometime in the next several weeks. Almost two years after we filed our application for a Federal loan guarantee and a full five years after such loan guarantees were authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which is what triggered our development of STP 3 & 4, we are now in the absolute final stage of DOE consideration of our loan guarantee application. As the DOE process has been both very demanding and highly iterative, we are confident that we have done everything reasonably requested of us to satisfy the government's concerns, which have been ably and forcedly expressed by the DOE staff and their consultants on behalf of the American taxpayer, and which have been focused on ensuring the credit quality of the proposed loan guarantee.
As such and while we have no assurance that at this time from the DOE or from any other branch of the U.S. government that we will be awarded a guarantee, we are and we remain confident in our position. The issue that exists is one of appropriations and timing. While the Obama administration is seeking to expand the Nuclear Loan Guarantee Program in the next budget cycle, the next budget cycle is months away and right now, they have two projects, our project and Constellation's Calvert Cliffs project, which are at the same place in the process and each asking for about $7 billion in loan guarantees when there is a little more than $10 billion of currently appropriated and available. 
Moreover, while not NRG and we don't believe Constellation based on statements they have made, are in a position to carry their project through to the next budget cycle at a cash burn rate that will keep their project or our project on track. We believe there is very strong bipartisan support across a broad swath of the executive and legislative branches to make it possible for the U.S. government to support both projects without disruption. We believe our public policymakers in Washington recognize and appreciate that much has been invested by Constellation and NRG in these massive greenhouse gas reducing infrastructure projects, and that these projects represent a large number of present and future American jobs.
As the vanguard of the nuclear renaissance, the success of these projects is essential to the build out of the domestic nuclear supply chain that will be needed for the United States to be cost competitive in the burgeoning global market for nuclear power plants. But as we all know, it can be a very long way in Washington from good intention to positive outcome. So we at NRG are prepared both for a positive result and a negative result. Our plan for both outcomes is outlined in broad-brushed terms on Slide 25. If we get a full loan guarantee, we move forward to the next steps in a cash-prudent manner. If we do not, we essentially suspend work on the project and reduce the external cash burn to near zero, while we seek to mitigate our exposure to the project to date.
Notwithstanding our contingency plan for what we do if we don't win, you should walk away from this conference call knowing that, we, the management of NRG, are very confident that we will secure a Federal loan guarantee. It is equally important for you to understand that such a win would indeed be a big win for NRG shareholders and would not be a de facto loss as some of you maybe previous to today's announcement might have thought. If we win, we will pursue the project vigorously on all critical path items. But we nonetheless will significantly reduce our planned burn rate on project engineering, recognizing that we don't need to be as far along as the time our CLO [collateralized loan obligation] is expected to be granted as we had previously planned. 
Moreover, as depicted on Slide 26, in part due to the buy-in and participation of TEPCO, and as a result of various additional sources of project funding, we expect to fund STP through the critical stages of 2010 with a call on NRG's cash resources, which is while still significant, very manageable relative to the size of the project opportunity. If we get past the loan guarantee, there are two more critical steps in 2010, as outlined on Slide 27.
First, as we outlined at our Analyst Day last November, we need to confirm that Toshiba and Flor [ph] can and will build the project for $10 billion or less. Very detailed work is being done on this issue as we speak and it's progressing satisfactorily. Then armed with a reliable EPC number, we then need to confirm off-take with the off-take partners with whom we currently have Memorandum of Understanding for a significant portion of the new plants output. In this respect, I know there is concern in the market that those off-take agreements will not be available at a viable price level, as a result of the decline in natural gas prices over the past couple of years. While of course, I cannot provide you assurance until binding agreements have been signed, our analysis indicates that if you take into account, first the fact that the natural gas forward curve is in contango. Second, the $18 per megawatt hour production tax credit under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Third, the benefit of fuel diversification to load serving entities in Texas, many of whom are almost entirely dependent on gas-fired generation at this time. And fourth, if you ascribe a modest amount of value to the future value of the full carbon hedge provided by nuclear, we believe we have a very good chance of success at arranging sufficient off-take for this project and ensure project viability at an equity return that makes it worthwhile from the perspective of NRG. And I should say, that's at a risk adjusted return of equity that is appropriate for a nuclear power plant.
Which brings me to the last point, which I wanted to address directly, before opening the lines for questions. And I wanted to address the issue of shareholder value in the context of our nuclear development project. All of us on this call, whether you're a regular shareholder of NRG or an employee shareholder of NRG as all of us from the company are, we can agree on one thing and that's it we're unhappy with the company's share price performance over the past several months. This is particularly frustrating for many of us in the company because as depicted on Slide 29, we feel that our stock has been under pressure over the past months despite several obvious wins, which we have achieved.
It has become increasingly clear to us that we cannot hope to create upward momentum in our share price simply by posting more and more achievements in the win column. We need to address directly the factors which overhang our stock, namely bearish stock price settlement and concern about the cost risk and prospects of our nuclear development. With respect to gas prices, there obviously is nothing we can do about the trajectory of gas prices themselves but we can diversify our expected cash flow streams away from near total dependence directly or indirectly on natural gas prices as existed as was the case for NRG before we bought Reliant. A key differentiation point between us and our current peer group of merchant generators now and increasingly in the future, is that we see the path to maximum shareholder value creation as something different from just lining up as many power plants as you can get your hands on. So that you can sell as many megawatt hours that you can at natural gas derived prices.
We see the future in terms of a dual strategy, which we depicted on Slide 30. That is using our core wholesale generation plus retail strength, as a platform to spring board into a range of non-natural gas correlated revenue and free cash flow streams, such as renewable energy credits, carbon credits, payments for capacity, firming and other auxiliary services and green energy service business, whether associated with smart meters, electric vehicle infrastructure or both. And in most if not all these areas, our unique position in wholesale and retail and in Texas, gives us a substantial competitive advantage. We began the process last November by showing Slide 31 at our Analyst Day, of laying out for you our objective that by the latter part of this decade, we will roughly double the company's recurring free cash flow to our first mover push into the areas I just mentioned. That push is led from a free cash flow perspective by what we hope and expect to achieve in low carbon base load power, principally nuclear and in renewables, principally solar. You can expect that as we go forward on the quarterly calls and Analyst Days to come, that we will fill out this picture and demonstrate to you how we are going about achieving this financial objective. Doubling our recurring free cash flow in a few years may strike you as ambitious. But of course, that is what we achieved from 2006, our first year with Texas Genco through 2009. 
So finally, in conclusion, on Slide 22 (sic)[32], new advanced nuclear power plays a fundamental part in our plan, as I believe it does in the future energy mix of our increasingly low carbon society. Nothing has more confirmed that to me than the Obama Administration's announcement earlier this year that it was seeking $54 billion of nuclear loan guarantee authority, being that support for new nuclear in Washington is now fully bipartisan. $54 billion of loan guarantees mean $70-plus billion of new nuclear projects, enough to fund eight to 10 new plants. I believe that the United States starts to build 10 new nuclear plants, then inevitably, our country will build 100 as we need to do. That means new nuclear power will be a $500-billion to $700-billion market, and we at NRG have the opportunity through the STP 3 & 4 projects to be the first mover in an industry, which certainly will follow the lead of the successful first movers.
That is why we have taken on this challenge in order to access this once-in-a-business-lifetime opportunity. We will pursue this opportunity aggressively but I hope you are convinced after today's presentation, we will not pursue it irrationally or in a manner that is financially imprudent. And we will not proceed without a near-term Federal loan guarantee commitment. With that, Chanel, we'd be very pleased to take any questions."

I mean, I think if we do not get awarded the loan guarantee at this time, probably what we would do and this is first addressing your characterization as a cold stop, is that and we would have to see what the cost of this would be. But we would probably shut down everything except we might keep the license process going. Our initial estimate is just see the license through would cost less than $10 million a year. And given where we are and the fact that certainly, one thing we would be doing would be trying to mitigate the amount we've spent through sort of selling the intellectual property to other people who might want to be pursuing that type of project. We probably would try and carry through to get the license done, unless it was too expensive. Apart from that, if they came back a year from now, when the -- further money has been authorized and said, you can have your loan guarantee now and we basically wound down everything, we would have to look at them. We would have to look at the circumstances at the time. One thing is when you unwind an effort like this, as they say, it's hard to put Humpty Dumpty back together again. So I wouldn't be overly confident that we could come back and resurrect the project a year from now."

I think there are a lot of people in Washington, Certainly, people in our end and I would presume on Constellation, that are suggesting various ways that this dilemma could be solved. And additional appropriations outside the normal budget cycle is probably most prominent on that list, as the government does do appropriations outside of the budget cycle. And while the amount of money that we would be talking about, the shortfall of the $14 billion needed minus the $10 billion they have, $4 billion sounds like a very large number. My understanding of the appropriations that they would actually have to put through the process, would actually just be essentially the cost of the loan premium, which is a number that I've heard -- that less than $100 million. So that is definitely not insurmountable. But at this point, I'm not in a position to preclude any of the variety of ways that people inside and outside the government have suggested that, for the government to resolve this conundrum.

Today, I'm joined by Chris Schade, our Chief Financial Officer, who will begin part of the presentation; and John Ragan, who will be giving the Chief Operating Officer's part of the presentation, although as maybe you know, John Ragan has moved on to become the President of NRG Texas. His successor as Chief Operating Officer of the Company, Mauricio Gutierrez, is also here but he will be reprising his role as the Head of Commercial Operations and available to answer questions on topics relating to the market and the commodities. And finally, I'm also joined by Jason Few, who runs Reliant's business. 
Before I get started, I just want to mention of course that this shift in the management team has been caused in large part by the retirement of Kevin Howell. I know many of the long-term shareholders on the phone know Kevin well, and Kevin's had a great career at NRG first, fashioning our superb commercial operations team, then being acting as Chief Administrative Officer and most recently as President of NRG Texas. I want to thank Kevin for the phenomenal job he's done. I appreciate that a couple years ago, when he wanted to retire, he allowed me to persuade him to stay a couple extra years, and I just want to thank him personally for all that he's done for this Company.
Now turning to the presentation and on Page 3, referring to the slides that have been posted on our website. I wanted to start as I usually do by giving you my take on the Company's financial performance during the quarter. The Company quite simply performed spectacularly well during the quarter, and our superior performance, combined with favorable prevailing weather conditions, produce an exceptional financial performance for the Company. $693 million of adjusted EBITDA, the second strongest second quarter in our history and nearly $350 million of cash from operations.
The goal of operating the business for cash, as we always have done, obviously, is first to accumulate that cash and then allocate it in a timely and efficient manner on behalf of its owners and our chief shareholders. We've been successful on both counts during the quarter, increasing our cash balance by over $360 million and by allocating the cash effectively, including $50 million of expended to buyback NRG shares as the first stage of our 2010 capital allocation program. Our cash accounts were buoyed by, in addition to our cash generated from operations, by more than $100 million received under the cash ITC program from the federal government in connection with the Langford wind and the Blythe solar projects.
I'm very pleased with the steps we are taking towards building more flexibility into our capital structure, and Chris will talk more about that during his presentation. 
As we assess where we stand at this financial midpoint in 2010 today, the result achieved over the previous six months, together with the positions we have taken with respect to the six months to come, I'm very pleased to report to you that today we are increasing our guidance for the full year for both adjusted EBITDA and cash from operations by a very substantial amount. As you assess our new guidance, as I believe that you must, given the absolute magnitude and the sizable margin by which our performance in 2010 to date has exceeded the expectations of the financial community, I ask you to be mindful of three things. First, consider that 14 months after we purchased Reliant, perhaps it is time to recognize the superiority of our wholesale/retail model. Unique among our peers and as such, acknowledge that we merit a multiple premium rather than a multiple discount in comparison to peer generators.
Second, consider the resilience of our business model based as it is on the twin pillars of prudent balance sheet management and forward hedging through the commodity down cycles. Here we are reporting on the eighth full fiscal quarter since natural gas prices began to drop. And even though commodity prices continue to scrape along at the bottom of the trough, NRG is continuing to report nearly record results. Of course, it isn't our hedging alone that is achieving such a fantastic result. It's the strong contribution of Reliant. And that is where the prudent balance sheet management component of the strategy looms large. If we had not been in a strong financial position when the financial tsunami occurred, we could not have acquired Reliant in the manner that we did.
Third and finally, consider that nine months ago when we first announced guidance for 2010 of $2.2 billion, coming off a record shattering $2.6 billion EBITDA year in 2009, I told you that we were not satisfied with making $2.2 billion in 2010. I vowed to you on behalf of all the management and employees of NRG that we would work our hardest to do better. Today, with guidance revised significantly upward to $2.45 billion to $2.55 billion, we are fulfilling a good part, but not yet all of that vow. We will continue to work our hardest to improve our 2010 result. We know that this is what you expect from the NRG team, which you have invested your capital with. 
Well let's look beyond the numbers. As you know one of the most significant characteristics that differentiates NRG is that all the while that we are delivering best in class financial results, we also are working tirelessly to position the Company as both the optimal conventional competitive power company and as the first mover in America's clean energy economy future. As Slide 4 indicates, we have five top priorities in respect of each of these two strategic tracks and the progress we have achieved against all these priorities over the past couple quarters has been highly satisfactory. I'm happy to speak with you at length about any and all of these priorities but given time constraints, I'm going to focus most of my comments on the two most topical.
On the conventional side, our wholesale/retail model and on the new energy economy side, our push towards being first mover in low carbon baseload generation, particularly new nuclear power. Success within our business model depends on our success in maintaining our Reliant retail franchise through all commodity price cycles. The particular challenge in this commodity price cycle is preserving, growing and extending the franchise through this potentially prolonged commodity price trough in an environment where retail margins are healthy and barriers to entry appear low. As shown on Slide 5, our approach is fourfold. First, targeted pricing and marketing to a highly segmented mass market. Second, a resurgent and coordinated sales effort across all customer classes, especially the C&I segment, an area of Reliant’s business which was being affirmatively and intentionally discontinued under previous ownership and which is in the process of being rebuilt under our ownership. Third, various initiatives to leverage off the customer service capabilities of Reliant in order to increase revenue opportunities. And fourth, brand extension to a range of products and services built around smart metering technology being deployed in homes and commercial establishments around Texas.
Our fifth objective for Reliant, which is both an objective in its own right but also is the quality that underpins the Reliant brand, and as such our ability to achieve the other four objectives, is our relentless focus at Reliant on customer care and customer satisfaction. Reliant’s intensely committed to provide differentiated service across the entire customer lifecycle, and that commitment has paid off. 
As illustrated on Slide 6, Reliant has the lowest customer complaint percentages of all the Texas retail electricity providers. This has caused the Reliant brand not only to enjoy the highest brand recognition in the key areas of ERCOT but also the highest brand preference, as demonstrated on the bar charts on the bottom right. Everything we do and everything Reliant is doing is designed to preserve and enhance that brand and create increased distinction between Reliant and its competition. We are very confident that the things Reliant itself is doing, in its communities, with its smart leader program and with its customer service and that we at NRG are doing alongside Reliant Texas, such as the windmills, the nuclear plant and the electric vehicle infrastructure, will further preserve and enhance Reliant’s brand and NRG’s retail advantage in Texas more generally.
What does all this means to NRG shareholders? We reproduced Slide 7 to remind you that in our humble opinion, Reliant is being severely undervalued within NRG, given the reciprocal advantages that matching wholesale and retail provide to each other. The advantages are bulleted on this page. These advantages exist not only in theory but we have amply demonstrated to the market over the past 14 months that they exist in practice as well. 
We have steadily and substantially reduced the capital required to collateralize the Retail business through a continuous increase in the number of crossing trades we have done, and we have partially de-risked the business through a sequence of constructive hurricane risk mitigation products.
But bottom line, it comes down to the earnings power of Reliant’s retail business, sustained through the extended trough of this commodity price cycle. It was just over a year ago that you were being asked to believe that Reliant was worth no more than $1 a share to NRG. And now after just 14 months, Reliant already has generated over $1 billion in EBITDA for the Company, meaning that Reliant already has generated $4 for each NRG share outstanding. It's a very good start. It provides the proof of consistent performance which the market has sought. And as such, it's a good point for ascribing a fairer value.
Moving now to low carbon baseload. Before we get to a discussion of our STP 3 & 4 project, let me say that more than any other area of our business, renewables, demand-side management, fast start gas, low carbon baseload is, in my opinion, where it’s going to be at over the next 20 years. This is where the winners among 21st century power companies are going to be crowned. And with NRG positioned to seize first mover status, not only with new advanced nuclear, but also with clean coal projects, pivoting off the 60-megawatt carbon capturer and enhanced oil recovery demonstration project, we are developing with the assistance of the DOE at Parish, we are as well positioned as a company could be in this critical and valuable area. 
Now with that said, turning to the continuing saga of our STP 3 & 4 nuclear project on Page 8, I have attempted to cut through the noise and the complexity of recent developments to put on one page everything important that you need to know about where we are and where we are going with this project.
Starting with Washington, where activities continue as we speak, both within the executive branch and on Capitol Hill to find a way to fund either the two or the three projects which remain in contention for nuclear loan guarantees. I am here to tell you that I have absolutely no idea what funding method will succeed or how it will be achieved but I can tell you this, based on what I personally have witnessed in terms of the commitment of high officers of the Obama administration, the highly professional and constructive approach of the DOE staff and their advisers to our project and the nearly unanimous pledges of support from senators and representatives of both parties to the concept of additional funding for nuclear loan guarantees, I am more confident than I have ever been that our project ultimately will be awarded a nuclear loan guarantee from the United States government. The question I cannot answer and the question that informs the basis for the spending decisions that I am announcing here to date, is the question of when. I do not know when. 
This uncertainty about when is what makes it impossible for me to continue spending NRG shareholders' money at the rate which we have been spending through the months since CPS withdrew from the project. Accordingly, having reduced our ongoing spend on the project last month from approximately $30 million a month to $7.5 million a month, a 70% reduction, henceforth, from August 1 onward, NRG is capping its spend on STP 3 & 4 at $1.5 million a month, a 95% reduction from the burn rate just two months ago.
The good news is that after extensive work and discussions with our partner, Toshiba Corp. and with the other key parties involved in the project development, we have developed a plan, depicted in very general terms on Slide 9 to keep the project fully on schedule through at least the balance of 2010. We have achieved this in significant part by reducing the project work streams only to those critical path matters, which are absolutely essential to maintaining project schedule. We have achieved this in even greater part by Toshiba having agreed to carry the project more fully on its shoulders in the months to come in the same way that NRG has done for the several months since CPS withdrew from the project. 
For our part, while our work in Washington continues with the DOE and the legislative branch, we and our Japanese partners have opened formal discussions with the Japanese government financial institutions regarding Japanese co-financing for this important project. We are confident that the Japanese government and its lending institutions appreciate the importance of this project as much as do Toshiba and NRG. We also intend to focus extensively over the next several months on finalizing EPC arrangements with a structure and at a price that the project can bear. And finally, in order to keep the project on track, we must over the next several months take our discussions on OFTEC arrangements with key counterparts to the next level of commitment. We recognize that this critical path work stream is as important as the federal loan guarantee work stream and that they are interdependent.
In summary, with respect to nuclear, as we undertook to do several months ago, we have dramatically scaled back our financial commitment to the STP project development, but we have managed to do so in a manner that keeps the project fully on schedule with critical work processes at the DOE, the NRC in Japan and at the site all sufficiently manned. We will determine over these next months of low NRG spend whether all the key elements, the federal loan guarantee, the Japanese government co-financing, an appropriate EPC arrangement and sufficient offtake arrangements can be brought together in a manner that enables the STP project, a project which is so critically important, not only to NRG but also to the economy of the state of Texas and the zero emission energy objectives of the United States of America, to go forward.
Finally, on Slide 10, let me conclude before handing over to John by bringing back Slide 4 in a scorecard format so that we can grade our implementation to date against the dual strategy that we previously have articulated. On the conventional side, or as I prefer to call it, the classic NRG side, we are delivering superlative results, providing positive proof that the wholesale/retail combination works better than the pure generator or the pure retail model. 
Slowly but surely, we are revitalizing our gas fleet with Brownfield repowerings, our plant expansions completed at Long Beach, Cos Cob, Cedar Bayou and Devon, construction underway at Middletown and with a line of sight for El Segundo. With respect to the fifth priority on the classic side, we have not appreciably expanded our conventional portfolio through acquisition, but we believe the current environment is an attractive market for asset buyers and that market dynamic is going to persist for at least a while longer.
In terms of the right side, the transformative side, where the nature of the objectives are inherently longer term, we are very pleased with our progress in terms of low carbon baseload, not only with STP which we have previously discussed, but which also with our carbon capture and enhanced oil recovery project at Parish. Our multiple solar initiatives are proceeding exceedingly well, and you will hear much more about them in the months to come. And the projects that we are building at our various gas sites, particularly El Segundo, are going to be cutting edge in combining fast-start characteristics to firm renewables while providing modern CCGT efficiency and steady state operations. In short, I can assure you as shareholders of NRG, that while there is a lot that I’m very proud of as the CEO of your Company, neither I nor the rest of the team at NRG will take our eye off the ball in terms of delivering another exceptional financial result in 2010, perfecting our classic competitive generation retail model and positioning the Company to be a leader in the transformation to a new energy economy.
Turning to John Ragan."

Good morning, everyone. During the second quarter of 2010, NRG continued to sustain the strong operating and commercial performance it achieved during the first quarter, solidly positioning the Company to enter the critical summer months. 
On Slide 12, we've highlighted some of our second quarter accomplishments. Our focus on safety across the entire organization, including Reliant, has remained strong with an OSHA recordable rate of 0.7 through the first half of the year, which continues to exceed the top decile benchmark for the industry.
During the second quarter, our Encina plant was awarded OSHA's VPP Star designation. OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program, or VPP, is a voluntary program that allows a facility to attain one of the highest levels of safety recognition available within the power industry. To achieve this designation, a plant must demonstrate to OSHA that both management and the employees have achieved an exemplary health and safety record in addition to creating a steadfast safety culture that is embraced by the entire organization. This is the first NRG facility to achieve this award outside of our Texas fleet, and is a testament to our employees’ desire across the organization to strive for continuous improvement in safety.
Our baseload fleet had another very good quarter of operational success with our plant personnel delivering strong performance. During the quarter, we continued to face challenging market conditions caused by cycling and additional starts for our coal assets. This was followed by periods of extreme heat in June. Through these widely fluctuating conditions and multiple plant maintenance outages, our coal fleet reliability was better than the second quarter of last year. Most notably, I want to point out the superior quality quarterly performance of the Indian River and Limestone stations, both with E4 below 2% and the Huntley station with an E4 below 1%.
Our EPC group has continued to move forward with multiple construction projects. We have completed the Devon peaking plant in Connecticut and these fast-start units have been transitioned into our operating portfolio. Middletown is currently under construction and is expected to come online about this time next year. 
During the quarter, we have also acquired and integrated the South Trent wind farm into our wind portfolio. And lastly, we were successful in being awarded a $167 million DOE grant to design and construct a 60-megawatt carbon capture and enhanced oil recovery system at our Parish plant in Texas.
Finally, our commercial operations group has continued to effectively manage the hedging and dispatch of our wholesale generation portfolio in addition to executing the integration and risk management requirements for the Reliant energy retail supply. This quarter was also marked by wins in additional load following contracts and portfolio hedges, which I will review later.
Now turning to our plant operation performance on Slide 13. We have continued to operate our fleet safely and efficiently during the second quarter. While net generation and baseload availability were slightly off for the first half of this year as compared to 2009, this was primarily the result of three specific events within the fleet. These include a refueling outage at STP unit 2 as compared to no outages at STP during the same time period during 2009, the movement of an outage from 2011 to the second quarter of 2010 for Limestone unit 1 and a generator rotor outage at Dunkirk’s unit 4 in January that was discussed during the first quarter earnings call. 
Our units did experience some limited fuel switching, primarily during the shoulder months of March and April, that impacted net generation. However, this was partially offset by strong load from weather-related events during the second quarter.
From a unit reliability perspective, our baseload E4 for the second quarter was 2.05%, which is an exceptionally strong showing from our operations team. When taking the events into account that I previously mentioned, our overall plant reliability and availability during the first half of the year was solid and within our expectations for strong operating performance. We also recognized that in the low-margin price environment that we currently operate in, it doesn't always make economic sense to spend that last marginal maintenance dollar in order to achieve the highest possible availability statistic. 
At NRG, we are always making those analytical decisions based on real-time information. We can promise you that we are scrutinizing our spend relentlessly across the fleet and putting our maintenance dollars to the best possible use where we can capture the value of the last marginal megawatt hour while making the best cost-benefit decisions to manage our overall plant assets. Finally, on the chart to the bottom left, at the end of the second quarter, we have achieved 50% of our full year FORNRG targets. This achievement was accomplished through contributions from our retail, tax and other corporate departments, continued plan efficiency improvements within our generation fleet and the sale of Padoma.
We are on track to complete this year's goals and have the potential of getting a head start on the 2011 targets.
Turning to our retail operations on Slide 14. Warmer-than-normal weather across Texas with cooling degree days above the 10- and 30-year benchmark coupled with lower gas prices created an opportunity to deliver higher volumes and stronger margins from our Mass Market segment. The dramatic decline in the commodities last year allowed us to deliver margin significantly above our targeted run rate while the market became much more competitive. The steady state of commodities this year, we have taken disciplined, targeted marketing pricing and actions to begin to stabilize our customer count while maintaining strong margins, thereby driving towards higher customer retention levels.
At the same time, we have strengthened our sales channels and maintained our leadership in customer satisfaction and brand preference. The result for the quarter reflects an optimized balance between customer count and margin which is consistent with our long-term mass-market strategy for the Reliant brand and the specific customer segment we desire to serve. 
In the C&I segment, we improved renewal rates of existing customers during the second quarter and extended the term and diversity of our portfolio while experiencing profitable margins within the segment. Reliant remains the largest C&I retail provider, the second-largest residential provider and the largest retailer overall based on volume in Texas.
Before I conclude the operations section, I want to provide some thoughts on EPA's recently proposed Clean Air Transport Rule or CATR, which was developed in response to the court’s rejection of CAIR. The primary objectives of the newer rule as compared to CAIR are outlined on Slide 15. The rule initiates new NOx and SO2 trading programs in 2012 with a second phase in 2014 which further lowers SO2 emission caps in certain states. The main difference between CAIR and CATR are: one, the inability to use acid rain allowances to meet CATR requirements after the program’s implementation; and two, the restriction on trading of allowances between Group 1 and Group 2 states for SO2 compliance.
According to the EPA, the cap in allocations for 2012 are based on modeling current power plant operations with existing and planned controls across the industry. The key takeaway is that NRG can meet the 2012 NOx and SO2 caps without any new environmental construction requirements. 
As we elaborate on Slide 16, NRG’s fleet is well positioned vis-à-vis the proposed CATR rule. Specifically, our existing plans for additional environmental capital projects remains unchanged. CATR does not include Texas in the SO2 program. Therefore, our Parish and Limestone units will not need to hold SO2 allowances. Having separate Group 1 and Group 2 SO2 trading allowance restrictions does not impact NRG's ability to comply with the program. Our assets in New York and Pennsylvania, which are Group 1 states, already have SO2 controls and will not face additional incremental CapEx requirements to meet the 2014 cap. And lastly, as older uncontrolled plants are at risk of retirement, NRG hopes to benefit from changes to higher heat rates and power prices.
In summary, the proposed CATR rule is anticipated to have very little impact on NRG’s plant operations’ concurrently forecasted capital spend. Additionally, while EPA has acted in a very proactive way to address both NOx and SO2, they have done so by working constructively with the industry to achieve the desired air emission goals. As we have been saying since our investor conference last fall, we believe the EPA will take a pragmatic and moderate approach to current and future air standards. Therefore, based on their actions to date, we believe that any future EPA regulations will be similarly pragmatic to allow the industry sufficient time and means to approach compliance.
Moving to our hedge profile and commodity sensitivities on Slide 17, as we have reviewed with you many times on prior calls, we continuously seek opportunities to lock in additional hedges, hedging power during the up cycles and coal during the down cycles. As illustrated in the chart on the top left, our wholesale and retail segments continue to be well hedged over the next few years. 
Baseload generation is fully hedged for the remainder of this year, and we have increased our hedge position for 2011 to approximately 86% from 73% last quarter. During the quarter, we have focused our hedging strategy for 2011 on using option structures similar to the strategy we implemented in 2006. This hedge structure helps to protect us from further downward gas price movements while retaining some upside for positive upward price movements.
Based on NRG's view that gas prices reached their floor during 2009, in a time when demand was significantly off and supply was plentiful, we believe that the last half of 2010 and 2011 will provide opportunities to continue to hedge our portfolio at higher gas prices than the current forward market.
Concerning our Retail business, our hedge positions have increased during the quarter as shown by the crosshatches. We will continue to increase our hedge percentages as we execute on aggregating fully priced retail loan. The chart at the top right illustrates our coal and transport positions. During the quarter, we were successful in executing a fairly priced and beneficial multiyear transportation contract for our western New York coal plants. Based on the current supply/demand factors for PRB coal, we don't expect any significant upward commodity pricing pressure in the foreseeable future.
And lastly, moving to the chart on the bottom, as is customary with our hedge profile, we have limited our sensitivity to gas going gold prices and heat rate movements for 2011. 
Turning to review market fundamentals on Slide 18, the quarter-on-quarter demand growth for ERCOT continues to show solid trends for recovery and positive growth on a year-over-year basis, particularly in comparison with PJM where weather-normalized load growth continues to be fairly stagnant. However, during the second quarter, warmer-than-normal weather drove significant load increases across all three Northeast operating systems, with peak load recovering close to 2008 demand levels and total load up 6% to 7% across the region as compared to Q2 2009.
In Texas, forward heat rates have continued to be well supported during the first half of the year due to increasing demand recovery, tighter supply, potential for future plant retirements and the continued lack of capital market access for non-PPA projects. So I would like to end by saying that we are very well positioned operationally and commercially to deliver on our revised set of financial objectives for 2010. Now I'll turn it over to Chris, who will discuss our financial results."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss the second quarter and year-to-date financial results achieved during my first quarter as CFO. Let's begin with a brief overview of our achievements during the second quart",1101,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss the second quarter and year-to-date financial results achieved during my first quarter as CFO. 
Let's begin with a brief overview of our achievements during the second quarter on Slide 20. As David previewed earlier, the Company delivered strong financial results in the second quarter, totaling $693 million of adjusted EBITDA. Reliant Energy contributed $195 million of adjusted EBITDA. With robust gross margins our Retail business benefited from favorable weather conditions in a favorable commodity environment.
Meanwhile, the Wholesale business contributed $498 million of adjusted EBITDA, only $19 million lower than Q2 2009 performance. The year-on-year difference was affected by a refueling outage at STP unit 2 and a major planned outage at unit 2 of our Big Cajun facility, which occurs every six to eight years. Baseload generation in the Northeast was comparatively flat but due to hotter-than-normal weather during the quarter, oil and gas generation increased 20%. Benefiting our wholesale performance was increased capacity pricing in New York City, as well as new projects that came online as a result of our retiring and renewable initiative, including Cedar Bayou 4, Blythe solar facility and our Langford wind farm.
Year-to-date, EBITDA for the first six months was a record $1.294 billion, representing a 6% increase over $1.22 billion generated in the first half of 2009. The addition of Reliant Energy added $385 million of EBITDA as favorable weather drove an 11% increase in customer usage partially offsetting a 2% decline in average customer count. Also, the improvement in customer payment patterns we mentioned in the first quarter continued into the second quarter. 
Meanwhile, the Wholesale business generated $909 million of adjusted EBITDA for the first half of this year, solid results despite a low commodity environment. The strong quarter and year-to-date financial results were directly influenced by our strategic forward hedging program and the continued focus on operational excellence. Our record results also reinforced the benefits of our strategy of owning both generation and retail in Texas.
Finally, on this slide, I want to touch briefly on our liquidity position as I will review it in more detail on the next slide. We entered the first half of 2010 with a total liquidity of $3.5 billion, an increase of $290 million from the end of the first quarter. Cash on hand of nearly $2.2 billion provides ample capacity to serve our capital structure objectives and current capital allocation strategies. 
Of particular note during the second quarter is we successfully completed the amended extend of our first lien facilities, an important step in improving the financial flexibility of the Company. The highlights of this transaction include: extending the maturities from 2013 to 2015 for $1.8 billion combined for our term loan facility and synthetic LC and refinancing our revolver to $875 million while extending its maturity to 2015. The results of this transaction provides NRG with improved LC and term funding capacity to support our future growth initiatives. Now for a more detailed discussion our capital allocation, please turn to Slide 21.
Again, the Company’s strong liquidity position as of June 30 which, excluding funds deposited by hedging counterparties, stood at $3.5 billion. While liquidity is up from the prior quarter, I would like to review the year-to-date change of $294 million as of June 30 from year-end 2009. 
This difference is largely explained by debt repayments of $459 million, which included a reduction of the term loan B debt of $240 million and the settlement of the common stock fund of $190 million. Capital expenditures, net of project funding, of $294 million consisting primarily of $70 million of normal maintenance CapEx, $88 million of environmental CapEx and $125 million for NINA. 
Acquisitions of $141 million, net of financing, related largely to the purchase of South Trent in Northwind Phoenix and share repurchases totaling 2.2 million shares at a volume weighted average price of $22.58 for $50 million.
We are in a very comfortable liquidity position, allowing us to complete the remainder of our $180 million share buyback program before year end, as well as continue to be opportunistic about intrinsic and extrinsic capital investments to enhance our Retail, Wholesale and Renewal businesses. We will continue to review our options to increase returning value to our shareholders, and will evaluate the possibility of increasing our share buyback later in the year.
With respect to the restrictive payment basket in certain of our bond indentures, we have decided for now not to offer bondholders a payment for relief of this covenant. We believe the costs required to ensure a successful amendment of the current RB restriction to be prohibitive, particularly when compared to upcoming coal prices embedded in the bond’s original issuance. 
Finally, to date, our successful hedging strategy has provided stability to our EBITDA our results and in the future, we will continue to hedge our baseload business when appropriate. With that said, as you can see from this slide, we have ample capacity to execute on hedges in the out years under our first lien structure, which preserves other sources of liquidity necessary to assist our future growth.
Now turning to our full year guidance slide on Slide 22. We have increased our full year EBITDA guidance in the range of $2.45 billion to $2.55 billion, an increase of $250 million to $350 million from earlier projections. Going forward, we will continue to provide full year EBITDA guidance as a range. We believe a range of EBITDA results better captures unanticipated volatility and certain factors that may impact our results, such as weather changes and fluctuations in the underlying commodity markets. 
Our goal would be to narrow our ranges as the year progresses and final results become more certain. Alongside this update in EBITDA guidance, we are also updating free cash flow guidance to a range of $816 million to $916 million, an increase of $354 million to $454 million. 
In addition to our strong operating results, the increase in free cash flow is a certain beneficiary of our decision to be dramatically reduced the spend on the STP nuclear project until there is clarity on the prospects for a receipt of a DOE loan guarantee.
In closing, as David pointed out earlier, we continue to drive this business to focus on cash and based on Friday's closing stock price of $22.68 in our updated outlook, the recurring free cash flow yield currently stands between 22% to 24% or $5.06 to $5.45 per share. With that, I’ll turn it back to David for closing comments and questions."

I think the way, Dan, that we've gone around planning South Texas and the new reality is around this fact that we just literally have no idea when the U.S. government will do the two things, the Department of Energy actually finished the loan guarantee process hopefully in a positive fashion and the money be appropriated. It's really the second part that's more uncertain. I mean, we are really at the final stages with the DOE with negotiations of the loan agreement complete. But as to when the money would be there for an award, I mean, to be frank, Dan, as I'm told, it could be today or worst case scenario, if it gets to be part of the 2011 budget appropriations and that takes the track that it’s taken in recent years, it could be as far away as next February or March. So that's really the timing horizon that we've looked at all of those critical decisions. And we expect to have all of those, the four things that I talked about, resolved within that time period. So the U.S. government financing, the Japanese government financing, the EPC and the offtake. In terms of further sell downs, Dan, I would say would that's the one thing that's really changed in this because our motivation to sell down early in the project was actually to reduce the amount that we were spending every month. Left to our own devices, if we weren't spending as much as we were spending, we would prefer to sell down later rather than earlier because the project gets more valuable as it gets towards closing. So since our spend rate has been cut by 95%, I think the one other significant change in terms of the things that you mentioned is that you probably shouldn't expect additional sell-downs, unless they're for highly strategic reasons, until we get these other four main critical path items resolved. Dan, that's the best short answer I can give. I mean did you want to follow-up on some aspects of that?"

One party only has the right to reduce or stop their spend in the project. The other party always has the right to unilaterally go forward. So when I talk about our decision-making in terms of actually shutting down a project, let's assume we have a joint decision of Toshiba and NRG to shut down the project. I think our overall sense is that while it will take a few months to wind down spending and money spent on demobilization and the like, there are not like enormous commitments that have not been disclosed before. I think the overall commitment of the Company would be in the $500 million range, but that $500 million includes the money that Toshiba's put to date. So that's more of an earnings number. You'd have to deduct the $150 million from Toshiba to get the cash exposure of NRG."

And in terms of the part of that, the very significant part of that, that NRG is not going to be funding, what we're showing on the right-hand side of Page 9 is the various alternatives that Toshiba has to bear that cost.

So think of our portfolio as the least cost provider of ancillaries and as these ancillaries increase in price, we've been able to position ourselves to mitigate some of the lower gas prices that you mentioned and that we have experienced in the business. I mean that is one of the drivers."

So this is just, I would consider, a perfection of hedging wholesale and retail after 14 months of ownership. With respect to the ancillary question, I think people try to get -- as you look into two years out, the market tends to pay off for insurance in the form of ancillaries. So we've been able to capitalize on that back in 2009 going into 2010.

I mean, I think one way to look at it simplistically is that really the STP development project has three work streams. The one that which I think when people started we would've talked the most about, which was the regulatory approval work stream at the NRC. We don't ever talk about that anymore because it's working perfectly. It's right on track. It's the other two work streams, one is how to get money for the project and then of course the commercial arrangements. And there's been a lot of focus on the getting money work stream because of the DOE loan guarantee process. But the third work stream is the offtake. The offtake is the uncertainty that has caused us to not push so hard on the offtake thus far is not really related to the money. It's more related to the fact that you have to have a solid EPC price in order to talk to offtakers about the power and what it's going to cost. And we're getting much closer to a conclusion there in terms of getting a final EPC price that we then can work into something more specific to take to the offtakers. And so we expect in the second half this year, maybe spilling into the first quarter, to be looking for binding commitments from the several people that we've been talking to about long-term offtake for the project."

I mean since it was done on kind of my schedule, I hope that by getting you to listen to us on a Monday morning, we brought you some good news earlier in the week than we otherwise  would've.
Today, I'm joined by Chris Schade, our Chief Financial Officer, who will begin part of the presentation; and John Ragan, who will be giving the Chief Operating Officer's part of the presentation, although as maybe you know, John Ragan has moved on to become the President of NRG Texas. His successor as Chief Operating Officer of the Company, Mauricio Gutierrez, is also here but he will be reprising his role as the Head of Commercial Operations and available to answer questions on topics relating to the market and the commodities. And finally, I'm also joined by Jason Few, who runs Reliant's business. 
Before I get started, I just want to mention of course that this shift in the management team has been caused in large part by the retirement of Kevin Howell. I know many of the long-term shareholders on the phone know Kevin well, and Kevin's had a great career at NRG first, fashioning our superb commercial operations team, then being acting as Chief Administrative Officer and most recently as President of NRG Texas. I want to thank Kevin for the phenomenal job he's done. I appreciate that a couple years ago, when he wanted to retire, he allowed me to persuade him to stay a couple extra years, and I just want to thank him personally for all that he's done for this Company.
Now turning to the presentation and on Page 3, referring to the slides that have been posted on our website. I wanted to start as I usually do by giving you my take on the Company's financial performance during the quarter. The Company quite simply performed spectacularly well during the quarter, and our superior performance, combined with favorable prevailing weather conditions, produce an exceptional financial performance for the Company. $693 million of adjusted EBITDA, the second strongest second quarter in our history and nearly $350 million of cash from operations.
The goal of operating the business for cash, as we always have done, obviously, is first to accumulate that cash and then allocate it in a timely and efficient manner on behalf of its owners and our chief shareholders. We've been successful on both counts during the quarter, increasing our cash balance by over $360 million and by allocating the cash effectively, including $50 million of expended to buyback NRG shares as the first stage of our 2010 capital allocation program. Our cash accounts were buoyed by, in addition to our cash generated from operations, by more than $100 million received under the cash ITC program from the federal government in connection with the Langford wind and the Blythe solar projects.
I'm very pleased with the steps we are taking towards building more flexibility into our capital structure, and Chris will talk more about that during his presentation. 
As we assess where we stand at this financial midpoint in 2010 today, the result achieved over the previous six months, together with the positions we have taken with respect to the six months to come, I'm very pleased to report to you that today we are increasing our guidance for the full year for both adjusted EBITDA and cash from operations by a very substantial amount. As you assess our new guidance, as I believe that you must, given the absolute magnitude and the sizable margin by which our performance in 2010 to date has exceeded the expectations of the financial community, I ask you to be mindful of three things. First, consider that 14 months after we purchased Reliant, perhaps it is time to recognize the superiority of our wholesale/retail model. Unique among our peers and as such, acknowledge that we merit a multiple premium rather than a multiple discount in comparison to peer generators.
Second, consider the resilience of our business model based as it is on the twin pillars of prudent balance sheet management and forward hedging through the commodity down cycles. Here we are reporting on the eighth full fiscal quarter since natural gas prices began to drop. And even though commodity prices continue to scrape along at the bottom of the trough, NRG is continuing to report nearly record results. Of course, it isn't our hedging alone that is achieving such a fantastic result. It's the strong contribution of Reliant. And that is where the prudent balance sheet management component of the strategy looms large. If we had not been in a strong financial position when the financial tsunami occurred, we could not have acquired Reliant in the manner that we did.
Third and finally, consider that nine months ago when we first announced guidance for 2010 of $2.2 billion, coming off a record shattering $2.6 billion EBITDA year in 2009, I told you that we were not satisfied with making $2.2 billion in 2010. I vowed to you on behalf of all the management and employees of NRG that we would work our hardest to do better. Today, with guidance revised significantly upward to $2.45 billion to $2.55 billion, we are fulfilling a good part, but not yet all of that vow. We will continue to work our hardest to improve our 2010 result. We know that this is what you expect from the NRG team, which you have invested your capital with. 
Well let's look beyond the numbers. As you know one of the most significant characteristics that differentiates NRG is that all the while that we are delivering best in class financial results, we also are working tirelessly to position the Company as both the optimal conventional competitive power company and as the first mover in America's clean energy economy future. As Slide 4 indicates, we have five top priorities in respect of each of these two strategic tracks and the progress we have achieved against all these priorities over the past couple quarters has been highly satisfactory. I'm happy to speak with you at length about any and all of these priorities but given time constraints, I'm going to focus most of my comments on the two most topical.
On the conventional side, our wholesale/retail model and on the new energy economy side, our push towards being first mover in low carbon baseload generation, particularly new nuclear power. Success within our business model depends on our success in maintaining our Reliant retail franchise through all commodity price cycles. The particular challenge in this commodity price cycle is preserving, growing and extending the franchise through this potentially prolonged commodity price trough in an environment where retail margins are healthy and barriers to entry appear low. As shown on Slide 5, our approach is fourfold. First, targeted pricing and marketing to a highly segmented mass market. Second, a resurgent and coordinated sales effort across all customer classes, especially the C&I segment, an area of Reliant’s business which was being affirmatively and intentionally discontinued under previous ownership and which is in the process of being rebuilt under our ownership. Third, various initiatives to leverage off the customer service capabilities of Reliant in order to increase revenue opportunities. And fourth, brand extension to a range of products and services built around smart metering technology being deployed in homes and commercial establishments around Texas.
Our fifth objective for Reliant, which is both an objective in its own right but also is the quality that underpins the Reliant brand, and as such our ability to achieve the other four objectives, is our relentless focus at Reliant on customer care and customer satisfaction. Reliant’s intensely committed to provide differentiated service across the entire customer lifecycle, and that commitment has paid off. 
As illustrated on Slide 6, Reliant has the lowest customer complaint percentages of all the Texas retail electricity providers. This has caused the Reliant brand not only to enjoy the highest brand recognition in the key areas of ERCOT but also the highest brand preference, as demonstrated on the bar charts on the bottom right. Everything we do and everything Reliant is doing is designed to preserve and enhance that brand and create increased distinction between Reliant and its competition. We are very confident that the things Reliant itself is doing, in its communities, with its smart leader program and with its customer service and that we at NRG are doing alongside Reliant Texas, such as the windmills, the nuclear plant and the electric vehicle infrastructure, will further preserve and enhance Reliant’s brand and NRG’s retail advantage in Texas more generally.
What does all this means to NRG shareholders? We reproduced Slide 7 to remind you that in our humble opinion, Reliant is being severely undervalued within NRG, given the reciprocal advantages that matching wholesale and retail provide to each other. The advantages are bulleted on this page. These advantages exist not only in theory but we have amply demonstrated to the market over the past 14 months that they exist in practice as well. 
We have steadily and substantially reduced the capital required to collateralize the Retail business through a continuous increase in the number of crossing trades we have done, and we have partially de-risked the business through a sequence of constructive hurricane risk mitigation products.
But bottom line, it comes down to the earnings power of Reliant’s retail business, sustained through the extended trough of this commodity price cycle. It was just over a year ago that you were being asked to believe that Reliant was worth no more than $1 a share to NRG. And now after just 14 months, Reliant already has generated over $1 billion in EBITDA for the Company, meaning that Reliant already has generated $4 for each NRG share outstanding. It's a very good start. It provides the proof of consistent performance which the market has sought. And as such, it's a good point for ascribing a fairer value.
Moving now to low carbon baseload. Before we get to a discussion of our STP 3 & 4 project, let me say that more than any other area of our business, renewables, demand-side management, fast start gas, low carbon baseload is, in my opinion, where it’s going to be at over the next 20 years. This is where the winners among 21st century power companies are going to be crowned. And with NRG positioned to seize first mover status, not only with new advanced nuclear, but also with clean coal projects, pivoting off the 60-megawatt carbon capturer and enhanced oil recovery demonstration project, we are developing with the assistance of the DOE at Parish, we are as well positioned as a company could be in this critical and valuable area. 
Now with that said, turning to the continuing saga of our STP 3 & 4 nuclear project on Page 8, I have attempted to cut through the noise and the complexity of recent developments to put on one page everything important that you need to know about where we are and where we are going with this project.
Starting with Washington, where activities continue as we speak, both within the executive branch and on Capitol Hill to find a way to fund either the two or the three projects which remain in contention for nuclear loan guarantees. I am here to tell you that I have absolutely no idea what funding method will succeed or how it will be achieved but I can tell you this, based on what I personally have witnessed in terms of the commitment of high officers of the Obama administration, the highly professional and constructive approach of the DOE staff and their advisers to our project and the nearly unanimous pledges of support from senators and representatives of both parties to the concept of additional funding for nuclear loan guarantees, I am more confident than I have ever been that our project ultimately will be awarded a nuclear loan guarantee from the United States government. The question I cannot answer and the question that informs the basis for the spending decisions that I am announcing here to date, is the question of when. I do not know when. 
This uncertainty about when is what makes it impossible for me to continue spending NRG shareholders' money at the rate which we have been spending through the months since CPS withdrew from the project. Accordingly, having reduced our ongoing spend on the project last month from approximately $30 million a month to $7.5 million a month, a 70% reduction, henceforth, from August 1 onward, NRG is capping its spend on STP 3 & 4 at $1.5 million a month, a 95% reduction from the burn rate just two months ago.
The good news is that after extensive work and discussions with our partner, Toshiba Corp. and with the other key parties involved in the project development, we have developed a plan, depicted in very general terms on Slide 9 to keep the project fully on schedule through at least the balance of 2010. We have achieved this in significant part by reducing the project work streams only to those critical path matters, which are absolutely essential to maintaining project schedule. We have achieved this in even greater part by Toshiba having agreed to carry the project more fully on its shoulders in the months to come in the same way that NRG has done for the several months since CPS withdrew from the project. 
For our part, while our work in Washington continues with the DOE and the legislative branch, we and our Japanese partners have opened formal discussions with the Japanese government financial institutions regarding Japanese co-financing for this important project. We are confident that the Japanese government and its lending institutions appreciate the importance of this project as much as do Toshiba and NRG. We also intend to focus extensively over the next several months on finalizing EPC arrangements with a structure and at a price that the project can bear. And finally, in order to keep the project on track, we must over the next several months take our discussions on OFTEC arrangements with key counterparts to the next level of commitment. We recognize that this critical path work stream is as important as the federal loan guarantee work stream and that they are interdependent.
In summary, with respect to nuclear, as we undertook to do several months ago, we have dramatically scaled back our financial commitment to the STP project development, but we have managed to do so in a manner that keeps the project fully on schedule with critical work processes at the DOE, the NRC in Japan and at the site all sufficiently manned. We will determine over these next months of low NRG spend whether all the key elements, the federal loan guarantee, the Japanese government co-financing, an appropriate EPC arrangement and sufficient offtake arrangements can be brought together in a manner that enables the STP project, a project which is so critically important, not only to NRG but also to the economy of the state of Texas and the zero emission energy objectives of the United States of America, to go forward.
Finally, on Slide 10, let me conclude before handing over to John by bringing back Slide 4 in a scorecard format so that we can grade our implementation to date against the dual strategy that we previously have articulated. On the conventional side, or as I prefer to call it, the classic NRG side, we are delivering superlative results, providing positive proof that the wholesale/retail combination works better than the pure generator or the pure retail model. 
Slowly but surely, we are revitalizing our gas fleet with Brownfield repowerings, our plant expansions completed at Long Beach, Cos Cob, Cedar Bayou and Devon, construction underway at Middletown and with a line of sight for El Segundo. With respect to the fifth priority on the classic side, we have not appreciably expanded our conventional portfolio through acquisition, but we believe the current environment is an attractive market for asset buyers and that market dynamic is going to persist for at least a while longer.
In terms of the right side, the transformative side, where the nature of the objectives are inherently longer term, we are very pleased with our progress in terms of low carbon baseload, not only with STP which we have previously discussed, but which also with our carbon capture and enhanced oil recovery project at Parish. Our multiple solar initiatives are proceeding exceedingly well, and you will hear much more about them in the months to come. And the projects that we are building at our various gas sites, particularly El Segundo, are going to be cutting edge in combining fast-start characteristics to firm renewables while providing modern CCGT efficiency and steady state operations. In short, I can assure you as shareholders of NRG, that while there is a lot that I’m very proud of as the CEO of your Company, neither I nor the rest of the team at NRG will take our eye off the ball in terms of delivering another exceptional financial result in 2010, perfecting our classic competitive generation retail model and positioning the Company to be a leader in the transformation to a new energy economy.
Turning to John Ragan.

During the second quarter of 2010, NRG continued to sustain the strong operating and commercial performance it achieved during the first quarter, solidly positioning the Company to enter the critical summer months",1923,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. During the second quarter of 2010, NRG continued to sustain the strong operating and commercial performance it achieved during the first quarter, solidly positioning the Company to enter the critical summer months. 
On Slide 12, we've highlighted some of our second quarter accomplishments. Our focus on safety across the entire organization, including Reliant, has remained strong with an OSHA recordable rate of 0.7 through the first half of the year, which continues to exceed the top decile benchmark for the industry.
During the second quarter, our Encina plant was awarded OSHA's VPP Star designation. OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program, or VPP, is a voluntary program that allows a facility to attain one of the highest levels of safety recognition available within the power industry. To achieve this designation, a plant must demonstrate to OSHA that both management and the employees have achieved an exemplary health and safety record in addition to creating a steadfast safety culture that is embraced by the entire organization. This is the first NRG facility to achieve this award outside of our Texas fleet, and is a testament to our employees’ desire across the organization to strive for continuous improvement in safety.
Our baseload fleet had another very good quarter of operational success with our plant personnel delivering strong performance. During the quarter, we continued to face challenging market conditions caused by cycling and additional starts for our coal assets. This was followed by periods of extreme heat in June. Through these widely fluctuating conditions and multiple plant maintenance outages, our coal fleet reliability was better than the second quarter of last year. Most notably, I want to point out the superior quality quarterly performance of the Indian River and Limestone stations, both with E4 below 2% and the Huntley station with an E4 below 1%.
Our EPC group has continued to move forward with multiple construction projects. We have completed the Devon peaking plant in Connecticut and these fast-start units have been transitioned into our operating portfolio. Middletown is currently under construction and is expected to come online about this time next year. 
During the quarter, we have also acquired and integrated the South Trent wind farm into our wind portfolio. And lastly, we were successful in being awarded a $167 million DOE grant to design and construct a 60-megawatt carbon capture and enhanced oil recovery system at our Parish plant in Texas.
Finally, our commercial operations group has continued to effectively manage the hedging and dispatch of our wholesale generation portfolio in addition to executing the integration and risk management requirements for the Reliant energy retail supply. This quarter was also marked by wins in additional load following contracts and portfolio hedges, which I will review later.
Now turning to our plant operation performance on Slide 13. We have continued to operate our fleet safely and efficiently during the second quarter. While net generation and baseload availability were slightly off for the first half of this year as compared to 2009, this was primarily the result of three specific events within the fleet. These include a refueling outage at STP unit 2 as compared to no outages at STP during the same time period during 2009, the movement of an outage from 2011 to the second quarter of 2010 for Limestone unit 1 and a generator rotor outage at Dunkirk’s unit 4 in January that was discussed during the first quarter earnings call. 
Our units did experience some limited fuel switching, primarily during the shoulder months of March and April, that impacted net generation. However, this was partially offset by strong load from weather-related events during the second quarter.
From a unit reliability perspective, our baseload E4 for the second quarter was 2.05%, which is an exceptionally strong showing from our operations team. When taking the events into account that I previously mentioned, our overall plant reliability and availability during the first half of the year was solid and within our expectations for strong operating performance. We also recognized that in the low-margin price environment that we currently operate in, it doesn't always make economic sense to spend that last marginal maintenance dollar in order to achieve the highest possible availability statistic. 
At NRG, we are always making those analytical decisions based on real-time information. We can promise you that we are scrutinizing our spend relentlessly across the fleet and putting our maintenance dollars to the best possible use where we can capture the value of the last marginal megawatt hour while making the best cost-benefit decisions to manage our overall plant assets. Finally, on the chart to the bottom left, at the end of the second quarter, we have achieved 50% of our full year FORNRG targets. This achievement was accomplished through contributions from our retail, tax and other corporate departments, continued plan efficiency improvements within our generation fleet and the sale of Padoma.
We are on track to complete this year's goals and have the potential of getting a head start on the 2011 targets.
Turning to our retail operations on Slide 14. Warmer-than-normal weather across Texas with cooling degree days above the 10- and 30-year benchmark coupled with lower gas prices created an opportunity to deliver higher volumes and stronger margins from our Mass Market segment. The dramatic decline in the commodities last year allowed us to deliver margin significantly above our targeted run rate while the market became much more competitive. The steady state of commodities this year, we have taken disciplined, targeted marketing pricing and actions to begin to stabilize our customer count while maintaining strong margins, thereby driving towards higher customer retention levels.
At the same time, we have strengthened our sales channels and maintained our leadership in customer satisfaction and brand preference. The result for the quarter reflects an optimized balance between customer count and margin which is consistent with our long-term mass-market strategy for the Reliant brand and the specific customer segment we desire to serve. 
In the C&I segment, we improved renewal rates of existing customers during the second quarter and extended the term and diversity of our portfolio while experiencing profitable margins within the segment. Reliant remains the largest C&I retail provider, the second-largest residential provider and the largest retailer overall based on volume in Texas.
Before I conclude the operations section, I want to provide some thoughts on EPA's recently proposed Clean Air Transport Rule or CATR, which was developed in response to the court’s rejection of CAIR. The primary objectives of the newer rule as compared to CAIR are outlined on Slide 15. The rule initiates new NOx and SO2 trading programs in 2012 with a second phase in 2014 which further lowers SO2 emission caps in certain states. The main difference between CAIR and CATR are: one, the inability to use acid rain allowances to meet CATR requirements after the program’s implementation; and two, the restriction on trading of allowances between Group 1 and Group 2 states for SO2 compliance.
According to the EPA, the cap in allocations for 2012 are based on modeling current power plant operations with existing and planned controls across the industry. The key takeaway is that NRG can meet the 2012 NOx and SO2 caps without any new environmental construction requirements. 
As we elaborate on Slide 16, NRG’s fleet is well positioned vis-à-vis the proposed CATR rule. Specifically, our existing plans for additional environmental capital projects remains unchanged. CATR does not include Texas in the SO2 program. Therefore, our Parish and Limestone units will not need to hold SO2 allowances. Having separate Group 1 and Group 2 SO2 trading allowance restrictions does not impact NRG's ability to comply with the program. Our assets in New York and Pennsylvania, which are Group 1 states, already have SO2 controls and will not face additional incremental CapEx requirements to meet the 2014 cap. And lastly, as older uncontrolled plants are at risk of retirement, NRG hopes to benefit from changes to higher heat rates and power prices.
In summary, the proposed CATR rule is anticipated to have very little impact on NRG’s plant operations’ concurrently forecasted capital spend. Additionally, while EPA has acted in a very proactive way to address both NOx and SO2, they have done so by working constructively with the industry to achieve the desired air emission goals. As we have been saying since our investor conference last fall, we believe the EPA will take a pragmatic and moderate approach to current and future air standards. Therefore, based on their actions to date, we believe that any future EPA regulations will be similarly pragmatic to allow the industry sufficient time and means to approach compliance.
Moving to our hedge profile and commodity sensitivities on Slide 17, as we have reviewed with you many times on prior calls, we continuously seek opportunities to lock in additional hedges, hedging power during the up cycles and coal during the down cycles. As illustrated in the chart on the top left, our wholesale and retail segments continue to be well hedged over the next few years. 
Baseload generation is fully hedged for the remainder of this year, and we have increased our hedge position for 2011 to approximately 86% from 73% last quarter. During the quarter, we have focused our hedging strategy for 2011 on using option structures similar to the strategy we implemented in 2006. This hedge structure helps to protect us from further downward gas price movements while retaining some upside for positive upward price movements.
Based on NRG's view that gas prices reached their floor during 2009, in a time when demand was significantly off and supply was plentiful, we believe that the last half of 2010 and 2011 will provide opportunities to continue to hedge our portfolio at higher gas prices than the current forward market.
Concerning our Retail business, our hedge positions have increased during the quarter as shown by the crosshatches. We will continue to increase our hedge percentages as we execute on aggregating fully priced retail loan. The chart at the top right illustrates our coal and transport positions. During the quarter, we were successful in executing a fairly priced and beneficial multiyear transportation contract for our western New York coal plants. Based on the current supply/demand factors for PRB coal, we don't expect any significant upward commodity pricing pressure in the foreseeable future.
And lastly, moving to the chart on the bottom, as is customary with our hedge profile, we have limited our sensitivity to gas going gold prices and heat rate movements for 2011. 
Turning to review market fundamentals on Slide 18, the quarter-on-quarter demand growth for ERCOT continues to show solid trends for recovery and positive growth on a year-over-year basis, particularly in comparison with PJM where weather-normalized load growth continues to be fairly stagnant. However, during the second quarter, warmer-than-normal weather drove significant load increases across all three Northeast operating systems, with peak load recovering close to 2008 demand levels and total load up 6% to 7% across the region as compared to Q2 2009.
In Texas, forward heat rates have continued to be well supported during the first half of the year due to increasing demand recovery, tighter supply, potential for future plant retirements and the continued lack of capital market access for non-PPA projects. So I would like to end by saying that we are very well positioned operationally and commercially to deliver on our revised set of financial objectives for 2010. Now I'll turn it over to Chris, who will discuss our financial results.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss the second quarter and year-to-date financial results achieved during my first quarter as CFO. Let's begin with a brief overview of our achievements during the second quart",1101,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss the second quarter and year-to-date financial results achieved during my first quarter as CFO. 
Let's begin with a brief overview of our achievements during the second quarter on Slide 20. As David previewed earlier, the Company delivered strong financial results in the second quarter, totaling $693 million of adjusted EBITDA. Reliant Energy contributed $195 million of adjusted EBITDA. With robust gross margins our Retail business benefited from favorable weather conditions in a favorable commodity environment.
Meanwhile, the Wholesale business contributed $498 million of adjusted EBITDA, only $19 million lower than Q2 2009 performance. The year-on-year difference was affected by a refueling outage at STP unit 2 and a major planned outage at unit 2 of our Big Cajun facility, which occurs every six to eight years. Baseload generation in the Northeast was comparatively flat but due to hotter-than-normal weather during the quarter, oil and gas generation increased 20%. Benefiting our wholesale performance was increased capacity pricing in New York City, as well as new projects that came online as a result of our retiring and renewable initiative, including Cedar Bayou 4, Blythe solar facility and our Langford wind farm.
Year-to-date, EBITDA for the first six months was a record $1.294 billion, representing a 6% increase over $1.22 billion generated in the first half of 2009. The addition of Reliant Energy added $385 million of EBITDA as favorable weather drove an 11% increase in customer usage partially offsetting a 2% decline in average customer count. Also, the improvement in customer payment patterns we mentioned in the first quarter continued into the second quarter. 
Meanwhile, the Wholesale business generated $909 million of adjusted EBITDA for the first half of this year, solid results despite a low commodity environment. The strong quarter and year-to-date financial results were directly influenced by our strategic forward hedging program and the continued focus on operational excellence. Our record results also reinforced the benefits of our strategy of owning both generation and retail in Texas.
Finally, on this slide, I want to touch briefly on our liquidity position as I will review it in more detail on the next slide. We entered the first half of 2010 with a total liquidity of $3.5 billion, an increase of $290 million from the end of the first quarter. Cash on hand of nearly $2.2 billion provides ample capacity to serve our capital structure objectives and current capital allocation strategies. 
Of particular note during the second quarter is we successfully completed the amended extend of our first lien facilities, an important step in improving the financial flexibility of the Company. The highlights of this transaction include: extending the maturities from 2013 to 2015 for $1.8 billion combined for our term loan facility and synthetic LC and refinancing our revolver to $875 million while extending its maturity to 2015. The results of this transaction provides NRG with improved LC and term funding capacity to support our future growth initiatives. Now for a more detailed discussion our capital allocation, please turn to Slide 21.
Again, the Company’s strong liquidity position as of June 30 which, excluding funds deposited by hedging counterparties, stood at $3.5 billion. While liquidity is up from the prior quarter, I would like to review the year-to-date change of $294 million as of June 30 from year-end 2009. 
This difference is largely explained by debt repayments of $459 million, which included a reduction of the term loan B debt of $240 million and the settlement of the common stock fund of $190 million. Capital expenditures, net of project funding, of $294 million consisting primarily of $70 million of normal maintenance CapEx, $88 million of environmental CapEx and $125 million for NINA. 
Acquisitions of $141 million, net of financing, related largely to the purchase of South Trent in Northwind Phoenix and share repurchases totaling 2.2 million shares at a volume weighted average price of $22.58 for $50 million.
We are in a very comfortable liquidity position, allowing us to complete the remainder of our $180 million share buyback program before year end, as well as continue to be opportunistic about intrinsic and extrinsic capital investments to enhance our Retail, Wholesale and Renewal businesses. We will continue to review our options to increase returning value to our shareholders, and will evaluate the possibility of increasing our share buyback later in the year.
With respect to the restrictive payment basket in certain of our bond indentures, we have decided for now not to offer bondholders a payment for relief of this covenant. We believe the costs required to ensure a successful amendment of the current RB restriction to be prohibitive, particularly when compared to upcoming coal prices embedded in the bond’s original issuance. 
Finally, to date, our successful hedging strategy has provided stability to our EBITDA our results and in the future, we will continue to hedge our baseload business when appropriate. With that said, as you can see from this slide, we have ample capacity to execute on hedges in the out years under our first lien structure, which preserves other sources of liquidity necessary to assist our future growth.
Now turning to our full year guidance slide on Slide 22. We have increased our full year EBITDA guidance in the range of $2.45 billion to $2.55 billion, an increase of $250 million to $350 million from earlier projections. Going forward, we will continue to provide full year EBITDA guidance as a range. We believe a range of EBITDA results better captures unanticipated volatility and certain factors that may impact our results, such as weather changes and fluctuations in the underlying commodity markets. 
Our goal would be to narrow our ranges as the year progresses and final results become more certain. Alongside this update in EBITDA guidance, we are also updating free cash flow guidance to a range of $816 million to $916 million, an increase of $354 million to $454 million. 
In addition to our strong operating results, the increase in free cash flow is a certain beneficiary of our decision to be dramatically reduced the spend on the STP nuclear project until there is clarity on the prospects for a receipt of a DOE loan guarantee.
In closing, as David pointed out earlier, we continue to drive this business to focus on cash and based on Friday's closing stock price of $22.68 in our updated outlook, the recurring free cash flow yield currently stands between 22% to 24% or $5.06 to $5.45 per share. With that, I’ll turn it back to David for closing comments and questions.

I think the way, Dan, that we've gone around planning South Texas and the new reality is around this fact that we just literally have no idea when the U.S. government will do the two things, the Department of Energy actually finished the loan guarantee process hopefully in a positive fashion and the money be appropriated. It's really the second part that's more uncertain. I mean, we are really at the final stages with the DOE with negotiations of the loan agreement complete. But as to when the money would be there for an award, I mean, to be frank, Dan, as I'm told, it could be today or worst case scenario, if it gets to be part of the 2011 budget appropriations and that takes the track that it’s taken in recent years, it could be as far away as next February or March. So that's really the timing horizon that we've looked at all of those critical decisions. And we expect to have all of those, the four things that I talked about, resolved within that time period. So the U.S. government financing, the Japanese government financing, the EPC and the offtake. In terms of further sell downs, Dan, I would say would that's the one thing that's really changed in this because our motivation to sell down early in the project was actually to reduce the amount that we were spending every month. Left to our own devices, if we weren't spending as much as we were spending, we would prefer to sell down later rather than earlier because the project gets more valuable as it gets towards closing. So since our spend rate has been cut by 95%, I think the one other significant change in terms of the things that you mentioned is that you probably shouldn't expect additional sell-downs, unless they're for highly strategic reasons, until we get these other four main critical path items resolved. Dan, that's the best short answer I can give. I mean did you want to follow-up on some aspects of that?

I mean, if the partners -- and Dan, one thing I want to emphasize here, and I apologize to all our shareholders because I may not have spoken as accurately as I should have about the way this works, when we talk about like shutting down the project, this project like every other jointly developed product I've ever been in my life, one party does not have the right to shut down the project. One party only has the right to reduce or stop their spend in the project. The other party always has the right to unilaterally go forward. So when I talk about our decision-making in terms of actually shutting down a project, let's assume we have a joint decision of Toshiba and NRG to shut down the project. I think our overall sense is that while it will take a few months to wind down spending and money spent on demobilization and the like, there are not like enormous commitments that have not been disclosed before. I think the overall commitment of the Company would be in the $500 million range, but that $500 million includes the money that Toshiba's put to date. So that's more of an earnings number. You'd have to deduct the $150 million from Toshiba to get the cash exposure of NRG.

And in terms of the part of that, the very significant part of that, that NRG is not going to be funding, what we're showing on the right-hand side of Page 9 is the various alternatives that Toshiba has to bear that cost. And it could be vendor financing or there is the TANE credit facility. Toshiba also has the option of doing it through equity in NINA, in which case there would be some dilution of NRG.

So we don't have a perfect insight in this crystal ball.

It's the other two work streams, one is how to get money for the project and then of course the commercial arrangements. And there's been a lot of focus on the getting money work stream because of the DOE loan guarantee process. But the third work stream is the offtake. The offtake is the uncertainty that has caused us to not push so hard on the offtake thus far is not really related to the money. It's more related to the fact that you have to have a solid EPC price in order to talk to offtakers about the power and what it's going to cost. And we're getting much closer to a conclusion there in terms of getting a final EPC price that we then can work into something more specific to take to the offtakers. And so we expect in the second half this year, maybe spilling into the first quarter, to be looking for binding commitments from the several people that we've been talking to about long-term offtake for the project.

Today, I'm joined by Chris Schade, our Chief Financial Officer, who will begin part of the presentation; and John Ragan, who will be giving the Chief Operating Officer's part of the presentation, although as maybe you know, John Ragan has moved on to become the President of NRG Texas. His successor as Chief Operating Officer of the Company, Mauricio Gutierrez, is also here but he will be reprising his role as the Head of Commercial Operations and available to answer questions on topics relating to the market and the commodities. And finally, I'm also joined by Jason Few, who runs Reliant's business. 
Before I get started, I just want to mention of course that this shift in the management team has been caused in large part by the retirement of Kevin Howell. I know many of the long-term shareholders on the phone know Kevin well, and Kevin's had a great career at NRG first, fashioning our superb commercial operations team, then being acting as Chief Administrative Officer and most recently as President of NRG Texas. I want to thank Kevin for the phenomenal job he's done. I appreciate that a couple years ago, when he wanted to retire, he allowed me to persuade him to stay a couple extra years, and I just want to thank him personally for all that he's done for this Company.
Now turning to the presentation and on Page 3, referring to the slides that have been posted on our website. I wanted to start as I usually do by giving you my take on the Company's financial performance during the quarter. The Company quite simply performed spectacularly well during the quarter, and our superior performance, combined with favorable prevailing weather conditions, produce an exceptional financial performance for the Company. $693 million of adjusted EBITDA, the second strongest second quarter in our history and nearly $350 million of cash from operations.
The goal of operating the business for cash, as we always have done, obviously, is first to accumulate that cash and then allocate it in a timely and efficient manner on behalf of its owners and our chief shareholders. We've been successful on both counts during the quarter, increasing our cash balance by over $360 million and by allocating the cash effectively, including $50 million of expended to buyback NRG shares as the first stage of our 2010 capital allocation program. Our cash accounts were buoyed by, in addition to our cash generated from operations, by more than $100 million received under the cash ITC program from the federal government in connection with the Langford wind and the Blythe solar projects.
I'm very pleased with the steps we are taking towards building more flexibility into our capital structure, and Chris will talk more about that during his presentation. 
As we assess where we stand at this financial midpoint in 2010 today, the result achieved over the previous six months, together with the positions we have taken with respect to the six months to come, I'm very pleased to report to you that today we are increasing our guidance for the full year for both adjusted EBITDA and cash from operations by a very substantial amount. As you assess our new guidance, as I believe that you must, given the absolute magnitude and the sizable margin by which our performance in 2010 to date has exceeded the expectations of the financial community, I ask you to be mindful of three things. First, consider that 14 months after we purchased Reliant, perhaps it is time to recognize the superiority of our wholesale/retail model. Unique among our peers and as such, acknowledge that we merit a multiple premium rather than a multiple discount in comparison to peer generators.
Second, consider the resilience of our business model based as it is on the twin pillars of prudent balance sheet management and forward hedging through the commodity down cycles. Here we are reporting on the eighth full fiscal quarter since natural gas prices began to drop. And even though commodity prices continue to scrape along at the bottom of the trough, NRG is continuing to report nearly record results. Of course, it isn't our hedging alone that is achieving such a fantastic result. It's the strong contribution of Reliant. And that is where the prudent balance sheet management component of the strategy looms large. If we had not been in a strong financial position when the financial tsunami occurred, we could not have acquired Reliant in the manner that we did.
Third and finally, consider that nine months ago when we first announced guidance for 2010 of $2.2 billion, coming off a record shattering $2.6 billion EBITDA year in 2009, I told you that we were not satisfied with making $2.2 billion in 2010. I vowed to you on behalf of all the management and employees of NRG that we would work our hardest to do better. Today, with guidance revised significantly upward to $2.45 billion to $2.55 billion, we are fulfilling a good part, but not yet all of that vow. We will continue to work our hardest to improve our 2010 result. We know that this is what you expect from the NRG team, which you have invested your capital with. 
Well let's look beyond the numbers. As you know one of the most significant characteristics that differentiates NRG is that all the while that we are delivering best in class financial results, we also are working tirelessly to position the Company as both the optimal conventional competitive power company and as the first mover in America's clean energy economy future. As Slide 4 indicates, we have five top priorities in respect of each of these two strategic tracks and the progress we have achieved against all these priorities over the past couple quarters has been highly satisfactory. I'm happy to speak with you at length about any and all of these priorities but given time constraints, I'm going to focus most of my comments on the two most topical.
On the conventional side, our wholesale/retail model and on the new energy economy side, our push towards being first mover in low carbon baseload generation, particularly new nuclear power. Success within our business model depends on our success in maintaining our Reliant retail franchise through all commodity price cycles. The particular challenge in this commodity price cycle is preserving, growing and extending the franchise through this potentially prolonged commodity price trough in an environment where retail margins are healthy and barriers to entry appear low. As shown on Slide 5, our approach is fourfold. First, targeted pricing and marketing to a highly segmented mass market. Second, a resurgent and coordinated sales effort across all customer classes, especially the C&I segment, an area of Reliant’s business which was being affirmatively and intentionally discontinued under previous ownership and which is in the process of being rebuilt under our ownership. Third, various initiatives to leverage off the customer service capabilities of Reliant in order to increase revenue opportunities. And fourth, brand extension to a range of products and services built around smart metering technology being deployed in homes and commercial establishments around Texas.
Our fifth objective for Reliant, which is both an objective in its own right but also is the quality that underpins the Reliant brand, and as such our ability to achieve the other four objectives, is our relentless focus at Reliant on customer care and customer satisfaction. Reliant’s intensely committed to provide differentiated service across the entire customer lifecycle, and that commitment has paid off. 
As illustrated on Slide 6, Reliant has the lowest customer complaint percentages of all the Texas retail electricity providers. This has caused the Reliant brand not only to enjoy the highest brand recognition in the key areas of ERCOT but also the highest brand preference, as demonstrated on the bar charts on the bottom right. Everything we do and everything Reliant is doing is designed to preserve and enhance that brand and create increased distinction between Reliant and its competition. We are very confident that the things Reliant itself is doing, in its communities, with its smart leader program and with its customer service and that we at NRG are doing alongside Reliant Texas, such as the windmills, the nuclear plant and the electric vehicle infrastructure, will further preserve and enhance Reliant’s brand and NRG’s retail advantage in Texas more generally.
What does all this means to NRG shareholders? We reproduced Slide 7 to remind you that in our humble opinion, Reliant is being severely undervalued within NRG, given the reciprocal advantages that matching wholesale and retail provide to each other. The advantages are bulleted on this page. These advantages exist not only in theory but we have amply demonstrated to the market over the past 14 months that they exist in practice as well. 
We have steadily and substantially reduced the capital required to collateralize the Retail business through a continuous increase in the number of crossing trades we have done, and we have partially de-risked the business through a sequence of constructive hurricane risk mitigation products.
But bottom line, it comes down to the earnings power of Reliant’s retail business, sustained through the extended trough of this commodity price cycle. It was just over a year ago that you were being asked to believe that Reliant was worth no more than $1 a share to NRG. And now after just 14 months, Reliant already has generated over $1 billion in EBITDA for the Company, meaning that Reliant already has generated $4 for each NRG share outstanding. It's a very good start. It provides the proof of consistent performance which the market has sought. And as such, it's a good point for ascribing a fairer value.
Moving now to low carbon baseload. Before we get to a discussion of our STP 3 & 4 project, let me say that more than any other area of our business, renewables, demand-side management, fast start gas, low carbon baseload is, in my opinion, where it’s going to be at over the next 20 years. This is where the winners among 21st century power companies are going to be crowned. And with NRG positioned to seize first mover status, not only with new advanced nuclear, but also with clean coal projects, pivoting off the 60-megawatt carbon capturer and enhanced oil recovery demonstration project, we are developing with the assistance of the DOE at Parish, we are as well positioned as a company could be in this critical and valuable area. 
Now with that said, turning to the continuing saga of our STP 3 & 4 nuclear project on Page 8, I have attempted to cut through the noise and the complexity of recent developments to put on one page everything important that you need to know about where we are and where we are going with this project.
Starting with Washington, where activities continue as we speak, both within the executive branch and on Capitol Hill to find a way to fund either the two or the three projects which remain in contention for nuclear loan guarantees. I am here to tell you that I have absolutely no idea what funding method will succeed or how it will be achieved but I can tell you this, based on what I personally have witnessed in terms of the commitment of high officers of the Obama administration, the highly professional and constructive approach of the DOE staff and their advisers to our project and the nearly unanimous pledges of support from senators and representatives of both parties to the concept of additional funding for nuclear loan guarantees, I am more confident than I have ever been that our project ultimately will be awarded a nuclear loan guarantee from the United States government. The question I cannot answer and the question that informs the basis for the spending decisions that I am announcing here to date, is the question of when. I do not know when. 
This uncertainty about when is what makes it impossible for me to continue spending NRG shareholders' money at the rate which we have been spending through the months since CPS withdrew from the project. Accordingly, having reduced our ongoing spend on the project last month from approximately $30 million a month to $7.5 million a month, a 70% reduction, henceforth, from August 1 onward, NRG is capping its spend on STP 3 & 4 at $1.5 million a month, a 95% reduction from the burn rate just two months ago.
The good news is that after extensive work and discussions with our partner, Toshiba Corp. and with the other key parties involved in the project development, we have developed a plan, depicted in very general terms on Slide 9 to keep the project fully on schedule through at least the balance of 2010. We have achieved this in significant part by reducing the project work streams only to those critical path matters, which are absolutely essential to maintaining project schedule. We have achieved this in even greater part by Toshiba having agreed to carry the project more fully on its shoulders in the months to come in the same way that NRG has done for the several months since CPS withdrew from the project. 
For our part, while our work in Washington continues with the DOE and the legislative branch, we and our Japanese partners have opened formal discussions with the Japanese government financial institutions regarding Japanese co-financing for this important project. We are confident that the Japanese government and its lending institutions appreciate the importance of this project as much as do Toshiba and NRG. We also intend to focus extensively over the next several months on finalizing EPC arrangements with a structure and at a price that the project can bear. And finally, in order to keep the project on track, we must over the next several months take our discussions on OFTEC arrangements with key counterparts to the next level of commitment. We recognize that this critical path work stream is as important as the federal loan guarantee work stream and that they are interdependent.
In summary, with respect to nuclear, as we undertook to do several months ago, we have dramatically scaled back our financial commitment to the STP project development, but we have managed to do so in a manner that keeps the project fully on schedule with critical work processes at the DOE, the NRC in Japan and at the site all sufficiently manned. We will determine over these next months of low NRG spend whether all the key elements, the federal loan guarantee, the Japanese government co-financing, an appropriate EPC arrangement and sufficient offtake arrangements can be brought together in a manner that enables the STP project, a project which is so critically important, not only to NRG but also to the economy of the state of Texas and the zero emission energy objectives of the United States of America, to go forward.
Finally, on Slide 10, let me conclude before handing over to John by bringing back Slide 4 in a scorecard format so that we can grade our implementation to date against the dual strategy that we previously have articulated. On the conventional side, or as I prefer to call it, the classic NRG side, we are delivering superlative results, providing positive proof that the wholesale/retail combination works better than the pure generator or the pure retail model. 
Slowly but surely, we are revitalizing our gas fleet with Brownfield repowerings, our plant expansions completed at Long Beach, Cos Cob, Cedar Bayou and Devon, construction underway at Middletown and with a line of sight for El Segundo. With respect to the fifth priority on the classic side, we have not appreciably expanded our conventional portfolio through acquisition, but we believe the current environment is an attractive market for asset buyers and that market dynamic is going to persist for at least a while longer.
In terms of the right side, the transformative side, where the nature of the objectives are inherently longer term, we are very pleased with our progress in terms of low carbon baseload, not only with STP which we have previously discussed, but which also with our carbon capture and enhanced oil recovery project at Parish. Our multiple solar initiatives are proceeding exceedingly well, and you will hear much more about them in the months to come. And the projects that we are building at our various gas sites, particularly El Segundo, are going to be cutting edge in combining fast-start characteristics to firm renewables while providing modern CCGT efficiency and steady state operations. In short, I can assure you as shareholders of NRG, that while there is a lot that I’m very proud of as the CEO of your Company, neither I nor the rest of the team at NRG will take our eye off the ball in terms of delivering another exceptional financial result in 2010, perfecting our classic competitive generation retail model and positioning the Company to be a leader in the transformation to a new energy economy.
Turning to John Ragan."

During the second quarter of 2010, NRG continued to sustain the strong operating and commercial performance it achieved during the first quarter, solidly positioning the Company to enter the critical summer months",1924,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. During the second quarter of 2010, NRG continued to sustain the strong operating and commercial performance it achieved during the first quarter, solidly positioning the Company to enter the critical summer months. 
On Slide 12, we've highlighted some of our second quarter accomplishments. Our focus on safety across the entire organization, including Reliant, has remained strong with an OSHA recordable rate of 0.7 through the first half of the year, which continues to exceed the top decile benchmark for the industry.
During the second quarter, our Encina plant was awarded OSHA's VPP Star designation. OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program, or VPP, is a voluntary program that allows a facility to attain one of the highest levels of safety recognition available within the power industry. To achieve this designation, a plant must demonstrate to OSHA that both management and the employees have achieved an exemplary health and safety record in addition to creating a steadfast safety culture that is embraced by the entire organization. This is the first NRG facility to achieve this award outside of our Texas fleet, and is a testament to our employees’ desire across the organization to strive for continuous improvement in safety.
Our baseload fleet had another very good quarter of operational success with our plant personnel delivering strong performance. During the quarter, we continued to face challenging market conditions caused by cycling and additional starts for our coal assets. This was followed by periods of extreme heat in June. Through these widely fluctuating conditions and multiple plant maintenance outages, our coal fleet reliability was better than the second quarter of last year. Most notably, I want to point out the superior quality quarterly performance of the Indian River and Limestone stations, both with E4 below 2% and the Huntley station with an E4 below 1%.
Our EPC group has continued to move forward with multiple construction projects. We have completed the Devon peaking plant in Connecticut and these fast-start units have been transitioned into our operating portfolio. Middletown is currently under construction and is expected to come online about this time next year. 
During the quarter, we have also acquired and integrated the South Trent wind farm into our wind portfolio. And lastly, we were successful in being awarded a $167 million DOE grant to design and construct a 60-megawatt carbon capture and enhanced oil recovery system at our Parish plant in Texas.
Finally, our commercial operations group has continued to effectively manage the hedging and dispatch of our wholesale generation portfolio in addition to executing the integration and risk management requirements for the Reliant energy retail supply. This quarter was also marked by wins in additional load following contracts and portfolio hedges, which I will review later.
Now turning to our plant operation performance on Slide 13. We have continued to operate our fleet safely and efficiently during the second quarter. While net generation and baseload availability were slightly off for the first half of this year as compared to 2009, this was primarily the result of three specific events within the fleet. These include a refueling outage at STP unit 2 as compared to no outages at STP during the same time period during 2009, the movement of an outage from 2011 to the second quarter of 2010 for Limestone unit 1 and a generator rotor outage at Dunkirk’s unit 4 in January that was discussed during the first quarter earnings call. 
Our units did experience some limited fuel switching, primarily during the shoulder months of March and April, that impacted net generation. However, this was partially offset by strong load from weather-related events during the second quarter.
From a unit reliability perspective, our baseload E4 for the second quarter was 2.05%, which is an exceptionally strong showing from our operations team. When taking the events into account that I previously mentioned, our overall plant reliability and availability during the first half of the year was solid and within our expectations for strong operating performance. We also recognized that in the low-margin price environment that we currently operate in, it doesn't always make economic sense to spend that last marginal maintenance dollar in order to achieve the highest possible availability statistic. 
At NRG, we are always making those analytical decisions based on real-time information. We can promise you that we are scrutinizing our spend relentlessly across the fleet and putting our maintenance dollars to the best possible use where we can capture the value of the last marginal megawatt hour while making the best cost-benefit decisions to manage our overall plant assets. Finally, on the chart to the bottom left, at the end of the second quarter, we have achieved 50% of our full year FORNRG targets. This achievement was accomplished through contributions from our retail, tax and other corporate departments, continued plan efficiency improvements within our generation fleet and the sale of Padoma.
We are on track to complete this year's goals and have the potential of getting a head start on the 2011 targets.
Turning to our retail operations on Slide 14. Warmer-than-normal weather across Texas with cooling degree days above the 10- and 30-year benchmark coupled with lower gas prices created an opportunity to deliver higher volumes and stronger margins from our Mass Market segment. The dramatic decline in the commodities last year allowed us to deliver margin significantly above our targeted run rate while the market became much more competitive. The steady state of commodities this year, we have taken disciplined, targeted marketing pricing and actions to begin to stabilize our customer count while maintaining strong margins, thereby driving towards higher customer retention levels.
At the same time, we have strengthened our sales channels and maintained our leadership in customer satisfaction and brand preference. The result for the quarter reflects an optimized balance between customer count and margin which is consistent with our long-term mass-market strategy for the Reliant brand and the specific customer segment we desire to serve. 
In the C&I segment, we improved renewal rates of existing customers during the second quarter and extended the term and diversity of our portfolio while experiencing profitable margins within the segment. Reliant remains the largest C&I retail provider, the second-largest residential provider and the largest retailer overall based on volume in Texas.
Before I conclude the operations section, I want to provide some thoughts on EPA's recently proposed Clean Air Transport Rule, or CATR, which was developed in response to the court’s rejection of CAIR. The primary objectives of the newer rule as compared to CAIR are outlined on Slide 15. The rule initiates new NOx and SO2 trading programs in 2012 with a second phase in 2014 which further lowers SO2 emission caps in certain states. The main difference between CAIR and CATR are: one, the inability to use acid rain allowances to meet CATR requirements after the program’s implementation; and two, the restriction on trading of allowances between Group 1 and Group 2 states for SO2 compliance.
According to the EPA, the cap and allocations for 2012 are based on modeling current power plant operations with existing and planned controls across the industry. The key takeaway is that NRG can meet the 2012 NOx and SO2 caps without any new environmental construction requirements. 
As we elaborate on Slide 16, NRG’s fleet is well positioned vis-à-vis the proposed CATR rule. Specifically, our existing plans for additional environmental capital projects remains unchanged. CATR does not include Texas in the SO2 program. Therefore, our Parish and Limestone units will not need to hold SO2 allowances. Having separate Group 1 and Group 2 SO2 trading allowance restrictions does not impact NRG's ability to comply with the program. Our assets in New York and Pennsylvania, which are Group 1 states, already have SO2 controls and will not face additional incremental CapEx requirements to meet the 2014 cap. And lastly, as older uncontrolled plants are at risk of retirement, NRG hopes to benefit from changes to higher heat rates and power prices.
In summary, the proposed CATR rule is anticipated to have very little impact on NRG’s plant operations’ concurrently forecasted capital spend. Additionally, while EPA has acted in a very proactive way to address both NOx and SO2, they have done so by working constructively with the industry to achieve the desired air emission goals. As we have been saying since our investor conference last fall, we believe the EPA will take a pragmatic and moderate approach to current and future air standards. Therefore, based on their actions to date, we believe that any future EPA regulations will be similarly pragmatic to allow the industry sufficient time and means to approach compliance.
Moving to our hedge profile and commodity sensitivities on Slide 17. As we have reviewed with you many times on prior calls, we continuously seek opportunities to lock in additional hedges, hedging power during the up cycles and coal during the down cycles. As illustrated in the chart on the top left, our Wholesale and Retail segments continue to be well hedged over the next few years. 
Baseload generation is fully hedged for the remainder of this year, and we have increased our hedge position for 2011 to approximately 86% from 73% last quarter. During the quarter, we have focused our hedging strategy for 2011 on using option structures similar to the strategy we implemented in 2006. This hedge structure helps to protect us from further downward gas price movements while retaining some upside for positive upward price movements.
Based on NRG's view that gas prices reached their floor during 2009, in a time when demand was significantly off and supply was plentiful, we believe that the last half of 2010 and 2011 will provide opportunities to continue to hedge our portfolio at higher gas prices than the current forward market.
Concerning our Retail business, our hedge positions have increased during the quarter as shown by the crosshatches. We will continue to increase our hedge percentages as we execute on aggregating fully priced retail loan. The chart at the top right illustrates our coal and transport positions. During the quarter, we were successful in executing a fairly priced and beneficial multi-year transportation contract for our western New York coal plants. Based on the current supply/demand factors for PRB coal, we don't expect any significant upward commodity pricing pressure in the foreseeable future.
And lastly, moving to the chart on the bottom left, as is customary with our hedge profile, we have limited our sensitivity to gas and coal prices and heat rate movements through 2011. 
Turning to review market fundamentals on Slide 18. The quarter-on-quarter demand growth for ERCOT continues to show solid trends for recovery and positive growth on a year-over-year basis, particularly in comparison with PJM where weather-normalized load growth continues to be fairly stagnant. However, during the second quarter, warmer-than-normal weather drove significant load increases across all three Northeast operating systems, with peak load recovering close to 2008 demand levels and total load up 6% to 7% across the region as compared to Q2 2009.
In Texas, forward heat rates have continued to be well supported during the first half of the year due to increasing demand recovery, tighter supply, potential for future plant retirements and the continued lack of capital market access for non-PPA projects. So I would like to end by saying that we are very well positioned operationally and commercially to deliver on our revised set of financial objectives for 2010. Now I'll turn it over to Chris, who will discuss our financial results."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss the second quarter and year-to-date financial results achieved during my first quarter as CFO. Let's begin with a brief overview of our achievements during the second quart",1103,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss the second quarter and year-to-date financial results achieved during my first quarter as CFO. 
Let's begin with a brief overview of our achievements during the second quarter on Slide 20. As David previewed earlier, the company delivered strong financial results in the second quarter, totaling $693 million of adjusted EBITDA. Reliant Energy contributed $195 million of adjusted EBITDA. With robust gross margins, our Retail business benefited from favorable weather conditions and a favorable commodity environment.
Meanwhile, the Wholesale business contributed $498 million of adjusted EBITDA, only $19 million lower than Q2 2009 performance. The year-on-year difference was affected by a refueling outage at STP unit 2 and a major planned outage at unit 2 of our Big Cajun facility, which occurs every six to eight years. Baseload generation in the Northeast was comparatively flat, but due to hotter-than-normal weather during the quarter, oil and gas generation increased 20%. Benefiting our wholesale performance was increased capacity pricing in New York City, as well as new projects that came online as a result of our repowering and renewable initiatives, including Cedar Bayou 4, Blythe solar facility and our Langford wind farm.
Year-to-date, EBITDA for the first six months was a record $1.294 billion, representing a 6% increase over $1.224 billion generated in the first half of 2009. The addition of Reliant Energy added $385 million of EBITDA as favorable weather drove an 11% increase in customer usage, partially offsetting a 2% decline in average customer count. Also, the improvement in customer payment patterns we mentioned in the first quarter continued into the second quarter. 
Meanwhile, the Wholesale business generated $909 million of adjusted EBITDA for the first half of this year, solid results despite a low commodity environment. The strong quarter and year-to-date financial results were directly influenced by our strategic forward hedging program and the continued focus on operational excellence. Our record results also reinforced the benefits of our strategy of owning both generation and retail in Texas.
Finally, on this slide, I want to touch briefly on our liquidity position as I will review it in more detail on the next slide. We entered the first half of 2010 with a total liquidity of $3.5 billion, an increase of $290 million from the end of the first quarter. Cash on hand of nearly $2.2 billion provides ample capacity to serve our capital structure objectives and current capital allocation strategies. 
Of particular note during the second quarter is we successfully completed the amend and extend of our first lien facilities, an important step in improving the financial flexibility of the company. The highlights of this transaction include: extending the maturities from 2013 to 2015 for $1.8 billion combined for our term loan facility and synthetic LC; and refinancing our revolver to $875 million while extending its maturity to 2015. The results of this transaction provides NRG with improved LC and term funding capacity to support our future growth initiatives. Now for a more detailed discussion on our capital allocation, please turn to Slide 21.
Again, the company’s strong liquidity position as of June 30 which, excluding funds deposited by hedging counterparties, stood at $3.5 billion. While liquidity is up from the prior quarter, I would like to review the year-to-date change of $294 million as of June 30 from year-end 2009. 
This difference is largely explained by debt repayments of $459 million, which included a reduction of the term loan B debt of $240 million and the settlement of the common stock fund of $190 million; capital expenditures, net of project funding, of $294 million consisting primarily of $70 million of normal maintenance CapEx, $88 million of environmental CapEx and $125 million for NINA; acquisitions of $141 million, net of financing, related largely to the purchase of South Trent in Northwind Phoenix; and share repurchases totaling 2.2 million shares at a volume weighted average price of $22.58 for $50 million.
We are in a very comfortable liquidity position, allowing us to complete the remainder of our $180 million share buyback program before year end, as well as continue to be opportunistic about intrinsic and extrinsic capital investments to enhance our Retail, Wholesale and Renewal businesses. We will continue to review our options to increase returning value to our shareholders, and will evaluate the possibility of increasing our share buyback later in the year.
With respect to the restrictive payment basket in certain of our bond indentures, we have decided for now not to offer bondholders a payment for relief of this covenant. We believe the costs required to ensure a successful amendment of the current RB restriction to be prohibitive, particularly when compared to upcoming coal prices embedded in the bond’s original issuance. 
Finally, to date, our successful hedging strategy has provided stability to our EBITDA our results and in the future, we will continue to hedge our baseload business when appropriate. With that said, as you can see from this slide, we have ample capacity to execute on hedges in the out years under our first lien structure, which preserves other sources of liquidity necessary to assist our future growth.
Now turning to our full year guidance slide on Slide 22. We have increased our full year EBITDA guidance in the range of $2.45 billion to $2.55 billion, an increase of $250 million to $350 million from earlier projections. Going forward, we will continue to provide full year EBITDA guidance as a range. We believe a range of EBITDA results better captures unanticipated volatility and certain factors that may impact our results, such as weather changes and fluctuations in the underlying commodity markets. 
Our goal would be to narrow our ranges as the year progresses and final results become more certain. Alongside this update in EBITDA guidance, we are also updating free cash flow guidance to a range of $816 million to $916 million, an increase of $354 million to $454 million. 
In addition to our strong operating results, the increase in free cash flow is a certain beneficiary of our decision to be dramatically reduced the spend on the STP nuclear project until there is clarity on the prospects for a receipt of a DOE loan guarantee.
In closing, as David pointed out earlier, we continue to drive this business to focus on cash and based on Friday's closing stock price of $22.68 in our updated outlook, the recurring free cash flow yield currently stands between 22% to 24% or $5.06 to $5.45 per share. With that, I’ll turn it back to David for closing comments and questions."

I think the way, Dan, that we've gone around planning South Texas and the new reality is around this fact that we just literally have no idea when the U.S. government will do the two things, the Department of Energy actually finished the loan guarantee process hopefully in a positive fashion and the money be appropriated. It's really the second part that's more uncertain. I mean, we are really at the final stages with the DOE with negotiations of the loan agreement complete. But as to when the money would be there for an award, I mean, to be frank, Dan, as I'm told, it could be today or worst case scenario, if it gets to be part of the 2011 budget appropriations and that takes the track that it’s taken in recent years, it could be as far away as next February or March. So that's really the timing horizon that we've looked at all of those critical decisions. And we expect to have all of those, the four things that I talked about, resolved within that time period. So the U.S. government financing, the Japanese government financing, the EPC and the offtake. In terms of further sell downs, Dan, I would say would that's the one thing that's really changed in this because our motivation to sell down early in the project was actually to reduce the amount that we were spending every month. Left to our own devices, if we weren't spending as much as we were spending, we would prefer to sell down later rather than earlier because the project gets more valuable as it gets towards closing. So since our spend rate has been cut by 95%, I think the one other significant change in terms of the things that you mentioned is that you probably shouldn't expect additional sell-downs, unless they're for highly strategic reasons, until we get these other four main critical path items resolved. Dan, that's the best short answer I can give. I mean did you want to follow-up on some aspects of that?"

One party only has the right to reduce or stop their spend in the project. The other party always has the right to unilaterally go forward. So when I talk about our decision-making in terms of actually shutting down a project, let's assume we have a joint decision of Toshiba and NRG to shut down the project. I think our overall sense is that while it will take a few months to wind down spending and money spent on demobilization and the like, there are not like enormous commitments that have not been disclosed before. I think the overall commitment of the Company would be in the $500 million range, but that $500 million includes the money that Toshiba's put to date. So that's more of an earnings number. You'd have to deduct the $150 million from Toshiba to get the cash exposure of NRG."

They're just bearing more of the ongoing cost. The spend rate of the project is being reduced from about $30 million a month to about $20 million a month. And in terms of the part of that, the very significant part of that, that NRG is not going to be funding, what we're showing on the right-hand side of Page 9 is the various alternatives that Toshiba has to bear that cost.

We don't ever talk about that anymore because it's working perfectly. It's right on track. It's the other two work streams, one is how to get money for the project and then of course the commercial arrangements. And there's been a lot of focus on the getting money work stream because of the DOE loan guarantee process. But the third work stream is the offtake. The offtake is the uncertainty that has caused us to not push so hard on the offtake thus far is not really related to the money. It's more related to the fact that you have to have a solid EPC price in order to talk to offtakers about the power and what it's going to cost. And we're getting much closer to a conclusion there in terms of getting a final EPC price that we then can work into something more specific to take to the offtakers.

But I think when people have looked at this issue at South Central, they've exaggerated the ease with which a customer to Louisiana Generating could switch because it's a constrained transmission system down there. Our plants have the transmission rights to serve these customers who as you know, are spread all over Louisiana. So it may not be a straight, look, I can get a price 2% lower from someone else that you're suggesting. It's a more complicated assessment. Having said that, like I said, we want to work with the co-ops to smooth out the path, and get the right outcome for them and their customers. Mauricio, did you have anything to add on that?"

Let me start by introducing my colleagues here participating in this presentation joined by Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Corporate Officer; and by Chris Schade, our Chief Financial Officer. Also available to",2813,"Thank you, Nahla, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by introducing my colleagues here participating in this presentation joined by Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Corporate Officer; and by Chris Schade, our Chief Financial Officer. Also available to answer your questions will be Jason Few, who runs the Reliant Retail Business on our behalf; and Chris Mose, who is responsible for commercial operations at NRG. 
So to begin, as we know, the Equity Markets, relentlessly forward-looking to some, I spent most of my time looking for it as well. I do want to pause for a moment, and you should be looking at Slide 3, if you're following along in the presentation on what this company accomplished in the third quarter of 2010 and what we are in the process of accomplishing here today. 
We had another exceptionally strong performance with our second best-ever quarter from an EBITDA perspective with an able assist from favorable weather and most importantly, thanks to our exceptional operating performance in robust hedged position. We largely mitigate the impact of gas prices trending relentlessly downward and keep rates moving sideways to post $777 million of adjusted EBITDA and $536 million of cash from operations. Certainly, our already strong current liquidity position was enhanced during the quarter by the bond financing that we did in August, but our liquidity was also strengthened as it has been for many course in a row by a very substantial contribution of free cash flow from the company's operating assets and businesses. 
Our strong performance year-to-date allows us to narrow our full year 2010 guidance to the top end of the present range. And while I had in my exploration from the beginning of the year to reach the $2.6 billion level, which would've put us flat against our record-shattering performance in 2009, I am nonetheless very proud given the gravitational pull of near-term gas prices that we are on our way to a performance in the $2.5 billion range. 
Indeed, as you may recall that 12 months ago in the course of announcing an initial EBITDA guidance for 2010 of $2.2 billion, I convey to you that as a management team, we were not satisfied with that number. And we made a commitment to you, our shareholders, that we would not rest until we had improved substantially on that number. I feel that under the circumstances, we have delivered on that commitment. 
Today, I'm here to make another set of commitment. As Chris will outline for you, we are initiating guidance for 2011 in the $2 billion range. Our financial prospects in the third year of commodity price recession, once again being subjected to the downward pressure of the significantly lower gas curve, our commitment to our shareholders again this year is that we will not rest until we have substantially improved our performance against the standard of this initial guidance. I can't promise you anything specific today with respect to our next fiscal year, which obviously doesn't begin for another two months. But if you check our record over the past six years, I think you will find that we have been pretty successful in exceeding expectations regarding our current operating and financial performance.
I'd like to devote the remainder of my time to comment on a few important comments of our strategic positioning of this company, Many of these areas of our business figure primarily in the thoughts of our investors since they have been introduced recently or will be in the near future. The company's strategic approach is in general terms depicted on Slide 4, five conventional priorities and five transformational green energy priorities. I feel that we've made significant progress against all kind of these priorities year-to-date. And during Q&A, I would be happy to talk about any or all of that. But due to time constraints, I'm going to limit my prepared remarks to the four Rs: reactors, renewables, retail and CCT acquisitions at a significant discounts or replacement costs.
Our goal in respect to our Conventional business, as shown on Slide  5, is to build our business on the foundation of a multi-fuel, across-the-merit-order, geographically advantage generation portfolio at scale in each of our core markets. And in our principal market, which of course is Texas, matching up that diversified generation portfolio with the Retail Electricity business also at scale. As such, in this area, the four Rs are where much of our opportunity lay. In the case of new advanced nuclear power, there are two more Rs which are important. The first R is replacement power. Our nation's solid fuel base load fleet is very old and rapidly getting older as little to no new base load generation is being built. The oldest quartile of baseload generation this country needs to be replaced over the next decade and given the development lead times for solid fuel generation, our view is that those of us who get started now will be advantaged. 
The final R stands for renaissance, and it's not yet clear how robust the nuclear renaissance will be here in the United States. But it is very clear that the world at large is well down the path towards a global nuclear renaissance worth hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions, and the owner or developers of the first new nuclear plant in the United States are going to have a very beneficial first mover advantage in that nuclear renaissance.
But of course, the secure first mover advantage of the nuclear renaissance you actually have to have a first mover project. The status of STP 3 & 4 has not changed significantly since our previous quarterly call. The lack of visible progress was to be expected since the gating item for most meaningful steps forward on the project, such as additional equity partners, has been and continue to be the DOE loan guaranty process and the related issue of funding appropriations. Since Congress has been in business for most of the last three months, it's not surprising that there has been no development on the additional appropriation. 
Nonetheless, significant progress continue to be made on all key fronts below the surface. From the perspective of NRG shareholders, we believe you should evaluate the present arrangement with respect to STP as illustrated on Slide 6 as follows. NRG has a limited obligation at currently a $1.5 million a month, an obligation to our partners to contribute to ongoing development spend until the loan guaranty is received and accepted. Nonetheless, recognizing NRG's very substantial financial contribution to the project development today of approximately $315 million, including a significant amount, which was funded during the first half of this year as a result of NRG assuming CPS share of the overall development spend, the project remains fully on schedule. This is due to the much appreciated stepped up contribution of our partners or, and we remain very much in contention for the valuable nuclear loan guaranty from the Department of Energy. As such, during this phase, the STP 3 & 4 development should be perceived by earnings from shareholders as a low cost option on a very large benefit opportunity with clearly defined exit ramps.
Of course, the news affecting nuclear development in the United States during the past several weeks has had little to do with STP and much to do with the Calvert Cliffs project and the loan guarantees we issued cited by Constellation as their reason for withdrawing from the project. What I would tell you is that notwithstanding the superficial similarities between the two projects, and this is shown on the left side of Slide 7, the two projects actually are structured very differently. Obviously, they are in different markets with different rates of projected base load growth, but also they involve different risk allocation with respect to technology, completion risk and merchant offtake. We do not yet know precisely how these differences will play into the government's analysis of the loan guaranty fee for STP, but the government is well aware of the structural differences because they have been discussed at length by us with the DOE. 
As I am trying to depict on the right side of this page, we believe we're in the midst of the final stage of the government's determination of this issue. And so hopefully, we will be in the position to advise our investors within a few weeks of the outcome.
Moving on Slide 8. We have transaction spending to purchase high efficiency load volume CCGTs in three of our four core regions, and we continue to push towards a prompt closing of these transactions. We are highly confident that Cottonwood will close in the very near future and that while Cottonwood in and of itself will be fairly unspectacular in its near-term contribution to EBITDA, given the subdued commodity price environment, cottonwood will play in the essential role in enabling us to renew the portfolio long-term offtake arrangements that South Central has with its key co-op customers, recognizing that a significant number of these contracts are up for renewal in 2014.
As to the Dynegy assets, we remain very comfortable with the bargain we struck back in August, and we want the transaction to proceed on its present terms. With the commodity price curve for natural gas, bumping along its cyclical bottom, it is a good time to acquire generation assets. We are highly confident if we get the opportunity to close the Dynegy transactions. And over the entire commodity price cycle, our investment will be money well spent and that this portfolio, headlined by the strategically and geographically advance Moss Landing 1 and 2 will be a successful investment on behalf of NRG shareholders. 
If the Blackstone acquisition does not proceed and the opportunity to buy the set of CCGTs disappears, we are equally confident that we have very attractive alternative uses for the liquidity that will be freed up. Not only is it a good time to invest in well located CCGT that price is well below replacement cost, it's a good time to invest in low risk, high return solar projects, and that's something I'm about to talk about. And It's always a good time particularly at the current depressed price levels to buy NRG stock. 
Of course, our stock price performance seems to be constrained by the drop in gas prices and the flattening of the gas curve more generally. However, that fundamental connection between natural gas prices and the financial prospects of ITPs hence overlook the fact that our Reliant Retail business is countercyclical to natural gas, and the $600 million of year-to-date EBITDA that we are reporting today demonstrates the resilience of that countercyclicality. We have previously guided the markets to think of reliance in our hands as a $300 million year ""mid-cycle business"" for the course. That concept is very broad brush and indeed somewhat meaningless outside of financial modeling since in my 20 years experience, the mid-cycle never seems to last for more than a millisecond either in the natural gas or the key rate market. What we have tried to depict on Slide 9 is a slightly more nuanced and hopefully a significantly more accurate view of the earnings power of Reliant as a function of the natural gas price cycle.
The upside of this analysis is that rather than thinking about Reliant as a $300 million year EBITDA mid-cycle business, we believe the markets should think of Reliant as a $400 million to $500 million year EBITDA business in all flat to modestly probing gas price environments. When natural gas prices are sharply decreasing, Reliant's earnings power conspite above $600 million a year. When natural gas prices are sharply increasing, Reliant's earnings power will dip below $400 million a year, with $300 million being more of a baseline, absent some extraordinary event. 
Moving on to our green initiatives on Slide 10. Our purchase of Green Mountain Energy, has received all necessary approvals and is ready to be closed in the very near future. As a general comment, I want to emphasize how important I think Green Mountain and the Green Mountain brand is going to be in transforming NRG's alternative energy future by trying to get to our various renewable generation businesses and initiatives and tying them to Green Mountain's own substantial and growing green energy customers. 
In the fast-growing world of green energy, as depicted on Slide 11, there is no brand that comes within a country mile of Green Mountain. As a stand-alone business, divorced from any association with NRG's renewables project or any support of NRG's commercial operation theme, Green Mountain is a solid business with a healthy EBITDA contribution relative to the purchase price. As such, even on its own, it's a welcome addition to the portfolio. But beyond that, Green Mountain will allow NRG to offer a match green wholesale green retail product to green energy consumers that's truly unique. And this is important because while the idea of top down imposition of a carbon regime on the American public is dead on arrival in the New Washington, the American consumer planetory sustainability is going to continue. And indeed, in my opinion, it accelerate, lead by thought leaders of the next generation. 
Success with Green Mountain for us starts with a successful integration. At NRG, our track record of quick, efficient and effective integration of new acquisitions is one of the things I'm proud of at this company, both in the case of Texas Genco and Reliant Retail, we've demonstrated that complex businesses could be brought into the NRG camp in a matter that not only was non-destructive but which enable the newly-acquired businesses to equal or exceed their business objectives, virtually form the very beginning. The single key to our success in this regard is our emphasis on enabling the new businesses to continue to focus on what they do best while letting us take care of the rest. In the weeks ahead, we will be working closely with Green Mountain on the integration of their business enterprise into NRG, focusing on our the priorities listed on Slide 12. We intend to protect, preserve and extend our green identity to secure their core financial performance and to prioritize their opportunities for profitable expansion to new regions and products but particularly in respect to new market segments. We believe NRG can ably assist Green Mountain to move further up the C&I ladder to sell to bigger and more expensive retail orientations, which themselves want to short up their own sustainability credentials with their own customer base. In short, I'm extremely excited on what Green Mountain and NRG can accomplish working together. So you should, as they say, stay tuned.
Turning to the Wholesale side of our green equation on Slide 13, we have talked about the immense opportunity we see in the solar space. But so far, it has been mainly anticipatory. What you already have begun to see over the past couple of weeks with the announcement of construction at Avanol and Ivanpha is that our development effort is beginning to bear a fruit. If all goes according to plan, you should expect to hear significantly more in the weeks to come as conservatively more solar projects to our development pipeline complete the usual development process and proceed into the construction phase.
As we've stated previously and repeat on Slide 14, we feel that our solar investment strategy, being a validly multi-technology, multi-vendor and initially focused on the utility-sized projects with very long-term PPAs, is the precisely right strategy to capitalize on the opportunities and incentives currently available to the solar industry. The equity return on these projects, particularly when you consider the lack of merchant risk, the complete absence of environmental risk and the minimal completion risk and construction time, are as attractive on a risk-adjusted basis as any that I have seen over the course of my 20 years in this industry. 
And finally, before handing over to Mauricio, let me emphasize that we are mindful that our solid financial performance year-to-date in 2010 and our successful positioning of the company to take advantage of the very attractive growth opportunities that will arise as our industry transforms itself in response to the society's demand for sustainability have not yet translated into improving our share price. And as a consequence, our shareholders have suffered. We will do everything within our power to bring about that improvement, and we believe that the main thing we can do is execute on our plan as effectively and as quickly as possible. As listed on Slide 15, we have a great deal on our plate over the next six to nine months, and we hope that successful execution against these priorities will serve as a springboard for share price appreciation.

As you all know, the third quarter is critical for both our generation and retail segments. This summer, we experienced some of the warmest weather on record across our Northeast, South Central and Texas regions. I am very pleased to report that we had another strong quarter from both an operational and financial perspective. 
Slide 17 highlights a few of the accomplishments achieved during the third quarter. As always, we remain focused on safety across the organization. And for the third quarter, we posted an ocean recordable rate of 0.88, a significant improvement from last summer and just shy of subsea levels. Our top performance improved across our entire fleet for the third quarter. 
Starting with our coal plant performance, the equivalent availability factor or EAF increased to 94.9% in the third quarter from 92.3% for the same period in 2009. This improvement was lead by our Limestone and facilities. Nuclear generation at STP had another outstanding quarter with 99% availability, and our oil and gas portfolio responded to the significant fees experienced in Texas, South Central and the Northeast by starting over 2,500x with a 99% reliability during these critical summer months. 
With respect to our construction projects, the Indian River environmental control project, continues to be on track and within budget to begin operations in January 2012. Our middle pound repowering project to build 200 megawatts of peaking capacity is somewhat scheduled to be operational by the summer of 2011. This is the second repowering project in our New England fleet. Our first project at Devon have been running successfully since it began operation this past summer. 
The BBA for El Segundo energy complex in California received CPUC approval in October. Demolition of work has started to make room for the construction of the new units, which I expected to be in service by the summer of 2013. Our core energy program stands at $83 million year-to-date and is on track to achieve the $98 million free cash flow goal for the year. Also, we have already identified projects and cost savings that will bring this program to completion by achieving the full goal of $150 million ahead of our 2012 for regional base. 
Finally, our commercial operations group took advantage of some market opportunity during this summer to increase our hedge profile in 2011, which I will discuss in more detail later in the presentation. In addition, they have successfully managed our retail supply under volatile market conditions, delivering strong financial results for two consecutive summers.
Moving on to our client operations on Slide 18. Net generation increased by 8% this quarter over last year. This increase came primarily from our northeast plants, which benefited from lower than normal weather and a decreasing coal to gas switching, which was most prevalent in 2009. Also, nuclear generation was higher due to much improved availability from the third quarter of last year. Our base line portfolio, which includes both our coal and nuclear assets experienced significant reliability improvements during the third quarter compared to last year. Limestone and Indian River led the cold fleet with a clear and forced outage rates of 2.6% and 4%, respectively. 
Turning to our retail operations on Slide 19. We experienced another solid performance during the third quarter. Record weather in August and September across Texas created an opportunity to deliver higher volumes and stronger margin from our Mass segments. The Mass segment drove significant improvement in this customer attrition with the launch of the advertising campaign and innovative products. In addition, we maintained our low customer complaint rate through strong performance in retail operations. We continue to balance customer count and pricing to deliver higher than run rate margins that are more sustainable in the long term.
In the C&I segment, we continue to improve win rates during the third quarter and extended the terms and diversity of our portfolio. Reliant remains the largest C&I provider in Texas, and we continue to leverage the strength of NRG to provide innovative products and services for our business customers. In summary, we're optimizing margin and customer count by delivering innovative products and excellent customer service. 
Turning to our hedge profile and commodity sensitivities on Slide 20. As illustrated in the chart on the upper left, we had increased our hedge profile for 2011 to 96% from 86% last quarter. This is consistent with our view that the gas markets continue to be under pressure given the high and resilient domestic production levels despite of low gas prices. 
With gas producers beginning to show some drilling restraint, hedged positions rolling off and indications that drilling to both acreage may be ending, we have chosen to remain relatively open beyond 2011 to benefit from an expected recovery in the gas markets. If we decide to add additional hedges in the other years, we would likely lean towards using option structures that allow us to participate in some upside, while protecting the portfolio for further decreases in gas prices. With respect to retail, we have increased our price, though, to 57% in 2011 from 50% in the second quarter. We continue to match as much generational load as possible to strike maximum synergies between our Retail and Wholesale portfolios.
In order to match our incremental power hedges, our growth hedges increased over 2011 from 78% last quarter to 88% as illustrated on the upper right chart. We also remain well hedged in terms of coal transportation for some time. We continue to limit our commodity price sensitivity in 2011 as illustrated in the lower left chart with 2012 to 2013 through '15 largely unchanged. 
Moving on to Slide 21. The quarter-on-quarter demand growth for continues to the positive trend for the weather normalized load growth for the year at around 2%. In August, set multiple consecutive big loads and achieved a new all-time record big load of 65.7 kilowatts, an increase of almost 4% from the previous record set in July of last year. In PJM, the weather normalized load growth continues to be fairly present. However, the warmer than normal weather drove significant load increases across the Northeast, and total load off was up 7% to 9% higher as compared to third quarter of 2009. In Texas, recovery remains to be well supported during the first half of the year. There's a continued robust demand, higher supply, time retirement and the continued lack of capital for merchant projects. We expect the Texas market to continue showing robust fundamentals.
Moving on to the environmental front. 2011 will provide a lot more clarity around environmental growth and requirement for our facility. As we have mentioned in previous presentations, we currently have a plan to invest approximately $700 million over the next  four years in the environmental projects, failure to comply with these future regulations. Starting with Cedar, the proposed rules does not require additional capital for compliance. With respect to MACT, our client considers mercury controls on local units. While a worst-case scenario to control acid gas could result in additional environmental capital for 1,900 megawatts at Parish and 1,500 megawatt at Big Cajun. We don't expect this to be the likely scenario. 
In terms of master pulling, intake qualifications on reborrowing are expected to achieve desired results. For example, originating targets today with extreme qualifications at our Arcotil [ph] plant in New York. Finally, NRG does not face the challenges of converting from web surface implants to landfills as we have assets also at all our core facilities. 
Our near-term operational priorities are listed on Slide 22. As we move into 2011, we remain focused on excellence in safety and operational performance. We will continue to constantly evaluate the impact of various environmental regulations and our term maintenance and capital spend, particularly in the face of a challenging commodity price environment and determine the best cost benefit decision for each of our assets. 
With that, I will turn it over to Chris, who will discuss our financial results."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining our discussion of NRG's third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Beginning with Slide 24, our financial results remained strong with $777 million of adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter and $2.071 billion of adjusted EBITDA year-to-date. During the quarter, Reliant Energy contributed $209 million of adjusted EBITDA to our results compared to $306 million in EBITDA for the third quarter of '09. This difference is largely explained by lower margins on newly acquired customers and existing customer renewals as well as lower customer accounts. 
Meanwhile, the Wholesale business contribute $568 million of adjusted EBITDA during Q3. The $32 million decline compared to Q3 2009 Wholesale performance can be largely attributed to the following. In the Northeast region, lower base load hedges were partially offset by a 37% increase in generation due to warmer than expected weather during the quarter. In Texas, a 5% increase in generation and the benefits of lower operations and maintenance costs were offset by a 20% increase in fuel costs, driven by new coal transportation contract at our Parish facility. Meanwhile, the south-central region benefited from the addition of a new contract with the regional municipality, leading to a 17% increase in megawatt hour sold and a 23% increase in the average realized energy price per megawatt hour. Also contributing to the results of south-central region was an 8% increase in load due in part to warmer weather. 
Turning to year-to-date results. Reliant Energy contributed $594 million of EBITDA, $58 million greater than 2009 EBITDA of $536 million. Excluding the $227 million of EBITDA generated in the first four months of 2010 for comparative year-to-date analysis since the acquisition was completed in May of '09, EBITDA results were lower by $169 million. This decline is driven by a 19% decline in mass margins, which were the result of price reductions following the acquisition and lower margins and customer renewal and acquisitions, reflective of the current competitive marketplace. 
The Wholesale business year-to-date generated $1.477 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $116 million lower as compared to the first three quarters of 2009. The comparative year-to-date decline is largely explained by lower base load hedges in the Northeast, lower margins in Texas, caused by higher transportation costs, offset somewhat by better contributions from the south-central region. At September 30, the company's liquidity position stood at approximately $4.8 billion. Impacting this liquidity position during the third quarter were the following items. We repurchased $130  million of NRG shares at a volume weighted average cost of $20.80 per share. These shares, combined with the $50 million repurchase in the second quarter, brings the 2010 share repurchase program to a close at $180 million or 8.4 million shares purchase at a volume weighted average cost of $21.26 per share. 
On August 20, the company issued $1.1 billion of 8.25% senior notes due 2020, with the proceeds we use for general corporate purposes, including a funding of a recently announced acquisitions. And on October 12, NRG completed $190 million tax exempt financing in relation to the environmental work to be completed at our Indian River facility, which is not yet reflected in current liquidity. The company closed the third quarter in a strong financial position to complete the three recently announced acquisitions of Dynegy assets, Cottonwood and Green Mountain Energy totaling $2.238 billion. 
Now turn to Slide 25. As I mentioned a moment ago, total liquidity, excluding funds deposited by hedged counter-parties remained strong at nearly $4.8 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion from the year end 2009. The increase is principally driven by $1.1 billion increase in total cash and largely explained by continued strong cash flow from operations and proceeds from capital market transactions of about $1.3 billion.
During the first three quarters of 2010, we also made debt repayments of $529 million, which include a reduction of a Term Loan B debt of $247 million and the early settlement of the common stock finance fund of $190 million and completed capital expenditures excluding those in NINA of $274 million, consisting largely of $119 million of normal maintenance and $132 million of environmental CapEx. 
Finally, before turning to the next slide, as you can see in the lower right, we continue to have ample capacity under our first lien to execute hedges on our base load business when appropriate. The first lien remains a very useful tool to both execute such hedges and preserve other sources of liquidity necessary to assist future growth.
Now turning to our 2010 full year guidance update on Slide 26. As a result of a strong performance of the business in the third quarter, we have narrowed our guidance to the upper end of the original range to $2.5 billion to $2.55 billion. At the same time, because of the increase in EBITDA expectations, lower than anticipated income tax of $50 million, $92 million of debt funding for the Indian River environmental work, all offset by an increase in collateral postings during the third quarter of $86 million, we have increased guidance for free cash flow before growth investments to about $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion. Meanwhile, we are lowering our free cash flow guidance for the full year to about $700 million to $750 million. The decrease is a result of increased growth investments of $225 million in the fourth quarter, which includes our El Segundo repowering project and the majority balance for projects, both previously announced and currently planned. 
Based on Wednesday's closing stock price of $20.4 and our updated outlook, the free cash flow before growth yield currently stands at between 24% to 25% or $4.77 to $4.97 per share.
Now turning to preliminary guidance on Slide 27. As you can see, we currently expect our full year 2011 consolidated EBITDA guidance to be in a range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Included in this guidance range are Wholesale expectations of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, which includes our announced acquisitions. In comparison to the current 2010 Wholesale EBITDA forecast, our Wholesale guidance for 2011 is largely impacted by low overall hedge prices, lower expected capacity prices in the Northeast and normalized weather. Somewhat offsetting these decreases are reductions in our anticipated O&M and G&A spend across the company, which is expected to come in 6% lower in 2011 than in 2010. As Mauricio discussed earlier, we are nearly 100% hedged for 2011 and are just confident of our forecasted results. As we look forward to our Wholesale business in 2012, we are currently in excess of 50% hedge, but at significantly higher prices in 2011 as indicated in our current SEC filings. 
Due to this position, coupled with the current commodity market conditions, we expect flat to marginally lower year-on-year Wholesale results in 2012 from 2011. For our Retail business in 2011, our current expectations, assuming normal weather, are an EBITDA range of between $480 million to $570 million. The decrease in 2011 guidance compared to current 2010 forecast is largely explained by lower unit margin Reliant Mass business. Reliant C&I business margins are also expected to decline but be partially offset by higher territorial reserve reflecting our continued dedication to this growing client base.
Finally, we expect Green Mountain Energy to contribute between $70 million to $80 million of EBITDA. As David discussed earlier, we are very excited about enhancing the growth prospects for new our Green Energy Retail business. 
We are similarly excited by our solar development prospects. And on Slide 28, this illustrates this potential. This slide represents our four-year net equity commitment to 500 megawatts of solar projects, both announced and planned the coming months, as well as their respective EBITDA contribution of $175 million by 2014. We are committed to investing in this financially value-enhancing promising pipeline of projects and look forward to sharing with you both our current progress and future opportunity as we have identified to extend our solar footprint.
On Slide 29, we have provided our projected year end cash position for 2011 of approximately $1.5 billion. Assume in this calculation, our cash flow estimates from guidance, the completion of outstanding acquisitions of $2.238 billion and expected debt repayment under our Term Loan B agreements. As such, when reviewing our capital allocation plans, we usually maintain a minimum cash balance of $700 million, largely for margin working capital, margin requirements, the timing of cash payments of interest, property taxes and the like as well as equity for the project that we have under construction throughout the year. Thus, in 2011, estimate a balance of about $785 million to allocate between share buybacks and further investments in high growth opportunities.
The decision to deploy these funds in 2011 will be dependent on a number of factors, such as the size of our restricted payment basket and continued availability of attractive projects to invest in. We would hope to update this allocation with improved precision at our 2010 year-end results call.
In closing, we are very proud of our ability to continue to deliver solid results despite the current commodity market climate. As we move forward, we remain committed to a prudent allocation of capital to create further opportunity for business growth and to return value to our shareholders. 
Now I'll pass it back to David for final comments."

The first is I think that we're demonstrating, as I said, even three years into the commodity price down cycle, we're showing uneven in these circumstances the company is demonstrating substantial free cash flow generation. 
Secondly, we do have investment opportunities lead by solar, which are very attractive in absolute terms and from a risk perspective and also are much shorter in terms of how soon they contribute to EBITDA because of the shorter construction cycle. And finally, to follow on Chris' last point, we do have substantial liquidity to deploy. And I think our track record over the last six years has indicated our ability to allocate and deploy capital in a manner that enhances the value of the company from medium to long term. So we hope and expect to continue to do that for the benefit of NRG shareholders.

We made it very clear from the beginning that we were not interested in owning the Midwest coal assets. And that was really a factor, two factors that caused us to feel that way. One, as you yourself mentioned, we have a significant amount of that in our own portfolio already. And the second thing, and we've been consistent about this ever since the response to the Exelon situation, as we consider the Midwest, in my seven years in this company, we have never been attracted to the Midwest as a place where we really want to be very active. And I would say that lack of interest in the Midwest has gotten greater over those years because we find the prospects for demand growth in the Midwest. In the Midwest, the country are more challenging than on the coast, and we also think that the Midwest market is being coal-on-coal competition for the most part. That's not very attractive to begin with. But also, we think it's subject to a risk from a build out of wind capacity coming out of it. And so that just wasn't our cup of tea.

But if the Dynegy transaction was defeated, a, obviously we would have no idea why would it appear, what the plan of Dynegy would be going forward and whether the assets that we had contracted to sale would be available for sale from someone else. If someone offered those assets to us, we were free of our obligation when were free from our obligation to Blackstone to conserve, we obviously would consider it. And to me, it's a blinding glimpse of the obvious. But given the change in the gas curves since August, we would be offering a lower price. I'm not going to talk about how much of a lower price. But there is another factor is that, we would have to be certain that whoever we were buying the assets from, the transaction was structured in a way that was bankruptcy remote, that we were not subject to a potential unwinding of the transaction due to fraudulent again. So that would be the potential obstacle as well. So the potential permutations of what might happen are so great. That's about all I can tell you right now. On the alternative use of the liquidity, I'll just repeat what we've said. We have a lot of investment opportunities. The Dynegy assets were particularly attractive to us, but they're not the only combined cycle power plant in the United States that are on the market today. And I previously stated in many meetings that I actually thought that the absolute best time to be buying combined cycle power plants most probably can be in the first part of 2012. And then of course, there's no hostility of redeploying the capital in terms of return of capital to stakeholders. And obviously, there is the possibility for share buyback. But as we did borrow money in August in order to finance the Dynegy transaction, there's also the possibility of paying down some debt. So, Chris, did you want to..."

But, however, if there's an upturn in gas, then we would expect to see an increasing result of around $60 million during the year. There's also some variability in our gas leak results. So with an increase in both gas prices and heat rates, there could be an upward revision of sort of $15 million for them. Also, as we said during the presentation, we have built-in a 6% decrease in costs across our O&M and G&A with about $1 billion of costs. If there are additional 1% to 2% decreasing cost, then that can obviously add to our results as well. And as David said, the management team, we're very much focused on the improvements we can squeeze out of the business. In retail, the range that we have in there contemplates certain load variability due to weather. And then also, if we see lower than expected attrition rates than we previously forecast, that would increase results. Also, if there is a decline in gas and this speaks sort of to the hedge against our Wholesale business, then that would most likely improve results for Reliant. And finally, it's very clear that we guided $500 million of EBITDA for 2010, and we've exceeded that by nearly $200 million we expect to for the year. So changes in weather and other changes to the exogenous markets, obviously, have a very large influence on those results."

But they demonstrated that over each of the last four or five years. And certainly, we think that as I mentioned in my comments, the Green Mountain can penetrate into markets that they haven't, and they've been moving outside of Texas. Their principal area of expansion to date had been in New York City, and we wanted to think in a sort of methodical way. But certainly, we think there are other markets in the Northeast that they can move into. But I think the most obvious thing is that as a small company in the C&I business, Green Mountain has focused on very, very small commercial customer. And our sense and I think there are a lot of anecdotes and data points on this, I'll spare you my Philadelphia cream cheese example, but -- so it seems that a growing number of businesses in the United States that are facing the American consumer are seeing the benefit of sending a Green Energy message. And we think that's the trend it's going to accelerate in, and we expect Green Mountain to be a big part of that trend. So we think there's multiple avenues for growth with Green Mountain, and really, the most challenging one is which ones we prioritize and focus on so we don't spread too fast."

But really, to me, it comes down to basically two sort of interconnected exits. One is the loan guaranty and the others  the that PPA obligation, and they're tied together because the PPA obligation has the condition of the loan guarantee. And, Jay, what I can say is it's always hard to predict the development business, and we clearly get subject to complete impact in Washington, where there's just no money that's appropriated for nuclear loan guarantees even though I think President Obama yesterday said that when I'm told, I didn't see despite when he was asked, which areas does our room for cooperation with the Republic, and I think I would sell a nuclear with the first thing of the second thing that you've said. And so in a sense, we should think that there's a scenario, where the election result is beneficial. But the nuclear needs, the loan guaranty appropriation, and if that doesn't happen, obviously, that's a very, very clear exit ramp. The slightly less clear exit ramp is, okay, we got the loan guaranty, but conditional on offtake and what I would tell you about that is that our sense because we're working the offtake question very hard right now is that within a few months of getting the loan guarantee, we'll know whether or not the offtake is going to happen. And if we don't get that within a few months, the fact we have always said to our shareholders that we would not go forward with STP 3 & 4 as a fully emerging plan. The amount of offtake that's being required by the DOE is pretty much the same as what that we were going to insist exist upon anyway. So the exact timing is uncertain, Jay. But I certainly expect that by the summer of 2011, assuming we got the loan guaranty well before that, we should know whether or not the offtake's going to happen or not going to happen."

Let me start by introducing my colleagues here participating in this presentation joined by Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Corporate Officer; and by Chris Schade, our Chief Financial Officer. Also available to",2813,"Thank you, Nahla, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by introducing my colleagues here participating in this presentation joined by Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Corporate Officer; and by Chris Schade, our Chief Financial Officer. Also available to answer your questions will be Jason Few, who runs the Reliant Retail Business on our behalf; and Chris Mose, who is responsible for commercial operations at NRG. 
So to begin, as we know, the Equity Markets, relentlessly forward-looking to some, I spent most of my time looking for it as well. I do want to pause for a moment, and you should be looking at Slide 3, if you're following along in the presentation on what this company accomplished in the third quarter of 2010 and what we are in the process of accomplishing here today. 
We had another exceptionally strong performance with our second best-ever quarter from an EBITDA perspective with an able assist from favorable weather and most importantly, thanks to our exceptional operating performance in robust hedged position. We largely mitigate the impact of gas prices trending relentlessly downward and keep rates moving sideways to post $777 million of adjusted EBITDA and $536 million of cash from operations. Certainly, our already strong current liquidity position was enhanced during the quarter by the bond financing that we did in August, but our liquidity was also strengthened as it has been for many course in a row by a very substantial contribution of free cash flow from the company's operating assets and businesses. 
Our strong performance year-to-date allows us to narrow our full year 2010 guidance to the top end of the present range. And while I had in my exploration from the beginning of the year to reach the $2.6 billion level, which would've put us flat against our record-shattering performance in 2009, I am nonetheless very proud given the gravitational pull of near-term gas prices that we are on our way to a performance in the $2.5 billion range. 
Indeed, as you may recall that 12 months ago in the course of announcing an initial EBITDA guidance for 2010 of $2.2 billion, I convey to you that as a management team, we were not satisfied with that number. And we made a commitment to you, our shareholders, that we would not rest until we had improved substantially on that number. I feel that under the circumstances, we have delivered on that commitment. 
Today, I'm here to make another set of commitment. As Chris will outline for you, we are initiating guidance for 2011 in the $2 billion range. Our financial prospects in the third year of commodity price recession, once again being subjected to the downward pressure of the significantly lower gas curve, our commitment to our shareholders again this year is that we will not rest until we have substantially improved our performance against the standard of this initial guidance. I can't promise you anything specific today with respect to our next fiscal year, which obviously doesn't begin for another two months. But if you check our record over the past six years, I think you will find that we have been pretty successful in exceeding expectations regarding our current operating and financial performance.
I'd like to devote the remainder of my time to comment on a few important comments of our strategic positioning of this company, Many of these areas of our business figure primarily in the thoughts of our investors since they have been introduced recently or will be in the near future. The company's strategic approach is in general terms depicted on Slide 4, five conventional priorities and five transformational green energy priorities. I feel that we've made significant progress against all kind of these priorities year-to-date. And during Q&A, I would be happy to talk about any or all of that. But due to time constraints, I'm going to limit my prepared remarks to the four Rs: reactors, renewables, retail and CCT acquisitions at a significant discounts or replacement costs.
Our goal in respect to our Conventional business, as shown on Slide  5, is to build our business on the foundation of a multi-fuel, across-the-merit-order, geographically advantage generation portfolio at scale in each of our core markets. And in our principal market, which of course is Texas, matching up that diversified generation portfolio with the Retail Electricity business also at scale. As such, in this area, the four Rs are where much of our opportunity lay. In the case of new advanced nuclear power, there are two more Rs which are important. The first R is replacement power. Our nation's solid fuel base load fleet is very old and rapidly getting older as little to no new base load generation is being built. The oldest quartile of baseload generation this country needs to be replaced over the next decade and given the development lead times for solid fuel generation, our view is that those of us who get started now will be advantaged. 
The final R stands for renaissance, and it's not yet clear how robust the nuclear renaissance will be here in the United States. But it is very clear that the world at large is well down the path towards a global nuclear renaissance worth hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions, and the owner or developers of the first new nuclear plant in the United States are going to have a very beneficial first mover advantage in that nuclear renaissance.
But of course, the secure first mover advantage of the nuclear renaissance you actually have to have a first mover project. The status of STP 3 & 4 has not changed significantly since our previous quarterly call. The lack of visible progress was to be expected since the gating item for most meaningful steps forward on the project, such as additional equity partners, has been and continue to be the DOE loan guaranty process and the related issue of funding appropriations. Since Congress has been in business for most of the last three months, it's not surprising that there has been no development on the additional appropriation. 
Nonetheless, significant progress continue to be made on all key fronts below the surface. From the perspective of NRG shareholders, we believe you should evaluate the present arrangement with respect to STP as illustrated on Slide 6 as follows. NRG has a limited obligation at currently a $1.5 million a month, an obligation to our partners to contribute to ongoing development spend until the loan guaranty is received and accepted. Nonetheless, recognizing NRG's very substantial financial contribution to the project development today of approximately $315 million, including a significant amount, which was funded during the first half of this year as a result of NRG assuming CPS share of the overall development spend, the project remains fully on schedule. This is due to the much appreciated stepped up contribution of our partners or, and we remain very much in contention for the valuable nuclear loan guaranty from the Department of Energy. As such, during this phase, the STP 3 & 4 development should be perceived by earnings from shareholders as a low cost option on a very large benefit opportunity with clearly defined exit ramps.
Of course, the news affecting nuclear development in the United States during the past several weeks has had little to do with STP and much to do with the Calvert Cliffs project and the loan guarantees we issued cited by Constellation as their reason for withdrawing from the project. What I would tell you is that notwithstanding the superficial similarities between the two projects, and this is shown on the left side of Slide 7, the two projects actually are structured very differently. Obviously, they are in different markets with different rates of projected base load growth, but also they involve different risk allocation with respect to technology, completion risk and merchant offtake. We do not yet know precisely how these differences will play into the government's analysis of the loan guaranty fee for STP, but the government is well aware of the structural differences because they have been discussed at length by us with the DOE. 
As I am trying to depict on the right side of this page, we believe we're in the midst of the final stage of the government's determination of this issue. And so hopefully, we will be in the position to advise our investors within a few weeks of the outcome.
Moving on Slide 8. We have transaction spending to purchase high efficiency load volume CCGTs in three of our four core regions, and we continue to push towards a prompt closing of these transactions. We are highly confident that Cottonwood will close in the very near future and that while Cottonwood in and of itself will be fairly unspectacular in its near-term contribution to EBITDA, given the subdued commodity price environment, cottonwood will play in the essential role in enabling us to renew the portfolio long-term offtake arrangements that South Central has with its key co-op customers, recognizing that a significant number of these contracts are up for renewal in 2014.
As to the Dynegy assets, we remain very comfortable with the bargain we struck back in August, and we want the transaction to proceed on its present terms. With the commodity price curve for natural gas, bumping along its cyclical bottom, it is a good time to acquire generation assets. We are highly confident if we get the opportunity to close the Dynegy transactions. And over the entire commodity price cycle, our investment will be money well spent and that this portfolio, headlined by the strategically and geographically advance Moss Landing 1 and 2 will be a successful investment on behalf of NRG shareholders. 
If the Blackstone acquisition does not proceed and the opportunity to buy the set of CCGTs disappears, we are equally confident that we have very attractive alternative uses for the liquidity that will be freed up. Not only is it a good time to invest in well located CCGT that price is well below replacement cost, it's a good time to invest in low risk, high return solar projects, and that's something I'm about to talk about. And It's always a good time particularly at the current depressed price levels to buy NRG stock. 
Of course, our stock price performance seems to be constrained by the drop in gas prices and the flattening of the gas curve more generally. However, that fundamental connection between natural gas prices and the financial prospects of ITPs hence overlook the fact that our Reliant Retail business is countercyclical to natural gas, and the $600 million of year-to-date EBITDA that we are reporting today demonstrates the resilience of that countercyclicality. We have previously guided the markets to think of reliance in our hands as a $300 million year ""mid-cycle business"" for the course. That concept is very broad brush and indeed somewhat meaningless outside of financial modeling since in my 20 years experience, the mid-cycle never seems to last for more than a millisecond either in the natural gas or the key rate market. What we have tried to depict on Slide 9 is a slightly more nuanced and hopefully a significantly more accurate view of the earnings power of Reliant as a function of the natural gas price cycle.
The upside of this analysis is that rather than thinking about Reliant as a $300 million year EBITDA mid-cycle business, we believe the markets should think of Reliant as a $400 million to $500 million year EBITDA business in all flat to modestly probing gas price environments. When natural gas prices are sharply decreasing, Reliant's earnings power conspite above $600 million a year. When natural gas prices are sharply increasing, Reliant's earnings power will dip below $400 million a year, with $300 million being more of a baseline, absent some extraordinary event. 
Moving on to our green initiatives on Slide 10. Our purchase of Green Mountain Energy, has received all necessary approvals and is ready to be closed in the very near future. As a general comment, I want to emphasize how important I think Green Mountain and the Green Mountain brand is going to be in transforming NRG's alternative energy future by trying to get to our various renewable generation businesses and initiatives and tying them to Green Mountain's own substantial and growing green energy customers. 
In the fast-growing world of green energy, as depicted on Slide 11, there is no brand that comes within a country mile of Green Mountain. As a stand-alone business, divorced from any association with NRG's renewables project or any support of NRG's commercial operation theme, Green Mountain is a solid business with a healthy EBITDA contribution relative to the purchase price. As such, even on its own, it's a welcome addition to the portfolio. But beyond that, Green Mountain will allow NRG to offer a match green wholesale green retail product to green energy consumers that's truly unique. And this is important because while the idea of top down imposition of a carbon regime on the American public is dead on arrival in the New Washington, the American consumer planetory sustainability is going to continue. And indeed, in my opinion, it accelerate, lead by thought leaders of the next generation. 
Success with Green Mountain for us starts with a successful integration. At NRG, our track record of quick, efficient and effective integration of new acquisitions is one of the things I'm proud of at this company, both in the case of Texas Genco and Reliant Retail, we've demonstrated that complex businesses could be brought into the NRG camp in a matter that not only was non-destructive but which enable the newly-acquired businesses to equal or exceed their business objectives, virtually form the very beginning. The single key to our success in this regard is our emphasis on enabling the new businesses to continue to focus on what they do best while letting us take care of the rest. In the weeks ahead, we will be working closely with Green Mountain on the integration of their business enterprise into NRG, focusing on our the priorities listed on Slide 12. We intend to protect, preserve and extend our green identity to secure their core financial performance and to prioritize their opportunities for profitable expansion to new regions and products but particularly in respect to new market segments. We believe NRG can ably assist Green Mountain to move further up the C&I ladder to sell to bigger and more expensive retail orientations, which themselves want to short up their own sustainability credentials with their own customer base. In short, I'm extremely excited on what Green Mountain and NRG can accomplish working together. So you should, as they say, stay tuned.
Turning to the Wholesale side of our green equation on Slide 13, we have talked about the immense opportunity we see in the solar space. But so far, it has been mainly anticipatory. What you already have begun to see over the past couple of weeks with the announcement of construction at Avanol and Ivanpha is that our development effort is beginning to bear a fruit. If all goes according to plan, you should expect to hear significantly more in the weeks to come as conservatively more solar projects to our development pipeline complete the usual development process and proceed into the construction phase.
As we've stated previously and repeat on Slide 14, we feel that our solar investment strategy, being a validly multi-technology, multi-vendor and initially focused on the utility-sized projects with very long-term PPAs, is the precisely right strategy to capitalize on the opportunities and incentives currently available to the solar industry. The equity return on these projects, particularly when you consider the lack of merchant risk, the complete absence of environmental risk and the minimal completion risk and construction time, are as attractive on a risk-adjusted basis as any that I have seen over the course of my 20 years in this industry. 
And finally, before handing over to Mauricio, let me emphasize that we are mindful that our solid financial performance year-to-date in 2010 and our successful positioning of the company to take advantage of the very attractive growth opportunities that will arise as our industry transforms itself in response to the society's demand for sustainability have not yet translated into improving our share price. And as a consequence, our shareholders have suffered. We will do everything within our power to bring about that improvement, and we believe that the main thing we can do is execute on our plan as effectively and as quickly as possible. As listed on Slide 15, we have a great deal on our plate over the next six to nine months, and we hope that successful execution against these priorities will serve as a springboard for share price appreciation. 
Mauricio?

As you all know, the third quarter is critical for both our generation and retail segments.

As you all know, the third quarter is critical for both our generation and retail segments. This summer, we experienced some of the warmest weather on record across our Northeast, South Central and Texas regions. I am very pleased to report that we had another strong quarter from both an operational and financial perspective. 
Slide 17 highlights a few of the accomplishments achieved during the third quarter. As always, we remain focused on safety across the organization. And for the third quarter, we posted an ocean recordable rate of 0.88, a significant improvement from last summer and just shy of subsea levels. Our top performance improved across our entire fleet for the third quarter. 
Starting with our coal plant performance, the equivalent availability factor or EAF increased to 94.9% in the third quarter from 92.3% for the same period in 2009. This improvement was lead by our Limestone and facilities. Nuclear generation at STP had another outstanding quarter with 99% availability, and our oil and gas portfolio responded to the significant fees experienced in Texas, South Central and the Northeast by starting over 2,500x with a 99% reliability during these critical summer months. 
With respect to our construction projects, the Indian River environmental control project, continues to be on track and within budget to begin operations in January 2012. Our middle pound repowering project to build 200 megawatts of peaking capacity is somewhat scheduled to be operational by the summer of 2011. This is the second repowering project in our New England fleet. Our first project at Devon have been running successfully since it began operation this past summer. 
The BBA for El Segundo energy complex in California received CPUC approval in October. Demolition of work has started to make room for the construction of the new units, which I expected to be in service by the summer of 2013. Our core energy program stands at $83 million year-to-date and is on track to achieve the $98 million free cash flow goal for the year. Also, we have already identified projects and cost savings that will bring this program to completion by achieving the full goal of $150 million ahead of our 2012 for regional base. 
Finally, our commercial operations group took advantage of some market opportunity during this summer to increase our hedge profile in 2011, which I will discuss in more detail later in the presentation. In addition, they have successfully managed our retail supply under volatile market conditions, delivering strong financial results for two consecutive summers.
Moving on to our client operations on Slide 18. Net generation increased by 8% this quarter over last year. This increase came primarily from our northeast plants, which benefited from lower than normal weather and a decreasing coal to gas switching, which was most prevalent in 2009. Also, nuclear generation was higher due to much improved availability from the third quarter of last year. Our base line portfolio, which includes both our coal and nuclear assets experienced significant reliability improvements during the third quarter compared to last year. Limestone and Indian River led the cold fleet with a clear and forced outage rates of 2.6% and 4%, respectively. 
Turning to our retail operations on Slide 19. We experienced another solid performance during the third quarter. Record weather in August and September across Texas created an opportunity to deliver higher volumes and stronger margin from our Mass segments. The Mass segment drove significant improvement in this customer attrition with the launch of the advertising campaign and innovative products. In addition, we maintained our low customer complaint rate through strong performance in retail operations. We continue to balance customer count and pricing to deliver higher than run rate margins that are more sustainable in the long term.
In the C&I segment, we continue to improve win rates during the third quarter and extended the terms and diversity of our portfolio. Reliant remains the largest C&I provider in Texas, and we continue to leverage the strength of NRG to provide innovative products and services for our business customers. In summary, we're optimizing margin and customer count by delivering innovative products and excellent customer service. 
Turning to our hedge profile and commodity sensitivities on Slide 20. As illustrated in the chart on the upper left, we had increased our hedge profile for 2011 to 96% from 86% last quarter. This is consistent with our view that the gas markets continue to be under pressure given the high and resilient domestic production levels despite of low gas prices. 
With gas producers beginning to show some drilling restraint, hedged positions rolling off and indications that drilling to both acreage may be ending, we have chosen to remain relatively open beyond 2011 to benefit from an expected recovery in the gas markets. If we decide to add additional hedges in the other years, we would likely lean towards using option structures that allow us to participate in some upside, while protecting the portfolio for further decreases in gas prices. With respect to retail, we have increased our price, though, to 57% in 2011 from 50% in the second quarter. We continue to match as much generational load as possible to strike maximum synergies between our Retail and Wholesale portfolios.
In order to match our incremental power hedges, our growth hedges increased over 2011 from 78% last quarter to 88% as illustrated on the upper right chart. We also remain well hedged in terms of coal transportation for some time. We continue to limit our commodity price sensitivity in 2011 as illustrated in the lower left chart with 2012 to 2013 through '15 largely unchanged. 
Moving on to Slide 21. The quarter-on-quarter demand growth for continues to the positive trend for the weather normalized load growth for the year at around 2%. In August, set multiple consecutive big loads and achieved a new all-time record big load of 65.7 kilowatts, an increase of almost 4% from the previous record set in July of last year. In PJM, the weather normalized load growth continues to be fairly present. However, the warmer than normal weather drove significant load increases across the Northeast, and total load off was up 7% to 9% higher as compared to third quarter of 2009. In Texas, recovery remains to be well supported during the first half of the year. There's a continued robust demand, higher supply, time retirement and the continued lack of capital for merchant projects. We expect the Texas market to continue showing robust fundamentals.
Moving on to the environmental front. 2011 will provide a lot more clarity around environmental growth and requirement for our facility. As we have mentioned in previous presentations, we currently have a plan to invest approximately $700 million over the next  four years in the environmental projects, failure to comply with these future regulations. Starting with Cedar, the proposed rules does not require additional capital for compliance. With respect to MACT, our client considers mercury controls on local units. While a worst-case scenario to control acid gas could result in additional environmental capital for 1,900 megawatts at Parish and 1,500 megawatt at Big Cajun. We don't expect this to be the likely scenario. 
In terms of master pulling, intake qualifications on reborrowing are expected to achieve desired results. For example, originating targets today with extreme qualifications at our Arcotil [ph] plant in New York. Finally, NRG does not face the challenges of converting from web surface implants to landfills as we have assets also at all our core facilities. 
Our near-term operational priorities are listed on Slide 22. As we move into 2011, we remain focused on excellence in safety and operational performance. We will continue to constantly evaluate the impact of various environmental regulations and our term maintenance and capital spend, particularly in the face of a challenging commodity price environment and determine the best cost benefit decision for each of our assets. 
With that, I will turn it over to Chris, who will discuss our financial results.

Good morning, and thank you all for joining our discussion of NRG's third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Beginning with Slide 24, our financial results remained strong with $777 million of adjusted EBITDA for the third qu",1555,"Thank you, Mauricio. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our discussion of NRG's third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Beginning with Slide 24, our financial results remained strong with $777 million of adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter and $2.071 billion of adjusted EBITDA year-to-date. During the quarter, Reliant Energy contributed $209 million of adjusted EBITDA to our results compared to $306 million in EBITDA for the third quarter of '09. This difference is largely explained by lower margins on newly acquired customers and existing customer renewals as well as lower customer accounts. 
Meanwhile, the Wholesale business contribute $568 million of adjusted EBITDA during Q3. The $32 million decline compared to Q3 2009 Wholesale performance can be largely attributed to the following. In the Northeast region, lower base load hedges were partially offset by a 37% increase in generation due to warmer than expected weather during the quarter. In Texas, a 5% increase in generation and the benefits of lower operations and maintenance costs were offset by a 20% increase in fuel costs, driven by new coal transportation contract at our Parish facility. Meanwhile, the south-central region benefited from the addition of a new contract with the regional municipality, leading to a 17% increase in megawatt hour sold and a 23% increase in the average realized energy price per megawatt hour. Also contributing to the results of south-central region was an 8% increase in load due in part to warmer weather. 
Turning to year-to-date results. Reliant Energy contributed $594 million of EBITDA, $58 million greater than 2009 EBITDA of $536 million. Excluding the $227 million of EBITDA generated in the first four months of 2010 for comparative year-to-date analysis since the acquisition was completed in May of '09, EBITDA results were lower by $169 million. This decline is driven by a 19% decline in mass margins, which were the result of price reductions following the acquisition and lower margins and customer renewal and acquisitions, reflective of the current competitive marketplace. 
The Wholesale business year-to-date generated $1.477 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $116 million lower as compared to the first three quarters of 2009. The comparative year-to-date decline is largely explained by lower base load hedges in the Northeast, lower margins in Texas, caused by higher transportation costs, offset somewhat by better contributions from the south-central region. At September 30, the company's liquidity position stood at approximately $4.8 billion. Impacting this liquidity position during the third quarter were the following items. We repurchased $130  million of NRG shares at a volume weighted average cost of $20.80 per share. These shares, combined with the $50 million repurchase in the second quarter, brings the 2010 share repurchase program to a close at $180 million or 8.4 million shares purchase at a volume weighted average cost of $21.26 per share. 
On August 20, the company issued $1.1 billion of 8.25% senior notes due 2020, with the proceeds we use for general corporate purposes, including a funding of a recently announced acquisitions. And on October 12, NRG completed $190 million tax exempt financing in relation to the environmental work to be completed at our Indian River facility, which is not yet reflected in current liquidity. The company closed the third quarter in a strong financial position to complete the three recently announced acquisitions of Dynegy assets, Cottonwood and Green Mountain Energy totaling $2.238 billion. 
Now turn to Slide 25. As I mentioned a moment ago, total liquidity, excluding funds deposited by hedged counter-parties remained strong at nearly $4.8 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion from the year end 2009. The increase is principally driven by $1.1 billion increase in total cash and largely explained by continued strong cash flow from operations and proceeds from capital market transactions of about $1.3 billion.
During the first three quarters of 2010, we also made debt repayments of $529 million, which include a reduction of a Term Loan B debt of $247 million and the early settlement of the common stock finance fund of $190 million and completed capital expenditures excluding those in NINA of $274 million, consisting largely of $119 million of normal maintenance and $132 million of environmental CapEx. 
Finally, before turning to the next slide, as you can see in the lower right, we continue to have ample capacity under our first lien to execute hedges on our base load business when appropriate. The first lien remains a very useful tool to both execute such hedges and preserve other sources of liquidity necessary to assist future growth.
Now turning to our 2010 full year guidance update on Slide 26. As a result of a strong performance of the business in the third quarter, we have narrowed our guidance to the upper end of the original range to $2.5 billion to $2.55 billion. At the same time, because of the increase in EBITDA expectations, lower than anticipated income tax of $50 million, $92 million of debt funding for the Indian River environmental work, all offset by an increase in collateral postings during the third quarter of $86 million, we have increased guidance for free cash flow before growth investments to about $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion. Meanwhile, we are lowering our free cash flow guidance for the full year to about $700 million to $750 million. The decrease is a result of increased growth investments of $225 million in the fourth quarter, which includes our El Segundo repowering project and the majority balance for projects, both previously announced and currently planned. 
Based on Wednesday's closing stock price of $20.4 and our updated outlook, the free cash flow before growth yield currently stands at between 24% to 25% or $4.77 to $4.97 per share.
Now turning to preliminary guidance on Slide 27. As you can see, we currently expect our full year 2011 consolidated EBITDA guidance to be in a range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Included in this guidance range are Wholesale expectations of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, which includes our announced acquisitions. In comparison to the current 2010 Wholesale EBITDA forecast, our Wholesale guidance for 2011 is largely impacted by low overall hedge prices, lower expected capacity prices in the Northeast and normalized weather. Somewhat offsetting these decreases are reductions in our anticipated O&M and G&A spend across the company, which is expected to come in 6% lower in 2011 than in 2010. As Mauricio discussed earlier, we are nearly 100% hedged for 2011 and are just confident of our forecasted results. As we look forward to our Wholesale business in 2012, we are currently in excess of 50% hedge, but at significantly higher prices in 2011 as indicated in our current SEC filings. 
Due to this position, coupled with the current commodity market conditions, we expect flat to marginally lower year-on-year Wholesale results in 2012 from 2011. For our Retail business in 2011, our current expectations, assuming normal weather, are an EBITDA range of between $480 million to $570 million. The decrease in 2011 guidance compared to current 2010 forecast is largely explained by lower unit margin Reliant Mass business. Reliant C&I business margins are also expected to decline but be partially offset by higher territorial reserve reflecting our continued dedication to this growing client base.
Finally, we expect Green Mountain Energy to contribute between $70 million to $80 million of EBITDA. As David discussed earlier, we are very excited about enhancing the growth prospects for new our Green Energy Retail business. 
We are similarly excited by our solar development prospects. And on Slide 28, this illustrates this potential. This slide represents our four-year net equity commitment to 500 megawatts of solar projects, both announced and planned the coming months, as well as their respective EBITDA contribution of $175 million by 2014. We are committed to investing in this financially value-enhancing promising pipeline of projects and look forward to sharing with you both our current progress and future opportunity as we have identified to extend our solar footprint.
On Slide 29, we have provided our projected year end cash position for 2011 of approximately $1.5 billion. Assume in this calculation, our cash flow estimates from guidance, the completion of outstanding acquisitions of $2.238 billion and expected debt repayment under our Term Loan B agreements. As such, when reviewing our capital allocation plans, we usually maintain a minimum cash balance of $700 million, largely for margin working capital, margin requirements, the timing of cash payments of interest, property taxes and the like as well as equity for the project that we have under construction throughout the year. Thus, in 2011, estimate a balance of about $785 million to allocate between share buybacks and further investments in high growth opportunities.
The decision to deploy these funds in 2011 will be dependent on a number of factors, such as the size of our restricted payment basket and continued availability of attractive projects to invest in. We would hope to update this allocation with improved precision at our 2010 year-end results call.
In closing, we are very proud of our ability to continue to deliver solid results despite the current commodity market climate. As we move forward, we remain committed to a prudent allocation of capital to create further opportunity for business growth and to return value to our shareholders. 
Now I'll pass it back to David for final comments.

Before we open the line for questions, let me just make three quick points for you to keep in mind. The first is I think that we're demonstrating, as I said, even three years into the commodity price down cycle, we're showing uneven in these circumstances the company is demonstrating substantial free cash flow generation. 
Secondly, we do have investment opportunities lead by solar, which are very attractive in absolute terms and from a risk perspective and also are much shorter in terms of how soon they contribute to EBITDA because of the shorter construction cycle. And finally, to follow on Chris' last point, we do have substantial liquidity to deploy. And I think our track record over the last six years has indicated our ability to allocate and deploy capital in a manner that enhances the value of the company from medium to long term. So we hope and expect to continue to do that for the benefit of NRG shareholders. 
So with that, Zumira, we'd be happy to take any questions that you have on the line.

I mean, why did we not go after the full company of Dynegy, I would say that we didn't feel that with the exposure that the company has in terms of the call assets, and I think that you know from the SEC filings that Dynegy is listed in terms of the description of the discussions that occurred with that. We made it very clear from the beginning that we were not interested in owning the Midwest coal assets. And that was really a factor, two factors that caused us to feel that way. One, as you yourself mentioned, we have a significant amount of that in our own portfolio already. And the second thing, and we've been consistent about this ever since the response to the Exelon situation, as we consider the Midwest, in my seven years in this company, we have never been attracted to the Midwest as a place where we really want to be very active. And I would say that lack of interest in the Midwest has gotten greater over those years because we find the prospects for demand growth in the Midwest. In the Midwest, the country are more challenging than on the coast, and we also think that the Midwest market is being coal-on-coal competition for the most part. That's not very attractive to begin with. But also, we think it's subject to a risk from a build out of wind capacity coming out of it. And so that just wasn't our cup of tea. And obviously, those a big part of the overall value of Dynegy.

If someone offered those assets to us, we were free of our obligation when were free from our obligation to Blackstone to conserve, we obviously would consider it. And to me, it's a blinding glimpse of the obvious. But given the change in the gas curves since August, we would be offering a lower price. I'm not going to talk about how much of a lower price. But there is another factor is that, we would have to be certain that whoever we were buying the assets from, the transaction was structured in a way that was bankruptcy remote, that we were not subject to a potential unwinding of the transaction due to fraudulent again. So that would be the potential obstacle as well. So the potential permutations of what might happen are so great. That's about all I can tell you right now. On the alternative use of the liquidity, I'll just repeat what we've said. We have a lot of investment opportunities. The Dynegy assets were particularly attractive to us, but they're not the only combined cycle power plant in the United States that are on the market today. And I previously stated in many meetings that I actually thought that the absolute best time to be buying combined cycle power plants most probably can be in the first part of 2012. And then of course, there's no hostility of redeploying the capital in terms of return of capital to stakeholders. And obviously, there is the possibility for share buyback.

But, however, if there's an upturn in gas, then we would expect to see an increasing result of around $60 million during the year. There's also some variability in our gas leak results. So with an increase in both gas prices and heat rates, there could be an upward revision of sort of $15 million for them. Also, as we said during the presentation, we have built-in a 6% decrease in costs across our O&M and G&A with about $1 billion of costs. If there are additional 1% to 2% decreasing cost, then that can obviously add to our results as well. And as David said, the management team, we're very much focused on the improvements we can squeeze out of the business. In retail, the range that we have in there contemplates certain load variability due to weather. And then also, if we see lower than expected attrition rates than we previously forecast, that would increase results. Also, if there is a decline in gas and this speaks sort of to the hedge against our Wholesale business, then that would most likely improve results for Reliant. And finally, it's very clear that we guided $500 million of EBITDA for 2010, and we've exceeded that by nearly $200 million we expect to for the year. So changes in weather and other changes to the exogenous markets, obviously, have a very large influence on those results.

But certainly, we think there are other markets in the Northeast that they can move into. But I think the most obvious thing is that as a small company in the C&I business, Green Mountain has focused on very, very small commercial customer. And our sense and I think there are a lot of anecdotes and data points on this, I'll spare you my Philadelphia cream cheese example, but -- so it seems that a growing number of businesses in the United States that are facing the American consumer are seeing the benefit of sending a Green Energy message. And we think that's the trend it's going to accelerate in, and we expect Green Mountain to be a big part of that trend. So we think there's multiple avenues for growth with Green Mountain, and really, the most challenging one is which ones we prioritize and focus on so we don't spread too fast.

But really, to me, it comes down to basically two sort of interconnected exits. One is the loan guaranty and the others  the that PPA obligation, and they're tied together because the PPA obligation has the condition of the loan guarantee. And, Jay, what I can say is it's always hard to predict the development business, and we clearly get subject to complete impact in Washington, where there's just no money that's appropriated for nuclear loan guarantees even though I think President Obama yesterday said that when I'm told, I didn't see despite when he was asked, which areas does our room for cooperation with the Republic, and I think I would sell a nuclear with the first thing of the second thing that you've said. And so in a sense, we should think that there's a scenario, where the election result is beneficial. But the nuclear needs, the loan guaranty appropriation, and if that doesn't happen, obviously, that's a very, very clear exit ramp. The slightly less clear exit ramp is, okay, we got the loan guaranty, but conditional on offtake and what I would tell you about that is that our sense because we're working the offtake question very hard right now is that within a few months of getting the loan guarantee, we'll know whether or not the offtake is going to happen. And if we don't get that within a few months, the fact we have always said to our shareholders that we would not go forward with STP 3 & 4 as a fully emerging plan. The amount of offtake that's being required by the DOE is pretty much the same as what that we were going to insist exist upon anyway. So the exact timing is uncertain, Jay. But I certainly expect that by the summer of 2011, assuming we got the loan guaranty well before that, we should know whether or not the offtake's going to happen or not going to happen.

Let me start by introducing my colleagues here participating in this presentation joined by Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Corporate Officer; and by Chris Schade, our Chief Financial Officer. Also available to",2815,"Thank you, Nahla, and good morning, everyone.

Also available to answer your questions will be Jason Few, who runs the Reliant Retail Business on our behalf; and Chris Mose [sp], who is responsible for commercial operations at NRG. 
So to begin, as we know, the Equity Markets are relentlessly forward-looking, so I’m going to spend most of my time looking forward as well. I do want to pause for a moment, and you should be looking at Slide 3 if you're following along in the presentation, on what this company accomplished in the third quarter of 2010 and what we are in the process of accomplishing here today. 
We had another exceptionally strong performance with our second best-ever quarter from an EBITDA perspective with an able assist from favorable weather but most importantly, thanks to our exceptional operating performance in robust hedge position. We largely mitigated the impact of gas prices trending relentlessly downward and keep rates moving sideways to post $777 million of adjusted EBITDA and $536 million of cash from operations. Certainly, our already strong current liquidity position was enhanced during the quarter by the bond financing that we did in August, but our liquidity was also strengthened as it has been for many quarters in a row by a very substantial contribution of free cash flow from the company's operating assets and businesses. 
Our strong performance year-to-date allows us to narrow our full-year 2010 guidance to the top end of the present range. And while I’ve had in my aspirations from the beginning of the year to reach the $2.6 billion level, which would've put us flat against our record-shattering performance in 2009, I am nonetheless very proud given the gravitational pull of near-term gas prices that we are on our way to a performance in the $2.5 billion range. 
Indeed, you may recall that 12 months ago in the course of announcing an initial EBITDA guidance for 2010 of $2.2 billion, I conveyed to you that as a management team, we were not satisfied with that number. And we made a commitment to you, our shareholders, that we would not rest until we had improved substantially on that number. I feel that under the circumstances, we have delivered on that commitment. 
Today, I'm here to make another set of commitments. As Chris will outline for you, we are initiating guidance for 2011 in the $2 billion range. Our financial prospects in this, the third year of commodity price recession, once again being subjected to the downward pressure of the significantly lower gas curve. Our commitment to our shareholders again this year is that we will not rest until we have substantially improved our performance against the standard of this initial guidance. I can't promise you anything specific today with respect to our next fiscal year, which obviously doesn't begin for another two months. But if you check our record over the past six years, I think you will find that we have been pretty successful in exceeding expectations regarding our current operating and financial performance.
I want to devote the remainder of my time to comment on a few important components of our strategic positioning of this company, Many of these areas of our business figure primarily in the thoughts of our investors since they have been in the news recently or will be in the near future. The company's strategic approach is in general terms depicted on Slide 4, five conventional priorities and five transformational green energy priorities. I feel that we've made significant progress against all 10 of these priorities year-to-date. And during Q&A, I would be happy to talk about any or all of them. But due to time constraints, I'm going to limit my prepared remarks to the four Rs: reactors, renewables, retail and CCT acquisitions at a significant discounts or replacement costs.
Our goal in respect to our Conventional business, as shown on Slide 5, is to build our business on the foundation of a multi-fuel, across-the-merit-order, geographically advantaged generation portfolio at scale in each of our core markets. And in our principal market, which of course is Texas, matching up that diversified generation portfolio with the Retail Electricity business also at scale. As such, in this area, the four Rs are where much of our opportunity lay. In the case of new advanced nuclear power, there are two more Rs which are important. The first R is replacement power. Our nation's solid fuel base load fleet is very old and rapidly getting older as little to no new base load generation is being built. The oldest quartile of baseload generation this country needs to be replaced over the next decade and given the development lead times for solid fuel generation, our view is that those of us who get started now will be advantaged. 
The final R stands for renaissance, and it's not yet clear how robust the nuclear renaissance will be here in the United States. But it is very clear that the world at large is well down the path towards a global nuclear renaissance worth hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions, and the owner or developers of the first new nuclear plants in the United States are going to have a very beneficial first mover advantage in that nuclear renaissance.
But of course, the secure first mover advantage of the nuclear renaissance you actually have to have a first mover project. The status of STP 3 & 4 has not changed significantly since our previous quarterly call. The lack of visible progress was to be expected since the gating item for most meaningful steps forward on the project, such as additional equity partners, has been and continues to be the DOE loan guaranty process and the related issue of funding appropriations. Since Congress has been in recess for most of the last three months, it's not surprising that there has been no development on the additional appropriations. 
Nonetheless, significant progress continued to be made on all key fronts below the surface. From the perspective of NRG shareholders, we believe you should evaluate the present arrangement with respect to STP as illustrated on Slide 6 as follows. NRG has a limited obligation at currently a $1.5 million a month, an obligation to our partners, to contribute to ongoing development spend until the loan guaranty is received and accepted. Nonetheless, recognizing NRG's very substantial financial contribution to the project development to date of approximately $315 million, including a significant amount, which was funded during the first half of this year as a result of NRG assuming CPS’s share of the overall development spend, the project remains fully on schedule. This is due to the much appreciated stepped-up contribution of our partner Toshiba Corp. And we remain very much in contention for the valuable nuclear loan guaranty from the Department of Energy. As such, during this phase, the STP 3 & 4 development should be perceived by energy shareholders as a low cost option on a very large benefit opportunity with clearly defined exit ramps.
Of course, the news affecting nuclear development in the United States during the past several weeks has had little to do with STP and much to do with the Calvert Cliffs project and the loan guarantees fee issue cited by Constellation as their reason for withdrawing from the project. What I would tell you is that notwithstanding the superficial similarities between the two projects, and this is shown on the left side of Slide 7, the two projects actually are structured very differently. Obviously, they are in different markets with different rates of projected base load growth, but also they involve different risk allocation with respect to technology, completion risk and merchant off-take. We do not yet know precisely how these differences will play into the government's analysis of the loan guarantee fee for STP, but the government is well aware of the structural differences because they have been discussed at length by us with the DOE. 
As I am trying to depict on the right side of this page, we believe we're in the midst of the final stage of the government's determination of this issue. And so hopefully, we will be in the position to advise our investors within a few weeks of the outcome.
Moving on, on Slide 8. We have transactions spending to purchase high efficiency, load following CCGTs in three of our four core regions, and we continue to push towards a prompt closing of these transactions. We are highly confident that Cottonwood will close in the very near future and that while Cottonwood in and of itself will be fairly unspectacular in its near-term contribution to EBITDA, given the subdued commodity price environment, cottonwood will play an essential role in enabling us to renew the portfolio long-term off-take of arrangements that South Central has with its key co-op customers, recognizing that a significant number of these contracts are up for renewal in 2014.
As to the Dynegy assets, we remain very comfortable with the bargain we struck back in August, and we want the transaction to proceed on its present terms. With the commodity price curve for natural gas, bumping along its cyclical bottom, it is a good time to acquire generation assets. We are highly confident if we get the opportunity to close the Dynegy transactions that over the entire commodity price cycle, our investment will be money well spent and that this portfolio, headlined by the strategically and geographically advance Moss Landing 1 and 2, will be a successful investment on behalf of NRG shareholders. 
If the Blackstone acquisition does not proceed and the opportunity to buy this set of CCGTs disappears, we are equally confident that we have very attractive alternative uses for the liquidity that will be freed up. Not only is it a good time to invest in well located CCGTs at price is well below replacement cost, it's a good time to invest in low risk, high return solar projects, and that's something I'm about to talk about. And it's always a good time particularly at the current depressed price levels to buy NRG stock. 
Of course, our stock price performance seems to be constrained by the drop in gas prices and the flattening of the gas curve more generally. However, that fundamental connection between natural gas prices and the financial prospects of ITPs tends to overlook the fact that our Reliant Retail business is countercyclical to natural gas, and the $600 million of year-to-date EBITDA that we are reporting today demonstrates the resilience of that counter-cyclicality. We have previously guided the markets to think of reliance in our hands as a $300 million year ""mid-cycle business"". But the course, that concept is very broad brushed and indeed somewhat meaningless outside of financial modeling since in my 20 years experience in this industry, the mid-cycle never seems to last for more than a millisecond either in the natural gas or the heat rate market. What we have tried to depict on Slide 9 is a slightly more nuanced, and hopefully a significantly more accurate, view of the earnings power of Reliant as a function of the natural gas price cycle.
The upside of this analysis is that rather than thinking about Reliant as a $300 million year EBITDA mid-cycle business, we believe the market should think of Reliant as a $400 million to $500 million year EBITDA business in all flat-to-modestly probing gas price environments. When natural gas prices are sharply decreasing, Reliant's earnings power can spike above $600 million a year. When natural gas prices are sharply increasing, Reliant's earnings power will dip below $400 million a year, with $300 million being more of a baseline, absent some extraordinary event. 
Moving on to our green initiatives on Slide 10. Our purchase of Green Mountain Energy, has received all necessary approvals and is ready to be closed in the very near future. As a general comment, I want to emphasize how important I think Green Mountain and the Green Mountain brand is going to be in transforming NRG's alternative energy future by tying together our various renewable generation businesses and initiatives and tying them to Green Mountain's own substantial and growing green energy customers. 
In the fast-growing world of green energy, as depicted on Slide 11, there is no brand that comes within a country mile of Green Mountain. As a stand-alone business, divorced from any association with NRG's renewables projects or any support of NRG's commercial operation theme, Green Mountain is a solid business with a healthy EBITDA contribution relative to the purchase price. As such, even on its own, it's a welcome addition to the portfolio. But beyond that, Green Mountain will allow NRG to offer a matched green wholesale green retail product to green energy consumers that's truly unique. And this is important because while the idea of top down imposition of a carbon regime on the American public is dead on arrival in the New Washington, the American consumer trend toward sustainability is going to continue. And indeed, in my opinion, it accelerate, lead by thought leaders of the next generation. 
Success with Green Mountain for us starts with a successful integration. At NRG, our track record of quick, efficient and effective integration of new acquisitions is one of the things I'm proudest of at this company. Both in the case of Texas Genco and Reliant Retail, we've demonstrated that complex businesses could be brought into the NRG camp in a matter that not only was non-disruptive but which enabled the newly-acquired businesses to equal or exceed their business objectives, virtually form the very beginning. The single key to our success in this regard is our emphasis on enabling the new businesses to continue to focus on what they do best while letting us take care of the rest. In the weeks ahead, we will be working closely with Green Mountain on the integration of their business enterprise into NRG, focusing on the priorities listed on Slide 12. We intend to protect, preserve and extend our green identity to secure their core financial performance and to prioritize their opportunities for profitable expansion to new regions and products but particularly in respect to new market segments. We believe NRG can ably assist Green Mountain move further up the C&I ladder to sell to bigger and more expensive retail orientations, which themselves want to short up their own sustainability credentials with their own customer base. In short, I'm extremely excited on what Green Mountain and NRG can accomplish working together. So you should, as they say, stay tuned.
Turning to the Wholesale side of our green equation on Slide 13, we have talked about the immense opportunity we see in the solar space, but so far has been mainly anticipatory. What you already have begun to see over the past couple of weeks with the announcement of construction at Avenal and Ivanpah is that our development effort is beginning to bear fruit. If all goes according to plan, you should expect to hear significantly more in the weeks to come as conservatively more solar projects in our development pipeline complete the usual development process and proceed into the construction phase.
As we've stated previously and repeat on Slide 14, we feel that our solar investment strategy, being a validly multi-technology, multi-vendor and initially focused on the utility-sized projects with very long-term PPAs, is the precisely right strategy to capitalize on the opportunities and incentives currently available to the solar industry. The equity return on these projects, particularly when you consider the lack of merchant risk, the complete absence of environmental risk and the minimal completion risk and construction time, are as attractive on a risk-adjusted basis as any that I have seen over the course of my 20 years in this industry. 
And finally, before handing over to Mauricio, let me emphasize that we are mindful that our solid financial performance year-to-date in 2010 and our successful positioning of the company to take advantage of the very attractive growth opportunities that will arise as our industry transforms itself in response to the society's demand for sustainability, have not yet translated into improving our share price. And as a consequence, our shareholders have suffered. We will do everything within our power to bring about that improvement, and we believe that the main thing we can do is execute on our plan as effectively and as quickly as possible. As listed on Slide 15, we have a great deal on our plate over the next six to nine months, and we hope that successful execution against these priorities will serve as a springboard for share price appreciation.

As you all know, the third quarter is critical to both our generation and retail segments. This summer, we experienced some of the warmest weather on record across our Northeast, South Central and Texas region",1345,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. As you all know, the third quarter is critical to both our generation and retail segments. This summer, we experienced some of the warmest weather on record across our Northeast, South Central and Texas regions. I am very pleased to report that we had another strong quarter from both an operational and financial perspective. 
Slide 17 highlights a few of the accomplishments achieved during the third quarter. As always, we remain focused on safety across the organization. And for the third quarter, we posted an OSHA recordable rate of 0.88, a significant improvement from last summer and just shy of top decile levels. Our plant performance improved across our entire fleet for the third quarter. 
Starting with our coal plant performance, the equivalent availability factor or EAF increased to 94.9% in the third quarter from 92.3% for the same period in 2009. This improvement was lead by our Limestone and Big Cajun II facilities. Nuclear generation at STP had another outstanding quarter with 99% availability, and our oil and gas portfolio responded to the significant heat experienced in Texas, South Central and the Northeast by starting over 2,500x with a 99% reliability during these critical summer months. 
With respect to our construction projects, the Indian River environmental control project, continues to be on track and within budget to begin operations in January 2012. Our Middletown Repowering project to build 200 megawatts of peaking capacity is on schedule to be operational by the summer of 2011. This is the second Repowering project in our New England fleet. Our first project at Devon has been running successfully since it began operation this past summer. 
The BBA for El Segundo energy complex in California received CPUC approval in October. Demolition work has started to make room for the construction of the new units, which are expected to be in service by the summer of 2013. Our core energy program stands at $83 million year-to-date and is on track to achieve the $98 million free cash flow goal for the year. Also, we have already identified projects and cost savings that will bring this program to completion by achieving the full goal of $150 million ahead of our 2012 for original date. 
Finally, our commercial operations group took advantage of some market opportunity during this summer to increase our hedge profile in 2011, which I will discuss in more detail later in the presentation. In addition, they have successfully managed our retail supply under volatile market conditions, delivering strong financial results for two consecutive summers.
Moving on to our plant operations on Slide 18. Net generation increased by 8% this quarter over last year. This increase came primarily from our northeast plants, which benefited from warmer than normal weather and a decreasing coal to gas switching, which was most prevalent in 2009. Also, nuclear generation was higher due to much improved availability compared to third quarter of last year. Our base line portfolio, which includes both our coal and nuclear assets, experienced significant reliability improvements during the third quarter compared to last year. Limestone and Indian River led the coal fleet with equivalent forced outage rates of 2.6% and 4%, respectively. 
Turning to our retail operations on Slide 19. We experienced another solid performance during the third quarter. Record weather in August and September across Texas created an opportunity to deliver higher volumes and stronger margins from our Mass segments. The Mass segment drove significant improvement in this customer attrition with the launch of the advertising campaign and innovative products. In addition, we maintained our low customer complaint rate through strong performance in retail operations. We continue to balance customer count and pricing to deliver higher than run rate margins that are more sustainable in the long term.
In the C&I segment, we continued to improve win rates during the third quarter and extended the terms and diversity of our portfolio. Reliant remains the largest C&I provider in Texas, and we continue to leverage the strength of NRG to provide innovative products and services for our business customers. In summary, we're optimizing margin and customer count by delivering innovative products and excellent customer service. 
Turning to our hedge profile and commodity sensitivities on Slide 20. As illustrated in the chart on the upper left, we have increased our hedge profile for 2011 to 96% from 86% last quarter. This is consistent with our view that the gas markets continue to be under pressure given the high and resilient domestic production levels despite of low gas prices. 
With gas producers beginning to show some drilling restraint, hedged positions rolling off and indications that drilling to hold acreage may be ending, we have chosen to remain relatively open beyond 2011 to benefit from an expected recovery in the gas markets. If we decide to add additional hedges in the other years, we would likely lean towards using option structures that allow us to participate in some upside, while protecting the portfolio for further decreases in gas prices. With respect to retail, we have increased our price, though, to 57% in 2011 from 50% in the second quarter. We continue to match as much generational load as possible to strike maximum synergies between our Retail and Wholesale portfolios.
In order to match our incremental power hedges, our growth hedges increased over 2011 from 78% last quarter to 88% as illustrated on the upper right chart. We also remain well hedged in terms of coal transportation for some time. We continue to limit our commodity price sensitivity in 2011 as illustrated in the lower left chart with 2012 to 2013 -- through '15 largely unchanged. 
Moving on to Slide 21. The quarter-on-quarter demand growth for ERCOT continues to the positive trend for the weather normalized load growth for the year at around 2%. In August, ERCOT set multiple consecutive new big loads and achieved a new all-time record big load of 65.7 kilowatts, an increase of almost 4% from the previous record set in July of last year. In PJM, the weather normalized load growth continues to be fairly stagnant. However, the warmer than normal weather drove significant load increases across the Northeast, and total load was up 7% to 9% higher as compared to third quarter of 2009. In Texas, forward heat recovery remains to be well supported during the first half of the year. Due to continued robust demand, higher supply, time retirement and the continued lack of capital for merchant projects. We expect the Texas market to continue showing robust fundamentals.
Moving on to the environmental front. 2011 will provide a lot more clarity around environmental growth and requirement for our facility. As we have mentioned in previous presentations, we currently have a plan to invest approximately $700 million over the next four years in the environmental projects, failure to comply with these future regulations. Starting with Cedar [indiscernible], the proposed rules does not require additional capital for compliance. With respect to MACT, our client considers mercury controls on local units. While a worst-case scenario to control acid gases could result in additional environmental capital for 1,900 megawatts at Parish and 1,500 megawatt at Big Cajun. We don't expect this to be the likely scenario. 
In terms of master pulling, intake qualifications on Repowering are expected to achieve desired results. For example, we are meeting targets today with extreme qualifications at our Astoria plant in New York. Finally, NRG does not face the challenges of converting from web surface impoundments to landfills as we have drive-by ash disposal at all our coal facilities. 
Our near-term operational priorities are listed on Slide 22. As we move into 2011, we remain focused on excellence in safety and operational performance. We will continue to constantly evaluate the impact of various environmental regulations and our term maintenance and capital spend, particularly in the face of a challenging commodity price environment and determine the best cost benefit decision for each of our assets. 
With that, I will turn it over to Chris, who will discuss our financial results."
413857,114779758,85525,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our discussion of NRG's third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Beginning with Slide 24, our financial results remained strong with $777 million of adjusted EBITDA for the third qu",1557,"Thank you, Mauricio. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our discussion of NRG's third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Beginning with Slide 24, our financial results remained strong with $777 million of adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter and $2.071 billion of adjusted EBITDA year-to-date. During the quarter, Reliant Energy contributed $209 million of adjusted EBITDA to our results compared to $306 million in EBITDA for the third quarter of '09. This difference is largely explained by lower margins on newly acquired customers and existing customer renewals as well as lower customer counts. 
Meanwhile, the Wholesale business contribute $568 million of adjusted EBITDA during Q3. The $32 million decline compared to Q3 2009 Wholesale performance can be largely attributed to the following: In the Northeast region, lower base load hedges were partially offset by a 37% increase in generation due to warmer than expected weather during the quarter. In Texas, a 5% increase in generation and the benefits of lower operation and maintenance costs were offset by a 20% increase in fuel costs, driven by new coal transportation contract at our Parish facility. Meanwhile, the south-central region benefited from the addition of a new contract with the regional municipality, leading to a 17% increase in megawatt hours sold and a 23% increase in the average realized energy price per megawatt hour. Also contributing to the results of south-central region was an 8% increase in load due in part to warmer weather. 
Turning to year-to-date results. Reliant Energy contributed $594 million of EBITDA, $58 million greater than 2009 EBITDA of $536 million. Excluding the $227 million of EBITDA generated in the first four months of 2010 for comparative year-to-date analysis since the acquisition was completed in May of '09, EBITDA results were lower by $169 million. This decline is driven by a 19% decline in mass margins, which were the result of price reductions enacted following the acquisition and lower margins and customer renewal and acquisitions, reflective of the current competitive marketplace. 
The Wholesale business year-to-date generated $1.477 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $116 million lower as compared to the first three quarters of 2009. The comparative year-to-date decline is largely explained by lower base load hedges in the Northeast, lower margins in Texas, caused by higher transportation costs, offset somewhat by better contributions from the south-central region. At September 30, the company's liquidity position stood at approximately $4.8 billion. Impacting this liquidity position during the third quarter were the following items. We repurchased $130 million of NRG shares at a volume weighted average cost of $20.80 per share. These shares, combined with the $50 million repurchase in the second quarter, brings the 2010 share repurchase program to a close at $180 million or 8.4 million shares purchased at a volume weighted average cost of $21.26 per share. 
On August 20, the company issued $1.1 billion of 8.25% senior notes due 2020, with the proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes, including a funding of a recently announced acquisitions. And on October 12, NRG completed $190 million tax exempt financing in relation to the environmental work to be completed at our Indian River facility, which is not yet reflected in current liquidity. The company closed the third quarter in a strong financial position to complete the three recently announced acquisitions of Dynegy assets, Cottonwood and Green Mountain Energy totaling $2.238 billion. 
Now turning to Slide 25. As I mentioned a moment ago, total liquidity, excluding funds deposited by hedged counter-parties remained strong at nearly $4.8 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion from the year end 2009. The increase is principally driven by $1.1 billion increase in total cash and largely explained by continued strong cash flow from operations and proceeds from capital market transactions of about $1.3 billion.
During the first three quarters of 2010, we also made debt repayments of $529 million, which include a reduction of a Term Loan B debt of $247 million and the early settlement of the common stock finance fund of $190 million and completed capital expenditures excluding those in NINA of $274 million, consisting largely of $119 million of normal maintenance and $132 million of environmental CapEx. 
Finally, before turning to the next slide, as you can see in the lower right, we continue to have ample capacity under our first lien to execute hedges on our base load business when appropriate. The first lien remains a very useful tool to both execute such hedges and preserve other sources of liquidity necessary to assist future growth.
Now turning to our 2010 full year guidance update on Slide 26. As a result of a strong performance of the business in the third quarter, we have narrowed our guidance to the upper end of the original range to $2.5 billion to $2.55 billion. At the same time, because of the increase in EBITDA expectations, lower than anticipated income tax of $50 million, $92 million of debt funding for the Indian River environmental work, all offset by an increase in collateral postings during the third quarter of $86 million, we have increased guidance for free cash flow before growth investments to about $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion. Meanwhile, we are lowering our free cash flow guidance for the full year to about $700 million to $750 million. The decrease is a result of increased growth investments of $225 million in the fourth quarter, which includes our El Segundo Repowering project and the majority balance for projects, both previously announced and currently planned. 
Based on Wednesday's closing stock price of $20.4 and our updated outlook, the free cash flow before growth yield currently stands at between 24% to 25% or $4.77 to $4.97 per share.
Now turning to preliminary guidance on Slide 27. As you can see, we currently expect our full year 2011 consolidated EBITDA guidance to be in a range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Included in this guidance range are Wholesale expectations of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, which includes our announced acquisitions. In comparison to the current 2010 Wholesale EBITDA forecast, our Wholesale guidance for 2011 is largely impacted by low overall hedge prices, lower expected capacity prices in the Northeast and normalized weather. Somewhat offsetting these decreases are reductions in our anticipated O&M and G&A spend across the company, which is expected to come in 6% lower in 2011 than in 2010. As Mauricio discussed earlier, we are nearly 100% hedged for 2011 and are this confident of our forecasted results. As we look forward to our Wholesale business in 2012, we are currently in excess of 50% hedge, but at significantly higher prices than 2011 as indicated in our current SEC filings. 
Due to this position, coupled with the current commodity market conditions, we expect flat to marginally lower year-on-year Wholesale results in 2012 from 2011. For our Retail business in 2011, our current expectations, assuming normal weather, are an EBITDA range of between $480 million to $570 million. The decrease in 2011 guidance compared to current 2010 forecast is largely explained by lower unit margin Reliant Mass business. Reliant C&I business margins are also expected to decline but be partially offset by higher terawatt-hour served reflecting our continued dedication to this growing client base.
Finally, we expect Green Mountain Energy to contribute between $70 million to $80 million of EBITDA. As David discussed earlier, we are very excited about enhancing the growth prospects for new our Green Energy Retail business. 
We are similarly excited by our solar development prospects. And on Slide 28, this illustrates this potential. This slide represents our four-year net equity commitment to 500 megawatts of solar projects, both announced and planned over the coming months, as well as their respective EBITDA contribution of $175 million by 2014. We are committed to investing in this financially value-enhancing promising pipeline of projects and look forward to sharing with you both our current progress and future opportunity as we have identified to expand our solar footprint.
On Slide 29, we have provided our projected year-end cash position for 2011 of approximately $1.5 billion. Assume in this calculation, are cash flow estimates from guidance, the completion of outstanding acquisitions of $2.238 billion and expected debt repayment under our Term Loan B agreements. As such, when reviewing our capital allocation plans, we usually maintain a minimum cash balance of $700 million, largely for margin working capital, margin requirements, the timing of cash payments of interest, property taxes and the like as well as equity for the project that we have under construction throughout the year. Thus, in 2011, estimate a balance of about $785 million to allocate between share buybacks and further investments in high growth opportunities.
The decision to deploy these funds in 2011 will be dependent on a number of factors, such as the size of our restricted payment basket and continued availability of attractive projects to invest in. We would hope to update this allocation with improved precision at our 2010 year-end results call.
In closing, we are very proud of our ability to continue to deliver solid results despite the current commodity market climate. As we move forward, we remain committed to a prudent allocation of capital to create further opportunity for business growth and to return value to our shareholders. 
Now I'll pass it back to David for final comments."

Before we open the line for questions, let me just make three quick points for you to keep in mind. The first is I think that we're demonstrating, as I said, even three years into the commodity price-down cycle, we're showing that even in these circumstances the company is demonstrating substantial free cash flow generation. 
Secondly, we do have investment opportunities lead by solar, which are very attractive in absolute terms and from a risk perspective and also are much shorter in terms of how soon they contribute to EBITDA because of the shorter construction cycle. And finally, to follow on Chris' last point, we do have substantial liquidity to deploy. And I think our track record over the last six years has indicated our ability to allocate and deploy capital in a manner that enhances the value of the company over the medium to long term.

We made it very clear from the beginning that we were not interested in owning the Midwest coal assets. And that was really a factor, two factors that caused us to feel that way. One, as you yourself mentioned, we have a significant amount of that in our own portfolio already. And the second thing, and we've been consistent about this ever since the response to the Exelon situation, as we consider the Midwest, in my seven years in this company, we have never been attracted to the Midwest as a place where we really wanted to be very active. And I would say that lack of interest in the Midwest has gotten greater over those years because we find the prospects for demand growth in the Midwest, in the Midwest of the country, are more challenging than on the coast, and we also think that the Midwest market is being coal-on-coal competition for the most part. That's not very attractive to begin with. But also, we think it's subject to a risk from a build-out of wind capacity coming out of the Dakotas. And so that just wasn't our cup of tea.

But if the Dynegy transaction was defeated, a, obviously we would have no idea why would it appear, what the plan of Dynegy would be going forward and whether the assets that we had contracted to sale would be available for sale from someone else. If someone offered those assets to us and we were free of our obligation, when were free from our obligation to Blackstone, to consider, we obviously would consider it. And to me, it's a blinding glimpse of the obvious. But given the change in the gas curves since August, we would be offering a lower price. I'm not going to talk about how much of a lower price. But there is another factor is that, we would have to be certain that whoever we were buying the assets from, the transaction was structured in a way that was bankruptcy remote, that we’re not subject to a potential unwinding of the transaction due to fraudulent [indiscernible]. So that would be a potential obstacle as well. So the potential permutations of what might happen are so great. That's about all I can tell you right now. On the alternative use of the liquidity, I'll just repeat what we've said. We have a lot of investment opportunities. The Dynegy assets were particularly attractive to us, but they're not the only combined cycle power plants in the United States that are on the market today. And I previously stated in many meetings that I actually thought that the absolute best time to be buying combined cycle power plants was probably can be in the first part of 2012. And then of course, there's the possibility of redeploying the capital in terms of return of capital to stakeholders. And obviously, there is the possibility for share buyback. But as we did borrow money in August in order to finance the Dynegy transaction, there's also the possibility of paying down some debt. So, Chris, did you want to..."

But, however, if there's an upturn in gas, then we would expect to see an increasing result of around $60 million during the year. There's also some variability in our gas leak results. So with an increase in both gas prices and heat rates, there could be an upward revision of sort of $15 million for them. Also, as we said during the presentation, we have built-in a 6% decrease in costs across our O&M and G&A with about $1 billion of costs. If there are additional 1% to 2% decrease in cost, then that can obviously add to our results as well. And as David said, the management team, we're very much focused on the improvements we can squeeze out of the business. In retail, the range that we have in there contemplates certain load variability due to weather. And then also, if we see lower than expected attrition rates than we previously forecast, that would increase results. Also, if there is a decline in gas and this speaks sort of to the hedge against our Wholesale business, then that would most likely improve results for Reliant. And finally, it's very clear that we guided $500 million of EBITDA for 2010, and we've exceeded that by nearly $200 million, we expect to, for the year.

Their principal area of expansion to date had been in New York City, and we wanted to think in a sort of methodical way. But certainly, we think there are other markets in the Northeast that they can move into. But I think the most obvious thing is that as a small company in the C&I business, Green Mountain has focused on very, very small commercial customer. And our sense and I think there are a lot of anecdotes and data points on this, I'll spare you my Philadelphia cream cheese example, but -- it seems that a growing number of businesses in the United States that are facing the American consumer are seeing the benefit of sending a Green Energy message. And we think that's a trend it's going to accelerate, and we expect Green Mountain to be a big part of that trend.

But really, to me, it comes down to basically two sort of interconnected exits. One is the loan guarantee and the other is that PPA obligation, and they're tied together because the PPA obligation has the condition of the loan guarantee. And, Jay, what I can say is it's always hard to predict the development business, and we could get subject to complete impasse in Washington, where there's just no money is appropriated for nuclear loan guarantees even though I think President Obama yesterday said that when -- I'm told, I didn't see this but when he was asked which areas is there room for cooperation with the Republicans, I think – I was told nuclear with the first or the second thing that you've said. And so in a sense, we should think that this is an area, where the election result is beneficial. But the nuclear needs the loan guaranty appropriation, and if that doesn't happen, obviously, that's a very, very clear exit ramp. The slightly less clear exit ramp is, okay, we got the loan guaranty, but it’s conditional on off-take and what I would tell you about that is that our sense because we're working the off-take question very hard right now is that within a few months of getting the loan guarantee, we'll know whether or not the off-take is going to happen. And if we don't get that within a few months, the fact we have always said to our shareholders that we would not go forward with STP 3 & 4 as a fully merchant plan. The amount of off-take that's being required by the DOE is pretty much the same as what that we were going to insist upon anyway. So the exact timing is uncertain, Jay. But I certainly expect that by the summer of 2011, assuming we got the loan guarantee well before that, we should know whether or not the off-take's going to happen or not going to happen."

Let me start by introducing my colleagues here participating in this presentation joined by Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Corporate Officer; and by Chris Schade, our Chief Financial Officer. Also available to",2815,"Thank you, Nahla, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by introducing my colleagues here participating in this presentation joined by Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Corporate Officer; and by Chris Schade, our Chief Financial Officer. Also available to answer your questions will be Jason Few, who runs the Reliant Retail Business on our behalf; and Chris Mose [sp], who is responsible for commercial operations at NRG. 
So to begin, as we know, the Equity Markets are relentlessly forward-looking, so I’m going to spend most of my time looking forward as well. I do want to pause for a moment, and you should be looking at Slide 3 if you're following along in the presentation, on what this company accomplished in the third quarter of 2010 and what we are in the process of accomplishing here today. 
We had another exceptionally strong performance with our second best-ever quarter from an EBITDA perspective with an able assist from favorable weather but most importantly, thanks to our exceptional operating performance in robust hedge position. We largely mitigated the impact of gas prices trending relentlessly downward and keep rates moving sideways to post $777 million of adjusted EBITDA and $536 million of cash from operations. Certainly, our already strong current liquidity position was enhanced during the quarter by the bond financing that we did in August, but our liquidity was also strengthened as it has been for many quarters in a row by a very substantial contribution of free cash flow from the company's operating assets and businesses. 
Our strong performance year-to-date allows us to narrow our full-year 2010 guidance to the top end of the present range. And while I’ve had in my aspirations from the beginning of the year to reach the $2.6 billion level, which would've put us flat against our record-shattering performance in 2009, I am nonetheless very proud given the gravitational pull of near-term gas prices that we are on our way to a performance in the $2.5 billion range. 
Indeed, you may recall that 12 months ago in the course of announcing an initial EBITDA guidance for 2010 of $2.2 billion, I conveyed to you that as a management team, we were not satisfied with that number. And we made a commitment to you, our shareholders, that we would not rest until we had improved substantially on that number. I feel that under the circumstances, we have delivered on that commitment. 
Today, I'm here to make another set of commitments. As Chris will outline for you, we are initiating guidance for 2011 in the $2 billion range. Our financial prospects in this, the third year of commodity price recession, once again being subjected to the downward pressure of the significantly lower gas curve. Our commitment to our shareholders again this year is that we will not rest until we have substantially improved our performance against the standard of this initial guidance. I can't promise you anything specific today with respect to our next fiscal year, which obviously doesn't begin for another two months. But if you check our record over the past six years, I think you will find that we have been pretty successful in exceeding expectations regarding our current operating and financial performance.
I want to devote the remainder of my time to comment on a few important components of our strategic positioning of this company, Many of these areas of our business figure primarily in the thoughts of our investors since they have been in the news recently or will be in the near future. The company's strategic approach is in general terms depicted on Slide 4, five conventional priorities and five transformational green energy priorities. I feel that we've made significant progress against all 10 of these priorities year-to-date. And during Q&A, I would be happy to talk about any or all of them. But due to time constraints, I'm going to limit my prepared remarks to the four Rs: reactors, renewables, retail and CCT acquisitions at a significant discounts or replacement costs.
Our goal in respect to our Conventional business, as shown on Slide 5, is to build our business on the foundation of a multi-fuel, across-the-merit-order, geographically advantaged generation portfolio at scale in each of our core markets. And in our principal market, which of course is Texas, matching up that diversified generation portfolio with the Retail Electricity business also at scale. As such, in this area, the four Rs are where much of our opportunity lay. In the case of new advanced nuclear power, there are two more Rs which are important. The first R is replacement power. Our nation's solid fuel base load fleet is very old and rapidly getting older as little to no new base load generation is being built. The oldest quartile of baseload generation this country needs to be replaced over the next decade and given the development lead times for solid fuel generation, our view is that those of us who get started now will be advantaged. 
The final R stands for renaissance, and it's not yet clear how robust the nuclear renaissance will be here in the United States. But it is very clear that the world at large is well down the path towards a global nuclear renaissance worth hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions, and the owner or developers of the first new nuclear plants in the United States are going to have a very beneficial first mover advantage in that nuclear renaissance.
But of course, the secure first mover advantage of the nuclear renaissance you actually have to have a first mover project. The status of STP 3 & 4 has not changed significantly since our previous quarterly call. The lack of visible progress was to be expected since the gating item for most meaningful steps forward on the project, such as additional equity partners, has been and continues to be the DOE loan guaranty process and the related issue of funding appropriations. Since Congress has been in recess for most of the last three months, it's not surprising that there has been no development on the additional appropriations. 
Nonetheless, significant progress continued to be made on all key fronts below the surface. From the perspective of NRG shareholders, we believe you should evaluate the present arrangement with respect to STP as illustrated on Slide 6 as follows. NRG has a limited obligation at currently a $1.5 million a month, an obligation to our partners, to contribute to ongoing development spend until the loan guaranty is received and accepted. Nonetheless, recognizing NRG's very substantial financial contribution to the project development to date of approximately $315 million, including a significant amount, which was funded during the first half of this year as a result of NRG assuming CPS’s share of the overall development spend, the project remains fully on schedule. This is due to the much appreciated stepped-up contribution of our partner Toshiba Corp. And we remain very much in contention for the valuable nuclear loan guaranty from the Department of Energy. As such, during this phase, the STP 3 & 4 development should be perceived by energy shareholders as a low cost option on a very large benefit opportunity with clearly defined exit ramps.
Of course, the news affecting nuclear development in the United States during the past several weeks has had little to do with STP and much to do with the Calvert Cliffs project and the loan guarantees fee issue cited by Constellation as their reason for withdrawing from the project. What I would tell you is that notwithstanding the superficial similarities between the two projects, and this is shown on the left side of Slide 7, the two projects actually are structured very differently. Obviously, they are in different markets with different rates of projected base load growth, but also they involve different risk allocation with respect to technology, completion risk and merchant off-take. We do not yet know precisely how these differences will play into the government's analysis of the loan guarantee fee for STP, but the government is well aware of the structural differences because they have been discussed at length by us with the DOE. 
As I am trying to depict on the right side of this page, we believe we're in the midst of the final stage of the government's determination of this issue. And so hopefully, we will be in the position to advise our investors within a few weeks of the outcome.
Moving on, on Slide 8. We have transactions spending to purchase high efficiency, load following CCGTs in three of our four core regions, and we continue to push towards a prompt closing of these transactions. We are highly confident that Cottonwood will close in the very near future and that while Cottonwood in and of itself will be fairly unspectacular in its near-term contribution to EBITDA, given the subdued commodity price environment, cottonwood will play an essential role in enabling us to renew the portfolio long-term off-take of arrangements that South Central has with its key co-op customers, recognizing that a significant number of these contracts are up for renewal in 2014.
As to the Dynegy assets, we remain very comfortable with the bargain we struck back in August, and we want the transaction to proceed on its present terms. With the commodity price curve for natural gas, bumping along its cyclical bottom, it is a good time to acquire generation assets. We are highly confident if we get the opportunity to close the Dynegy transactions that over the entire commodity price cycle, our investment will be money well spent and that this portfolio, headlined by the strategically and geographically advance Moss Landing 1 and 2, will be a successful investment on behalf of NRG shareholders. 
If the Blackstone acquisition does not proceed and the opportunity to buy this set of CCGTs disappears, we are equally confident that we have very attractive alternative uses for the liquidity that will be freed up. Not only is it a good time to invest in well located CCGTs at price is well below replacement cost, it's a good time to invest in low risk, high return solar projects, and that's something I'm about to talk about. And it's always a good time particularly at the current depressed price levels to buy NRG stock. 
Of course, our stock price performance seems to be constrained by the drop in gas prices and the flattening of the gas curve more generally. However, that fundamental connection between natural gas prices and the financial prospects of ITPs tends to overlook the fact that our Reliant Retail business is countercyclical to natural gas, and the $600 million of year-to-date EBITDA that we are reporting today demonstrates the resilience of that counter-cyclicality. We have previously guided the markets to think of reliance in our hands as a $300 million year ""mid-cycle business"". But the course, that concept is very broad brushed and indeed somewhat meaningless outside of financial modeling since in my 20 years experience in this industry, the mid-cycle never seems to last for more than a millisecond either in the natural gas or the heat rate market. What we have tried to depict on Slide 9 is a slightly more nuanced, and hopefully a significantly more accurate, view of the earnings power of Reliant as a function of the natural gas price cycle.
The upside of this analysis is that rather than thinking about Reliant as a $300 million year EBITDA mid-cycle business, we believe the market should think of Reliant as a $400 million to $500 million year EBITDA business in all flat-to-modestly probing gas price environments. When natural gas prices are sharply decreasing, Reliant's earnings power can spike above $600 million a year. When natural gas prices are sharply increasing, Reliant's earnings power will dip below $400 million a year, with $300 million being more of a baseline, absent some extraordinary event. 
Moving on to our green initiatives on Slide 10. Our purchase of Green Mountain Energy, has received all necessary approvals and is ready to be closed in the very near future. As a general comment, I want to emphasize how important I think Green Mountain and the Green Mountain brand is going to be in transforming NRG's alternative energy future by tying together our various renewable generation businesses and initiatives and tying them to Green Mountain's own substantial and growing green energy customers. 
In the fast-growing world of green energy, as depicted on Slide 11, there is no brand that comes within a country mile of Green Mountain. As a stand-alone business, divorced from any association with NRG's renewables projects or any support of NRG's commercial operation theme, Green Mountain is a solid business with a healthy EBITDA contribution relative to the purchase price. As such, even on its own, it's a welcome addition to the portfolio. But beyond that, Green Mountain will allow NRG to offer a matched green wholesale green retail product to green energy consumers that's truly unique. And this is important because while the idea of top down imposition of a carbon regime on the American public is dead on arrival in the New Washington, the American consumer trend toward sustainability is going to continue. And indeed, in my opinion, it accelerate, lead by thought leaders of the next generation. 
Success with Green Mountain for us starts with a successful integration. At NRG, our track record of quick, efficient and effective integration of new acquisitions is one of the things I'm proudest of at this company. Both in the case of Texas Genco and Reliant Retail, we've demonstrated that complex businesses could be brought into the NRG camp in a matter that not only was non-disruptive but which enabled the newly-acquired businesses to equal or exceed their business objectives, virtually form the very beginning. The single key to our success in this regard is our emphasis on enabling the new businesses to continue to focus on what they do best while letting us take care of the rest. In the weeks ahead, we will be working closely with Green Mountain on the integration of their business enterprise into NRG, focusing on the priorities listed on Slide 12. We intend to protect, preserve and extend our green identity to secure their core financial performance and to prioritize their opportunities for profitable expansion to new regions and products but particularly in respect to new market segments. We believe NRG can ably assist Green Mountain move further up the C&I ladder to sell to bigger and more expensive retail orientations, which themselves want to short up their own sustainability credentials with their own customer base. In short, I'm extremely excited on what Green Mountain and NRG can accomplish working together. So you should, as they say, stay tuned.
Turning to the Wholesale side of our green equation on Slide 13, we have talked about the immense opportunity we see in the solar space, but so far has been mainly anticipatory. What you already have begun to see over the past couple of weeks with the announcement of construction at Avenal and Ivanpah is that our development effort is beginning to bear fruit. If all goes according to plan, you should expect to hear significantly more in the weeks to come as conservatively more solar projects in our development pipeline complete the usual development process and proceed into the construction phase.
As we've stated previously and repeat on Slide 14, we feel that our solar investment strategy, being a validly multi-technology, multi-vendor and initially focused on the utility-sized projects with very long-term PPAs, is the precisely right strategy to capitalize on the opportunities and incentives currently available to the solar industry. The equity return on these projects, particularly when you consider the lack of merchant risk, the complete absence of environmental risk and the minimal completion risk and construction time, are as attractive on a risk-adjusted basis as any that I have seen over the course of my 20 years in this industry. 
And finally, before handing over to Mauricio, let me emphasize that we are mindful that our solid financial performance year-to-date in 2010 and our successful positioning of the company to take advantage of the very attractive growth opportunities that will arise as our industry transforms itself in response to the society's demand for sustainability, have not yet translated into improving our share price. And as a consequence, our shareholders have suffered. We will do everything within our power to bring about that improvement, and we believe that the main thing we can do is execute on our plan as effectively and as quickly as possible. As listed on Slide 15, we have a great deal on our plate over the next six to nine months, and we hope that successful execution against these priorities will serve as a springboard for share price appreciation.

As you all know, the third quarter is critical to both our generation and retail segments. This summer, we experienced some of the warmest weather on record across our Northeast, South Central and Texas region",1345,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. As you all know, the third quarter is critical to both our generation and retail segments. This summer, we experienced some of the warmest weather on record across our Northeast, South Central and Texas regions. I am very pleased to report that we had another strong quarter from both an operational and financial perspective. 
Slide 17 highlights a few of the accomplishments achieved during the third quarter. As always, we remain focused on safety across the organization. And for the third quarter, we posted an OSHA recordable rate of 0.88, a significant improvement from last summer and just shy of top decile levels. Our plant performance improved across our entire fleet for the third quarter. 
Starting with our coal plant performance, the equivalent availability factor or EAF increased to 94.9% in the third quarter from 92.3% for the same period in 2009. This improvement was lead by our Limestone and Big Cajun II facilities. Nuclear generation at STP had another outstanding quarter with 99% availability, and our oil and gas portfolio responded to the significant heat experienced in Texas, South Central and the Northeast by starting over 2,500x with a 99% reliability during these critical summer months. 
With respect to our construction projects, the Indian River environmental control project, continues to be on track and within budget to begin operations in January 2012. Our Middletown Repowering project to build 200 megawatts of peaking capacity is on schedule to be operational by the summer of 2011. This is the second Repowering project in our New England fleet. Our first project at Devon has been running successfully since it began operation this past summer. 
The BBA for El Segundo energy complex in California received CPUC approval in October. Demolition work has started to make room for the construction of the new units, which are expected to be in service by the summer of 2013. Our core energy program stands at $83 million year-to-date and is on track to achieve the $98 million free cash flow goal for the year. Also, we have already identified projects and cost savings that will bring this program to completion by achieving the full goal of $150 million ahead of our 2012 for original date. 
Finally, our commercial operations group took advantage of some market opportunity during this summer to increase our hedge profile in 2011, which I will discuss in more detail later in the presentation. In addition, they have successfully managed our retail supply under volatile market conditions, delivering strong financial results for two consecutive summers.
Moving on to our plant operations on Slide 18. Net generation increased by 8% this quarter over last year. This increase came primarily from our northeast plants, which benefited from warmer than normal weather and a decreasing coal to gas switching, which was most prevalent in 2009. Also, nuclear generation was higher due to much improved availability compared to third quarter of last year. Our base line portfolio, which includes both our coal and nuclear assets, experienced significant reliability improvements during the third quarter compared to last year. Limestone and Indian River led the coal fleet with equivalent forced outage rates of 2.6% and 4%, respectively. 
Turning to our retail operations on Slide 19. We experienced another solid performance during the third quarter. Record weather in August and September across Texas created an opportunity to deliver higher volumes and stronger margins from our Mass segments. The Mass segment drove significant improvement in this customer attrition with the launch of the advertising campaign and innovative products. In addition, we maintained our low customer complaint rate through strong performance in retail operations. We continue to balance customer count and pricing to deliver higher than run rate margins that are more sustainable in the long term.
In the C&I segment, we continued to improve win rates during the third quarter and extended the terms and diversity of our portfolio. Reliant remains the largest C&I provider in Texas, and we continue to leverage the strength of NRG to provide innovative products and services for our business customers. In summary, we're optimizing margin and customer count by delivering innovative products and excellent customer service. 
Turning to our hedge profile and commodity sensitivities on Slide 20. As illustrated in the chart on the upper left, we have increased our hedge profile for 2011 to 96% from 86% last quarter. This is consistent with our view that the gas markets continue to be under pressure given the high and resilient domestic production levels despite of low gas prices. 
With gas producers beginning to show some drilling restraint, hedged positions rolling off and indications that drilling to hold acreage may be ending, we have chosen to remain relatively open beyond 2011 to benefit from an expected recovery in the gas markets. If we decide to add additional hedges in the other years, we would likely lean towards using option structures that allow us to participate in some upside, while protecting the portfolio for further decreases in gas prices. With respect to retail, we have increased our price, though, to 57% in 2011 from 50% in the second quarter. We continue to match as much generational load as possible to strike maximum synergies between our Retail and Wholesale portfolios.
In order to match our incremental power hedges, our growth hedges increased over 2011 from 78% last quarter to 88% as illustrated on the upper right chart. We also remain well hedged in terms of coal transportation for some time. We continue to limit our commodity price sensitivity in 2011 as illustrated in the lower left chart with 2012 to 2013 -- through '15 largely unchanged. 
Moving on to Slide 21. The quarter-on-quarter demand growth for ERCOT continues to the positive trend for the weather normalized load growth for the year at around 2%. In August, ERCOT set multiple consecutive new big loads and achieved a new all-time record big load of 65.7 kilowatts, an increase of almost 4% from the previous record set in July of last year. In PJM, the weather normalized load growth continues to be fairly stagnant. However, the warmer than normal weather drove significant load increases across the Northeast, and total load was up 7% to 9% higher as compared to third quarter of 2009. In Texas, forward heat recovery remains to be well supported during the first half of the year. Due to continued robust demand, higher supply, time retirement and the continued lack of capital for merchant projects. We expect the Texas market to continue showing robust fundamentals.
Moving on to the environmental front. 2011 will provide a lot more clarity around environmental growth and requirement for our facility. As we have mentioned in previous presentations, we currently have a plan to invest approximately $700 million over the next four years in the environmental projects, failure to comply with these future regulations. Starting with Cedar [indiscernible], the proposed rules does not require additional capital for compliance. With respect to MACT, our client considers mercury controls on local units. While a worst-case scenario to control acid gases could result in additional environmental capital for 1,900 megawatts at Parish and 1,500 megawatt at Big Cajun. We don't expect this to be the likely scenario. 
In terms of master pulling, intake qualifications on Repowering are expected to achieve desired results. For example, we are meeting targets today with extreme qualifications at our Astoria plant in New York. Finally, NRG does not face the challenges of converting from web surface impoundments to landfills as we have drive-by ash disposal at all our coal facilities. 
Our near-term operational priorities are listed on Slide 22. As we move into 2011, we remain focused on excellence in safety and operational performance. We will continue to constantly evaluate the impact of various environmental regulations and our term maintenance and capital spend, particularly in the face of a challenging commodity price environment and determine the best cost benefit decision for each of our assets. 
With that, I will turn it over to Chris, who will discuss our financial results."
413857,114779758,85614,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our discussion of NRG's third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Beginning with Slide 24, our financial results remained strong with $777 million of adjusted EBITDA for the third qu",1557,"Thank you, Mauricio. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our discussion of NRG's third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Beginning with Slide 24, our financial results remained strong with $777 million of adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter and $2.071 billion of adjusted EBITDA year-to-date. During the quarter, Reliant Energy contributed $209 million of adjusted EBITDA to our results compared to $306 million in EBITDA for the third quarter of '09. This difference is largely explained by lower margins on newly acquired customers and existing customer renewals as well as lower customer counts. 
Meanwhile, the Wholesale business contribute $568 million of adjusted EBITDA during Q3. The $32 million decline compared to Q3 2009 Wholesale performance can be largely attributed to the following: In the Northeast region, lower base load hedges were partially offset by a 37% increase in generation due to warmer than expected weather during the quarter. In Texas, a 5% increase in generation and the benefits of lower operation and maintenance costs were offset by a 20% increase in fuel costs, driven by new coal transportation contract at our Parish facility. Meanwhile, the south-central region benefited from the addition of a new contract with the regional municipality, leading to a 17% increase in megawatt hours sold and a 23% increase in the average realized energy price per megawatt hour. Also contributing to the results of south-central region was an 8% increase in load due in part to warmer weather. 
Turning to year-to-date results. Reliant Energy contributed $594 million of EBITDA, $58 million greater than 2009 EBITDA of $536 million. Excluding the $227 million of EBITDA generated in the first four months of 2010 for comparative year-to-date analysis since the acquisition was completed in May of '09, EBITDA results were lower by $169 million. This decline is driven by a 19% decline in mass margins, which were the result of price reductions enacted following the acquisition and lower margins and customer renewal and acquisitions, reflective of the current competitive marketplace. 
The Wholesale business year-to-date generated $1.477 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $116 million lower as compared to the first three quarters of 2009. The comparative year-to-date decline is largely explained by lower base load hedges in the Northeast, lower margins in Texas, caused by higher transportation costs, offset somewhat by better contributions from the south-central region. At September 30, the company's liquidity position stood at approximately $4.8 billion. Impacting this liquidity position during the third quarter were the following items. We repurchased $130 million of NRG shares at a volume weighted average cost of $20.80 per share. These shares, combined with the $50 million repurchase in the second quarter, brings the 2010 share repurchase program to a close at $180 million or 8.4 million shares purchased at a volume weighted average cost of $21.26 per share. 
On August 20, the company issued $1.1 billion of 8.25% senior notes due 2020, with the proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes, including a funding of a recently announced acquisitions. And on October 12, NRG completed $190 million tax exempt financing in relation to the environmental work to be completed at our Indian River facility, which is not yet reflected in current liquidity. The company closed the third quarter in a strong financial position to complete the three recently announced acquisitions of Dynegy assets, Cottonwood and Green Mountain Energy totaling $2.238 billion. 
Now turning to Slide 25. As I mentioned a moment ago, total liquidity, excluding funds deposited by hedged counter-parties remained strong at nearly $4.8 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion from the year end 2009. The increase is principally driven by $1.1 billion increase in total cash and largely explained by continued strong cash flow from operations and proceeds from capital market transactions of about $1.3 billion.
During the first three quarters of 2010, we also made debt repayments of $529 million, which include a reduction of a Term Loan B debt of $247 million and the early settlement of the common stock finance fund of $190 million and completed capital expenditures excluding those in NINA of $274 million, consisting largely of $119 million of normal maintenance and $132 million of environmental CapEx. 
Finally, before turning to the next slide, as you can see in the lower right, we continue to have ample capacity under our first lien to execute hedges on our base load business when appropriate. The first lien remains a very useful tool to both execute such hedges and preserve other sources of liquidity necessary to assist future growth.
Now turning to our 2010 full year guidance update on Slide 26. As a result of a strong performance of the business in the third quarter, we have narrowed our guidance to the upper end of the original range to $2.5 billion to $2.55 billion. At the same time, because of the increase in EBITDA expectations, lower than anticipated income tax of $50 million, $92 million of debt funding for the Indian River environmental work, all offset by an increase in collateral postings during the third quarter of $86 million, we have increased guidance for free cash flow before growth investments to about $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion. Meanwhile, we are lowering our free cash flow guidance for the full year to about $700 million to $750 million. The decrease is a result of increased growth investments of $225 million in the fourth quarter, which includes our El Segundo Repowering project and the majority balance for projects, both previously announced and currently planned. 
Based on Wednesday's closing stock price of $20.4 and our updated outlook, the free cash flow before growth yield currently stands at between 24% to 25% or $4.77 to $4.97 per share.
Now turning to preliminary guidance on Slide 27. As you can see, we currently expect our full year 2011 consolidated EBITDA guidance to be in a range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Included in this guidance range are Wholesale expectations of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, which includes our announced acquisitions. In comparison to the current 2010 Wholesale EBITDA forecast, our Wholesale guidance for 2011 is largely impacted by low overall hedge prices, lower expected capacity prices in the Northeast and normalized weather. Somewhat offsetting these decreases are reductions in our anticipated O&M and G&A spend across the company, which is expected to come in 6% lower in 2011 than in 2010. As Mauricio discussed earlier, we are nearly 100% hedged for 2011 and are this confident of our forecasted results. As we look forward to our Wholesale business in 2012, we are currently in excess of 50% hedge, but at significantly higher prices than 2011 as indicated in our current SEC filings. 
Due to this position, coupled with the current commodity market conditions, we expect flat to marginally lower year-on-year Wholesale results in 2012 from 2011. For our Retail business in 2011, our current expectations, assuming normal weather, are an EBITDA range of between $480 million to $570 million. The decrease in 2011 guidance compared to current 2010 forecast is largely explained by lower unit margin Reliant Mass business. Reliant C&I business margins are also expected to decline but be partially offset by higher terawatt-hour served reflecting our continued dedication to this growing client base.
Finally, we expect Green Mountain Energy to contribute between $70 million to $80 million of EBITDA. As David discussed earlier, we are very excited about enhancing the growth prospects for new our Green Energy Retail business. 
We are similarly excited by our solar development prospects. And on Slide 28, this illustrates this potential. This slide represents our four-year net equity commitment to 500 megawatts of solar projects, both announced and planned over the coming months, as well as their respective EBITDA contribution of $175 million by 2014. We are committed to investing in this financially value-enhancing promising pipeline of projects and look forward to sharing with you both our current progress and future opportunity as we have identified to expand our solar footprint.
On Slide 29, we have provided our projected year-end cash position for 2011 of approximately $1.5 billion. Assume in this calculation, are cash flow estimates from guidance, the completion of outstanding acquisitions of $2.238 billion and expected debt repayment under our Term Loan B agreements. As such, when reviewing our capital allocation plans, we usually maintain a minimum cash balance of $700 million, largely for margin working capital, margin requirements, the timing of cash payments of interest, property taxes and the like as well as equity for the project that we have under construction throughout the year. Thus, in 2011, estimate a balance of about $785 million to allocate between share buybacks and further investments in high growth opportunities.
The decision to deploy these funds in 2011 will be dependent on a number of factors, such as the size of our restricted payment basket and continued availability of attractive projects to invest in. We would hope to update this allocation with improved precision at our 2010 year-end results call.
In closing, we are very proud of our ability to continue to deliver solid results despite the current commodity market climate. As we move forward, we remain committed to a prudent allocation of capital to create further opportunity for business growth and to return value to our shareholders. 
Now I'll pass it back to David for final comments."

Before we open the line for questions, let me just make three quick points for you to keep in mind. The first is I think that we're demonstrating, as I said, even three years into the commodity price-down cycle, we're showing that even in these circumstances the company is demonstrating substantial free cash flow generation. 
Secondly, we do have investment opportunities lead by solar, which are very attractive in absolute terms and from a risk perspective and also are much shorter in terms of how soon they contribute to EBITDA because of the shorter construction cycle. And finally, to follow on Chris' last point, we do have substantial liquidity to deploy. And I think our track record over the last six years has indicated our ability to allocate and deploy capital in a manner that enhances the value of the company over the medium to long term. So we hope and expect to continue to do that for the benefit of NRG shareholders. 
So with that, Lamida, we'd be happy to take any questions that you have on the line."

We made it very clear from the beginning that we were not interested in owning the Midwest coal assets. And that was really a factor, two factors that caused us to feel that way. One, as you yourself mentioned, we have a significant amount of that in our own portfolio already. And the second thing, and we've been consistent about this ever since the response to the Exelon situation, as we consider the Midwest, in my seven years in this company, we have never been attracted to the Midwest as a place where we really wanted to be very active. And I would say that lack of interest in the Midwest has gotten greater over those years because we find the prospects for demand growth in the Midwest, in the Midwest of the country, are more challenging than on the coast, and we also think that the Midwest market is being coal-on-coal competition for the most part. That's not very attractive to begin with. But also, we think it's subject to a risk from a build-out of wind capacity coming out of the Dakotas. And so that just wasn't our cup of tea.

And to me, it's a blinding glimpse of the obvious. But given the change in the gas curves since August, we would be offering a lower price. I'm not going to talk about how much of a lower price. But there is another factor is that, we would have to be certain that whoever we were buying the assets from, the transaction was structured in a way that was bankruptcy remote, that we’re not subject to a potential unwinding of the transaction due to fraudulent [indiscernible].

The Dynegy assets were particularly attractive to us, but they're not the only combined cycle power plants in the United States that are on the market today. And I previously stated in many meetings that I actually thought that the absolute best time to be buying combined cycle power plants was probably can be in the first part of 2012. And then of course, there's the possibility of redeploying the capital in terms of return of capital to stakeholders. And obviously, there is the possibility for share buyback. But as we did borrow money in August in order to finance the Dynegy transaction, there's also the possibility of paying down some debt. So, Chris, did you want to..."

But, however, if there's an upturn in gas, then we would expect to see an increasing result of around $60 million during the year. There's also some variability in our gas leak results. So with an increase in both gas prices and heat rates, there could be an upward revision of sort of $15 million for them. Also, as we said during the presentation, we have built-in a 6% decrease in costs across our O&M and G&A with about $1 billion of costs. If there are additional 1% to 2% decrease in cost, then that can obviously add to our results as well. And as David said, the management team, we're very much focused on the improvements we can squeeze out of the business. In retail, the range that we have in there contemplates certain load variability due to weather. And then also, if we see lower than expected attrition rates than we previously forecast, that would increase results. Also, if there is a decline in gas and this speaks sort of to the hedge against our Wholesale business, then that would most likely improve results for Reliant. And finally, it's very clear that we guided $500 million of EBITDA for 2010, and we've exceeded that by nearly $200 million, we expect to, for the year.

But really, to me, it comes down to basically two sort of interconnected exits. One is the loan guarantee and the other is that PPA obligation, and they're tied together because the PPA obligation has the condition of the loan guarantee. And, Jay, what I can say is it's always hard to predict the development business, and we could get subject to complete impasse in Washington, where there's just no money is appropriated for nuclear loan guarantees even though I think President Obama yesterday said that when -- I'm told, I didn't see this but when he was asked which areas is there room for cooperation with the Republicans, I think – I was told nuclear with the first or the second thing that you've said. And so in a sense, we should think that this is an area, where the election result is beneficial. But the nuclear needs the loan guaranty appropriation, and if that doesn't happen, obviously, that's a very, very clear exit ramp. The slightly less clear exit ramp is, okay, we got the loan guaranty, but it’s conditional on off-take and what I would tell you about that is that our sense because we're working the off-take question very hard right now is that within a few months of getting the loan guarantee, we'll know whether or not the off-take is going to happen. And if we don't get that within a few months, the fact we have always said to our shareholders that we would not go forward with STP 3 & 4 as a fully merchant plan. The amount of off-take that's being required by the DOE is pretty much the same as what that we were going to insist upon anyway. So the exact timing is uncertain, Jay. But I certainly expect that by the summer of 2011, assuming we got the loan guarantee well before that, we should know whether or not the off-take's going to happen or not going to happen."

I’m joined by Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer; and by Chris Schade, our Chief Financial Officer. Also available to answer your questions will be Jason Few, who runs our Reliant Retail Business on our behalf; and Chris Moser, who is responsible for commercial operations at NRG.
  So to begin, as we know, the equity markets are relentlessly forward-looking, so I am going to spend most of my time looking forward as well. I do want to go over for a moment, and you should be looking at Slide 3, if you're following along in the presentation on what this company accomplished in the third quarter of 2010 and what we are in the process of accomplishing here today.
  We had another exceptionally strong performance with our second best-ever quarter from an EBITDA perspective with an able assist from favorable weather. But most importantly, thanks to our exceptional operating performance and robust hedge position, we largely mitigated the impact of gas prices trending relentlessly downward and heat rates moving sideways to post $777 million of adjusted EBITDA and $536 million of cash from operations. Certainly, our already strong current liquidity position was enhanced during the quarter by the bond financing that we did in August, but our liquidity was also strengthened as it has been for many quarters in a row by a very substantial contribution of free cash flow from the company's operating assets and businesses.
  Our strong performance year-to-date allows us to narrow our full year 2010 guidance to the top end of the present range. And while I had in my aspirations from the beginning of the year to reach the $2.6 billion level, which would've put us flat against our record-shattering performance in 2009, I am nonetheless very proud given the gravitational pull of near-term gas prices that we are on our way with performance in the $2.5 billion range.
  Indeed, you may recall that 12 months ago in the course of announcing an initial EBITDA guidance for 2010 of $2.2 billion, I conveyed to you that as a management team, we were not satisfied with that number. And we made a commitment to you, our shareholders, that we would not rest until we had improved substantially on that number. I feel that under the circumstances, we have delivered on that commitment.
  Today, I'm here to make another such commitment. As Chris will outline for you, we are initiating guidance for 2011 in the $2 billion range. Our financial prospects in the third year of commodity price recession, once again being subjected to the downward pressure of the significantly lower gas curve, our commitment to our shareholders again this year is that we will not rest until we have substantially improved our performance against the standard of this initial guidance. I can't promise you anything specific today with respect to our next fiscal year, which obviously doesn't begin for another two months. But if you check our record over the past six years, I think you will find that we have been pretty successful in exceeding expectations regarding our current operating and financial performance.
  I'd like to devote the remainder of my time to comment on a few important comments of our strategic positioning of this company, many of these areas of our business figure prominently in the thoughts of our investors since they have been introduced recently or will be in the near future. The company's strategic approach is in general terms depicted on Slide 4, five conventional priorities and five transformational green energy priorities. I feel that we've made significant progress against all ten of these priorities year-to-date. And during Q&A, I would be happy to talk about any or all of that. But due to time constraints, I'm going to limit my prepared remarks to the four Rs: reactors, renewables, retail and CCT acquisitions at a significant discount to replacement costs.
  Our goal in respect of our Conventional business, as shown on Slide 5, is to build our business on the foundation of a multi-fuel, across-the-merit-order, geographically advantaged generation portfolio at scale in each of our core markets. And in our principal market, which of course is Texas, matching up that diversified generation portfolio with the Retail Electricity business also at scale. As such, in this area, the four Rs are where much of our opportunity lay. In the case of new advanced nuclear power, there are two more Rs which are important. The first R is replacement power. Our nation's solid fuel base load fleet is very old and rapidly getting older as little to no new base load generation is being built. The oldest quartile of baseload generation this country needs to be replaced over the next decade. And given the development lead times for solid fuel generation, our view is that those of us who get started now will be advantaged.
  The final R stands for renaissance, and it's not yet clear how robust the nuclear renaissance will be here in the United States. But it is very clear that the world at large is well down the path towards a global nuclear renaissance worth hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions, and the owner or developers of the first new nuclear plant in the United States are going to have a very beneficial first mover advantage in that nuclear renaissance.
  But of course, the secure first mover advantage of the nuclear renaissance is you actually have to have a first mover project. The status of STP 3 & 4 has not changed significantly since our previous quarterly call. The lack of visible progress was to be expected since the gating item for most meaningful steps forward on the project, such as additional equity partners, has been and continues to be the DOE loan guaranty process and the related issue of funding appropriations. Since Congress has been in recess for most of the last three months, it's not surprising that there has been no development on the additional appropriation. 
  Nonetheless, significant progress continue to be made on all key fronts below the surface. From the perspective of NRG shareholders, we believe you should evaluate the present arrangement with respect to STP as illustrated on Slide 6 as follows. NRG has a limited obligation at currently a $1.5 million a month, an obligation to our partners to contribute to ongoing development spend until the loan guaranty is received and accepted. Nonetheless, recognizing NRG's very substantial financial contribution to the project development today of approximately $315 million, including a significant amount, which was funded during the first half of this year as a result of NRG assuming CPS share of the overall development spend, the project remains fully on schedule. This is due to the much appreciated stepped up contribution of our partners or, and we remain very much in contention for the valuable nuclear loan guaranty from the Department of Energy. As such, during this phase, the STP 3 & 4 development should be perceived by earnings from shareholders as a low cost option on a very large benefit opportunity with clearly defined exit ramps.
  Of course, the news affecting nuclear development in the United States during the past several weeks has had little to do with STP and much to do with the Calvert Cliffs project and the loan guarantees we issued cited by Constellation as their reason for withdrawing from the project. What I would tell you is that notwithstanding the superficial similarities between the two projects, and this is shown on the left side of Slide 7, the two projects actually are structured very differently. Obviously, they are in different markets with different rates of projected base load growth, but also they involve different risk allocation with respect to technology, completion risk and merchant offtake. We do not yet know precisely how these differences will play into the government's analysis of the loan guaranty fee for STP, but the government is well aware of the structural differences because they have been discussed at length by us with the DOE.
  As I am trying to depict on the right side of this page, we believe we're in the midst of the final stage of the government's determination of this issue. And so hopefully, we will be in the position to advise our investors within a few weeks of the outcome.
  Moving on Slide 8. We have transaction spending to purchase high efficiency load volume CCGTs in three of our four core regions, and we continue to push towards a prompt closing of these transactions. We are highly confident that Cottonwood will close in the very near future and that while Cottonwood in and of itself will be fairly unspectacular in its near-term contribution to EBITDA, given the subdued commodity price environment, cottonwood will play in the essential role in enabling us to renew the portfolio long-term offtake arrangements that South Central has with its key co-op customers, recognizing that a significant number of these contracts are up for renewal in 2014.
  As to the Dynegy assets, we remain very comfortable with the bargain we struck back in August, and we want the transaction to proceed on its present terms. With the commodity price curve for natural gas, bumping along its cyclical bottom, it is a good time to acquire generation assets. We are highly confident if we get the opportunity to close the Dynegy transactions. And over the entire commodity price cycle, our investment will be money well spent and that this portfolio, headlined by the strategically and geographically advance Moss Landing 1 and 2 will be a successful investment on behalf of NRG shareholders.
  If the Blackstone acquisition does not proceed and the opportunity to buy the set of CCGTs disappears, we are equally confident that we have very attractive alternative uses for the liquidity that will be freed up. Not only is it a good time to invest in well located CCGT that price is well below replacement cost, it's a good time to invest in low risk, high return solar projects, and that's something I'm about to talk about. And It's always a good time particularly at the current depressed price levels to buy NRG stock.
  Of course, our stock price performance seems to be constrained by the drop in gas prices and the flattening of the gas curve more generally. However, that fundamental connection between natural gas prices and the financial prospects of ITPs hence overlook the fact that our Reliant Retail business is countercyclical to natural gas, and the $600 million of year-to-date EBITDA that we are reporting today demonstrates the resilience of that countercyclicality. We have previously guided the markets to think of reliance in our hands as a $300 million year ""mid-cycle business"" for the course. That concept is very broad brush and indeed somewhat meaningless outside of financial modeling since in my 20 years experience, the mid-cycle never seems to last for more than a millisecond either in the natural gas or the key rate market. What we have tried to depict on Slide 9 is a slightly more nuanced and hopefully a significantly more accurate view of the earnings power of Reliant as a function of the natural gas price cycle.
  The upside of this analysis is that rather than thinking about Reliant as a $300 million year EBITDA mid-cycle business, we believe the markets should think of Reliant as a $400 million to $500 million year EBITDA business in all flat to modestly probing gas price environments. When natural gas prices are sharply decreasing, Reliant's earnings power can spike above $600 million a year. When natural gas prices are sharply increasing, Reliant's earnings power will dip below $400 million a year, with $300 million being more of a baseline, absent some extraordinary event.
  Moving on to our green initiatives on Slide 10. Our purchase of Green Mountain Energy, has received all necessary approvals and is ready to be closed in the very near future. As a general comment, I want to emphasize how important I think Green Mountain and the Green Mountain brand is going to be in transforming NRG's alternative energy future by trying to get to our various renewable generation businesses and initiatives and tying them to Green Mountain's own substantial and growing green energy customers.
  In the fast-growing world of green energy, as depicted on Slide 11, there is no brand that comes within a country mile of Green Mountain. As a stand-alone business, divorced from any association with NRG's renewables project or any support of NRG's commercial operation theme, Green Mountain is a solid business with a healthy EBITDA contribution relative to the purchase price. As such, even on its own, it's a welcome addition to the portfolio. But beyond that, Green Mountain will allow NRG to offer a match green wholesale green retail product to green energy consumers that's truly unique. And this is important because while the idea of top down imposition of a carbon regime on the American public is dead on arrival in the New Washington, the American consumer trend toward sustainability is going to continue. And indeed, in my opinion, it accelerate, lead by thought leaders of the next generation.
  Success with Green Mountain for us starts with a successful integration. At NRG, our track record of quick, efficient and effective integration of new acquisitions is one of the things I'm proud of at this company, both in the case of Texas Genco and Reliant Retail, we've demonstrated that complex businesses could be brought into the NRG camp in a matter that not only was non-destructive but which enable the newly-acquired businesses to equal or exceed their business objectives, virtually form the very beginning. The single key to our success in this regard is our emphasis on enabling the new businesses to continue to focus on what they do best while letting us take care of the rest. In the weeks ahead, we will be working closely with Green Mountain on the integration of their business enterprise into NRG, focusing on our the priorities listed on Slide 12. We intend to protect, preserve and extend our green identity to secure their core financial performance and to prioritize their opportunities for profitable expansion to new regions and products but particularly in respect to new market segments. We believe NRG can ably assist Green Mountain to move further up the C&I ladder to sell to bigger and more expensive retail orientations, which themselves want to short up their own sustainability credentials with their own customer base. In short, I'm extremely excited on what Green Mountain and NRG can accomplish working together. So you should, as they say, stay tuned.
  Turning to the Wholesale side of our green equation on Slide 13, we have talked about the immense opportunity we see in the solar space. But so far, it has been mainly anticipatory. What you already have begun to see over the past couple of weeks with the announcement of construction at Avanol and Ivanpha is that our development effort is beginning to bear a fruit. If all goes according to plan, you should expect to hear significantly more in the weeks to come as conservatively more solar projects to our development pipeline complete the usual development process and proceed into the construction phase.
  As we've stated previously and repeat on Slide 14, we feel that our solar investment strategy, being a validly multi-technology, multi-vendor and initially focused on the utility-sized projects with very long-term PPAs, is the precisely right strategy to capitalize on the opportunities and incentives currently available to the solar industry. The equity return on these projects, particularly when you consider the lack of merchant risk, the complete absence of environmental risk and the minimal completion risk and construction time, are as attractive on a risk-adjusted basis as any that I have seen over the course of my 20 years in this industry.
  And finally, before handing over to Mauricio, let me emphasize that we are mindful that our solid financial performance year-to-date in 2010 and our successful positioning of the company to take advantage of the very attractive growth opportunities that will arise as our industry transforms itself in response to the society's demand for sustainability have not yet translated into improving our share price. And as a consequence, our shareholders have suffered. We will do everything within our power to bring about that improvement, and we believe that the main thing we can do is execute on our plan as effectively and as quickly as possible. As listed on Slide 15, we have a great deal on our plate over the next six to nine months, and we hope that successful execution against these priorities will serve as a springboard for share price appreciation.
  Mauricio?

As you all know, the third quarter is critical for both our generation and retail segments. This summer, we experienced some of the warmest weather on record across our Northeast, South Central and Texas reg",1337,"  Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. As you all know, the third quarter is critical for both our generation and retail segments. This summer, we experienced some of the warmest weather on record across our Northeast, South Central and Texas regions. I am very pleased to report that we had another strong quarter from both an operational and financial perspective.
  Slide 17 highlights a few of the accomplishments achieved during the third quarter. As always, we remain focused on safety across the organization. And for the third quarter, we posted an ocean recordable rate of 0.88, a significant improvement from last summer and just shy of subsea levels. Our top performance improved across our entire fleet for the third quarter.
  Starting with our coal plant performance, the equivalent availability factor or EAF increased to 94.9% in the third quarter from 92.3% for the same period in 2009. This improvement was lead by our Limestone and facilities. Nuclear generation at STP had another outstanding quarter with 99% availability, and our oil and gas portfolio responded to the significant fees experienced in Texas, South Central and the Northeast by starting over 2,500x with a 99% reliability during these critical summer months.
  With respect to our construction projects, the Indian River environmental control project, continues to be on track and within budget to begin operations in January 2012. Our middle pound repowering project to build 200 megawatts of peaking capacity is somewhat scheduled to be operational by the summer of 2011. This is the second repowering project in our New England fleet. Our first project at Devon have been running successfully since it began operation this past summer.
  The BBA for El Segundo energy complex in California received CPUC approval in October. Demolition of work has started to make room for the construction of the new units, which I expected to be in service by the summer of 2013. Our core energy program stands at $83 million year-to-date and is on track to achieve the $98 million free cash flow goal for the year. Also, we have already identified projects and cost savings that will bring this program to completion by achieving the full goal of $150 million ahead of our 2012 for regional base.
  Finally, our commercial operations group took advantage of some market opportunity during this summer to increase our hedge profile in 2011, which I will discuss in more detail later in the presentation. In addition, they have successfully managed our retail supply under volatile market conditions, delivering strong financial results for two consecutive summers.
  Moving on to our client operations on Slide 18. Net generation increased by 8% this quarter over last year. This increase came primarily from our northeast plants, which benefited from lower than normal weather and a decreasing coal to gas switching, which was most prevalent in 2009. Also, nuclear generation was higher due to much improved availability from the third quarter of last year. Our base line portfolio, which includes both our coal and nuclear assets experienced significant reliability improvements during the third quarter compared to last year. Limestone and Indian River led the coal fleet with a clear and forced outage rates of 2.6% and 4%, respectively.
  Turning to our retail operations on Slide 19. We experienced another solid performance during the third quarter. Record weather in August and September across Texas created an opportunity to deliver higher volumes and stronger margin from our Mass segments. The Mass segment drove significant improvement in this customer attrition with the launch of the advertising campaign and innovative products. In addition, we maintained our low customer complaint rate through strong performance in retail operations. We continue to balance customer count and pricing to deliver higher than run rate margins that are more sustainable in the long term.
  In the C&I segment, we continue to improve win rates during the third quarter and extended the terms and diversity of our portfolio. Reliant remains the largest C&I provider in Texas, and we continue to leverage the strength of NRG to provide innovative products and services for our business customers. In summary, we're optimizing margin and customer count by delivering innovative products and excellent customer service.
  Turning to our hedge profile and commodity sensitivities on Slide 20. As illustrated in the chart on the upper left, we had increased our hedge profile for 2011 to 96% from 86% last quarter. This is consistent with our view that the gas markets continue to be under pressure given the high and resilient domestic production levels despite of low gas prices.
  With gas producers beginning to show some drilling restraint, hedged positions rolling off and indications that drilling to both acreage may be ending, we have chosen to remain relatively open beyond 2011 to benefit from an expected recovery in the gas markets. If we decide to add additional hedges in the other years, we would likely lean towards using option structures that allow us to participate in some upside, while protecting the portfolio for further decreases in gas prices. With respect to retail, we have increased our price, though, to 57% in 2011 from 50% in the second quarter. We continue to match as much generational load as possible to strike maximum synergies between our Retail and Wholesale portfolios.
  In order to match our incremental power hedges, our growth hedges increased over 2011 from 78% last quarter to 88% as illustrated on the upper right chart. We also remain well hedged in terms of coal transportation for some time. We continue to limit our commodity price sensitivity in 2011 as illustrated in the lower left chart with 2012 to 2013 through '15 largely unchanged.
  Moving on to Slide 21. The quarter-on-quarter demand growth for continues to the positive trend for the weather normalized load growth for the year at around 2%. In August, set multiple consecutive big loads and achieved a new all-time record big load of 65.7 kilowatts, an increase of almost 4% from the previous record set in July of last year. In PJM, the weather normalized load growth continues to be fairly present. However, the warmer than normal weather drove significant load increases across the Northeast, and total load off was up 7% to 9% higher as compared to third quarter of 2009. In Texas, recovery remains to be well supported during the first half of the year. There's a continued robust demand, higher supply, time retirement and the continued lack of capital for merchant projects. We expect the Texas market to continue showing robust fundamentals.
  Moving on to the environmental front. 2011 will provide a lot more clarity around environmental growth and requirement for our facility. As we have mentioned in previous presentations, we currently have a plan to invest approximately $700 million over the next four years in the environmental projects, failure to comply with these future regulations. Starting with Cedar, the proposed rules does not require additional capital for compliance. With respect to MACT, our client considers mercury controls on local units. While a worst-case scenario to control acid gas could result in additional environmental capital for 1,900 megawatts at Parish and 1,500 megawatt at Big Cajun. We don't expect this to be the likely scenario.
  In terms of master pulling, intake qualifications on reborrowing are expected to achieve desired results. For example, originating targets today with extreme qualifications at our Arcotil [ph] plant in New York. Finally, NRG does not face the challenges of converting from web surface implants to landfills as we have assets also at all our core facilities.
  Our near-term operational priorities are listed on Slide 22. As we move into 2011, we remain focused on excellence in safety and operational performance. We will continue to constantly evaluate the impact of various environmental regulations and our term maintenance and capital spend, particularly in the face of a challenging commodity price environment and determine the best cost benefit decision for each of our assets.
  With that, I will turn it over to Chris, who will discuss our financial results.

413857,114779758,86538,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","  Thank you, Mauricio. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our discussion of NRG's third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Beginning with Slide 24, our financial results remained strong with $777 million of adjusted EBITDA for the third",1555,"  Thank you, Mauricio. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our discussion of NRG's third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Beginning with Slide 24, our financial results remained strong with $777 million of adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter and $2.071 billion of adjusted EBITDA year-to-date. During the quarter, Reliant Energy contributed $209 million of adjusted EBITDA to our results compared to $306 million in EBITDA for the third quarter of '09. This difference is largely explained by lower margins on newly acquired customers and existing customer renewals as well as lower customer accounts.
  Meanwhile, the Wholesale business contribute $568 million of adjusted EBITDA during Q3. The $32 million decline compared to Q3 2009 Wholesale performance can be largely attributed to the following. In the Northeast region, lower base load hedges were partially offset by a 37% increase in generation due to warmer than expected weather during the quarter. In Texas, a 5% increase in generation and the benefits of lower operations and maintenance costs were offset by a 20% increase in fuel costs, driven by new coal transportation contract at our Parish facility. Meanwhile, the south-central region benefited from the addition of a new contract with the regional municipality, leading to a 17% increase in megawatt hour sold and a 23% increase in the average realized energy price per megawatt hour. Also contributing to the results of south-central region was an 8% increase in load due in part to warmer weather.
  Turning to year-to-date results. Reliant Energy contributed $594 million of EBITDA, $58 million greater than 2009 EBITDA of $536 million. Excluding the $227 million of EBITDA generated in the first four months of 2010 for comparative year-to-date analysis since the acquisition was completed in May of '09, EBITDA results were lower by $169 million. This decline is driven by a 19% decline in mass margins, which were the result of price reductions following the acquisition and lower margins and customer renewal and acquisitions, reflective of the current competitive marketplace.
  The Wholesale business year-to-date generated $1.477 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $116 million lower as compared to the first three quarters of 2009. The comparative year-to-date decline is largely explained by lower base load hedges in the Northeast, lower margins in Texas, caused by higher transportation costs, offset somewhat by better contributions from the south-central region. At September 30, the company's liquidity position stood at approximately $4.8 billion. Impacting this liquidity position during the third quarter were the following items. We repurchased $130 million of NRG shares at a volume weighted average cost of $20.80 per share. These shares, combined with the $50 million repurchase in the second quarter, brings the 2010 share repurchase program to a close at $180 million or 8.4 million shares purchase at a volume weighted average cost of $21.26 per share.
  On August 20, the company issued $1.1 billion of 8.25% senior notes due 2020, with the proceeds we use for general corporate purposes, including a funding of a recently announced acquisitions. And on October 12, NRG completed $190 million tax exempt financing in relation to the environmental work to be completed at our Indian River facility, which is not yet reflected in current liquidity. The company closed the third quarter in a strong financial position to complete the three recently announced acquisitions of Dynegy assets, Cottonwood and Green Mountain Energy totaling $2.238 billion.
  Now turn to Slide 25. As I mentioned a moment ago, total liquidity, excluding funds deposited by hedged counter-parties remained strong at nearly $4.8 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion from the year end 2009. The increase is principally driven by $1.1 billion increase in total cash and largely explained by continued strong cash flow from operations and proceeds from capital market transactions of about $1.3 billion.
  During the first three quarters of 2010, we also made debt repayments of $529 million, which include a reduction of a Term Loan B debt of $247 million and the early settlement of the common stock finance fund of $190 million and completed capital expenditures excluding those in NINA of $274 million, consisting largely of $119 million of normal maintenance and $132 million of environmental CapEx.
  Finally, before turning to the next slide, as you can see in the lower right, we continue to have ample capacity under our first lien to execute hedges on our base load business when appropriate. The first lien remains a very useful tool to both execute such hedges and preserve other sources of liquidity necessary to assist future growth.
  Now turning to our 2010 full year guidance update on Slide 26. As a result of a strong performance of the business in the third quarter, we have narrowed our guidance to the upper end of the original range to $2.5 billion to $2.55 billion. At the same time, because of the increase in EBITDA expectations, lower than anticipated income tax of $50 million, $92 million of debt funding for the Indian River environmental work, all offset by an increase in collateral postings during the third quarter of $86 million, we have increased guidance for free cash flow before growth investments to about $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion. Meanwhile, we are lowering our free cash flow guidance for the full year to about $700 million to $750 million. The decrease is a result of increased growth investments of $225 million in the fourth quarter, which includes our El Segundo repowering project and the majority balance for projects, both previously announced and currently planned.
  Based on Wednesday's closing stock price of $20.4 and our updated outlook, the free cash flow before growth yield currently stands at between 24% to 25% or $4.77 to $4.97 per share.
  Now turning to preliminary guidance on Slide 27. As you can see, we currently expect our full year 2011 consolidated EBITDA guidance to be in a range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Included in this guidance range are Wholesale expectations of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, which includes our announced acquisitions. In comparison to the current 2010 Wholesale EBITDA forecast, our Wholesale guidance for 2011 is largely impacted by low overall hedge prices, lower expected capacity prices in the Northeast and normalized weather. Somewhat offsetting these decreases are reductions in our anticipated O&M and G&A spend across the company, which is expected to come in 6% lower in 2011 than in 2010. As Mauricio discussed earlier, we are nearly 100% hedged for 2011 and are just confident of our forecasted results. As we look forward to our Wholesale business in 2012, we are currently in excess of 50% hedge, but at significantly higher prices in 2011 as indicated in our current SEC filings.
  Due to this position, coupled with the current commodity market conditions, we expect flat to marginally lower year-on-year Wholesale results in 2012 from 2011. For our Retail business in 2011, our current expectations, assuming normal weather, are an EBITDA range of between $480 million to $570 million. The decrease in 2011 guidance compared to current 2010 forecast is largely explained by lower unit margin Reliant Mass business. Reliant C&I business margins are also expected to decline but be partially offset by higher territorial reserve reflecting our continued dedication to this growing client base.
  Finally, we expect Green Mountain Energy to contribute between $70 million to $80 million of EBITDA. As David discussed earlier, we are very excited about enhancing the growth prospects for new our Green Energy Retail business.
  We are similarly excited by our solar development prospects. And on Slide 28, this illustrates this potential. This slide represents our four-year net equity commitment to 500 megawatts of solar projects, both announced and planned the coming months, as well as their respective EBITDA contribution of $175 million by 2014. We are committed to investing in this financially value-enhancing promising pipeline of projects and look forward to sharing with you both our current progress and future opportunity as we have identified to extend our solar footprint.
  On Slide 29, we have provided our projected year end cash position for 2011 of approximately $1.5 billion. Assume in this calculation, our cash flow estimates from guidance, the completion of outstanding acquisitions of $2.238 billion and expected debt repayment under our Term Loan B agreements. As such, when reviewing our capital allocation plans, we usually maintain a minimum cash balance of $700 million, largely for margin working capital, margin requirements, the timing of cash payments of interest, property taxes and the like as well as equity for the project that we have under construction throughout the year. Thus, in 2011, estimate a balance of about $785 million to allocate between share buybacks and further investments in high growth opportunities.
  The decision to deploy these funds in 2011 will be dependent on a number of factors, such as the size of our restricted payment basket and continued availability of attractive projects to invest in. We would hope to update this allocation with improved precision at our 2010 year-end results call.
  In closing, we are very proud of our ability to continue to deliver solid results despite the current commodity market climate. As we move forward, we remain committed to a prudent allocation of capital to create further opportunity for business growth and to return value to our shareholders.
  Now I'll pass it back to David for final comments.

Before we open the line for questions, let me just make three quick points for you to keep in mind. The first is I think that we're demonstrating, as I said, even three years into the commodity price down cycle, we're showing uneven in these circumstances the company is demonstrating substantial free cash flow generation.
  Secondly, we do have investment opportunities lead by solar, which are very attractive in absolute terms and from a risk perspective and also are much shorter in terms of how soon they contribute to EBITDA because of the shorter construction cycle. And finally, to follow on Chris' last point, we do have substantial liquidity to deploy. And I think our track record over the last six years has indicated our ability to allocate and deploy capital in a manner that enhances the value of the company from medium to long term.

I'm not sure that I predicted a full recovery in the year 2012, but maybe a guy will hung up on that. I mean, why did we not go after the full company of Dynegy, I would say that we didn't feel that with the exposure that the company has in terms of the coal assets, and I think that you know from the SEC filings that Dynegy is listed in terms of the description of the discussions that occurred with that. We made it very clear from the beginning that we were not interested in owning the Midwest coal assets. And that was really a factor, two factors that caused us to feel that way. One, as you yourself mentioned, we have a significant amount of that in our own portfolio already. And the second thing, and we've been consistent about this ever since the response to the Exelon situation, as we consider the Midwest, in my seven years in this company, we have never been attracted to the Midwest as a place where we really want to be very active. And I would say that lack of interest in the Midwest has gotten greater over those years because we find the prospects for demand growth in the Midwest. In the Midwest, the country are more challenging than on the coast, and we also think that the Midwest market is being coal-on-coal competition for the most part. That's not very attractive to begin with. But also, we think it's subject to a risk from a build out of wind capacity coming out of it. And so that just wasn't our cup of tea. And obviously, those a big part of the overall value of Dynegy.

But if the Dynegy transaction was defeated, a, obviously we would have no idea why it was defeated or what the plan of Dynegy would be going forward and whether the assets that we had contracted to sale would be available for sale from someone else. If someone offered those assets to us, we were free of our obligation -- when were free from our obligation to Blackstone to consider, we obviously would consider it. And to me, it's a blinding glimpse of the obvious. But given the change in the gas curves since August, we would be offering a lower price. I'm not going to talk about how much of a lower price. But there is another factor is that, we would have to be certain that whoever we were buying the assets from, the transaction was structured in a way that was bankruptcy remote, that we were not subject to a potential unwinding of the transaction due to fraudulent conveyance. So that would be a potential obstacle as well. So the potential permutations of what might happen are so great. That's about all I can tell you right now. On the alternative use of the liquidity, I'll just repeat what we've said. We have a lot of investment opportunities. The Dynegy assets were particularly attractive to us, but they're not the only combined cycle power plant in the United States that are on the market today. And I previously stated in many meetings that I actually thought that the absolute best time to be buying combined cycle power plants most probably can be in the first part of 2012. And then of course, there's the possibility of redeploying the capital in terms of return of capital to stakeholders. And obviously, there is the possibility for share buyback. But as we did borrow money in August in order to finance the Dynegy transaction, there's also the possibility of paying down some debt. So, Chris, did you want to...

But, however, if there's an upturn in gas, then we would expect to see an increasing result of around $60 million during the year. There's also some variability in our gas leak results. So with an increase in both gas prices and heat rates, there could be an upward revision of sort of $15 million for them. Also, as we said during the presentation, we have built-in a 6% decrease in costs across our O&M and G&A with about $1 billion of costs. If there are additional 1% to 2% decreasing cost, then that can obviously add to our results as well. And as David said, the management team, we're very much focused on the improvements we can squeeze out of the business. In retail, the range that we have in there contemplates certain load variability due to weather. And then also, if we see lower than expected attrition rates than we previously forecast, that would increase results. Also, if there is a decline in gas and this speaks sort of to the hedge against our Wholesale business, then that would most likely improve results for Reliant. And finally, it's very clear that we guided $500 million of EBITDA for 2010, and we've exceeded that by nearly $200 million we expect to for the year. So changes in weather and other changes to the exogenous markets, obviously, have a very large influence on those results.

They have averaged a compound annual growth of the 20% to 25% range. And so again, being cautious people as we sort of project forward, we don't project that type of increase because again we're cautious people. But they demonstrated that over each of the last four or five years. And certainly, we think that as I mentioned in my comments, the Green Mountain can penetrate into markets that they haven't, and they've been moving outside of Texas. Their principal area of expansion to date had been in New York City, and we wanted to think in a sort of methodical way. But certainly, we think there are other markets in the Northeast that they can move into. But I think the most obvious thing is that as a small company in the C&I business, Green Mountain has focused on very, very small commercial customer. And our sense and I think there are a lot of anecdotes and data points on this, I'll spare you my Philadelphia cream cheese example, but -- so it seems that a growing number of businesses in the United States that are facing the American consumer are seeing the benefit of sending a Green Energy message. And we think that's the trend it's going to accelerate in, and we expect Green Mountain to be a big part of that trend. So we think there's multiple avenues for growth with Green Mountain, and really, the most challenging one is which ones we prioritize and focus on so we don't spread too fast.

Is that loan of guaranty driven because obviously you wouldn't have a PPA by then or some of the other old frames you mentioned?

But really, to me, it comes down to basically two sort of interconnected exits. One is the loan guaranty and the others the that PPA obligation, and they're tied together because the PPA obligation has the condition of the loan guarantee. And, Jay, what I can say is it's always hard to predict the development business, and we clearly get subject to complete impact in Washington, where there's just no money that's appropriated for nuclear loan guarantees even though I think President Obama yesterday said that when I'm told, I didn't see despite when he was asked, which areas does our room for cooperation with the Republic, and I think I would sell a nuclear with the first thing of the second thing that you've said. And so in a sense, we should think that there's a scenario, where the election result is beneficial. But the nuclear needs, the loan guaranty appropriation, and if that doesn't happen, obviously, that's a very, very clear exit ramp. The slightly less clear exit ramp is, okay, we got the loan guaranty, but conditional on offtake and what I would tell you about that is that our sense because we're working the offtake question very hard right now is that within a few months of getting the loan guarantee, we'll know whether or not the offtake is going to happen. And if we don't get that within a few months, the fact we have always said to our shareholders that we would not go forward with STP 3 & 4 as a fully emerging plan. The amount of offtake that's being required by the DOE is pretty much the same as what that we were going to insist exist upon anyway. So the exact timing is uncertain, Jay. But I certainly expect that by the summer of 2011, assuming we got the loan guaranty well before that, we should know whether or not the offtake's going to happen or not going to happen.
