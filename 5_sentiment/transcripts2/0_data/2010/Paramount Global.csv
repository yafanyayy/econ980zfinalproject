Good afternoon, everyone. I thank you for being with us today. I am certain that all of you know how delighted I am to be speaking to you today in the light of the fabulous results shown by CBS and the terrific performance of Les and his team. In the past year, CBS reduced expenses, improved its financial position and ensured that all the right people and processes were in place, so that CBS would significantly outperform as the market turned and the market is turning. With disciplined management and a solid long-term strategy for growth, there is no economic storm that a company like CBS cannot weather. With all of this, one thing is for sure, content is king and we'll always be king, and no one has better content out there than CBS and one other company whose name I cannot mention today.Our content focus continues to pay out throughout the company. CBS, the premium number one network, has won new and returning hit shows than any other network. Showtime continues its creative and financial role. We're growing our presence in all the most important areas of the digital world. On the local front, our focus on the largest TV and radio markets means we're in the right place as these businesses are rapidly improved, and they are improving. Through hard work, through determination, Les and his team have put CBS in a position to reap the benefits of the improving economic environment, which we're witnessing today. In these, Les and his team have done every possible thing this past year to ensure that CBS is on the path to succeed. On that, there'd be no misunderstanding, our fourth quarter results are not only a sign of the momentum we have gained across all the company. But remember this, they are a preview of great things to come well into the future."

Thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to be giving you a look at a very good quarter. We've managed our way through a difficult economic environment and emerged even stronger, and we're now being helped by a marketplace that is steadily improving. This is a message that you've heard from our peers in recent weeks, and we are clearly a prime beneficiary of the recovering economy. The pacing games we saw throughout the fourth quarter are gathering even more momentum in 2010. Today, I'm going to briefly review our fourth quarter results and operational highlights and discuss what we are seeing in 2010. And then I'll turn it over to our CFO, Joe Ianniello, to offer some more details on our financials and balance sheet, and then we'll happily take your questions.As we promised, each quarter in 2009 came in better than the one before. The second was better than the first, the third was better than the second, culminating in the fourth quarter where we had our best revenue performance of the year. Our revenues of $3.5 billion were virtually even with the same quarter last year, and our second half revenues were up 11% over the first half, once again speaking to our momentum. Also on an adjusted basis, our OIBDA [Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization], operating income and EPS were all up double digits. The revenue picture continues to brighten for us, largely due to the strength of our industry-leading content and the improvement in our Local businesses. On the content side, CBS is the most watched network on television, and we're selling our hit shows into syndication earlier at better rates and to a broader local audience than ever. Our premium cable network, Showtime, continues to add subscribers and grow its revenues and profits. We're also expanding and monetizing our leading global online presence and more efficiently distributing our content in major local TV and radio markets.Our fourth quarter results reflect all of this, as well as the improved business marketplace. At the same time, we spent the past year working to reduce our cost structure across the company. We have recently removed $250 million in expenses, and our commitment to containing these expenses will continue. As I stated, we are now reporting a much improved OIBDA, $569 million for the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis, up 11% from a year ago. Our adjusted operating income, net earnings and EPS all turned in terrific increases as well. Operating income was up 16% to $422 million, net earnings were up 23% to $171 million and EPS was up 19% to $0.25 per share. We are pleased that our businesses have rebounded so strongly in the fourth quarter and have great momentum into the first quarter of 2010.Our financial position is also stronger. As you know, in 2009, we refinanced near-term debt and secured a new credit facility, enhancing our financial security well into the future. Joe will touch on this a bit more later.Our businesses continue to generate very healthy free cash flow, $828 million for the year with $295 million of that coming in the fourth quarter. In addition, we finished 2009 with $717 million of cash on hand. And the good news is, as we've mentioned, the momentum has not only carried into the new year it's accelerating. National advertising is up, and we're seeing pacing levels at or well above last year in just about every local TV and radio market, with particular strength in key categories like auto and financial services. With our new segment structure reporting structure in place, you can clearly see the continued strength of our Content businesses, which include Entertainment, Cable Networks and Publishing and ongoing improvement on our Local businesses, Local Broadcasting and Outdoor.Now let's take a quick look at our financial and operational highlights, beginning with our Content Group and its largest segment, Entertainment. As you know, our Entertainment segment includes the CBS Television Network, our TV Production and Distribution businesses, our new Films business and CBS Interactive. Entertainment revenues, $1.8 billion, were up 4% in the fourth quarter from last year. The biggest revenue driver was television advertising, which increased 8% versus fourth quarter '08. As we've maintained our focus on reducing program expenses and other costs in this business, we've improved our operating leverage as well. OIBDA of $191 million was up 10%. The ongoing strength of the CBS Television Network was front and center in the success we saw on the quarter. We are number one for the season to date and up year-over-year in every major demographic. We have more top 10 shows than any other network and more top 20 shows than all other networks combined, and we are the most watched television network, six out of seven nights of the week.We've also drawn record audiences for our recent tenfold events. Our Grammys telecast pulled the largest audience in six years, nearly 26 million viewers, up 35% over last year. The average audience of 47 million viewers for the AFC Championship game last month was our largest ever and the most for any AFC Championship game since 1986. And as you know, the Super Bowl, two weeks ago, was the most watched program in television history, with 106.5 million average viewers, eclipsing the match series finale in 1983, which was also on CBS, by the way.After the game, we premiered our new reality series, UNDERCOVER BOSS, and we couldn't have asked for a better debut, nearly 39 million tuned in, and we're encouraged by the strong rating from the show's second air in this past Sunday night as well. Along with NCIS L.A. and The Good Wife, we now have the top three new shows on television. Partially due to the Super Bowl promos, our programming on Monday after the game was the highest rated this season to date and the lift continued throughout the week. We've been saying for a long time that in a fragmented but socially networked universe, big event and hit programming will be more popular and more relevant than ever. And it's also true that broadcast television continues to be the best bang for an advertiser's buck each and everyday. The fact is, TV viewership for the five major network is up this season over last year, look at the Grammys, look at the Super Bowl, look at the Olympic Games. And you may have heard some issues about late night over the last few months. I'll just say we're very happy with our performance in that day part. David Letterman and Craig Ferguson are both number one in their time period and continue to put on a great show night after night.And on another positive note, being the network with the largest number of golf events, the return of Tiger Woods is a welcome one. The breadth and strength of our programming, not only big events but our lineup overall, is helping us to excel in a very strong marketplace. Primetime scatter-applied pricing was up an average of 25% over upfront in the fourth quarter and is now up more than 30% in the first. The scatter market remains extremely hot right now, and this ad strength for the network is real. And as you know, Super bowl ads sold out well advance of the game at very favorable rates, representing a nice profit for us. Of course, it also helps when you own programming that's performing so well. 11 of the 20 top shows on TV are in CBS. And through CBS Television Studios, we own more than half of them. That means we're not only benefiting from advertising today, but also we'll benefit both today and for years to come in syndication. And the good news is that the syndication market, both domestically and internationally, has never been stronger.I talked on our last call about how we made a record-breaking deal to sell NCIS L.A. into domestic syndication after just seven episodes on the air. Globally as well, the marketplace has been terrific. NCIS L.A. is now licensed in 192 markets, and The Good Wife is licensed in 181 markets. As our Syndication business continues to grow, both in total dollars and as a percentage of our revenue, these deals are diversifying our revenue base, making it more recurring and more predictable, providing stability well into the future. So once again, the industry has changed to our benefit. Yes, CBS, still, is the number one network, but we are all now also operating in an environment where we own most of our programming and take advantage of a syndication market place that continues to grow year after year.We have also established retransmission consent fees as a significant secondary revenue stream. We more than tripled our retransmission revenues in 2009 versus 2008. It's now a substantial figure, and we expect it to grow again this year. At CBS, we're very pleased about the increasing attention paid to retrans. We've been saying for a while that this would be a game changer for us, and now it is. We've done 56 deals and counting, including the recent major ones with Time Warner Cable, Cablevision and DISH. Meanwhile, we are selectively putting our content online. Our online strategy of putting non-exclusive distribution deals for our content continues to work very well for us. At CBS Interactive, through our wholly-owned TV.com and CBS.com, we are successfully getting our shows online, along with the shows of other, but never at the expense of cannibalizing our network content. The marketplace at Interactive is also growing strongly with display advertising picking up nicely. We are pacing up high teens this quarter, with particular strength in areas like games and sports. And we're gearing up now for March Madness on Demand [MMOD], which we expect will be even better this year than last.A few words about CBS Films, which is just getting started. In this business, our risks are limited, and the world is always seeking to content. The potential gain can be high. Our first film did not perform nearly as well as we would have liked. We were disappointed. However, the budget was modest about $30 million, and the advertising and promotion expenses were helped by reach and power of our own media properties. We have three more films coming up this year, and we will continue to report on our progress.Turning to our Cable Networks, an important source of subscription revenues for us, this segment, which includes Showtime Networks and CBS College Sports, was one of our strongest performers in the fourth quarter. Revenues of $347 million were up 8% year-over-year. And OIBDA of $153 million was up 46%, once again, expanding our base of recurring revenue. Cable Networks' financial performance was driven by growth rates and subscribers at both Showtime and College Sports. Showtime Networks finished the year with 61.3 million subscriptions, up 2.6% from fourth quarter '08. Most recent industry data shows at Showtime was the only premium network to significantly grow subscribers in 2009.CBS College Sports had 35 million subscriptions at year end, up 9.5 million from the prior year. The latest award season improved once again, just how popular Showtime original programming is with the audience. Our hit shows, Dexter and the United States of Tara, were big winners at both the Golden Globe's and the SAG [Screen Actors Guild] Awards. Last month, we began rolling out a new slater programming that I'm sure will build upon the incredible success we've already had with Showtime. The final component of our Content Group is Publishing, and this business had a very strong year content-wise. Simon & Schuster ended 2009 with a total of 164 New York Times bestsellers and more hit the number one spot, 25 in total, than in 2008. Fourth quarter revenues were $220 million, OIBDA was $13.6 million. We are seeing signs of a better marketplace here as well, and we're exploring new revenue opportunities on a variety of new eReader platforms that are now coming in to the marketplace. We just concluded a deal to make our content available on the Apple iPad, the viewing next month, and we look forward to other deals as well.Overall, our Content Group made $2.4 billion in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2009, up 3% from a year ago and OIBDA of $357 million, up 16%. Delivering results like this in the economically challenging year we've gone through is a testament to our strategy of focusing, first and foremost, on creating the best content and effectively monetizing it as well.Turning to our Local Group, which includes our Local Broadcasting and Outdoor segments, the fourth quarter was by far the best of the year with the revenues of $1.16 billion and OIBDA of $296 million. Nowhere is the recovery more apparent than at our TV and radio stations. Fourth quarter Local Broadcasting revenues of $680 million were our highest of the year by a wide margin, and OIBDA of $227 million for the quarter was up 31% from fourth quarter '08.At our TV Stations, non-political revenues were up 11% year-over-year on the quarter, and the outlook keeps improving. So far this year, our TV Station groups, as a whole, is pacing up by high teens on average from the same period last year, and our top 10 stations are pacing even higher than that. Certainly helped by our 10 p.m. primetime program, many of our stations are in first or second place in late news, and we're expecting an extra lift from political this year. Given the unusually large number of settled [ph] (43:40) seats that have come into play, clearly, there are going to be some hard fought battles around the country. And the barriers, recently removed by the Supreme Court, will bring added political dollars into the market.Meanwhile, Radio is also a really strong story. As we promised you late last year and to some skepticism from many, Radio will be showing plus signs in the first quarter. Average pacing has been rising in 2010 and is well ahead of last year. This success is driven by the performance of our bigger markets. While we are pacing up by mid-single digits overall, our top 10 radio markets are pacing up by low teen. Radio's steady improvement has now only been the result of our improving economy. Our focus on programming has been instrumental as well. Our top 10 markets grew average audience share by 10% in 2009 in markets like New York and Los Angeles, implemented new formulas to gain to a multiples of that. And CBS radio stations had the number ones audience share in five of the top 10 markets for 2009: New York, Chicago, Dallas, Philadelphia and Boston.Our final Local Group segment is Outdoor where the recovery has been slower but also clear. Fourth quarter revenues were $484 million and OIBDA was $69 million. But pacing here, too, is improving steadily. Right now in the first quarter, our Outdoor business, as a whole, is pacing even with last year at this time. And as you know, this is the best level of pacing we have seen in a year. At the same time, we're entering into new deals at much better terms than in the past. And as revenues begin to come back, we are confident we will see the benefit in our results.As you can see across the board, 2009 ended on a high notes for us. Our content is performing better than ever, and our local assets are improving dramatically as the economy recovers. And as 2010 gets into full swing, top-line trends are continuing to move in our favor. To make no mistake, we have no intention of using rising revenues as an excuse to let costs creep back into our businesses. We'll stay focused on improving efficiencies, making sure that more of the top-line growth we expect translates into free cash flow for our investors.From our leading content to a growing syndication marketplace, to significant retransmission consent revenues, to rising political spending, I feel very confident about the ongoing strength of this company for this year and beyond. With that, I'll hand it over to Joe who will give you more detail on our financial performance and what to expect in 2010. Joe?"

Today, I'd like to focus my comments on four areas: First, review our fourth quarter results for the company; second, highlight some segment information; third, discuss our liquidity position; and lastly, outline what we see in 2010.Starting",1737,"Thanks, Les. Today, I'd like to focus my comments on four areas: First, review our fourth quarter results for the company; second, highlight some segment information; third, discuss our liquidity position; and lastly, outline what we see in 2010.Starting with our results, as Les noted, revenues for the quarter were $3.5 billion, down 0.8% from a year ago when we benefited from strong political advertising. This was our highest revenue quarter of the year, building on last quarter where we had five shows going into syndication. Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter came in at $569 million, up 11% from the prior year. OIBDA is being adjusted for only impairment charges both this year and last. During the fourth quarter of this year, we took a $178 million non-cash charge to reduce the value of FCC licenses in certain radio markets. And in Q4 of last year, we recorded a $64 million charge related to the sale of some radio stations.We continue to benefit from strong cost-savings initiatives across the company. We now have exceeded $250 million of annualized saving, and we see more to come, which I will discuss in a bit.We also benefited from lower restructuring charges. However, this benefit was offset by the lack of political advertising. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.25 for the quarter, up 19%. We are only adjusting for the impairment charges that I just discussed and some discrete tax benefits from settling some income tax audits. You can see full reconciliations of these adjustments in our press release.Turning to our segments, this is the first quarter that you see our results in the new segment presentation. In mid-January, we filed historical results in our new format via an 8-K. We also posted historical tables on our Investor Relations website. In addition to our new segments, we provided revenue by type in our press release to give you more detail on the various sources of the company's revenue. We also modified this table slightly.Let's start with Entertainment. Revenues for the quarter were up 4%, led by 8% growth in ad sales at the CBS Network. Scatter pricing during the quarter was up 25%, above upfront and gaining momentum from the increasingly strong demand. Leading categories were automotive, financial services and retail. Ad sales at CBS Interactive decreased 5% for the quarter, but the tide started turning during the back half of the quarter. More on that later.Our Entertainment OIBDA for the quarter was up 10% to $191 million, driven by higher revenue, lower restructuring costs, offset by increased investment into content. Revenues at our Cable segment were up 8% during the quarter driven by increases in both rates and subscribers. OIBDA was up 46% from higher revenues and the mix of cable programming. Obviously, this is not a normalized flow-through of revenue. Looking at the full year is more representative of the earnings power of this segment. So looking at the year, revenue grew 7% and OIBDA grew 18%, putting our Cable Nets [Cable Networks] at a 34% margin.Publishing revenues for the quarter decreased 10% due to the soft retail market and fewer titles released this quarter, which caused EBITDA to drop from $28 million to $14 million. We will continue to manage costs, while we play a critical role in the fast-evolving e-book industry.Local Broadcast revenues were down 8% for the quarter, of which TV Stations were down 3% and Radio down 12%. Remember, we took in significant political dollars in 2008, which accounted for 14 points of the decline in TV. And for Radio, you should note that we have 10 less stations from our divestitures in 2009, which accounted for two points of its decline. TV Stations were the first to see signs of the recovery, which started to benefit Radio in the quarter. And in December, Radio had its best month of the year for revenue, led by the automotive category, which was up high single digits.On an OIBDA level, we were up 31% for the quarter, benefiting from our reduced costs as well as a gain on the sale of some spectrum and the absence of last year's restructuring costs, offset by lower political advertising. Outdoor revenues decreased 8% for the quarter. Foreign exchange contributed favorably four points of that change. Breaking this down further, in constant dollars, the Americas were down 10%, and Europe and Asia are down 15%. Contributed to this decline is also the fact that we had fewer transit contracts, as we've been disciplined in our approach to renewing these types of contracts. Our occupancy rate for the quarter increased slightly, and pricing began to firm up during the quarter. OIBDA dropped from $98 million to $69 million quarter-over-quarter due to the fixed nature of the transit contracts. As Les noted, we are continuously entering into new deals on more favorable terms. Next, a few words about our liquidity profile. As Les mentioned, our free cash flow was $295 million for the quarter and $828 million for the full year. Cash on hand at 12/31/09 was $717 million. This is almost $300 million more than when we started the year. We were able to build our cash balances, while at the same time, deleveraging the company. We will continue to focus on deleveraging throughout 2010. With our new credit facility in place and having refinanced $1 billion last year, we are in a much stronger financial position.Let's talk about 2010. 2010 for us is going to be about three things: First, driving top-line growth; second, a continued commitment to controlling costs; and third, generating significant levels of free cash flow. Here's how we see things shaping up so far. We're confident 2010 is going to be better financially than in 2009. How much better will be determined in part by the pace of the economic recovery since advertising continues to be an important factor to our revenue base. Our Content Group should have another solid year. As you know, our content asset's comprised about 70% of total revenues, and the outlook is strong. Scatter pricing at the network in the first quarter is now up by more than 30% over upfront. And Q1 ad sales is pacing up high teens for our interactive unit.The huge Super Bowl performance in Q1 will also drive revenues. It was the most revenue we ever generated for a Super Bowl. Our affiliate and subscription revenue grew steadily. And incremental film revenues will be recognized as our films are released throughout the year. On the syndication front, I should remind you that we do not have the five major titles hitting syndication that we had last year in the third quarter. But not to worry because our studio had six new shows on the air in their first season. They only not make it into syndication, but we continued to replenish the pipeline. In addition, Showtime will have some original series available to syndication down the road. Now for our local assets, we're focused on returning these businesses back to growth, while finding new ways to monetize our valuable content. And with an improved cost structure, even a small rebound will have a significant margin impact. Retransmission fees will be another important contributor of growth. We expect these fees to exceed $100 million in 2010, and we are well on our way to surpassing our $250 million target, which now seems conservative from when we first provided it a few years ago. I want to emphasize that these fees are earned by both our TV station and the CBS Network, and thus will be reflected in our Local Broadcasting and Entertainment segments. Later in the year, we expect political advertising to drive strong growth at our Local Broadcasting segment. With the Supreme Court's recent decision and our stations located in key states, this mid-term election could be a record political year. But for now, here's what we see. While Q1 isn't finished yet, we are pacing at our TV station group up high teens, with our 14 owned and operated CBS stations pacing north of 30%. Radio stations are pacing up mid-single digits, with our top 10 markets showing low teen increases, driven by several advertising categories. This is the first quarter that we are seeing real growth at radio since the separation from Viacom. As Les said, the format changes our team has made in key markets are paying off.Our Outdoor group is currently pacing flat, but gaining pace points each week. On the cost side, we will continue to drive further efficiencies. We've taken steps to restructure our operations. Early in 2010, we expect to record a restructuring charge of approximately $50 million across the company that will lead to annual savings at least one times that amount. As we experience a return to top-line growth and to continue to benefit from the cost reductions we've implemented, we've created a path to return the company to historical profit margins in the future. Turning to free cash flow, which we believe is the best metric to measure wealth creation and where we expect to have a very strong year. We have a great conversion ratio of OIBDA into cash flow. Over the last several years, we are averaging a greater than 50% conversion ratio. Let me discuss a few components of free cash flow. Capital spending will remain relatively flat and come in at a range of $250 million to $300 million. As you know in 2009, we spent $262 million in capital. You should also note that this normalized capital spending is significantly lower than our annual depreciation expense. Working capital will benefit from: One, the syndication profit we recognized last year as the cash comes in; two, the Super Bowl, where right's fees were paid in 2009; and thirdly, from political advertising as it is paid upfront, which will help our receivable balances later in the year; lastly, cash interest cost on our debt will decrease as we delever. So to conclude, I think you should be able to use these tools as a guide to help you think about our businesses throughout the year. We feel very good about the trends we're seeing in terms of the advertising marketplace and the growing opportunities to monetize our content. We finished 2009 strong and believe the company is well positioned for 2010 and beyond. With that, operator, we can now open the lines for questions."

We will not be producing any shows for NBC. We're concentrating most of our production for either CBS or The CW. And once again, being as this year, we've done NCIS: L.A. and The Good Wife, and they're a 100% wholly owned, bodes well for us syndicating them in the first place. So we're fairly confident we'll remain strong at 10:00. And our stations, which are getting a much greater piece of the market share, will continue that way."

How much of that benefit you're going to see in the early part of the 2010, and when we should expect that to kind of normalized on a quarterly basis?"

Good afternoon, everyone. I thank you for being with us today. I am certain that all of you know how delighted I am to be speaking to you today in the light of the fabulous results shown by CBS and the terrific performance of Les and his team. In the past year, CBS reduced expenses, improved its financial position and ensured that all the right people and processes were in place, so that CBS would significantly outperform as the market turned and the market is turning. With disciplined management and a solid long-term strategy for growth, there is no economic storm that a company like CBS cannot weather. With all of this, one thing is for sure, content is king and we'll always be king, and no one has better content out there than CBS and one other company whose name I cannot mention today.Our content focus continues to pay out throughout the company. CBS, the premium number one network, has won new and returning hit shows than any other network. Showtime continues its creative and financial role. We're growing our presence in all the most important areas of the digital world. On the local front, our focus on the largest TV and radio markets means we're in the right place as these businesses are rapidly improved, and they are improving. Through hard work, through determination, Les and his team have put CBS in a position to reap the benefits of the improving economic environment, which we're witnessing today. In these, Les and his team have done every possible thing this past year to ensure that CBS is on the path to succeed. On that, there'd be no misunderstanding, our fourth quarter results are not only a sign of the momentum we have gained across all the company. But remember this, they are a preview of great things to come well into the future."

Thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to be giving you a look at a very good quarter. We've managed our way through a difficult economic environment and emerged even stronger, and we're now being helped by a marketplace that is steadily improving. This is a message that you've heard from our peers in recent weeks, and we are clearly a prime beneficiary of the recovering economy. The pacing games we saw throughout the fourth quarter are gathering even more momentum in 2010. Today, I'm going to briefly review our fourth quarter results and operational highlights and discuss what we are seeing in 2010. And then I'll turn it over to our CFO, Joe Ianniello, to offer some more details on our financials and balance sheet, and then we'll happily take your questions.As we promised, each quarter in 2009 came in better than the one before. The second was better than the first, the third was better than the second, culminating in the fourth quarter where we had our best revenue performance of the year. Our revenues of $3.5 billion were virtually even with the same quarter last year, and our second half revenues were up 11% over the first half, once again speaking to our momentum. Also on an adjusted basis, our OIBDA [Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization], operating income and EPS were all up double digits. The revenue picture continues to brighten for us, largely due to the strength of our industry-leading content and the improvement in our Local businesses. On the content side, CBS is the most watched network on television, and we're selling our hit shows into syndication earlier at better rates and to a broader local audience than ever. Our premium cable network, Showtime, continues to add subscribers and grow its revenues and profits. We're also expanding and monetizing our leading global online presence and more efficiently distributing our content in major local TV and radio markets.Our fourth quarter results reflect all of this, as well as the improved business marketplace. At the same time, we spent the past year working to reduce our cost structure across the company. We have recently removed $250 million in expenses, and our commitment to containing these expenses will continue. As I stated, we are now reporting a much improved OIBDA, $569 million for the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis, up 11% from a year ago. Our adjusted operating income, net earnings and EPS all turned in terrific increases as well. Operating income was up 16% to $422 million, net earnings were up 23% to $171 million and EPS was up 19% to $0.25 per share. We are pleased that our businesses have rebounded so strongly in the fourth quarter and have great momentum into the first quarter of 2010.Our financial position is also stronger. As you know, in 2009, we refinanced near-term debt and secured a new credit facility, enhancing our financial security well into the future. Joe will touch on this a bit more later.Our businesses continue to generate very healthy free cash flow, $828 million for the year with $295 million of that coming in the fourth quarter. In addition, we finished 2009 with $717 million of cash on hand. And the good news is, as we've mentioned, the momentum has not only carried into the new year it's accelerating. National advertising is up, and we're seeing pacing levels at or well above last year in just about every local TV and radio market, with particular strength in key categories like auto and financial services. With our new segment structure reporting structure in place, you can clearly see the continued strength of our Content businesses, which include Entertainment, Cable Networks and Publishing and ongoing improvement on our Local businesses, Local Broadcasting and Outdoor.Now let's take a quick look at our financial and operational highlights, beginning with our Content Group and its largest segment, Entertainment. As you know, our Entertainment segment includes the CBS Television Network, our TV Production and Distribution businesses, our new Films business and CBS Interactive. Entertainment revenues, $1.8 billion, were up 4% in the fourth quarter from last year. The biggest revenue driver was television advertising, which increased 8% versus fourth quarter '08. As we've maintained our focus on reducing program expenses and other costs in this business, we've improved our operating leverage as well. OIBDA of $191 million was up 10%. The ongoing strength of the CBS Television Network was front and center in the success we saw on the quarter. We are number one for the season to date and up year-over-year in every major demographic. We have more top 10 shows than any other network and more top 20 shows than all other networks combined, and we are the most watched television network, six out of seven nights of the week.We've also drawn record audiences for our recent tenfold events. Our Grammys telecast pulled the largest audience in six years, nearly 26 million viewers, up 35% over last year. The average audience of 47 million viewers for the AFC Championship game last month was our largest ever and the most for any AFC Championship game since 1986. And as you know, the Super Bowl, two weeks ago, was the most watched program in television history, with 106.5 million average viewers, eclipsing the match series finale in 1983, which was also on CBS, by the way.After the game, we premiered our new reality series, UNDERCOVER BOSS, and we couldn't have asked for a better debut, nearly 39 million tuned in, and we're encouraged by the strong rating from the show's second air in this past Sunday night as well. Along with NCIS L.A. and The Good Wife, we now have the top three new shows on television. Partially due to the Super Bowl promos, our programming on Monday after the game was the highest rated this season to date and the lift continued throughout the week. We've been saying for a long time that in a fragmented but socially networked universe, big event and hit programming will be more popular and more relevant than ever. And it's also true that broadcast television continues to be the best bang for an advertiser's buck each and everyday. The fact is, TV viewership for the five major network is up this season over last year, look at the Grammys, look at the Super Bowl, look at the Olympic Games. And you may have heard some issues about late night over the last few months. I'll just say we're very happy with our performance in that day part. David Letterman and Craig Ferguson are both number one in their time period and continue to put on a great show night after night.And on another positive note, being the network with the largest number of golf events, the return of Tiger Woods is a welcome one. The breadth and strength of our programming, not only big events but our lineup overall, is helping us to excel in a very strong marketplace. Primetime scatter-applied pricing was up an average of 25% over upfront in the fourth quarter and is now up more than 30% in the first. The scatter market remains extremely hot right now, and this ad strength for the network is real. And as you know, Super bowl ads sold out well advance of the game at very favorable rates, representing a nice profit for us. Of course, it also helps when you own programming that's performing so well. 11 of the 20 top shows on TV are in CBS. And through CBS Television Studios, we own more than half of them. That means we're not only benefiting from advertising today, but also we'll benefit both today and for years to come in syndication. And the good news is that the syndication market, both domestically and internationally, has never been stronger.I talked on our last call about how we made a record-breaking deal to sell NCIS L.A. into domestic syndication after just seven episodes on the air. Globally as well, the marketplace has been terrific. NCIS L.A. is now licensed in 192 markets, and The Good Wife is licensed in 181 markets. As our Syndication business continues to grow, both in total dollars and as a percentage of our revenue, these deals are diversifying our revenue base, making it more recurring and more predictable, providing stability well into the future. So once again, the industry has changed to our benefit. Yes, CBS, still, is the number one network, but we are all now also operating in an environment where we own most of our programming and take advantage of a syndication market place that continues to grow year after year.We have also established retransmission consent fees as a significant secondary revenue stream. We more than tripled our retransmission revenues in 2009 versus 2008. It's now a substantial figure, and we expect it to grow again this year. At CBS, we're very pleased about the increasing attention paid to retrans. We've been saying for a while that this would be a game changer for us, and now it is. We've done 56 deals and counting, including the recent major ones with Time Warner Cable, Cablevision and DISH. Meanwhile, we are selectively putting our content online. Our online strategy of putting non-exclusive distribution deals for our content continues to work very well for us. At CBS Interactive, through our wholly-owned TV.com and CBS.com, we are successfully getting our shows online, along with the shows of other, but never at the expense of cannibalizing our network content. The marketplace at Interactive is also growing strongly with display advertising picking up nicely. We are pacing up high teens this quarter, with particular strength in areas like games and sports. And we're gearing up now for March Madness on Demand [MMOD], which we expect will be even better this year than last.A few words about CBS Films, which is just getting started. In this business, our risks are limited, and the world is always seeking to content. The potential gain can be high. Our first film did not perform nearly as well as we would have liked. We were disappointed. However, the budget was modest about $30 million, and the advertising and promotion expenses were helped by reach and power of our own media properties. We have three more films coming up this year, and we will continue to report on our progress.Turning to our Cable Networks, an important source of subscription revenues for us, this segment, which includes Showtime Networks and CBS College Sports, was one of our strongest performers in the fourth quarter. Revenues of $347 million were up 8% year-over-year. And OIBDA of $153 million was up 46%, once again, expanding our base of recurring revenue. Cable Networks' financial performance was driven by growth rates and subscribers at both Showtime and College Sports. Showtime Networks finished the year with 61.3 million subscriptions, up 2.6% from fourth quarter '08. Most recent industry data shows at Showtime was the only premium network to significantly grow subscribers in 2009.CBS College Sports had 35 million subscriptions at year end, up 9.5 million from the prior year. The latest award season improved once again, just how popular Showtime original programming is with the audience. Our hit shows, Dexter and the United States of Tara, were big winners at both the Golden Globe's and the SAG [Screen Actors Guild] Awards. Last month, we began rolling out a new slater programming that I'm sure will build upon the incredible success we've already had with Showtime. The final component of our Content Group is Publishing, and this business had a very strong year content-wise. Simon & Schuster ended 2009 with a total of 164 New York Times bestsellers and more hit the number one spot, 25 in total, than in 2008. Fourth quarter revenues were $220 million, OIBDA was $13.6 million. We are seeing signs of a better marketplace here as well, and we're exploring new revenue opportunities on a variety of new eReader platforms that are now coming in to the marketplace. We just concluded a deal to make our content available on the Apple iPad, the viewing next month, and we look forward to other deals as well.Overall, our Content Group made $2.4 billion in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2009, up 3% from a year ago and OIBDA of $357 million, up 16%. Delivering results like this in the economically challenging year we've gone through is a testament to our strategy of focusing, first and foremost, on creating the best content and effectively monetizing it as well.Turning to our Local Group, which includes our Local Broadcasting and Outdoor segments, the fourth quarter was by far the best of the year with the revenues of $1.16 billion and OIBDA of $296 million. Nowhere is the recovery more apparent than at our TV and radio stations. Fourth quarter Local Broadcasting revenues of $680 million were our highest of the year by a wide margin, and OIBDA of $227 million for the quarter was up 31% from fourth quarter '08.At our TV Stations, non-political revenues were up 11% year-over-year on the quarter, and the outlook keeps improving. So far this year, our TV Station groups, as a whole, is pacing up by high teens on average from the same period last year, and our top 10 stations are pacing even higher than that. Certainly helped by our 10 p.m. primetime program, many of our stations are in first or second place in late news, and we're expecting an extra lift from political this year. Given the unusually large number of settled [ph] (43:40) seats that have come into play, clearly, there are going to be some hard fought battles around the country. And the barriers, recently removed by the Supreme Court, will bring added political dollars into the market.Meanwhile, Radio is also a really strong story. As we promised you late last year and to some skepticism from many, Radio will be showing plus signs in the first quarter. Average pacing has been rising in 2010 and is well ahead of last year. This success is driven by the performance of our bigger markets. While we are pacing up by mid-single digits overall, our top 10 radio markets are pacing up by low teen. Radio's steady improvement has now only been the result of our improving economy. Our focus on programming has been instrumental as well. Our top 10 markets grew average audience share by 10% in 2009 in markets like New York and Los Angeles, implemented new formulas to gain to a multiples of that. And CBS radio stations had the number ones audience share in five of the top 10 markets for 2009: New York, Chicago, Dallas, Philadelphia and Boston.Our final Local Group segment is Outdoor where the recovery has been slower but also clear. Fourth quarter revenues were $484 million and OIBDA was $69 million. But pacing here, too, is improving steadily. Right now in the first quarter, our Outdoor business, as a whole, is pacing even with last year at this time. And as you know, this is the best level of pacing we have seen in a year. At the same time, we're entering into new deals at much better terms than in the past. And as revenues begin to come back, we are confident we will see the benefit in our results.As you can see across the board, 2009 ended on a high notes for us. Our content is performing better than ever, and our local assets are improving dramatically as the economy recovers. And as 2010 gets into full swing, top-line trends are continuing to move in our favor. To make no mistake, we have no intention of using rising revenues as an excuse to let costs creep back into our businesses. We'll stay focused on improving efficiencies, making sure that more of the top-line growth we expect translates into free cash flow for our investors.From our leading content to a growing syndication marketplace, to significant retransmission consent revenues, to rising political spending, I feel very confident about the ongoing strength of this company for this year and beyond. With that, I'll hand it over to Joe who will give you more detail on our financial performance and what to expect in 2010. Joe?"

Today, I'd like to focus my comments on four areas: First, review our fourth quarter results for the company; second, highlight some segment information; third, discuss our liquidity position; and lastly, outline what we see in 2010.Starting with our results, as Les noted, revenues for the quarter were $3.5 billion, down 0.8% from a year ago when we benefited from strong political advertising. This was our highest revenue quarter of the year, building on last quarter where we had five shows going into syndication. Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter came in at $569 million, up 11% from the prior year. OIBDA is being adjusted for only impairment charges both this year and last. During the fourth quarter of this year, we took a $178 million non-cash charge to reduce the value of FCC licenses in certain radio markets. And in Q4 of last year, we recorded a $64 million charge related to the sale of some radio stations.We continue to benefit from strong cost-savings initiatives across the company. We now have exceeded $250 million of annualized saving, and we see more to come, which I will discuss in a bit.We also benefited from lower restructuring charges. However, this benefit was offset by the lack of political advertising. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.25 for the quarter, up 19%. We are only adjusting for the impairment charges that I just discussed and some discrete tax benefits from settling some income tax audits. You can see full reconciliations of these adjustments in our press release.Turning to our segments, this is the first quarter that you see our results in the new segment presentation. In mid-January, we filed historical results in our new format via an 8-K. We also posted historical tables on our Investor Relations website. In addition to our new segments, we provided revenue by type in our press release to give you more detail on the various sources of the company's revenue. We also modified this table slightly.Let's start with Entertainment. Revenues for the quarter were up 4%, led by 8% growth in ad sales at the CBS Network. Scatter pricing during the quarter was up 25%, above upfront and gaining momentum from the increasingly strong demand. Leading categories were automotive, financial services and retail. Ad sales at CBS Interactive decreased 5% for the quarter, but the tide started turning during the back half of the quarter. More on that later.Our Entertainment OIBDA for the quarter was up 10% to $191 million, driven by higher revenue, lower restructuring costs, offset by increased investment into content. Revenues at our Cable segment were up 8% during the quarter driven by increases in both rates and subscribers. OIBDA was up 46% from higher revenues and the mix of cable programming. Obviously, this is not a normalized flow-through of revenue. Looking at the full year is more representative of the earnings power of this segment. So looking at the year, revenue grew 7% and OIBDA grew 18%, putting our Cable Nets [Cable Networks] at a 34% margin.Publishing revenues for the quarter decreased 10% due to the soft retail market and fewer titles released this quarter, which caused EBITDA to drop from $28 million to $14 million. We will continue to manage costs, while we play a critical role in the fast-evolving e-book industry.Local Broadcast revenues were down 8% for the quarter, of which TV Stations were down 3% and Radio down 12%. Remember, we took in significant political dollars in 2008, which accounted for 14 points of the decline in TV. And for Radio, you should note that we have 10 less stations from our divestitures in 2009, which accounted for two points of its decline. TV Stations were the first to see signs of the recovery, which started to benefit Radio in the quarter. And in December, Radio had its best month of the year for revenue, led by the automotive category, which was up high single digits.On an OIBDA level, we were up 31% for the quarter, benefiting from our reduced costs as well as a gain on the sale of some spectrum and the absence of last year's restructuring costs, offset by lower political advertising. Outdoor revenues decreased 8% for the quarter. Foreign exchange contributed favorably four points of that change. Breaking this down further, in constant dollars, the Americas were down 10%, and Europe and Asia are down 15%. Contributed to this decline is also the fact that we had fewer transit contracts, as we've been disciplined in our approach to renewing these types of contracts. Our occupancy rate for the quarter increased slightly, and pricing began to firm up during the quarter. OIBDA dropped from $98 million to $69 million quarter-over-quarter due to the fixed nature of the transit contracts. As Les noted, we are continuously entering into new deals on more favorable terms. Next, a few words about our liquidity profile. As Les mentioned, our free cash flow was $295 million for the quarter and $828 million for the full year. Cash on hand at 12/31/09 was $717 million. This is almost $300 million more than when we started the year. We were able to build our cash balances, while at the same time, deleveraging the company. We will continue to focus on deleveraging throughout 2010. With our new credit facility in place and having refinanced $1 billion last year, we are in a much stronger financial position.Let's talk about 2010. 2010 for us is going to be about three things: First, driving top-line growth; second, a continued commitment to controlling costs; and third, generating significant levels of free cash flow. Here's how we see things shaping up so far. We're confident 2010 is going to be better financially than in 2009. How much better will be determined in part by the pace of the economic recovery since advertising continues to be an important factor to our revenue base. Our Content Group should have another solid year. As you know, our content asset's comprised about 70% of total revenues, and the outlook is strong. Scatter pricing at the network in the first quarter is now up by more than 30% over upfront. And Q1 ad sales is pacing up high teens for our interactive unit.The huge Super Bowl performance in Q1 will also drive revenues. It was the most revenue we ever generated for a Super Bowl. Our affiliate and subscription revenue grew steadily. And incremental film revenues will be recognized as our films are released throughout the year. On the syndication front, I should remind you that we do not have the five major titles hitting syndication that we had last year in the third quarter. But not to worry because our studio had six new shows on the air in their first season. They only not make it into syndication, but we continued to replenish the pipeline. In addition, Showtime will have some original series available to syndication down the road. Now for our local assets, we're focused on returning these businesses back to growth, while finding new ways to monetize our valuable content. And with an improved cost structure, even a small rebound will have a significant margin impact. Retransmission fees will be another important contributor of growth. We expect these fees to exceed $100 million in 2010, and we are well on our way to surpassing our $250 million target, which now seems conservative from when we first provided it a few years ago. I want to emphasize that these fees are earned by both our TV station and the CBS Network, and thus will be reflected in our Local Broadcasting and Entertainment segments. Later in the year, we expect political advertising to drive strong growth at our Local Broadcasting segment. With the Supreme Court's recent decision and our stations located in key states, this mid-term election could be a record political year. But for now, here's what we see. While Q1 isn't finished yet, we are pacing at our TV station group up high teens, with our 14 owned and operated CBS stations pacing north of 30%. Radio stations are pacing up mid-single digits, with our top 10 markets showing low teen increases, driven by several advertising categories. This is the first quarter that we are seeing real growth at radio since the separation from Viacom. As Les said, the format changes our team has made in key markets are paying off.Our Outdoor group is currently pacing flat, but gaining pace points each week. On the cost side, we will continue to drive further efficiencies. We've taken steps to restructure our operations. Early in 2010, we expect to record a restructuring charge of approximately $50 million across the company that will lead to annual savings at least one times that amount. As we experience a return to top-line growth and to continue to benefit from the cost reductions we've implemented, we've created a path to return the company to historical profit margins in the future. Turning to free cash flow, which we believe is the best metric to measure wealth creation and where we expect to have a very strong year. We have a great conversion ratio of OIBDA into cash flow. Over the last several years, we are averaging a greater than 50% conversion ratio. Let me discuss a few components of free cash flow. Capital spending will remain relatively flat and come in at a range of $250 million to $300 million. As you know in 2009, we spent $262 million in capital. You should also note that this normalized capital spending is significantly lower than our annual depreciation expense. Working capital will benefit from: One, the syndication profit we recognized last year as the cash comes in; two, the Super Bowl, where right's fees were paid in 2009; and thirdly, from political advertising as it is paid upfront, which will help our receivable balances later in the year; lastly, cash interest cost on our debt will decrease as we delever. So to conclude, I think you should be able to use these tools as a guide to help you think about our businesses throughout the year. We feel very good about the trends we're seeing in terms of the advertising marketplace and the growing opportunities to monetize our content. We finished 2009 strong and believe the company is well positioned for 2010 and beyond. With that, operator, we can now open the lines for questions."

Good afternoon, everyone. I thank you for being with us today. I am certain that all of you know how delighted I am to be speaking to you today in the light of the fabulous results shown by CBS and the terrific performance of Les and his team. In the past year, CBS reduced expenses, improved its financial position and ensured that all the right people and processes were in place, so that CBS would significantly outperform as the market turned and the market is turning. With disciplined management and a solid long-term strategy for growth, there is no economic storm that a company like CBS cannot weather. With all of this, one thing is for sure, content is king and we'll always be king, and no one has better content out there than CBS and one other company whose name I cannot mention today.Our content focus continues to pay out throughout the company. CBS, the premium number one network, has won new and returning hit shows than any other network. Showtime continues its creative and financial role. We're growing our presence in all the most important areas of the digital world. On the local front, our focus on the largest TV and radio markets means we're in the right place as these businesses are rapidly improved, and they are improving. Through hard work, through determination, Les and his team have put CBS in a position to reap the benefits of the improving economic environment, which we're witnessing today. In these, Les and his team have done every possible thing this past year to ensure that CBS is on the path to succeed. On that, there'd be no misunderstanding, our fourth quarter results are not only a sign of the momentum we have gained across all the company. But remember this, they are a preview of great things to come well into the future."

Thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to be giving you a look at a very good quarter. We've managed our way through a difficult economic environment and emerged even stronger, and we're now being helped by a marketplace that is steadily improving. This is a message that you've heard from our peers in recent weeks, and we are clearly a prime beneficiary of the recovering economy. The pacing games we saw throughout the fourth quarter are gathering even more momentum in 2010. Today, I'm going to briefly review our fourth quarter results and operational highlights and discuss what we are seeing in 2010. And then I'll turn it over to our CFO, Joe Ianniello, to offer some more details on our financials and balance sheet, and then we'll happily take your questions.As we promised, each quarter in 2009 came in better than the one before. The second was better than the first, the third was better than the second, culminating in the fourth quarter where we had our best revenue performance of the year. Our revenues of $3.5 billion were virtually even with the same quarter last year, and our second half revenues were up 11% over the first half, once again speaking to our momentum. Also on an adjusted basis, our OIBDA [Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization], operating income and EPS were all up double digits. The revenue picture continues to brighten for us, largely due to the strength of our industry-leading content and the improvement in our Local businesses. On the content side, CBS is the most watched network on television, and we're selling our hit shows into syndication earlier at better rates and to a broader global audience than ever. Our premium cable network, Showtime, continues to add subscribers and grow its revenues and profits. We're also expanding and monetizing our leading global online presence and more efficiently distributing our content in major local TV and radio markets.Our fourth quarter results reflect all of this, as well as the improved business marketplace. At the same time, we spent the past year working to reduce our cost structure across the company. We have recently removed $250 million in expenses, and our commitment to containing these expenses will continue. As I stated, we are now reporting a much improved OIBDA, $569 million for the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis, up 11% from a year ago. Our adjusted operating income, net earnings and EPS all turned in terrific increases as well. Operating income was up 16% to $422 million, net earnings were up 23% to $171 million and EPS was up 19% to $0.25 per share. We are pleased that our businesses have rebounded so strongly in the fourth quarter and have great momentum into the first quarter of 2010.Our financial position is also stronger. As you know, in 2009, we refinanced near-term debt and secured a new credit facility, enhancing our financial security well into the future. Joe will touch on this a bit more later.Our businesses continue to generate very healthy free cash flow, $828 million for the year with $295 million of that coming in the fourth quarter. In addition, we finished 2009 with $717 million of cash on hand. And the good news is, as we've mentioned, the momentum has not only carried into the new year it's accelerating. National advertising is up, and we're seeing pacing levels at or well above last year in just about every local TV and radio market, with particular strength in key categories like auto and financial services. With our new segment structure reporting structure in place, you can clearly see the continued strength of our Content businesses, which include Entertainment, Cable Networks and Publishing and ongoing improvement on our Local businesses, Local Broadcasting and Outdoor.Now let's take a quick look at our financial and operational highlights, beginning with our Content Group and its largest segment, Entertainment. As you know, our Entertainment segment includes the CBS Television Network, our TV Production and Distribution businesses, our new Films business and CBS Interactive. Entertainment revenues, $1.8 billion, were up 4% in the fourth quarter from last year. The biggest revenue driver was television advertising, which increased 8% versus fourth quarter '08. As we've maintained our focus on reducing program expenses and other costs in this business, we've improved our operating leverage as well. OIBDA of $191 million was up 10%. The ongoing strength of the CBS Television Network was front and center in the success we saw on the quarter. We're number one for the season to date and up year-over-year in every major demographic. We have more top 10 shows than any other network and more top 20 shows than all other networks combined, and we are the most watched television network, six out of seven nights of the week.We've also drawn record audiences for our recent tenfold events. Our Grammys telecast pulled the largest audience in six years, nearly 26 million viewers, up 35% over last year. The average audience of 47 million viewers for the AFC Championship game last month was our largest ever and the most for any AFC Championship game since 1986. And as you know, the Super Bowl, two weeks ago, was the most watched program in television history, with 106.5 million average viewers, eclipsing the match series finale in 1983, which was also on CBS by the way.After the game, we premiered our new reality series, UNDERCOVER BOSS, and we couldn't have asked for a better debut, nearly 39 million tuned in, and we're encouraged by the strong rating from the show's second airing this past Sunday night as well. Along with NCIS L.A. and The Good Wife, we now have the top three new shows on television. Partially due to the Super Bowl promos, our programming on Monday after the game was the highest rated this season to date and the lift continued throughout the week. We've been saying for a long time that in a fragmented but socially networked universe, big event and hit programming will be more popular and more relevant than ever. And it's also true that broadcast television continues to be the best bang for an advertiser's buck each and everyday. The fact is, TV viewership for the five major network is up this season over last year, look at the Grammys, look at the Super Bowl, look at the Olympic Games. And you may have heard some issues about late night over the last few months. I'll just say we're very happy with our performance in that day part. David Letterman and Craig Ferguson are both number one in their time periods and continue to put on a great show night after night.And on another positive note, being the network with the largest number of golf events, the return of Tiger Woods is a welcome one. The breadth and strength of our programming, not only big events but our lineup overall, is helping us to excel in a very strong marketplace. Primetime scatter-applied pricing was up an average of 25% over upfront in the fourth quarter and is now up more than 30% in the first. The scatter market remains extremely hot right now, and this ad strength for the network is real. And as you know, Super bowl ads sold out well advance of the game at very favorable rates, representing a nice profit for us. Of course, it also helps when you own programming that's performing so well. 11 of the 20 top shows on TV are in CBS. And through CBS Television Studios, we own more than half of them. That means we're not only benefiting from advertising today, but also we'll benefit both today and for years to come in syndication. And the good news is that the syndication market, both domestically and internationally, has never been stronger.I talked on our last call about how we made a record-breaking deal to sell NCIS L.A. into domestic syndication after just seven episodes on the air. Globally as well, the marketplace has been terrific. NCIS L.A. is now licensed in 192 markets, and The Good Wife is licensed in 181 markets. As our Syndication business continues to grow, both in total dollars and as a percentage of our revenue, these deals are diversifying our revenue base, making it more recurring and more predictable, providing stability well into the future. So once again, the industry has changed to our benefit. Yes, CBS, still, is the number one network, but we are all now also operating in an environment where we own most of our programming and take advantage of a syndication market place that continues to grow year after year.We have also established retransmission consent fees as a significant secondary revenue stream. We more than tripled our retransmission revenues in 2009 versus 2008. It's now a substantial figure, and we expect it to grow again this year. At CBS, we're very pleased about the increasing attention paid to retrans. We've been saying for a while that this would be a game changer for us, and now it is. We've done 56 deals and counting, including the recent major ones with Time Warner Cable, Cablevision and DISH. Meanwhile, we are selectively putting our content online. Our online strategy of putting non-exclusive distribution deals for our content continues to work very well for us. At CBS Interactive, through our wholly-owned TV.com and CBS.com, we are successfully getting our shows online, along with the shows of other, but never at the expense of cannibalizing our network content. The marketplace at Interactive is also growing strongly with display advertising picking up nicely. We are pacing up high teens this quarter, with particular strength in areas like games and sports. And we're gearing up now for March Madness on Demand [MMOD], which we expect will be even better this year than last.A few words about CBS Films, which is just getting started. In this business, our risks are limited, and the world is always seeking to content. The potential gain can be high. Our first film did not perform nearly as well as we would have liked. We were disappointed. However, the budget was modest about $30 million, and the advertising and promotion expenses were helped by reach and power of our own media properties. We have three more films coming up this year, and we will continue to report on our progress.Turning to our Cable Networks, an important source of subscription revenues for us, this segment, which includes Showtime Networks and CBS College Sports, was one of our strongest performers in the fourth quarter. Revenues of $347 million were up 8% year-over-year. And OIBDA of $153 million was up 46%, once again, expanding our base of recurring revenue. Cable Networks' financial performance was driven by growth rates and subscribers at both Showtime and College Sports. Showtime Networks finished the year with 61.3 million subscriptions, up 2.6% from fourth quarter '08. Most recent industry data shows at Showtime was the only premium network to significantly grow subscribers in 2009.CBS College Sports had 35 million subscriptions at year end, up 9.5 million from the prior year. The latest award season improved once again, just how popular Showtime original programming is with the audience. Our hit shows, Dexter and the United States of Tara, were big winners at both the Golden Globe's and the SAG [Screen Actors Guild] Awards. Last month, we began rolling out a new slater programming that I'm sure will build upon the incredible success we've already had with Showtime. The final component of our Content Group is Publishing, and this business had a very strong year content-wise. Simon & Schuster ended 2009 with a total of 164 New York Times bestsellers and more hit the number one spot, 25 in total, than in 2008. Fourth quarter revenues were $220 million, OIBDA was $13.6 million. We are seeing signs of a better marketplace here as well, and we're exploring new revenue opportunities on a variety of new eReader platforms that are now coming in to the marketplace. We just concluded a deal to make our content available on the Apple iPad, the viewing next month, and we look forward to other deals as well.Overall, our Content Group made $2.4 billion in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2009, up 3% from a year ago and OIBDA of $357 million, up 16%. Delivering results like this in the economically challenging year we've gone through is a testament to our strategy of focusing, first and foremost, on creating the best content and effectively monetizing it as well.Turning to our Local Group, which includes our Local Broadcasting and Outdoor segments, the fourth quarter was by far the best of the year with the revenues of $1.16 billion and OIBDA of $296 million. Nowhere is the recovery more apparent than at our TV and radio stations. Fourth quarter Local Broadcasting revenues of $680 million were our highest of the year by a wide margin, and OIBDA of $227 million for the quarter was up 31% from fourth quarter '08.At our TV Stations, non-political revenues were up 11% year-over-year on the quarter, and the outlook keeps improving. So far this year, our TV Station groups, as a whole, is pacing up by high teens on average from the same period last year, and our top 10 stations are pacing even higher than that. Certainly helped by our 10 p.m. primetime program, many of our stations are in first or second place in late news, and we're expecting an extra lift from political this year. Given the unusually large number of settled [ph] seats that have come into play, clearly, there are going to be some hard fought battles around the country. And the barriers, recently removed by the Supreme Court, will bring added political dollars into the market.Meanwhile, Radio is also a really strong story. As we promised you late last year and to some skepticism from many, Radio will be showing plus signs in the first quarter. Average pacing has been rising in 2010 and is well ahead of last year. This success is driven by the performance of our bigger markets. While we are pacing up by mid-single digits overall, our top 10 radio markets are pacing up by low teen. Radio's steady improvement has now only been the result of our improving economy. Our focus on programming has been instrumental as well. Our top 10 markets grew average audience share by 10% in 2009 in markets like New York and Los Angeles, implemented new formulas to gain to a multiples of that. And CBS radio stations had the number ones audience share in five of the top 10 markets for 2009: New York, Chicago, Dallas, Philadelphia and Boston.Our final Local Group segment is Outdoor where the recovery has been slower but also clear. Fourth quarter revenues were $484 million and OIBDA was $69 million. But pacing here, too, is improving steadily. Right now in the first quarter, our Outdoor business, as a whole, is pacing even with last year at this time. And as you know, this is the best level of pacing we have seen in a year. At the same time, we're entering into new deals at much better terms than in the past. And as revenues begin to come back, we are confident we will see the benefit in our results.As you can see across the board, 2009 ended on a high notes for us. Our content is performing better than ever, and our local assets are improving dramatically as the economy recovers. And as 2010 gets into full swing, top-line trends are continuing to move in our favor. To make no mistake, we have no intention of using rising revenues as an excuse to let costs creep back into our businesses. We'll stay focused on improving efficiencies, making sure that more of the top-line growth we expect translates into free cash flow for our investors.From our leading content to a growing syndication marketplace, to significant retransmission consent revenues, to rising political spending, I feel very confident about the ongoing strength of this company for this year and beyond. With that, I'll hand it over to Joe who will give you more detail on our financial performance and what to expect in 2010. Joe?"

Today, I'd like to focus my comments on four areas: First, review our fourth quarter results for the company; second, highlight some segment information; third, discuss our liquidity position; and lastly, outline what we see in 2010.Starting",1738,"Thanks, Les. Today, I'd like to focus my comments on four areas: First, review our fourth quarter results for the company; second, highlight some segment information; third, discuss our liquidity position; and lastly, outline what we see in 2010.Starting with our results, as Les noted, revenues for the quarter were $3.5 billion, down 0.8% from a year ago when we benefited from strong political advertising. This was our highest revenue quarter of the year, building on last quarter where we had five shows going into syndication. Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter came in at $569 million, up 11% from the prior year. OIBDA is being adjusted for only impairment charges both this year and last. During the fourth quarter of this year, we took a $178 million non-cash charge to reduce the value of FCC licenses in certain radio markets. And in Q4 of last year, we recorded a $64 million charge related to the sale of some radio stations.We continue to benefit from strong cost-savings initiatives across the company. We now have exceeded $250 million of annualized saving, and we see more to come, which I will discuss in a bit.We also benefited from lower restructuring charges. However, this benefit was offset by the lack of political advertising. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.25 for the quarter, up 19%. We are only adjusting for the impairment charges that I just discussed and some discrete tax benefits from settling some income tax audits. You can see full reconciliations of these adjustments in our press release.Turning to our segments, this is the first quarter that you see our results in the new segment presentation. In mid-January, we filed historical results in our new format via an 8-K. We also posted historical tables on our Investor Relations website. In addition to our new segments, we provided revenue by type in our press release to give you more detail on the various sources of the company's revenue. We also modified this table slightly.Let's start with Entertainment. Revenues for the quarter were up 4%, led by 8% growth in ad sales at the CBS Network. Scatter pricing during the quarter was up 25%, above upfront and gaining momentum from the increasingly strong demand. Leading categories were automotive, financial services and retail. Ad sales at CBS Interactive decreased 5% for the quarter, but the tide started turning during the back half of the quarter. More on that later.Our Entertainment OIBDA for the quarter was up 10% to $191 million, driven by higher revenue, lower restructuring costs, offset by increased investment into content. Revenues at our Cable segment were up 8% during the quarter driven by increases in both rates and subscribers. OIBDA was up 46% from higher revenues and the mix of cable programming. Obviously, this is not a normalized flow-through of revenue. Looking at the full year is more representative of the earnings power of this segment. So looking at the year, revenue grew 7% and OIBDA grew 18%, putting our Cable Nets [Cable Networks] at a 34% margin.Publishing revenues for the quarter decreased 10% due to the soft retail market and fewer titles released this quarter, which caused EBITDA to drop from $28 million to $14 million. We will continue to manage costs, while we play a critical role in the fast-evolving e-book industry.Local Broadcast revenues were down 8% for the quarter, of which TV Stations were down 3% and Radio down 12%. Remember, we took in significant political dollars in 2008, which accounted for 14 points of the decline in TV. And for Radio, you should note that we have 10 less stations from our divestitures in 2009, which accounted for two points of its decline. TV Stations were the first to see signs of the recovery, which started to benefit Radio in the quarter. And in December, Radio had its best month of the year for revenue, led by the automotive category, which was up high single digits.On an OIBDA level, we were up 31% for the quarter, benefiting from our reduced costs as well as a gain on the sale of some spectrum and the absence of last year's restructuring costs, offset by lower political advertising. Outdoor revenues decreased 8% for the quarter. Foreign exchange contributed favorably four points of that change. Breaking this down further, in constant dollars, the Americas were down 10%, and Europe and Asia are down 15%. Contributed to this decline is also the fact that we had fewer transit contracts, as we've been disciplined in our approach to renewing these types of contracts. Our occupancy rate for the quarter increased slightly, and pricing began to firm up during the quarter. OIBDA dropped from $98 million to $69 million quarter-over-quarter due to the fixed nature of the transit contracts. As Les noted, we are continuously entering into new deals on more favorable terms. Next, a few words about our liquidity profile. As Les mentioned, our free cash flow was $295 million for the quarter and $828 million for the full year. Cash on hand at 12/31/09 was $717 million. This is almost $300 million more than when we started the year. We were able to build our cash balances, while at the same time, deleveraging the company. We will continue to focus on deleveraging throughout 2010. With our new credit facility in place and having refinanced $1 billion last year, we are in a much stronger financial position.Let's talk about 2010. 2010 for us is going to be about three things: First, driving top-line growth; second, a continued commitment to controlling costs; and third, generating significant levels of free cash flow. Here's how we see things shaping up so far. We're confident 2010 is going to be better financially than in 2009. How much better will be determined in part by the pace of the economic recovery since advertising continues to be an important factor to our revenue base. Our Content Group should have another solid year. As you know, our content asset's comprised about 70% of total revenues, and the outlook is strong. Scatter pricing at the network in the first quarter is now up by more than 30% over upfront. And Q1 ad sales is pacing up high teens for our interactive unit.The huge Super Bowl performance in Q1 will also drive revenues. It was the most revenue we ever generated for a Super Bowl. Our affiliate and subscription revenue grew steadily. And incremental film revenues will be recognized as our films are released throughout the year. On the syndication front, I should remind you that we do not have the five major titles hitting syndication that we had last year in the third quarter. But not to worry because our studio had six new shows on the air in their first season. They only not make it into syndication, but we continued to replenish the pipeline. In addition, Showtime will have some original series available to syndication down the road. Now for our local assets, we're focused on returning these businesses back to growth, while finding new ways to monetize our valuable content. And with an improved cost structure, even a small rebound will have a significant margin impact. Retransmission fees will be another important contributor of growth. We expect these fees to exceed $100 million in 2010, and we are well on our way to surpassing our $250 million target, which now seems conservative from when we first provided it a few years ago. I want to emphasize that these fees are earned by both our TV station and the CBS Network, and thus will be reflected in our Local Broadcasting and Entertainment segments. Later in the year, we expect political advertising to drive strong growth at our Local Broadcasting segment. With the Supreme Court's recent decision and our stations located in key states, this mid-term election could be a record political year. But for now, here's what we see. While Q1 isn't finished yet, we are pacing at our TV station group up high teens, with our 14 owned and operated CBS stations pacing north of 30%. Radio stations are pacing up mid-single digits, with our top 10 markets showing low teen increases, driven by several advertising categories. This is the first quarter that we are seeing real growth at radio since the separation from Viacom. As Les said, the format changes our team has made in key markets are paying off.Our Outdoor group is currently pacing flat, but gaining pace points each week. On the cost side, we will continue to drive further efficiencies. We've taken steps to restructure our operations. Early in 2010, we expect to record a restructuring charge of approximately $50 million across the company that will lead to annual savings at least one times that amount. As we experience a return to top-line growth and to continue to benefit from the cost reductions we've implemented, we've created a path to return the company to historical profit margins in the future. Turning to free cash flow, which we believe is the best metric to measure wealth creation and where we expect to have a very strong year. We have a great conversion ratio of OIBDA into cash flow. Over the last several years, we are averaging a greater than 50% conversion ratio. Let me discuss a few components of free cash flow. Capital spending will remain relatively flat and come in at a range of $250 million to $300 million. As you know in 2009, we spent $262 million in capital. You should also note that this normalized capital spending is significantly lower than our annual depreciation expense. Working capital will benefit from: One, the syndication profit we recognized last year as the cash comes in; two, the Super Bowl, where the right's fees were paid in 2009; and thirdly, from political advertising as it is paid upfront, which will help our receivable balances later in the year; lastly, cash interest cost on our debt will decrease as we delever. So to conclude, I think you should be able to use these tools as a guide to help you think about our businesses throughout the year. We feel very good about the trends we're seeing in terms of the advertising marketplace and the growing opportunities to monetize our content. We finished 2009 strong and believe the company is well positioned for 2010 and beyond. With that, operator, we can now open the lines for questions."

What a difference a year makes as we look back on a truly great quarter. It's really gratifying to see the rewards of all the hard work put in by Les and his management team. 
Even in the most challenging times, we've never wavered in our focus. We reduced expenses, we strengthened our balance sheet, we invested in premium content and we maintained our leading position in local TV and radio. In good times and in bad, we've kept to our long-term strategy of serving growth and shareholder value. As a result, no company today is poised to benefit from the improving economy more than we are. 
The CBS television network continues its reign at number one. CBS Studio shows have thrived within global syndication. Premium cable continues to grow. We are ideally positioned in the largest local markets as they rebound, and we built a leading global presence on the internet as well. 
Without a doubt, CBS is built for long-term success. The results we're reporting today are not only a sign of momentum but a preview of the kind of success that I believe, that I know, CBS will have for many, many years to come. 
And now, I would like to turn the call over to my very good friend and my colleague, CBS's President and CEO, the incomparable, Leslie Moonves."

As you can see from our numbers today, we've just finished an extraordinary quarter. We're off to a terrific start this year, and the momentum reflected in these first quarter results is continuing right into the second quarter and beyond. Obviously, we are in a much better operating environment. 
In addition to that, we are now seeing the results of many significant steps we have taken to position CBS for success not just this year but for many years to come. With proper cost cutting and by establishing consistent new revenue streams, the future is indeed bright, and as the strong ad market continues to shine, our results are very satisfying. 
Today, I'm going to briefly review our results and some operating highlights of the first quarter, as well as discuss what we're seeing in the second quarter and into the future. Then, I'll turn it over to Joe to offer some more details on our financial results and balance sheet. Then as always, we'll be happy to take your questions.
Beginning with our very strong first quarter results, revenues of $3.5 billion were up 12% from the same quarter last year. This is our first double-digit year-over-year revenue increase since we became a stand-alone company at the end of 2005, and it represents strength in our biggest businesses across the organization. Our adjusted OIBDA of $351 million was up 40% year-over-year, and our adjusted operating income of $211 million was up 94%. 
As you know, we've spent the past two years reducing our cost structure across the entire company, and we now have the operating leverage to show for it. We've expanded our margin so we can build on that progress going forward. At the same time, we generated $660 million in free cash flow during the first quarter, more than triple the amount for the same period last year, and we continue to take steps to fortify our already-strong financial position. We have reduced our debt and taken advantage of favorable markets to refinance near-term debt at favorable terms. More on that later from Joe. 
There are three major factors that not only drove our strong results in the quarter but point to continued momentum throughout 2010 as well. First, in our Entertainment segment. At the network, we had great success in both our regularly scheduled programming and our major events. All of our tent-pole events, including the Super Bowl, the Grammys, the NCAA basketball tournament have posted multi-year highs and even broken records this year. Our number one network schedule and the growing success of our big event programming have been sold into what has become a very, very hot scatter market, and we are very well positioned going into the upfront. It will be the strongest one in years.
The second factor is the remarkable turnaround in local broadcasting where the advertising marketplace has improved significantly. We've got a great story here with 29% revenue growth at our TV stations and 9% growth in Radio which also is due to better programming. Their growth we're seeing today validates our long-term commitment to large market local presence. 
And third, there's continuing and strong growth of Cable Networks where OIBDA was up 21% in the quarter. This business has grown every single year since the separation in 2005, and it will continue to grow and remains a big part of our overall portfolio going forward.
All of these areas played an instrumental role in our fourth quarter top line results. We continue to deliver on our promise to position CBS for success in both the near and long term. That's clear from the many first quarter financial and operational highlights of our content and local businesses we're sharing with you today. 
Let's take a quick look at some of them now. Beginning with our Content Group and its largest segment, Entertainment. Within Entertainment, the CBS Television Network was our best performer, benefiting from the dramatic improvement in national advertising, the continued strength of our number one network, and as I said, our record-breaking Super Bowl performance. Network advertising revenues were up 25% in the quarter. We've been the biggest beneficiary of a very strong primetime scatter market with pricing up 30% over last year's upfront. Scatter continues to be very strong in the second quarter and things are looking very positive for us heading into the upfront. We expect to see solid increases when we sell our number one primetime schedule in this year's upfront marketplace. 
Along with the Super Bowl, we also had tremendous ratings success with the NCAA men's basketball tournament this year. The championship game was up 31% over a year ago and the most watched since 1997. Going forward, we will continue to broadcast television's biggest events with costs that allow us to grow our profits as well. To that end, a couple of weeks ago, we finalized the deal with the NCAA along with Turner Broadcasting Group to extend our relationship for the tournament through 2024.
As you've heard, this is a terrific deal for our company. It secures CBS as the year-round sports broadcast leader well into the next decade. And what's most important is that we'll keep this franchise in a way that is profitable for us. Previously, we had escalating rights fees that would have been challenging in the next three years. Now we have a deal that will have a positive impact to our results in its very first year and for the life of the contract. Also importantly, CBS is positioned in primetime programming and sports rights enhances our ability to benefit from the dual-revenue-stream broadcast model that continues to emerge. 
Retrans [retransmission] is a significant reality today. The value of broadcast content is finally being recognized and paid for. As we read everyday, the financial model of broadcast television is being greatly improved, and CBS is capturing the benefits of that. We are on pace for north of $100 million in retrans revenues this year, and we'll achieve multiples of that number going forward.
In addition to that, we're also now receiving incremental affiliate fees from our non-owned CBS television stations. We recently announced one significant new deal which follows others and there will be many, many more to come. All of this is adding up to meaningful, additional revenues that have never been accrued before. So now, we're getting paid for our premium television content through advertising, through retrans and through affiliate fees. 
Domestic and international syndication is another business that produces recurring and steady revenues, and it continues to perform well for us. Our shows are being syndicated faster and are reaching broader global audiences than ever before. And NCIS is shaping up to be a global franchise for us that may rival CSI in power and reach. As we capture more and more of these non-advertising-driven revenues, we're better monetizing our leading television content and diversifying our revenue base. 
We're focusing on monetizing our content online as well, and CBS Interactive turned in a strong performance in the first quarter of 2010. Display advertising revenues were up 19% year-over-year as this business benefited from both our growing online presence and the recovery that is taking hold in the online marketplace. 
We've consistently grown traffic levels, and that's driven our ad growth. Leading sites like CNET, BNET, CBSsports.com and CBSNews.com continue to pose year-over-year increases and offer our advertisers a unique combination of original Internet content and broadcast video. 
At CBS Films, our most recent movie, The Back-up Plan, is having a very respectable run. It's performed considerably better than our first film, and we anticipate continued improvement for this new division going forward.
Turning to Cable Network. This content business turns out single-digit revenue growth and double-digit profit growth quarter after quarter. As I said, it continues to deliver for the company year in and year out, both financially and creatively. 
Showtime Networks, the Smithsonian Channel and the CBS College Sports Network all added subscribers during the quarter. Showtime's content of original programming, sports and movies makes it must-have premium cable channel. And in the future, Showtime's movie lineup will include the recent Academy award-winning The Hurt Locker, the very popular Twilight series as well as Inglorious Basterds. Plus, we recently announced the new output deal for all DreamWorks films beginning with Steven Spielberg's upcoming World War I movie, War Horse.
The final component of our Content Group is Publishing. Simon & Schuster's first quarter revenues were off from last year, but we've done a lot in this division to reduce costs. As a result, despite lower revenues, first quarter OIBDA was up from last year. S&S has also made great strides in the fast-growing digital space. Our e-book Library is nearly up to nearly 8,000 titles, and we have custom apps and downloads for virtually every mobile device. Digital sales more than tripled in the first quarter and represent a growing share of our overall Publishing revenues.
Turning to our Local Group. We have seen an even more pronounced improvement in market conditions, particularly in our local TV and radio operations. Local Broadcasting revenues of $606 million for the first quarter of 2010 were up 19% from last year's first quarter. TV stations led the way but radio joined in the momentum as well. 
Based on current pacing, local TV ad revenue will be up north of 25% in the second quarter. And looking forward, a very strong political marketplace is just beginning. The many hotly contested races that are picking up speed and the recent Supreme Court ruling give us great optimism that political spending will be a positive development for us. The great majority of this will be seen in the third and fourth quarters. 
In Radio, fixing programming in our large markets continue to pay off with audience share growing fastest in our top 10 markets. In fact, in the first quarter, we added nearly 2 million listeners in our top 10 markets over last year's quarter, and this audience growth is translating to revenue. So far in the second quarter, Radio pacing is up high-single digits with major markets leading the way. For the first time in five years, we're seeing major plus signs in every financial metric in Radio.
Healthy revenues across our Local Broadcasting segment are translating to strong profit growth helped significantly by our reduced cost structure. As you saw in our release, adjusted OIBDA of $134 million was up 148% year-over-year. 
At Outdoor, we're seeing improvement as well. Sales pacing, which is flat year-over-year at this time last quarter, is now up mid-single digits with particular strength in large markets. So our revenue outlook for this year is brightening. Like our other local businesses, the generally fixed nature of our expenses in Outdoor means that when revenues rise, we quickly see the positive impact on our operating profits. Taken together, our local businesses, which were hit the hardest in 2009, are now producing nearly $1 billion in quarterly revenues for our company, an improvement of 12% over a year ago. 
In thinking about the quarter, 2010 and beyond, we're optimistic. CBS is doing a lot more than just reaping the benefits of an improving economy. We've taken a number of actions to position this company for success both in the near term and for years to come. For sometime now, we've committed to make sure CBS would thrive in a changing media landscape. We continue to execute on that vision every day. We have long worked to establish a dual-revenue-stream for broadcast television and now retrans is a fact in our business. 
Our goal has always been to produce and broadcast the best contents, and year after year, we have the number one network. We said that syndication is a lucrative market place and one that ultimately rewards the best contents, and we've since made record-breaking deals like the one for NCIS: Los Angeles. 
We promised to get bigger in the emerging digital marketplace, and today, we are among the leading global internet companies. When others did not, we believed in large market local broadcasting, and that strategy is paying us off through our actions to capitalize on the dramatic recovery that is underway. We said we would successfully refinance our debt and we are. I think it's clear that this company delivers on its promises. Going forward, we will continue to do so, and I assure you the best is yet to come. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

As we said on our last call, 2010 was going to be about driving the top line, continuing to focus on controlling costs and generating significant amounts of free cash flow. This quarter results demonstrate just that. Revenues for the quarter were up 12% to $3.5 billion. We continue to restructure our operations and recorded a $57 million charge with the associated savings starting to kick in next quarter, and free cash flow is up over a threefold to $660 million for the quarter. Our 12% revenue increase was driven by a solid advertising marketplace. 
Total company advertising revenue was up 17% for the quarter led by the Super Bowl. Without the Super Bowl, our ad revenues are still up high-single digits. Affiliate and subscription fees also increased 11%. 
Adjusted OIBDA, which only excludes the restructuring charge I just mentioned, was up 40% for the quarter to $351 million. Our quarter-over-quarter OIBDA margin expanded 200 basis points. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.05 from a loss of $0.05 last year. We are adjusting for the restructuring charge and some discreet tax items. In 2010, we recorded a $26 million tax expense which included the impact of the change in the Healthcare Reform Act as well as favorable settlements of some state and local audits. These items, taken as a whole, had a negative $0.09 per share impact to our reported results. In 2009, we had a $19 million tax charge related to stock-based compensation, which amounted to $0.03 per share. Full reconciliations can be found in our press release. 
Let me discuss a few segment highlights. Entertainment revenues increased 15% to $2.1 billion led by the Super Bowl. Leading categories at network ad sales included financial services, telcos, auto and retail. We saw a slight decline in our Entertainment OIBDA before restructuring charges to $145 million from $151 million last year. The OIBDA was impacted by lower margin revenues from the Super Bowl as well as timing of programming costs. As an example, during Q1, we produced more of our own hit shows like NCIS: Los Angeles and The Good Wife. This will result in higher margins later in the year and subsequent years as a result of syndication of our studio product and expansion into additional international territories. 
Cable Networks' revenues increased 8% to $368 million due to rate and subscriber increases. Cable OIBDA increased 21% due to the solid revenue growth. OIBDA growth would have been even higher except for the timing of costs associated with series' premieres. The OIBDA margin for the remainder of the year for this segment will be considerably higher than Q1.
Publishing revenue for this quarter decreased $10 million from $162 million to $152 million reflecting the continued softness in the base retail market. Publishing still managed to turn in higher OIBDA before restructuring despite lower revenues as our reduced cost base took effect.
Local Broadcasting revenues were up 19% to $606 million with TV stations up 29%. Without the Super Bowl, TV stations were up north of 20% and Radio was up 9%. On a same-station basis, Radio would have been up double digits. Local Broadcasting OIBDA before restructuring was $134 million up 148% as Les said. We doubled the margin of this business and achieved about an 85% flow-through from revenue, and we continue to take costs out of this segment. So with modest revenue growth, we will see continued further margin expansion. 
Outdoor revenues for the quarter were up 3% to $392 million. However, foreign currency contributed favorably four points of that growth. European revenues were up 1% in constant dollars. Outdoor OIBDA before restructuring charges increased 24% reflecting lower costs due to the cost-savings initiatives we implemented last year. We have also taken further cost out of the infrastructure this quarter, so we should see strong margin expansion in the next couple of quarters.
Turning to our balance sheet. We said we were focused on delevering the balance sheet, and let me discuss how we delivered on that promise. We paid down $400 million of our asset securitization as that source of financing became inefficient. Under the new accounting rules, this paydown is reflected in financing activities on our cash flow statement. We also pulled the $415 million of debt that was due in July of this year and paid it down with cash on hand in April. You will see that effect on our second quarter balance sheet.
Also during the quarter, we were able to buy back $20 million of our longer-dated security at a discount in the open market. So that brings our total deleveraging to a $835 million already this year, and we ended the quarter with $873 million of cash on hand. 
In April, we also issued a new $500 million ten-year bond at a coupon of 5.75%. We took those proceeds and tended for our near-term maturities due in 2011 and 2012. So right now, we don't have anymore debt maturing in 2010. And in 2011, we are down to $550 million due, a very manageable amount considering our cash position and a $2 billion undrawn credit facility. 
We are still focused on our balance sheet, and we'll continuously monitor the credit markets to tap them opportunistically. Our strong cash flow gave us the ability to delever as quickly as we have. Capital spending, cash taxes and interest were all better for the quarter. But the biggest benefit came from working capital. 
On our last call, we mentioned our strong historical conversion of OIBDA into free cash flow. Because of our strong first quarter, we are positioned to have a very strong cash flow year which will be helped by political spending, particularly in the fourth quarter as all the cash is paid upfront before airing.
Next, let me tell you about some trends we're seeing, starting with our content assets. Our Q1 strength is continuing into Q2. Scatter pricing at the network in the second quarter is currently up 20-plus percent, and we are well positioned for a strong upfront. Q2 domestic ad sales is pacing 20-plus percent for our Interactive unit, and our Cable Network revenue should continue to grow steadily in Q2. 
Turning to our local assets. The 25-plus percent pacing increase Les mentioned at the Television Station Group for the second quarter is even more impressive when you consider that there's no Super Bowl in Q2. Our top 10 Radio markets are leading the way in the second quarter and pacing up double digits. Our Outdoor group is currently pacing up mid-single digits on a constant-dollar basis and high-single digits on a reported basis. We said Outdoor was lagging our local businesses in the recovery, but now that growth seems to be accelerating. 
Q1 is historically our lowest-margin quarter of the year, and you can expect our operating margin to expand throughout the year but the fourth quarter being our strongest. As reminder, our Q2 financing activities will result in an accounting charge for the early extinguishment of a debt of approximately $40 million pretax which will be recorded in the second quarter. However, this cost will be offset by future interest savings.
So to wrap up, our businesses are growing the top line, we're expanding our margins and we're generating lots of free cash flow. I want to underscore what Les said about CBS going forward. We are positioning the company for the long-term success and increased stability in our operations, and reduced balance sheet exposure, and our recent actions demonstrate that. 
Thank you, and we'll now take your questions. Operator, please open the lines."

Since you had to pick a -- when the market fell apart or buy back, just talk about returning capital and how you view that? And the second question is, clearly, this year was going to be an amazing comeback year. I was hoping you could address next year, some of the swings for next year, how much will film losses come down? What will TV syndication look like year-over-year? It looks like NCAA losses will come down with the Turner deal, retransfer versus comp, looks like it will go up. Obviously the upfront will be good. And are there more cost savings from -- there's a lot of speculation with CNN doing those kind of deals. So can you just kind of go through some of the kind of swing factor as we may see over the next year?"

We reduced expenses, we strengthened our balance sheet, we invested in premium content and we maintained our leading position in local TV and radio. In good times and in bad, we've kept to our long-term strategy of serving growth and shareholder value. As a result, no company today is poised to benefit from the improving economy more than we are. 
The CBS television network continues its reign at number one. CBS Studio shows have thrived within global syndication. Premium cable continues to grow. We are ideally positioned in the largest local markets as they rebound, and we built a leading global presence on the internet as well. 
Without a doubt, CBS is built for long-term success. The results we're reporting today are not only a sign of momentum but a preview of the kind of success that I believe, that I know, CBS will have for many, many years to come. 
And now, I would like to turn the call over to my very good friend and my colleague, CBS's President and CEO, the incomparable, Leslie Moonves.

As you can see from our numbers today, we've just finished an extraordinary quarter. We're off to a terrific start this year, and the momentum reflected in these first quarter results is continuing right into the second quarter and beyond. Obviously, we are in a much better operating environment. 
In addition to that, we are now seeing the results of many significant steps we have taken to position CBS for success not just this year but for many years to come. With proper cost cutting and by establishing consistent new revenue streams, the future is indeed bright, and as the strong ad market continues to shine, our results are very satisfying. 
Today, I'm going to briefly review our results and some operating highlights of the first quarter, as well as discuss what we're seeing in the second quarter and into the future. Then, I'll turn it over to Joe to offer some more details on our financial results and balance sheet. Then as always, we'll be happy to take your questions.
Beginning with our very strong first quarter results, revenues of $3.5 billion were up 12% from the same quarter last year. This is our first double-digit year-over-year revenue increase since we became a stand-alone company at the end of 2005, and it represents strength in our biggest businesses across the organization. Our adjusted OIBDA of $351 million was up 40% year-over-year, and our adjusted operating income of $211 million was up 94%. 
As you know, we've spent the past two years reducing our cost structure across the entire company, and we now have the operating leverage to show for it. We've expanded our margin so we can build on that progress going forward. At the same time, we generated $660 million in free cash flow during the first quarter, more than triple the amount for the same period last year, and we continue to take steps to fortify our already-strong financial position. We have reduced our debt and taken advantage of favorable markets to refinance near-term debt at favorable terms. More on that later from Joe. 
There are three major factors that not only drove our strong results in the quarter but point to continued momentum throughout 2010 as well. First, in our Entertainment segment. At the network, we had great success in both our regularly scheduled programming and our major events. All of our tent-pole events, including the Super Bowl, the Grammys, the NCAA basketball tournament have posted multi-year highs and even broken records this year. Our number one network schedule and the growing success of our big event programming have been sold into what has become a very, very hot scatter market, and we are very well positioned going into the upfront. It will be the strongest one in years.
The second factor is the remarkable turnaround in local broadcasting where the advertising marketplace has improved significantly. We've got a great story here with 29% revenue growth at our TV stations and 9% growth in Radio which also is due to better programming. Their growth we're seeing today validates our long-term commitment to large market local presence. 
And third, there's continuing and strong growth of Cable Networks where OIBDA was up 21% in the quarter. This business has grown every single year since the separation in 2005, and it will continue to grow and remains a big part of our overall portfolio going forward.
All of these areas played an instrumental role in our fourth quarter top line results. We continue to deliver on our promise to position CBS for success in both the near and long term. That's clear from the many first quarter financial and operational highlights of our content and local businesses we're sharing with you today. 
Let's take a quick look at some of them now. Beginning with our Content Group and its largest segment, Entertainment. Within Entertainment, the CBS Television Network was our best performer, benefiting from the dramatic improvement in national advertising, the continued strength of our number one network, and as I said, our record-breaking Super Bowl performance. Network advertising revenues were up 25% in the quarter. We've been the biggest beneficiary of a very strong primetime scatter market with pricing up 30% over last year's upfront. Scatter continues to be very strong in the second quarter and things are looking very positive for us heading into the upfront. We expect to see solid increases when we sell our number one primetime schedule in this year's upfront marketplace. 
Along with the Super Bowl, we also had tremendous ratings success with the NCAA men's basketball tournament this year. The championship game was up 31% over a year ago and the most watched since 1997. Going forward, we will continue to broadcast television's biggest events with costs that allow us to grow our profits as well. To that end, a couple of weeks ago, we finalized the deal with the NCAA along with Turner Broadcasting Group to extend our relationship for the tournament through 2024.
As you've heard, this is a terrific deal for our company. It secures CBS as the year-round sports broadcast leader well into the next decade. And what's most important is that we'll keep this franchise in a way that is profitable for us. Previously, we had escalating rights fees that would have been challenging in the next three years. Now we have a deal that will have a positive impact to our results in its very first year and for the life of the contract. Also importantly, CBS is positioned in primetime programming and sports rights enhances our ability to benefit from the dual-revenue-stream broadcast model that continues to emerge. 
Retrans [retransmission] is a significant reality today. The value of broadcast content is finally being recognized and paid for. As we read everyday, the financial model of broadcast television is being greatly improved, and CBS is capturing the benefits of that. We are on pace for north of $100 million in retrans revenues this year, and we'll achieve multiples of that number going forward.
In addition to that, we're also now receiving incremental affiliate fees from our non-owned CBS television stations. We recently announced one significant new deal which follows others and there will be many, many more to come. All of this is adding up to meaningful, additional revenues that have never been accrued before. So now, we're getting paid for our premium television content through advertising, through retrans and through affiliate fees. 
Domestic and international syndication is another business that produces recurring and steady revenues, and it continues to perform well for us. Our shows are being syndicated faster and are reaching broader global audiences than ever before. And NCIS is shaping up to be a global franchise for us that may rival CSI in power and reach. As we capture more and more of these non-advertising-driven revenues, we're better monetizing our leading television content and diversifying our revenue base. 
We're focusing on monetizing our content online as well, and CBS Interactive turned in a strong performance in the first quarter of 2010. Display advertising revenues were up 19% year-over-year as this business benefited from both our growing online presence and the recovery that is taking hold in the online marketplace. 
We've consistently grown traffic levels, and that's driven our ad growth. Leading sites like CNET, BNET, CBSsports.com and CBSNews.com continue to pose year-over-year increases and offer our advertisers a unique combination of original Internet content and broadcast video. 
At CBS Films, our most recent movie, The Back-up Plan, is having a very respectable run. It's performed considerably better than our first film, and we anticipate continued improvement for this new division going forward.
Turning to Cable Network. This content business turns out single-digit revenue growth and double-digit profit growth quarter after quarter. As I said, it continues to deliver for the company year in and year out, both financially and creatively. 
Showtime Networks, the Smithsonian Channel and the CBS College Sports Network all added subscribers during the quarter. Showtime's content of original programming, sports and movies makes it must-have premium cable channel. And in the future, Showtime's movie lineup will include the recent Academy award-winning The Hurt Locker, the very popular Twilight series as well as Inglorious Basterds. Plus, we recently announced the new output deal for all DreamWorks films beginning with Steven Spielberg's upcoming World War I movie, War Horse.
The final component of our Content Group is Publishing. Simon & Schuster's first quarter revenues were off from last year, but we've done a lot in this division to reduce costs. As a result, despite lower revenues, first quarter OIBDA was up from last year. S&S has also made great strides in the fast-growing digital space. Our e-book Library is nearly up to nearly 8,000 titles, and we have custom apps and downloads for virtually every mobile device. Digital sales more than tripled in the first quarter and represent a growing share of our overall Publishing revenues.
Turning to our Local Group. We have seen an even more pronounced improvement in market conditions, particularly in our local TV and radio operations. Local Broadcasting revenues of $606 million for the first quarter of 2010 were up 19% from last year's first quarter. TV stations led the way but radio joined in the momentum as well. 
Based on current pacing, local TV ad revenue will be up north of 25% in the second quarter. And looking forward, a very strong political marketplace is just beginning. The many hotly contested races that are picking up speed and the recent Supreme Court ruling give us great optimism that political spending will be a positive development for us. The great majority of this will be seen in the third and fourth quarters. 
In Radio, fixing programming in our large markets continue to pay off with audience share growing fastest in our top 10 markets. In fact, in the first quarter, we added nearly 2 million listeners in our top 10 markets over last year's quarter, and this audience growth is translating to revenue. So far in the second quarter, Radio pacing is up high-single digits with major markets leading the way. For the first time in five years, we're seeing major plus signs in every financial metric in Radio.
Healthy revenues across our Local Broadcasting segment are translating to strong profit growth helped significantly by our reduced cost structure. As you saw in our release, adjusted OIBDA of $134 million was up 148% year-over-year. 
At Outdoor, we're seeing improvement as well. Sales pacing, which is flat year-over-year at this time last quarter, is now up mid-single digits with particular strength in large markets. So our revenue outlook for this year is brightening. Like our other local businesses, the generally fixed nature of our expenses in Outdoor means that when revenues rise, we quickly see the positive impact on our operating profits. Taken together, our local businesses, which were hit the hardest in 2009, are now producing nearly $1 billion in quarterly revenues for our company, an improvement of 12% over a year ago. 
In thinking about the quarter, 2010 and beyond, we're optimistic. CBS is doing a lot more than just reaping the benefits of an improving economy. We've taken a number of actions to position this company for success both in the near term and for years to come. For sometime now, we've committed to make sure CBS would thrive in a changing media landscape. We continue to execute on that vision every day. We have long worked to establish a dual-revenue-stream for broadcast television and now retrans is a fact in our business. 
Our goal has always been to produce and broadcast the best contents, and year after year, we have the number one network. We said that syndication is a lucrative market place and one that ultimately rewards the best contents, and we've since made record-breaking deals like the one for NCIS: Los Angeles. 
We promised to get bigger in the emerging digital marketplace, and today, we are among the leading global internet companies. When others did not, we believed in large market local broadcasting, and that strategy is paying us off through our actions to capitalize on the dramatic recovery that is underway. We said we would successfully refinance our debt and we are. I think it's clear that this company delivers on its promises. Going forward, we will continue to do so, and I assure you the best is yet to come. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe.

Today, I'm going to touch on some highlights for the quarter then discuss our recent financing activities and lastly, update you on trends we're seeing in Q2.

Today, I'm going to touch on some highlights for the quarter then discuss our recent financing activities and lastly, update you on trends we're seeing in Q2. 
I'll start with the total company results. As we said on our last call, 2010 was going to be about driving the top line, continuing to focus on controlling costs and generating significant amounts of free cash flow. This quarter results demonstrate just that. Revenues for the quarter were up 12% to $3.5 billion. We continue to restructure our operations and recorded a $57 million charge with the associated savings starting to kick in next quarter, and free cash flow is up over a threefold to $660 million for the quarter. Our 12% revenue increase was driven by a solid advertising marketplace. 
Total company advertising revenue was up 17% for the quarter led by the Super Bowl. Without the Super Bowl, our ad revenues are still up high-single digits. Affiliate and subscription fees also increased 11%. 
Adjusted OIBDA, which only excludes the restructuring charge I just mentioned, was up 40% for the quarter to $351 million. Our quarter-over-quarter OIBDA margin expanded 200 basis points. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.05 from a loss of $0.05 last year. We are adjusting for the restructuring charge and some discreet tax items. In 2010, we recorded a $26 million tax expense which included the impact of the change in the Healthcare Reform Act as well as favorable settlements of some state and local audits. These items, taken as a whole, had a negative $0.09 per share impact to our reported results. In 2009, we had a $19 million tax charge related to stock-based compensation, which amounted to $0.03 per share. Full reconciliations can be found in our press release. 
Let me discuss a few segment highlights. Entertainment revenues increased 15% to $2.1 billion led by the Super Bowl. Leading categories at network ad sales included financial services, telcos, auto and retail. We saw a slight decline in our Entertainment OIBDA before restructuring charges to $145 million from $151 million last year. The OIBDA was impacted by lower margin revenues from the Super Bowl as well as timing of programming costs. As an example, during Q1, we produced more of our own hit shows like NCIS: Los Angeles and The Good Wife. This will result in higher margins later in the year and subsequent years as a result of syndication of our studio product and expansion into additional international territories. 
Cable Networks' revenues increased 8% to $368 million due to rate and subscriber increases. Cable OIBDA increased 21% due to the solid revenue growth. OIBDA growth would have been even higher except for the timing of costs associated with series' premieres. The OIBDA margin for the remainder of the year for this segment will be considerably higher than Q1.
Publishing revenue for this quarter decreased $10 million from $162 million to $152 million reflecting the continued softness in the base retail market. Publishing still managed to turn in higher OIBDA before restructuring despite lower revenues as our reduced cost base took effect.
Local Broadcasting revenues were up 19% to $606 million with TV stations up 29%. Without the Super Bowl, TV stations were up north of 20% and Radio was up 9%. On a same-station basis, Radio would have been up double digits. Local Broadcasting OIBDA before restructuring was $134 million up 148% as Les said. We doubled the margin of this business and achieved about an 85% flow-through from revenue, and we continue to take costs out of this segment. So with modest revenue growth, we will see continued further margin expansion. 
Outdoor revenues for the quarter were up 3% to $392 million. However, foreign currency contributed favorably four points of that growth. European revenues were up 1% in constant dollars. Outdoor OIBDA before restructuring charges increased 24% reflecting lower costs due to the cost-savings initiatives we implemented last year. We have also taken further cost out of the infrastructure this quarter, so we should see strong margin expansion in the next couple of quarters.
Turning to our balance sheet. We said we were focused on delevering the balance sheet, and let me discuss how we delivered on that promise. We paid down $400 million of our asset securitization as that source of financing became inefficient. Under the new accounting rules, this paydown is reflected in financing activities on our cash flow statement. We also pulled the $415 million of debt that was due in July of this year and paid it down with cash on hand in April. You will see that effect on our second quarter balance sheet.
Also during the quarter, we were able to buy back $20 million of our longer-dated security at a discount in the open market. So that brings our total deleveraging to a $835 million already this year, and we ended the quarter with $873 million of cash on hand. 
In April, we also issued a new $500 million ten-year bond at a coupon of 5.75%. We took those proceeds and tended for our near-term maturities due in 2011 and 2012. So right now, we don't have anymore debt maturing in 2010. And in 2011, we are down to $550 million due, a very manageable amount considering our cash position and a $2 billion undrawn credit facility. 
We are still focused on our balance sheet, and we'll continuously monitor the credit markets to tap them opportunistically. Our strong cash flow gave us the ability to delever as quickly as we have. Capital spending, cash taxes and interest were all better for the quarter. But the biggest benefit came from working capital. 
On our last call, we mentioned our strong historical conversion of OIBDA into free cash flow. Because of our strong first quarter, we are positioned to have a very strong cash flow year which will be helped by political spending, particularly in the fourth quarter as all the cash is paid upfront before airing.
Next, let me tell you about some trends we're seeing, starting with our content assets. Our Q1 strength is continuing into Q2. Scatter pricing at the network in the second quarter is currently up 20-plus percent, and we are well positioned for a strong upfront. Q2 domestic ad sales is pacing 20-plus percent for our Interactive unit, and our Cable Network revenue should continue to grow steadily in Q2. 
Turning to our local assets. The 25-plus percent pacing increase Les mentioned at the Television Station Group for the second quarter is even more impressive when you consider that there's no Super Bowl in Q2. Our top 10 Radio markets are leading the way in the second quarter and pacing up double digits. Our Outdoor group is currently pacing up mid-single digits on a constant-dollar basis and high-single digits on a reported basis. We said Outdoor was lagging our local businesses in the recovery, but now that growth seems to be accelerating. 
Q1 is historically our lowest-margin quarter of the year, and you can expect our operating margin to expand throughout the year but the fourth quarter being our strongest. As reminder, our Q2 financing activities will result in an accounting charge for the early extinguishment of a debt of approximately $40 million pretax which will be recorded in the second quarter. However, this cost will be offset by future interest savings.
So to wrap up, our businesses are growing the top line, we're expanding our margins and we're generating lots of free cash flow. I want to underscore what Les said about CBS going forward. We are positioning the company for the long-term success and increased stability in our operations, and reduced balance sheet exposure, and our recent actions demonstrate that. 
Thank you, and we'll now take your questions. Operator, please open the lines.

We looked at an NCAA deal and we looked out what and said, ""Alright, what is the best situation for CBS?"" And we were able to make a terrific deal with Turner and then a terrific deal with NCAA, which as we've said, turned a challenging contract into a positive one. In terms of every part of our operation, we talked to everybody constantly. We've been talking to CNN for years about what we can do together. As you noticed, Anderson Cooper currently appears on 60 Minutes. So there's a lot of sharing going on, and we're in constant dialogue about how do we make our businesses better, how do we make it more efficient, and we will continue to do that.

And then the other thing, we're hearing about, and I'm not even sure this is legal, so I'd be interested in your reviews. Is there any concept that you would band together with some of your affiliates to try to kind of jointly negotiate these affiliate deals so that everybody could make more money?

In terms of -- we've had a number of conversations with different affiliate groups about talking to the MSOs together. It's not illegal. Frankly, every CBS affiliate shares the same programming, the same primetime, the same NFL, the same NCAA, the same Letterman, etc. And we have discussed the benefits of that, and we've discussed it frankly openly with our MSOs. And some of them have felt that it might be a better way to go. So it's something that's certainly on the table.

Good afternoon, everyone. I thank all of you for being with us today. I’m certain it will come as no surprise to you that I am more than pleased to be reporting another quarter of super, excellent results for CBS, results that clearly demonstrate our momentous momentum. As you know, I've been in this industry for a long, long time. I'm thrilled by how CBS is executing right now. We're not only capitalizing on the economic recovery in every one of our businesses, we’re operating more efficiently, we're using our industry-leading content to expand and to grow in new markets. 
Some of you may remember that many decades ago, I coined the phrase, ""Content is king. And content will always be king"". As for our content, it continues to dominate on the air, it dominates on the Web, it dominates here, it dominates abroad, whether it’s the first place CBS Television Network, our major market and local access, our leading global syndication business, our growing premium cable operation, our top-brand Internet properties, our investment in premium content, each delivering for CBS. At the same time, we see strategically constructed. We’ve cut costs throughout every part of our company. And we've done so, though, without compromising on our industry-leading content or our investments in the areas that represent the best long-term growth. And as Les and Joe will tell you, we've taken really key steps to reduce our debt, to strengthen our already solid financial position, and these steps will play a key part in success for many years to come. 
Today, CBS is positioned for tremendous long-term success. But not just for today, not just for tomorrow, but for many years to come well into the future. And I, for one, am proud to be working side-by-side with the many talented executives that are making all of this happen. Leading [ph], of course, is my very close good friend and colleague, CBS' President, Les Moonves. I'm going to turn the call over to him now.

We are very pleased to report that CBS' strong momentum is continuing with second quarter results that were outstanding in every single business unit. Revenues were up by double digits. Profits were up dramatically. And we added four points through our OIBDA margin versus last year's second quarter. In addition, we have more than doubled our free cash flow so far this year. These outstanding results are due in part to the economy, of course. We have said that the recovery would benefit CBS as much or more than any media company. And in fact, it is continuing to do so. But we're not just benefiting from a rising tide. We've taken steps throughout the company to run our businesses more efficiently, and as a result, we have lowered expenses and created a cost structure that allows more revenue dollars to fall to the bottom line. We've also strengthened our financial position by reducing our debt and our interest expense. And most importantly, we're constantly finding new ways to use this strength of our leading content to capitalize on emerging growth areas like retransmission consent and international distribution, and position CBS as a long-term leader in the evolving media marketplace.
This progress will continue through this year and 2011 and beyond. We've taken a number of actions to ensure this. For example, just yesterday, we announced our most significant deal on record for the carriage of our content. It's a milestone agreement with Comcast that includes CBS, Showtime and our other Cable Networks. Plus, it gives us another significant way to monetize our content across Comcast’s new media platforms. 
As previously stated, we are now well on our way to delivering on our goal of north of $250 million in annual revenue from retrans in 2012. Also the recent extension of our NCAA March Madness deal sets us up very well for the future. It allows us to keep a very high profile sports property on CBS with economics that make this franchise profitable from year one through the life of the contract, representing a huge improvement from the previous deal we had in place.
We're also realizing more revenue from our network programming all the time. We just completed a terrific upfront, once again leading the way in total volume and price increases. And in syndication, we continue to strike new deals to sell our network programming for more money after fewer episodes and to broader markets. And on the balance sheet, we've reduced our debt significantly, which Joe will tell you about later. 
Now I'm going to briefly review our results and some operating highlights for the second quarter, as well as discuss what we're seeing in the second half of 2010. Then I'll turn it over to Joe to offer some more details on our financial results and balance sheet. Then, as always, we'll be happy to take your questions.
Beginning with our very strong second quarter results, revenues of $3.3 billion were up 11% from the same quarter last year. This is our second consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, and as I said, it was driven by top-line gains in every one of our businesses. Our adjusted OIBDA of $580 million was up 46% year-over-year and our adjusted operating income of $437 million was up 74%. Thanks to our lower cost structure, margins were up seven percentage points from the first quarter, and as I said, four points from last year's second quarter. We have no intention of letting costs creep back into our operations, so you should expect to see continued margin expansion over the long-term.
At the same time, we generated $492 million in free cash flow during the second quarter, up 40% from the same period last year. That brings our year-to-date free cash flow to $1.15 billion. Again, more than double the total for last year's first half and more than many had predicted, we produced for the entire year. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our financial position, year-to-date results and prospects for the remainder of 2010 and beyond.
Each one of our content and local businesses had significant successes in the quarter. And let's take a look at some of them now. Beginning with our Content Group and its largest segment, Entertainment, the CBS Television Network continues to play an integral role in our success. The network finished another Television season in first place, which helped revenues grow during the quarter, and also put us in a very strong position in the recent upfront marketplace. 
As you recall, last year, we held back about 35% of our inventory with the expectation that pricing would improve along with the economy. This year, demand and pricing were so strong we ended up selling about 80%, and we feel very good about our ability to improve our ratings in the year ahead and continue growing network revenues and profits. 
Our Entertainment segment advertising revenue were also helped up by the Final Four of the NCAA men's basketball tournament, which took place in the second quarter of this year. As I mentioned going forward, we'll realize vastly improved economics on this franchise as a result of our recently extended deal that will keep the tournament on CBS through 2024. Having the best sports and entertainment programming is a critical component in our long-term strategy to be the leading beneficiary of the growing dual revenue stream in broadcast television. 
We've been saying for years that are broadcast content needs to receive its proper value from distributors. Over time, we've made tremendous progress, reaching more than 60 retransmission consent agreements with cable operators, satellite companies and telcos at increasingly better terms for us. The deal we announced yesterday with Comcast epitomizes our momentum in this area and it does a lot more than just recognize the value of CBS entertainment, news and sports programming on Comcast’s cable television platform. It also includes online and VOD distribution and it enhances the long-term growth of Showtime Networks and improves the economics of CBS College Sports and the Smithsonian Channel. This is a great deal for both parties and we're extremely pleased to be in business with Comcast for a long, long time.
Domestic and international syndication is another growing part of our business. Revenues from licensing and distribution of TV programming were up 12% thanks to international syndication sales of our CSI franchise and our new hit shows NCIS: Los Angeles and The Good Wife, which as you'll recall, were the top two freshman-scripted series of the last television season. 
Once again, syndication is another important way we're extracting value for our content and it’s recurring in dependable, non-advertising related revenue streams. And given the strong international marketplace and increasingly aggressive buyers here at home, our hit series are now making a profit from day one.
In our Films division, The Back-up Plan did far better than our first movie. And our next film, Faster, comes out at Thanksgiving and is already generating a lot of buzz. And we'll shortly have some exciting announcements about our 2011 slate.
Also in our Entertainment segment, CBS Interactive performed very well in the second quarter, as the recovery in the online advertising marketplace continued. We are finding better ways to monetize full-length episodes and clips of our shows online and successfully creating new Internet content on all of our sites as well. This strategy is producing strong growth in both advertising and audience. Display advertising revenues were up 22% in the quarter and June comp score numbers showed that unique visitors to our sites grew by double digits with category leaders like CNET, CBSNews.com, CBSsports.com, Last.fm and CHOW notching the biggest increases.
Turning to our Cable Network segment, which also had a terrific quarter, revenues were up 12% and OIBDA was up 33% from the same period last year. Year-over-year, we've added more than 5 million subscriptions at Showtime Networks, another 5 million plus at CBS College Sports and more than 1 million at Smithsonian Channel. And rates have increased as well. Showtime continues to deliver strong results because of its outstanding original programming. Along those lines, we look forward to the debut of the Big C later this month starting Laura Linney, who was featured this past weekend on the cover of the New York Times Sunday Magazine. 
Our final Content Group is Publishing, and the performance here also is the best we've seen in quite some time. Simon & Schuster’s second quarter revenues were up 5% from last year, and with all of the expense savings we've realized during that time, OIBDA increased by an impressive 64%.
Later this month, we look forward to the release of The Power by Rhonda Byrne. The Power is Byrne's follow-up to the massive hit, The Secret, which sold 19 million copies so far and has been a New York Times bestseller for 166 weeks running. And of course, we also continue to be a major player in the growing digital transition that is going on the Publishing industry.
Turning to our Local Group, these businesses, particularly TV and Radio, have truly bounced back in 2010. Revenues in our Local Broadcasting segments were up 17% for the quarter with TV station advertising revenues up 31% and Radio ad revenue up 8%. At the same time, Local Broadcasting OIBDA was up more than 100% year-over-year and we added 14 points of OIBDA margin versus last year's second quarter. Even better, we see this growth continuing through the rest of the year. The second quarter's local TV ad growth is continuing well into the third. We do not foresee a slowdown. 
In addition, political advertising is shaping up to be a major driver of our performance in the fourth quarter, where we'll have two things working in our favor: a large number of critical hard court elections in many of our major markets and the new court decision, which allows increased spending. 
Outdoor is now joining the momentum as well. Second quarter revenues were up 6% in constant dollars as the advertising marketplace continued to improve. Sales pacing is accelerating into the third quarter as well, so things are looking good going forward. And from an OIBDA perspective, a little revenue growth goes a long, long way in this business. Outdoor adjusted OIBDA for the second quarter was up 76% from the same period last year.
A final point on our Local Group, in the coming weeks, we will launch a new Web site in New York that will truly leverage the power of our local assets. It will utilize WCBS TV and our three news and sports radio stations to create a single, local online destination, CBSNewYork.com. We're confident we have a terrific formula to serve the local needs of New Yorkers and we will be rolling out similar sites to other major markets around the country soon. I look forward to reporting to you on the progress of this significant growth opportunity for us. 
I think you can see why we're so pleased with the results of the second quarter, which speak to the strength of all of our businesses. Across the board, we saw higher revenues, wider margins and a number of signs pointing to continued sustainable growth. With each quarter, it’s increasingly clear that CBS is doing more than just participating in an economic recovery. We're producing and distributing excellent content and finding new ways to monetize it all the time. We're establishing and growing meaningful and incremental revenue streams that build upon the quality of our leading content around the world. We are keeping a tight lid on expenses to ensure that even as the economy continues to improve, costs remain contained and our revenue dollars translate more efficiently into profits. We're generating substantial free cash flow and using that cash to help our company going forward by reducing our debt and interest expense.
We have every reason to believe that the success we're experiencing across our businesses will continue into the third quarter and then we have the addition of political dollars in the fourth. So not only was the second quarter great, but the future looks bright as well. 
Thank you. And with that, I will turn it over to Joe."

Today, I will provide additional color on the results for the quarter, discuss our recent financing activities and lastly, add to Les's comments on what we’re seeing in the back half of the year. Starting with",1229,"Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will provide additional color on the results for the quarter, discuss our recent financing activities and lastly, add to Les's comments on what we’re seeing in the back half of the year. Starting with our results, the 11% company-wide revenue growth that Les mentioned can be broken down as follows: Total advertising revenues were up 9%, driven by the local and national marketplaces; content licensing and distribution was up 19%, with strong sales from international TV license fees; and affiliate and subscription revenues were up 12% due to our growing subscriber base, as well as substantially higher retrans dollars. At the adjusted OIBDA and operating income level, we are only adjusting for restructuring charges, which amounted to $1.7 million in Q2 2010 and $8.8 million in Q2 2009. So reported OIBDA was actually up 49% and reported operating income was up 80%, both better than adjusted results. 
On our last call, we said to expect margin improvement, and you can see it in our results today, driven by revenue growth plus the benefits of our recent restructuring activities. The company's adjusted OIBDA margin expanded 700 basis points from the first quarter to 17% in this quarter and expanded 400 basis points from the second quarter last year.
These are not just higher percentages but higher earnings dollars as well. Cable Networks, Local Broadcasting and Outdoor were the biggest drivers. Second quarter adjusted EPS came in at $0.25, which includes a $0.02 loss from foreign currency due to the stronger U.S. dollar, compared to $0.09 last year. In addition to restructuring charges I just mentioned, we are adjusting for the loss of early extinguishment of debt in both periods and some discrete tax items in 2009. 
Looking on a year-to-date basis, our revenues were up 11%, adjusted OIBDA was up 44% and adjusted operating income was up 80%, a very strong to rebound from a year ago.
Now I'll touch on some on details of our operating segments. Second quarter Entertainment revenues were up 10% to about $1.7 billion. Network ad sales were up 5% for the quarter. Scattered pricing in the quarter was up in the mid-20s above the upfront. Adjusted OIBDA was up 7% to $223 million for the quarter at our Entertainment segment. We have continued to invest in content and we expect to see higher margins starting in 2011 and beyond when you start seeing the effects of our newly-extended NCAA March Madness deal, as well as incremental retrans dollars. We had another solid quarter at our Cable segments, where subscriber and rate increases lead to our 35% OIBDA margin, which by the way, we expect to increase even further.
Our Publishing revenues benefited from strong digital book sales, which increased 71% for the quarter and continue to become a growing part of our business. Our Local Broadcast revenues increased 17% this quarter to $678 million. TV station ad sales grew 31% with political advertising contributing six points of growth. Radio station spot sales were up 8% with our top-10 markets finishing up 10%. Category strength in both TV and Radio was broad-based, led by automotive, telecom, retail, financial services and entertainment. While growth our local businesses are strong, we still have lots of room to grow. And as you see in the second quarter, 100% of the revenue increase flowed through to OIBDA, which more than doubled to $214 million, and now represents a 32% margin.
Turning to Outdoor, on our constant dollar basis, Outdoor revenues were up 6% in the quarter. The growth in the Americas was 6% led by 9% growth in the United States, while European revenues were up 5% with our biggest market, the U.K., up 14%. OIBDA grew, as Les said, 76%, or $34 million, which significantly exceeded our revenue increases as our low-cost base and restructured contracts are starting to take effect.
Turning to our balance sheet, free cash flow came in at $492 million for the quarter, up 40%. But during the first six months of 2010, we generated $1.15 billion of cash, an increase of over $300 million more than all of last year. We've been active on the financing front as well. In Q1, we paid down the entire $400 million asset securitization program. This quarter, we call $415 million of debt, which was due in July, so we had no other maturities this year. We've also tendered for some near-term debt and issued a $500 million 10-year bond. Overall, we have de-levered the company by $840 million since the start of the year and have extended our weighted average debt maturities to 16 years. In fact, our aggregate debt maturities over the next three years is only slightly higher than the free cash flow we just generated in six months. This deleveraging will save us approximately $40 million a year in annualized interest costs. We remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating and our $2 billion credit facility remains undrawn and we have significant headroom within our leverage and coverage ratios.  We ended the quarter with $838 million of cash on hand, an increase of $121 million from the beginning of the year, while still achieving all the deleveraging I just mentioned. 
In terms of the current marketplace, here's what we're seeing, starting with our content asset. As Les said, we just concluded a strong upfront for the new broadcast season, which is a good starting point for 2011. Scattered pricing in Q3 is accelerating and projected to be up 30-plus percent above the upfront. And this demand is growing as we head into the new season, which will lead to significant pricing premiums. So those advertisers who bought any upfront, I think, will be very pleased. At our Interactive unit, Q3 domestic display sales are pacing up plus 20%. Our content businesses will also benefit in Q3 from another strong quarter from our affiliate and subscription revenues.
Turning to our local assets, TV stations are expected to be up in the mid-20s excluding politicals for the third quarter, continuing its first-half momentum. Radio stations are pacing up high single digits with the top 10 markets continuing to lead the way. And our Outdoor group is currently pacing up high single digits on a constant dollar basis. The total company should achieve its highest OIBDA margin of the year in the fourth quarter driven by political advertising contributions, which could approach $200 million for the year. We also want to reiterate our CapEx full-year estimate guidance of $250 million to $300 million, as well as our book income tax rate of approximately 40% for the full year.
I'll wrap up with a few final thoughts. The advertising marketplace is rebounding and we expect to be one of the biggest beneficiaries, which means we expect growth for the 2/3 of our revenue base that is advertising. The non-advertising piece also continues to grow, given the structural changes in the business. This includes a growing international demand for our content and incremental retrans and other subscription-based fees. And finally, we remain committed to driving our operating margins, and we’re confident we can expand these margins, which should generate even higher profit dollars in 2011 and 2012. So there’s significant upside in the business model from where we sit today. 
With that, Melissa, we can open the lines for questions."

And it was global in nature and what was very unusual about it also was that it was a year and a half early before we started. The reason is that there a lot of big wins, and as I said, for both companies. Number one, we've established that CBS will be paid for retrans, something that I've been talking about for years and is a significant part of the future of our company. And that revenue stream that will continue, we now have a dual revenue stream base for CBS going forward. It establishes a growing revenue stream for Showtime. And for those who had any question about the ability of Showtime to continue to increase and thrive in the marketplace, Showtime is now secure and financially in great shape. But once again, from Comcast's point of view, they recognize the value of the content on CBS and Showtime. Plus, for those of you who've been following, Comcast is one of the most advanced companies in talking about online media and how to best use content online in a variety of different ways, whether it be video-on-demand or all sorts of other new methods of doing it. The key for us with this partnership is the flexibility. We're going to be trying lots of things with Comcast to put our media online and our content online. By the same token, it doesn't limit us to do other deals outside of it. So across the board, CBS Showtime new media, it’s a big win for us going forward. And as I said, it ensures a continuing and growing revenue stream year after year over the long length of this contract."

There's a great deal of flexibility with our new media prospects and there's a certain amount of knowledge about where these deals are going. So yes, could it fluctuate, could Comcast in the end of 10 years be paying us more than some of their other deals or less than some of their other deals? I guess that's possible. But overall, we see an increase, a growth over the course of time for Showtime and CBS, and incremental pricing is built in to what we both felt was fair. So it was an opportunity to have sustained growth, sustained revenue, which I know it's important to you guys as you look at as an advertising company, and just assume for a second that we may have been able to sort of get a fair deal on what this would be worth in 10 years."

Your business is recovering, your balance sheet’s in good shape. Any further thoughts on streamlining your asset base at all, in things like U.K., Outdoor or Publishing, or even domestic Outdoor, all seem non-core. And I’m guessing you think your stock is cheap, so reallocating capital from non-core businesses to your stock might make some sense. And then separately, on the new Comcast deal, how does VOD work now? That’s something that’s always been difficult to monetize. As they put more of your shows on VOD, is that something you'd be able to monetize at a reasonable level?"

However, there appears to be some nice activity now in some of the pricing, so I wouldn't be surprised if over the next six months to a year, we do divest some of our radio stations in a few markets and maybe one or two television stations. In terms of VOD, Doug, once again, it is not a big cash business yet. There will be some more content on VOD. It does work, but there is a profit-sharing on there. But it's not a major business. We've been doing this with Comcast, frankly, for five or six years. It really is not a great effect to the bottom line for either them or us."

As it grows, we are going to need to monetize it so that there are dollars replacing dollars and that is the game plan and the potential for things like TV Everywhere is something that is attractive for us. In other words, if Comcast is paying us for sub, then that sub should be paying the MSO their fee to be able to get our product online.

As you know, I've been in this industry for a long, long time. I'm thrilled by how CBS is executing right now. We're not only capitalizing on the economic recovery in every one of our businesses, we’re operating more efficiently, we're using our industry-leading content to expand and to grow in new markets. 
Some of you may remember that many decades ago, I coined the phrase, ""Content is king. And content will always be king"". As for our content, it continues to dominate on the air, it dominates on the Web, it dominates here, it dominates abroad, whether it’s the first place CBS Television Network, our major market and local access, our leading global syndication business, our growing premium cable operation, our top-brand Internet properties, our investment in premium content, each delivering for CBS. At the same time, we see strategically constructed. We’ve cut costs throughout every part of our company. And we've done so, though, without compromising on our industry-leading content or our investments in the areas that represent the best long-term growth. And as Les and Joe will tell you, we've taken really key steps to reduce our debt, to strengthen our already solid financial position, and these steps will play a key part in success for many years to come. 
Today, CBS is positioned for tremendous long-term success. But not just for today, not just for tomorrow, but for many years to come well into the future. And I, for one, am proud to be working side-by-side with the many talented executives that are making all of this happen. Leading [ph], of course, is my very close good friend and colleague, CBS' President, Les Moonves. I'm going to turn the call over to him now.

Thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report that CBS' strong momentum is continuing with second quarter results that were outstanding in every single business unit. Revenues were up by d",2058,"Thank you, Sumner, and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report that CBS' strong momentum is continuing with second quarter results that were outstanding in every single business unit. Revenues were up by double digits. Profits were up dramatically. And we added four points through our OIBDA margin versus last year's second quarter. In addition, we have more than doubled our free cash flow so far this year. These outstanding results are due in part to the economy, of course. We have said that the recovery would benefit CBS as much or more than any media company. And in fact, it is continuing to do so. But we're not just benefiting from a rising tide. We've taken steps throughout the company to run our businesses more efficiently, and as a result, we have lowered expenses and created a cost structure that allows more revenue dollars to fall to the bottom line. We've also strengthened our financial position by reducing our debt and our interest expense. And most importantly, we're constantly finding new ways to use this strength of our leading content to capitalize on emerging growth areas like retransmission consent and international distribution, and position CBS as a long-term leader in the evolving media marketplace.
This progress will continue through this year and 2011 and beyond. We've taken a number of actions to ensure this. For example, just yesterday, we announced our most significant deal on record for the carriage of our content. It's a milestone agreement with Comcast that includes CBS, Showtime and our other Cable Networks. Plus, it gives us another significant way to monetize our content across Comcast’s new media platforms. 
As previously stated, we are now well on our way to delivering on our goal of north of $250 million in annual revenue from retrans in 2012. Also the recent extension of our NCAA March Madness deal sets us up very well for the future. It allows us to keep a very high profile sports property on CBS with economics that make this franchise profitable from year one through the life of the contract, representing a huge improvement from the previous deal we had in place.
We're also realizing more revenue from our network programming all the time. We just completed a terrific upfront, once again leading the way in total volume and price increases. And in syndication, we continue to strike new deals to sell our network programming for more money after fewer episodes and to broader markets. And on the balance sheet, we've reduced our debt significantly, which Joe will tell you about later. 
Now I'm going to briefly review our results and some operating highlights for the second quarter, as well as discuss what we're seeing in the second half of 2010. Then I'll turn it over to Joe to offer some more details on our financial results and balance sheet. Then, as always, we'll be happy to take your questions.
Beginning with our very strong second quarter results, revenues of $3.3 billion were up 11% from the same quarter last year. This is our second consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, and as I said, it was driven by top-line gains in every one of our businesses. Our adjusted OIBDA of $580 million was up 46% year-over-year and our adjusted operating income of $437 million was up 74%. Thanks to our lower cost structure, margins were up seven percentage points from the first quarter, and as I said, four points from last year's second quarter. We have no intention of letting costs creep back into our operations, so you should expect to see continued margin expansion over the long-term.
At the same time, we generated $492 million in free cash flow during the second quarter, up 40% from the same period last year. That brings our year-to-date free cash flow to $1.15 billion. Again, more than double the total for last year's first half and more than many had predicted, we produced for the entire year. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our financial position, year-to-date results and prospects for the remainder of 2010 and beyond.
Each one of our content and local businesses had significant successes in the quarter. And let's take a look at some of them now. Beginning with our Content Group and its largest segment, Entertainment, the CBS Television Network continues to play an integral role in our success. The network finished another Television season in first place, which helped revenues grow during the quarter, and also put us in a very strong position in the recent upfront marketplace. 
As you recall, last year, we held back about 35% of our inventory with the expectation that pricing would improve along with the economy. This year, demand and pricing were so strong we ended up selling about 80%, and we feel very good about our ability to improve our ratings in the year ahead and continue growing network revenues and profits. 
Our Entertainment segment advertising revenue were also helped up by the Final Four of the NCAA men's basketball tournament, which took place in the second quarter of this year. As I mentioned going forward, we'll realize vastly improved economics on this franchise as a result of our recently extended deal that will keep the tournament on CBS through 2024. Having the best sports and entertainment programming is a critical component in our long-term strategy to be the leading beneficiary of the growing dual revenue stream in broadcast television. 
We've been saying for years that are broadcast content needs to receive its proper value from distributors. Over time, we've made tremendous progress, reaching more than 60 retransmission consent agreements with cable operators, satellite companies and telcos at increasingly better terms for us. The deal we announced yesterday with Comcast epitomizes our momentum in this area and it does a lot more than just recognize the value of CBS entertainment, news and sports programming on Comcast’s cable television platform. It also includes online and VOD distribution and it enhances the long-term growth of Showtime Networks and improves the economics of CBS College Sports and the Smithsonian Channel. This is a great deal for both parties and we're extremely pleased to be in business with Comcast for a long, long time.
Domestic and international syndication is another growing part of our business. Revenues from licensing and distribution of TV programming were up 12% thanks to international syndication sales of our CSI franchise and our new hit shows NCIS: Los Angeles and The Good Wife, which as you'll recall, were the top two freshman-scripted series of the last television season. 
Once again, syndication is another important way we're extracting value for our content and it’s recurring in dependable, non-advertising related revenue streams. And given the strong international marketplace and increasingly aggressive buyers here at home, our hit series are now making a profit from day one.
In our Films division, The Back-up Plan did far better than our first movie. And our next film, Faster, comes out at Thanksgiving and is already generating a lot of buzz. And we'll shortly have some exciting announcements about our 2011 slate.
Also in our Entertainment segment, CBS Interactive performed very well in the second quarter, as the recovery in the online advertising marketplace continued. We are finding better ways to monetize full-length episodes and clips of our shows online and successfully creating new Internet content on all of our sites as well. This strategy is producing strong growth in both advertising and audience. Display advertising revenues were up 22% in the quarter and June comp score numbers showed that unique visitors to our sites grew by double digits with category leaders like CNET, CBSNews.com, CBSsports.com, Last.fm and CHOW notching the biggest increases.
Turning to our Cable Network segment, which also had a terrific quarter, revenues were up 12% and OIBDA was up 33% from the same period last year. Year-over-year, we've added more than 5 million subscriptions at Showtime Networks, another 5 million plus at CBS College Sports and more than 1 million at Smithsonian Channel. And rates have increased as well. Showtime continues to deliver strong results because of its outstanding original programming. Along those lines, we look forward to the debut of the Big C later this month starting Laura Linney, who was featured this past weekend on the cover of the New York Times Sunday Magazine. 
Our final Content Group is Publishing, and the performance here also is the best we've seen in quite some time. Simon & Schuster’s second quarter revenues were up 5% from last year, and with all of the expense savings we've realized during that time, OIBDA increased by an impressive 64%.
Later this month, we look forward to the release of The Power by Rhonda Byrne. The Power is Byrne's follow-up to the massive hit, The Secret, which sold 19 million copies so far and has been a New York Times bestseller for 166 weeks running. And of course, we also continue to be a major player in the growing digital transition that is going on the Publishing industry.
Turning to our Local Group, these businesses, particularly TV and Radio, have truly bounced back in 2010. Revenues in our Local Broadcasting segments were up 17% for the quarter with TV station advertising revenues up 31% and Radio ad revenue up 8%. At the same time, Local Broadcasting OIBDA was up more than 100% year-over-year and we added 14 points of OIBDA margin versus last year's second quarter. Even better, we see this growth continuing through the rest of the year. The second quarter's local TV ad growth is continuing well into the third. We do not foresee a slowdown. 
In addition, political advertising is shaping up to be a major driver of our performance in the fourth quarter, where we'll have two things working in our favor: a large number of critical hard court elections in many of our major markets and the new court decision, which allows increased spending. 
Outdoor is now joining the momentum as well. Second quarter revenues were up 6% in constant dollars as the advertising marketplace continued to improve. Sales pacing is accelerating into the third quarter as well, so things are looking good going forward. And from an OIBDA perspective, a little revenue growth goes a long, long way in this business. Outdoor adjusted OIBDA for the second quarter was up 76% from the same period last year.
A final point on our Local Group, in the coming weeks, we will launch a new Web site in New York that will truly leverage the power of our local assets. It will utilize WCBS TV and our three news and sports radio stations to create a single, local online destination, CBSNewYork.com. We're confident we have a terrific formula to serve the local needs of New Yorkers and we will be rolling out similar sites to other major markets around the country soon. I look forward to reporting to you on the progress of this significant growth opportunity for us. 
I think you can see why we're so pleased with the results of the second quarter, which speak to the strength of all of our businesses. Across the board, we saw higher revenues, wider margins and a number of signs pointing to continued sustainable growth. With each quarter, it’s increasingly clear that CBS is doing more than just participating in an economic recovery. We're producing and distributing excellent content and finding new ways to monetize it all the time. We're establishing and growing meaningful and incremental revenue streams that build upon the quality of our leading content around the world. We are keeping a tight lid on expenses to ensure that even as the economy continues to improve, costs remain contained and our revenue dollars translate more efficiently into profits. We're generating substantial free cash flow and using that cash to help our company going forward by reducing our debt and interest expense.
We have every reason to believe that the success we're experiencing across our businesses will continue into the third quarter and then we have the addition of political dollars in the fourth. So not only was the second quarter great, but the future looks bright as well. 
Thank you. And with that, I will turn it over to Joe.

Today, I will provide additional color on the results for the quarter, discuss our recent financing activities and lastly, add to Les's comments on what we’re seeing in the back half of the year. Starting with",1229,"Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will provide additional color on the results for the quarter, discuss our recent financing activities and lastly, add to Les's comments on what we’re seeing in the back half of the year. Starting with our results, the 11% company-wide revenue growth that Les mentioned can be broken down as follows: Total advertising revenues were up 9%, driven by the local and national marketplaces; content licensing and distribution was up 19%, with strong sales from international TV license fees; and affiliate and subscription revenues were up 12% due to our growing subscriber base, as well as substantially higher retrans dollars. At the adjusted OIBDA and operating income level, we are only adjusting for restructuring charges, which amounted to $1.7 million in Q2 2010 and $8.8 million in Q2 2009. So reported OIBDA was actually up 49% and reported operating income was up 80%, both better than adjusted results. 
On our last call, we said to expect margin improvement, and you can see it in our results today, driven by revenue growth plus the benefits of our recent restructuring activities. The company's adjusted OIBDA margin expanded 700 basis points from the first quarter to 17% in this quarter and expanded 400 basis points from the second quarter last year.
These are not just higher percentages but higher earnings dollars as well. Cable Networks, Local Broadcasting and Outdoor were the biggest drivers. Second quarter adjusted EPS came in at $0.25, which includes a $0.02 loss from foreign currency due to the stronger U.S. dollar, compared to $0.09 last year. In addition to restructuring charges I just mentioned, we are adjusting for the loss of early extinguishment of debt in both periods and some discrete tax items in 2009. 
Looking on a year-to-date basis, our revenues were up 11%, adjusted OIBDA was up 44% and adjusted operating income was up 80%, a very strong to rebound from a year ago.
Now I'll touch on some on details of our operating segments. Second quarter Entertainment revenues were up 10% to about $1.7 billion. Network ad sales were up 5% for the quarter. Scattered pricing in the quarter was up in the mid-20s above the upfront. Adjusted OIBDA was up 7% to $223 million for the quarter at our Entertainment segment. We have continued to invest in content and we expect to see higher margins starting in 2011 and beyond when you start seeing the effects of our newly-extended NCAA March Madness deal, as well as incremental retrans dollars. We had another solid quarter at our Cable segments, where subscriber and rate increases lead to our 35% OIBDA margin, which by the way, we expect to increase even further.
Our Publishing revenues benefited from strong digital book sales, which increased 71% for the quarter and continue to become a growing part of our business. Our Local Broadcast revenues increased 17% this quarter to $678 million. TV station ad sales grew 31% with political advertising contributing six points of growth. Radio station spot sales were up 8% with our top-10 markets finishing up 10%. Category strength in both TV and Radio was broad-based, led by automotive, telecom, retail, financial services and entertainment. While growth our local businesses are strong, we still have lots of room to grow. And as you see in the second quarter, 100% of the revenue increase flowed through to OIBDA, which more than doubled to $214 million, and now represents a 32% margin.
Turning to Outdoor, on our constant dollar basis, Outdoor revenues were up 6% in the quarter. The growth in the Americas was 6% led by 9% growth in the United States, while European revenues were up 5% with our biggest market, the U.K., up 14%. OIBDA grew, as Les said, 76%, or $34 million, which significantly exceeded our revenue increases as our low-cost base and restructured contracts are starting to take effect.
Turning to our balance sheet, free cash flow came in at $492 million for the quarter, up 40%. But during the first six months of 2010, we generated $1.15 billion of cash, an increase of over $300 million more than all of last year. We've been active on the financing front as well. In Q1, we paid down the entire $400 million asset securitization program. This quarter, we call $415 million of debt, which was due in July, so we had no other maturities this year. We've also tendered for some near-term debt and issued a $500 million 10-year bond. Overall, we have de-levered the company by $840 million since the start of the year and have extended our weighted average debt maturities to 16 years. In fact, our aggregate debt maturities over the next three years is only slightly higher than the free cash flow we just generated in six months. This deleveraging will save us approximately $40 million a year in annualized interest costs. We remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating and our $2 billion credit facility remains undrawn and we have significant headroom within our leverage and coverage ratios.  We ended the quarter with $838 million of cash on hand, an increase of $121 million from the beginning of the year, while still achieving all the deleveraging I just mentioned. 
In terms of the current marketplace, here's what we're seeing, starting with our content asset. As Les said, we just concluded a strong upfront for the new broadcast season, which is a good starting point for 2011. Scattered pricing in Q3 is accelerating and projected to be up 30-plus percent above the upfront. And this demand is growing as we head into the new season, which will lead to significant pricing premiums. So those advertisers who bought any upfront, I think, will be very pleased. At our Interactive unit, Q3 domestic display sales are pacing up plus 20%. Our content businesses will also benefit in Q3 from another strong quarter from our affiliate and subscription revenues.
Turning to our local assets, TV stations are expected to be up in the mid-20s excluding politicals for the third quarter, continuing its first-half momentum. Radio stations are pacing up high single digits with the top 10 markets continuing to lead the way. And our Outdoor group is currently pacing up high single digits on a constant dollar basis. The total company should achieve its highest OIBDA margin of the year in the fourth quarter driven by political advertising contributions, which could approach $200 million for the year. We also want to reiterate our CapEx full-year estimate guidance of $250 million to $300 million, as well as our book income tax rate of approximately 40% for the full year.
I'll wrap up with a few final thoughts. The advertising marketplace is rebounding and we expect to be one of the biggest beneficiaries, which means we expect growth for the 2/3 of our revenue base that is advertising. The non-advertising piece also continues to grow, given the structural changes in the business. This includes a growing international demand for our content and incremental retrans and other subscription-based fees. And finally, we remain committed to driving our operating margins, and we’re confident we can expand these margins, which should generate even higher profit dollars in 2011 and 2012. So there’s significant upside in the business model from where we sit today. 
With that, Melissa, we can open the lines for questions.

And it was global in nature and what was very unusual about it also was that it was a year and a half early before we started. The reason is that there a lot of big wins, and as I said, for both companies. Number one, we've established that CBS will be paid for retrans, something that I've been talking about for years and is a significant part of the future of our company. And that revenue stream that will continue, we now have a dual revenue stream base for CBS going forward. It establishes a growing revenue stream for Showtime. And for those who had any question about the ability of Showtime to continue to increase and thrive in the marketplace, Showtime is now secure and financially in great shape. But once again, from Comcast's point of view, they recognize the value of the content on CBS and Showtime. Plus, for those of you who've been following, Comcast is one of the most advanced companies in talking about online media and how to best use content online in a variety of different ways, whether it be video-on-demand or all sorts of other new methods of doing it. The key for us with this partnership is the flexibility. We're going to be trying lots of things with Comcast to put our media online and our content online. By the same token, it doesn't limit us to do other deals outside of it. So across the board, CBS Showtime new media, it’s a big win for us going forward. And as I said, it ensures a continuing and growing revenue stream year after year over the long length of this contract.

What was significant last year is NCIS sold after six episodes, which in previous years, that's domestically, you would've needed to wait until there were already at least three years to shop. Now because the demand was so high for that show on and The Mentalist over at Warner Bros., that people are bidding for shows right out of the box, which is a great thing for us.

And I think we've been pretty prudent to date and we're going to continue to do so. But we have been proponents of returning capital to shareholders. We have done some share repurchase programs, some ASRs when we had that. And we have then maintained a dividend throughout our separation from Viacom. So you're going to continue to see us discuss all those things. As far as 2011 goes, I mean, look, I just sized political for you. The Super Bowl, I mean, you know the way the accounting works for that. So it may be interesting on top of revenue, but not in terms of profits. So I’m not sure what other headwinds you’re referring to. But I’m going to point to a strong upfront that starts the season, since we know that's good. We know we have accelerated growth in retrans. I just jotted a list of other cost items that are going to be a benefit. So we're confident we can have expanded margins in 2011 that's going to lead to additional profit dollars, like we said.

Good afternoon, everyone. I thank all of you for being with us today. I’m certain it will come as no surprise to you that I am more than pleased to be reporting another quarter of super, excellent results for CBS, results that clearly demonstrate our momentous momentum. As you know, I've been in this industry for a long, long time. I'm thrilled by how CBS is executing right now. We're not only capitalizing on the economic recovery in every one of our businesses, we’re operating more efficiently, we're using our industry-leading content to expand and to grow in new markets. 
Some of you may remember that many decades ago, I coined the phrase, ""Content is king. And content will always be king"". As for our content, it continues to dominate on the air, it dominates on the Web, it dominates here, it dominates abroad, whether it’s first place CBS Television Network, our major market and local access, our leading global syndication business, our growing premium cable operation or our top-brand Internet properties, our investment in premium content, each delivering for CBS. At the same time, we see strategically constructed. We’ve cut costs throughout every part of our company. And we've done some of those without compromising on our industry-leading content or our investments in the areas that represent the best long-term growth. And as Les and Joe will tell you, we've taken really key steps to reduce our debt, to strengthen our already solid financial position, and these steps will play a key part in our success for many years to come. 
Today, CBS is positioned for tremendous long-term success. But not just for today, not just for tomorrow, but for many years to come well into the future. And I, for one, am proud to be working side-by-side with the many talented executives that are making all of this happen. Leading [ph] (0:17:20.7), of course, is my very close good friend and colleague, CBS' President, Les Moonves. I'm going to turn the call over to him now.

Revenues were up by d",2057,"Thank you, Sumner, and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report that CBS' strong momentum is continuing with second quarter results that were outstanding in every single business unit. Revenues were up by double digits. Profits were up dramatically. And we added four points to our OIBDA margin versus last year's second quarter. In addition, we have more than doubled our free cash flow so far this year. These outstanding results are due in part to the economy, of course. We have said that the recovery would benefit CBS as much or more than any media company. And in fact, it is continuing to do so. But we're not just benefiting from a rising tide. We've taken steps throughout the company to run our businesses more efficiently, and as a result, we have lowered expenses and created a cost structure that allows more revenue dollars to fall to the bottom line. We've also strengthened our financial position by reducing our debt and our interest expense. And most importantly, we're constantly finding new ways to use the strength of our leading content to capitalize on emerging growth areas like retransmission consent and international distribution and position CBS as a long-term leader in the evolving media marketplace.
This progress will continue through this year and 2011 and beyond. We've taken a number of actions to ensure this. For example, just yesterday, we announced our most significant deal on record for the carriage of our content. It's a milestone agreement with Comcast that includes CBS, Showtime and our other Cable Networks. Plus, it gives us another significant way to monetize our content across Comcast’s new media platforms. 
As previously stated, we are now well on our way to delivering on our goal of north of $250 million in annual revenue from retrans in 2012. Also the recent extension of our NCAA March Madness deal sets us up very well for the future. It allows us to keep a very high profile sports property on CBS with economics that make this franchise profitable from year one through the life of the contract, representing a huge improvement from the previous deal we had in place.
We're also realizing more revenue from our network programming all the time. We just completed a terrific upfront, once again leading the way in total volume and price increases. And in syndication, we continue to strike new deals to sell our network programming for more money after fewer episodes and to broader markets. And on the balance sheet, we've reduced our debt significantly, which Joe will tell you about later. 
Now I'm going to briefly review our results and some operating highlights for the second quarter, as well as discuss what we're seeing in the second half of 2010. Then I'll turn it over to Joe to offer some more details on our financial results and balance sheet. Then, as always, we'll be happy to take your questions.
Beginning with our very strong second quarter results, revenues of $3.3 billion were up 11% from the same quarter last year. This is our second consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, and as I said, it was driven by top-line gains in every one of our businesses. Our adjusted OIBDA of $580 million was up 46% year-over-year and our adjusted operating income of $437 million was up 74%. Thanks to our lower cost structure, margins were up seven percentage points from the first quarter, and as I said, four points from last year's second quarter. We have no intention of letting costs creep back into our operations, so you should expect to see continued margin expansion over the long-term.
At the same time, we generated $492 million in free cash flow during the second quarter, up 40% from the same period last year. That brings our year-to-date free cash flow to $1.15 billion. Again, more than double the total for last year's first half and more than many had predicted, we produced for the entire year. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our financial position, year-to-date results and prospects for the remainder of 2010 and beyond.
Each one of our content and local businesses had significant successes in the quarter. And let's take a look at some of them now. Beginning with our Content Group and its largest segment, Entertainment, the CBS Television Network continues to play an integral role in our success. The network finished another Television season in first place, which helped revenues grow during the quarter, and also put us in a very strong position in the recent upfront marketplace. 
As you recall, last year, we held back about 35% of our inventory with the expectation that pricing would improve along with the economy. This year, demand and pricing were so strong we ended up selling about 80%, and we feel very good about our ability to improve our ratings in the year ahead and continue growing network revenues and profits. 
Our Entertainment segment advertising revenue were also helped up by the Final Four of the NCAA men's basketball tournament, which took place in the second quarter of this year. As I mentioned going forward, we'll realize vastly improved economics on this franchise as a result of our recently extended deal that will keep the tournament on CBS through 2024. Having the best sports and entertainment programming is a critical component in our long-term strategy to be the leading beneficiary of the growing dual revenue stream in broadcast television. 
We've been saying for years that are broadcast content needs to receive its proper value from distributors. Over time, we've made tremendous progress, reaching more than 60 retransmission consent agreements with cable operators, satellite companies and telcos at increasingly better terms for us. The deal we announced yesterday with Comcast epitomizes our momentum in this area and it does a lot more than just recognize the value of CBS entertainment, news and sports programming on Comcast’s cable television platform. It also includes online and VOD distribution and it enhances the long-term growth of Showtime Networks and improves the economics of CBS College Sports and the Smithsonian Channel. This is a great deal for both parties and we're extremely pleased to be in business with Comcast for a long, long time.
Domestic and international syndication is another growing part of our business. Revenues from licensing and distribution of TV programming were up 12% thanks to international syndication sales of our CSI franchise and our new hit shows NCIS: Los Angeles and The Good Wife, which as you'll recall, were the top two freshman-scripted series of the last television season. 
Once again, syndication is another important way we're extracting value for our content and it’s recurring in dependable, non-advertising related revenue streams. And given the strong international marketplace and increasingly aggressive buyers here at home, our hit series are now making a profit from day one.
In our Films division, The Back-up Plan did far better than our first movie. And our next film, Faster, comes out at Thanksgiving and is already generating a lot of buzz. And we'll shortly have some exciting announcements about our 2011 slate.
Also in our Entertainment segment, CBS Interactive performed very well in the second quarter, as the recovery in the online advertising marketplace continued. We are finding better ways to monetize full-length episodes and clips of our shows online and successfully creating new Internet content on all of our sites as well. This strategy is producing strong growth in both advertising and audience. Display advertising revenues were up 22% in the quarter and June comp score numbers showed that unique visitors to our sites grew by double digits with category leaders like CNET, CBSNews.com, CBSsports.com, Last.fm and CHOW notching the biggest increases.
Turning to our Cable Network segment, which also had a terrific quarter, revenues were up 12% and OIBDA was up 33% from the same period last year. Year-over-year, we've added more than 5 million subscriptions at Showtime Networks, another 5 million plus at CBS College Sports and more than 1 million at Smithsonian Channel. And rates have increased as well. Showtime continues to deliver strong results because of its outstanding original programming. Along those lines, we look forward to the debut of the Big C later this month starting Laura Linney, who was featured this past weekend on the cover of the New York Times Sunday Magazine. 
Our final Content Group is Publishing, and the performance here also is the best we've seen in quite some time. Simon & Schuster’s second quarter revenues were up 5% from last year, and with all of the expense savings we've realized during that time, OIBDA increased by an impressive 64%.
Later this month, we look forward to the release of The Power by Rhonda Byrne. The Power is Byrne's follow-up to the massive hit, The Secret, which sold 19 million copies so far and has been a New York Times bestseller for 166 weeks running. And of course, we also continue to be a major player in the growing digital transition that is going on the Publishing industry.
Turning to our Local Group, these businesses, particularly TV and Radio, have truly bounced back in 2010. Revenues in our Local Broadcasting segments were up 17% for the quarter with TV station advertising revenues up 31% and Radio ad revenue up 8%. At the same time, Local Broadcasting OIBDA was up more than 100% year-over-year and we added 14 points of OIBDA margin versus last year's second quarter. Even better, we see this growth continuing through the rest of the year. The second quarter's local TV ad growth is continuing well into the third. We do not foresee a slowdown. 
In addition, political advertising is shaping up to be a major driver of our performance in the fourth quarter, where we'll have two things working in our favor: a large number of critical hard court elections in many of our major markets and the new court decision, which allows increased spending. 
Outdoor is now joining the momentum as well. Second quarter revenues were up 6% in constant dollars as the advertising marketplace continued to improve. Sales pacing is accelerating into the third quarter as well, so things are looking good going forward. And from an OIBDA perspective, a little revenue growth goes a long, long way in this business. Outdoor adjusted OIBDA for the second quarter was up 76% from the same period last year.
A final point on our Local Group, in the coming weeks, we will launch a new website in New York that will truly leverage the power of our local assets. It will utilize WCBS TV and our three news and sports radio stations to create a single, local online destination, CBSNewYork.com. We're confident we have a terrific formula to serve the local needs of New Yorkers and we will be rolling out similar sites to other major markets around the country soon. I look forward to reporting to you on the progress of this significant growth opportunity for us. 
I think you can see why we're so pleased with the results of the second quarter, which speak to the strength of all of our businesses. Across the board, we saw higher revenues, wider margins and a number of signs pointing to continued sustainable growth. With each quarter, it’s increasingly clear that CBS is doing more than just participating in an economic recovery. We're producing and distributing excellent content and finding new ways to monetize it all the time. We're establishing and growing meaningful and incremental revenue streams that build upon the quality of our leading content around the world. We are keeping a tight lid on expenses to ensure that even as the economy continues to improve, costs remain contained and our revenue dollars translate more efficiently into profits. We're generating substantial free cash flow and using that cash to help our company going forward by reducing our debt and interest expense.
We have every reason to believe that the success we're experiencing across our businesses will continue into the third quarter and then we have the addition of political dollars in the fourth. So not only was the second quarter great, but the future looks bright as well. 
Thank you. And with that, I will turn it over to Joe."

Today, I will provide additional color on the results for the quarter, discuss our recent financing activities and lastly, add to Les's comments on what we’re seeing in the back half of the year. Starting wit",1230,"Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will provide additional color on the results for the quarter, discuss our recent financing activities and lastly, add to Les's comments on what we’re seeing in the back half of the year. 
Starting with our results. The 11% company-wide revenue growth that Les mentioned can be broken down as follows: Total advertising revenues were up 9%, driven by the local and national marketplaces; content licensing and distribution was up 19%, with strong sales from international TV license fees; and affiliate and subscription revenues were up 12% due to our growing subscriber base, as well as substantially higher retrans dollars. At the adjusted OIBDA and operating income level, we are only adjusting for restructuring charges, which amounted to $1.7 million in Q2 2010 and $8.8 million in Q2 2009. So reported OIBDA was actually up 49% and reported operating income was up 80%, both better than adjusted results. 
On our last call, we said to expect margin improvement, and you can see it in our results today, driven by revenue growth plus the benefits of our recent restructuring activities. The company's adjusted OIBDA margin expanded 700 basis points from the first quarter to 17% in this quarter and expanded 400 basis points from the second quarter last year.
These are not just higher percentages but higher earnings dollars as well. Cable Networks, Local Broadcasting and Outdoor were the biggest drivers. Second quarter adjusted EPS came in at $0.25, which includes a $0.02 loss from foreign currency due to the stronger U.S. dollar compared to $0.09 last year. In addition to the restructuring charges I just mentioned, we are adjusting for the loss of early extinguishment of debt in both periods and some discrete tax items in 2009. 
Looking on a year-to-date basis, our revenues were up 11%, adjusted OIBDA was up 44% and adjusted operating income was up 80%, a very strong rebound from a year ago.
Now I'll touch on some on details of our operating segments. Second quarter Entertainment revenues were up 10% to about $1.7 billion. Network ad sales were up 5% for the quarter. Scatter pricing in the quarter was up in the mid-20s above the upfront. Adjusted OIBDA was up 7% to $223 million for the quarter at our Entertainment segment. We have continued to invest in content and we expect to see higher margins starting in 2011 and beyond when you start seeing the effects of our newly extended NCAA March Madness deal, as well as incremental retrans dollars. We had another solid quarter at our Cable segments, where subscriber and rate increases lead to our 35% OIBDA margin, which by the way, we expect to increase even further.
Our Publishing revenues benefited from strong digital book sales, which increased 71% for the quarter and continue to become a growing part of our business. Our Local Broadcast revenues increased 17% this quarter to $678 million. TV station ad sales grew 31% with political advertising contributing six points of growth. Radio station spot sales were up 8% with our top-10 markets finishing up 10%. Category strength in both TV and Radio was broad-based, led by automotive, telecom, retail, financial services and entertainment. While growth our local businesses are strong, we still have lots of room to grow. And as you see in the second quarter, 100% of the revenue increase flowed through to OIBDA, which more than doubled to $214 million, and now represents a 32% margin.
Turning to Outdoor, on our constant dollar basis, Outdoor revenues were up 6% in the quarter. The growth in the Americas was 6% led by 9% growth in the United States, while European revenues were up 5% with our biggest market, the U.K., up 14%. OIBDA grew, as Les said, 76%, or $34 million, which significantly exceeded our revenue increases as our low-cost base and restructured contracts are starting to take effect.
Turning to our balance sheet, free cash flow came in at $492 million for the quarter, up 40%. But during the first six months of 2010, we generated $1.15 billion of cash, an increase of over $300 million more than all of last year. We've been active on the financing front as well. In Q1, we paid down the entire $400 million asset securitization program. This quarter, we call $415 million of debt, which was due in July, so we had no other maturities this year. We've also tendered for some near-term debt and issued a $500 million 10-year bond. Overall, we have de-levered the company by $840 million since the start of the year and have extended our weighted average debt maturities to 16 years. In fact, our aggregate debt maturities over the next three years is only slightly higher than the free cash flow we just generated in six months. This deleveraging will save us approximately $40 million a year in annualized interest costs. We remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating and our $2 billion credit facility remains undrawn and we have significant headroom within our leverage and coverage ratios.  We ended the quarter with $838 million of cash on hand, an increase of $121 million from the beginning of the year, while still achieving all the deleveraging I just mentioned. 
In terms of the current marketplace, here's what we're seeing, starting with our content asset. As Les said, we just concluded a strong upfront for the new broadcast season, which is a good starting point for 2011. Scattered pricing in Q3 is accelerating and projected to be up 30-plus percent above the upfront. And this demand is growing as we head into the new season, which will lead to significant pricing premiums. So those advertisers who bought any upfront, I think, will be very pleased. At our Interactive unit, Q3 domestic display sales are pacing up plus 20%. Our content businesses will also benefit in Q3 from another strong quarter from our affiliate and subscription revenues.
Turning to our local assets, TV stations are expected to be up in the mid-20s excluding politicals for the third quarter, continuing its first-half momentum. Radio stations are pacing up high single digits with the top 10 markets continuing to lead the way. And our Outdoor group is currently pacing up high single digits on a constant dollar basis. The total company should achieve its highest OIBDA margin of the year in the fourth quarter driven by political advertising contributions, which could approach $200 million for the year. We also want to reiterate our CapEx full-year estimate guidance of $250 million to $300 million, as well as our book income tax rate of approximately 40% for the full year.
I'll wrap up with a few final thoughts. The advertising marketplace is rebounding and we expect to be one of the biggest beneficiaries, which means we expect growth for the 2/3 of our revenue base that is advertising. The non-advertising piece also continues to grow, given the structural changes in the business. This includes a growing international demand for our content and incremental retrans and other subscription-based fees. And finally, we remain committed to driving our operating margins, and we’re confident we can expand these margins, which should generate even higher profit dollars in 2011 and 2012. So there’s significant upside in the business model from where we sit today. 
With that, Melissa, we can open the lines for questions."

And it was global in nature and what was very unusual about it also was that it was a year and a half early before we started. The reason is that there a lot of big wins, and as I said, for both companies. Number one, we've established that CBS will be paid for retrans, something that I've been talking about for years and is a significant part of the future of our company. And that revenue stream that will continue, we now have a dual revenue stream base for CBS going forward. It establishes a growing revenue stream for Showtime. And for those who had any question about the ability of Showtime to continue to increase and thrive in the marketplace, Showtime is now secure and financially in great shape. But once again, from Comcast's point of view, they recognize the value of the content on CBS and Showtime. Plus, for those of you who've been following, Comcast is one of the most advanced companies in talking about online media and how to best use content online in a variety of different ways, whether it be video-on-demand or all sorts of other new methods of doing it. The key for us with this partnership is the flexibility. We're going to be trying lots of things with Comcast to put our media online and our content online. By the same token, it doesn't limit us to do other deals outside of it. So across the board, CBS Showtime new media, it’s a big win for us going forward. And as I said, it ensures a continuing and growing revenue stream year after year over the long length of this contract."

But this was a new deal because it's the first time we’ve negotiated with Comcast as a freestanding network, not part of any other large cable group. So regarding discussions, yes, we are having discussions with our affiliates and certain deals have been struck where we are sharing and we are getting paid money from our affiliates as bigger deals come up. That is part of the new way of doing business and everybody acknowledges, one again, we are providing premium content and that should be paid for, both by the MSOs, as well as our affiliates. And that's what’s happening here. When we talk about what are we going to do with our cash, obviously, we are in very solid shape, as Joe said, with having paid down the debt. We're examining that as we speak before the end of the year. We're going to determine what to do with our cash, whether it involves paying down further debt, whether it involves retraining money to our shareholders in the form of increased dividends or share repurchase.

There's a great deal of flexibility with our new media prospects and there's a certain amount of knowledge about where these deals are going. So yes, could it fluctuate, could Comcast in the end of 10 years be paying us more than some of their other deals or less than some of their other deals? I guess that's possible. But overall, we see an increase, a growth over the course of time for Showtime and CBS, and incremental pricing is built in to what we both felt was fair. So it was an opportunity to have sustained growth, sustained revenue, which I know it's important to you guys as you look at as an advertising company, and just assume for a second that we may have been able to sort of get a fair deal on what this would be worth in 10 years."

Obviously, content is going more and more online, which is why we're exploring that. It, obviously, right now doesn't come close to the amount of revenue we're generating over the air in our normal broadcast methods. As it grows, we are going to need to monetize it so that there are dollars replacing dollars and that is the game plan and the potential for things like TV Everywhere is something that is attractive for us. In other words, if Comcast is paying us for sub, then that sub should be paying the MSO their fee to be able to get our product online. So the great news about the new deal, a lot of it is experimentation. A lot of it is very flexible and you're going to be seeing all sorts of new things going on between us."

Thank you very much for joining us. As you see from the results we're reporting today, we had another terrific quarter, and our momentum continues to build. Each quarter in 2010 has been better than the on",2196,"Thank you, Sumner, and good afternoon, everybody. Thank you very much for joining us. As you see from the results we're reporting today, we had another terrific quarter, and our momentum continues to build. Each quarter in 2010 has been better than the one before. Advertising revenues are growing. Profits are higher, and margins are expanding. A great deal of our success comes from how well our content has performed and how well we are monetizing that performance.
The things that we told you would happen over the last several quarters are, in fact, happening. We are benefiting greatly from a return of advertising to historical levels. We are diversifying and derisking our business model by growing our secondary revenue streams. Our major-market local assets are experiencing excellent growth, and once again, most importantly, our content is thriving across the company, also across the country, on a variety of platforms. 
At the same time, we're managing our businesses more efficiently, holding down costs and strengthening our financial position as the markets improve. We have taken a number of steps to greatly improve our balance sheet by paying down debt. All of this is coming through in our results, with double-digit growth in profits in EPS and even better growth in free cash flow. These healthy levels of free cash have enabled us to announce today a $1.5 billion share repurchase program beginning January 1. Returning value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks has been one of our highest priorities all along, and we are pleased to deliver on that objective.
All of these factors that I just mentioned have brought about a structural change that will cause our strong performance to continue into 2011 and beyond. In addition, the two new long-term deals we added with Comcast and the NCAA will only help us that much more. So between the performance of our content, the improving operating environment and our very strong balance sheet, you can forgive me for being even a little bit more bullish than usual today. It's a real good time to be a shareholder of CBS.
I'm going to give some additional comments, then I'll turn it over to our, CFO, Joe Ianniello, and then as always, we'll take your questions. I'll begin with our very strong third quarter financial results. EPS for the quarter of $0.35 was up 40% versus last year's third quarter. OIBDA of $667 million was up 17% as profitability continues to improve significantly, and OIBDA margins are expanding as well. We are now approaching pre-recession levels. This is a trend that should continue into next year as our new and better deals kick in. We grow our secondary revenue streams, and we make sure that the costs we cut a couple of years ago will never return.
Total company advertising revenues were up 10%, and affiliate and subscription fees were up 15%. So healthy underlying growth continues. These increases are even more encouraging, given that last year's third quarter was when the economy began to pick up. We also generated $260 million in free cash flow, a significant improvement over last year's quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $1.4 billion, up 165% over the same time period last year.
Again, it's because of this healthy free cash flow that we were able to announce the $1.5 billion share buyback I mentioned earlier. Let's take a look at each of our businesses and some third quarter highlights. Beginning with our Content Group and its largest segment, Entertainment, where we produced revenue of $1.6 billion and OIBDA of $278 million in the quarter. Underlying advertising growth in the Entertainment segment was very strong, led by a 7% increase at the CBS Television Network. 
As you know, we've had a phenomenal start to the new season, winning the first five weeks of the season in all key measures, viewers 25 to 54 and 18 to 49. This is the first time any network has done this since 1997, and it only happened twice since people meters were introduced in 1987. Our schedule is incredibly stable, and we expect it to continue to shine for the rest of the season. Our returning shows remain very strong, and the five new shows we launched are the top five new shows of the fall, led by the number one new show, Hawaii Five-0. All five of our new shows have been picked up for the entire season.
We not only outperformed the field in this year's upfront marketplace, but we're now reaping the greatest benefits of the increase in scatter pricing as well. Because of the strength of our prime time schedule, scatter is up more than 35% over the upfront, which bodes very well for the fourth quarter and the first quarter of '11 as well.
In addition, NFL ratings are up 12% year-over-year this season. We have extremely high demand for our AFC package, and our sales are phenomenally strong. We expect this to continue right through the AFC Championship Game in January. As you know, advertising is just one way we capitalize on our content. Very positive trends in non-advertising-dependent revenues, including global syndication, retransmission consent and license fees from emerging platforms continue to strengthen the evolving broadcast model. Including the three new CBS-produced dramas on our schedule this season, our studio now owns 27 shows that are currently in production, meaning that ratings success represents just the first length in our increasingly valuable monetary content chain. 
Let me point out just a few of the incremental ways we're getting paid for our content now. First, syndication. Domestically, we're selling our new hit shows earlier and at record prices. And international syndication is becoming a bigger piece of the pie as well, representing an important long-term growth opportunity for us. 
This season, we sold all three of our new dramas internationally for north of $2 million an episode each, meaning that all three were profitable before a single episode air. Within weeks of announcing Hawaii Five-0 was on our schedule, we sold it in more than 100 markets, and now it's in nearly all 200 of our overseas markets . And of course, on this show, domestic syndication is still to come. We're also expanding internationally by gaining equity in new overseas channels. As you know, last year, we partnered with Liberty to rebrand six local U.K. channels as CBS channels and expand our programming there. During the quarter, we entered into two new similar joint ventures. One, with Reliance in India for three channels in India, and another with Network Ten in Australia, the people who own the Ten Network, for a partnership to provide content to the new cable channel 11.
Next, in addition to syndication, retrans is now a very significant and continuing part of our content value chain as well. Our retransmission consent revenue was up more than 40% year-to-date versus the same time period last year and will easily meet our full year target of $100 million. This important revenue stream will keep growing for us, and the economics of our groundbreaking new 10-year deal with Comcast will benefit our bottom line for a long, long time.
We are pleased that without a fuss, the largest cable operator recognized the value of our content in a way that benefited both sides of the negotiations. Retrans, as well as broadcast affiliate compensation to us, will continue to grow every single year. 
And finally, it's becoming increasingly clear that every new online distribution platform needs premium content to successfully launch their service. We continue to talk to all of these companies, companies you all know very well, about ways we can get the proper value for our programming. We have and we'll continue to pick and choose the best deal for our shareholders as we grow this additional revenue stream. 
Meanwhile, our in-house websites led CBS Interactive to a very strong third quarter, with display advertising revenue up 17% year-over-year. Our ad sales, site traffic and audience engagement all continue to grow and to outpace the industry. Clearly, when you have the most successful shows on air, it crosses over to online as well, and not just CBS.com and TV.com, but also social communities like Facebook, where we have nearly 50 million fans for our prime time shows.
The cross-platform presence is appealing to our advertisers who are increasingly making both on-air and digital buys with us. Our Cable Network segment also had a terrific quarter. revenue was up 12%, and OIBDA was up 33% from the same period last year. Year-over-year, we've added more than 4 million subscriptions at Showtime Networks and nearly 5 million at CBS College Sports, and rates have increased as well. We are confident that all of our Cable Networks will continue to add more subscribers and value to our portfolio going forward.
And Cable is another business where the strength of our content is driving our performance. During the quarter, we debuted yet another critically acclaimed Showtime original series, The Big C. The show's launch drew our highest ratings for an original series premier in eight years, and it's staying strong. Our returning series, Weeds and Dexter, also premiered new seasons during the quarter. Both shows had their highest premiers ever. And Dexter was Showtime's best overall original series season premiere in 15 years. 
At Publishing, revenue was $218 million in the third quarter, and OIBDA was $31 million, up 10%, as our expense rationalization efforts keep paying off. Just as with our TV programming, where digital continues to be a growing part of the business, digital competition between Apple, Barnes & Noble, Google, Amazon and the rest has us well-positioned in the e-book space, giving our leading content. We had more New York Times bestsellers in this year's third quarter than we did last year. And our newest releases by authors Vince Flynn and Bob Woodward are outperforming their previous titles.
Turning to Local Broadcasting. We had another outstanding performance as the local ad market recovery continued into the third quarter. Revenue was up 15%, with TV station advertising revenue up 25%, and Radio ad revenue up 9%. At the same time, Local Broadcasting OIBDA increased 49% year-over-year, and our OIBDA margin was 29%.
Strong pacing is continuing into the fourth quarter. Radio is pacing up double-digits, and our TV station group is trending to be up more than 20% over last year. Political advertising will contribute significantly to our fourth quarter results. We saw a very strong political spending right up through the mid-term elections this week, and the demand for political time pushed non-political dollars past the election into the rest of the fourth quarter. The momentum in local TV advertising continues well beyond the fourth quarter. 
Momentum also continues at Outdoor as well. Third quarter revenue was up 10% in constant dollars as the advertising marketplace continued to improve. OIBDA more than doubled year-over-year in the quarter as a result of both the top line growth and this business' new streamlined cost structure. We continue to renegotiate and enter into new contracts at better terms, which will be reflected in our results going forward as well.
One final note on our Local Group. I mentioned to you last quarter that we were launching a single website in New York called cbsnewyork.com. This site combines the resources of WCBS channel 2, 1010 WINS, WCBS 880 and WFAN The Fan to become the premier local information destination in the market. We have since launched six more similar local sites in major markets where we own TV and radio stations, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Dallas and Boston. We are very encouraged by the early results. And going forward, we expect to be generating hundreds of millions of dollars from our local websites within the next few years.
Across the board during the quarter, we were able to once again deliver on our promises and produce results that speak to our ongoing growth and success. Beyond the strong finish we expect this year, there are a number of developments that will drive our continued momentum into '11 and '12. These include the best start any television network has had in 13 years with successful new shows that are already profitable and will generate revenue for years to come.
The increasing value of our content in a dual revenue stream universe including retrans, affiliate compensation and emerging online services, dramatically improve contracts like the new Comcast and NCAA deals, which truly kick in beginning next year, the broad-based recovery at the local ad market where there's still lots of room for more growth. Our lower cost structure, which allows more revenue to translate into profits. Interest expense alone will be down $90 million annually following all of our debt actions this year. And as you saw with our announcement today, a share repurchase program that returns additional value to shareholders as our businesses continue to throw off lots of cash. So yes, we had a terrific quarter. But as you see, the best is yet to come. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

Today, I'll provide some more detail on our results for the quarter, highlight our recent financing activities and new share buyback program and update you on what we're seeing in Q4 and the things we know about",1399,"Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide some more detail on our results for the quarter, highlight our recent financing activities and new share buyback program and update you on what we're seeing in Q4 and the things we know about 2011.
Starting with our total company results for the quarter. Total revenue of $3.3 billion compares to $3.35 billion for the same quarter last year when we benefited from the sale of five major television series that went into first cycle syndication. To give you a sense of the size of these titles, we're talking about over $300 million in revenue at about a 35% OIBDA margin, which is not included in this year's third quarter.
Meanwhile, as Les said, total advertising revenue was up 10% and affiliate and subscription revenues were up 15%, illustrating the ongoing strength in our underlying businesses. The 10% advertising growth accelerated from Q2's 9% despite tougher comps this quarter.
Reported OIBDA was up 33% for the quarter to $750 million. Reported operating income increased 46%, and reported diluted EPS increased 53% to $0.46. We are adjusting our reported results for four items in 2010: a favorable legal recovery of $90 million; a gain on sale of a TV station of approximately $8 million; an $18 million tax benefit from the settlements of income tax audits; and restructuring charges of $7 million. In 2009, we are adjusting for three items: another favorable legal recovery of $28 million; $42 million of tax benefits from additional audit settlements; and impairment charges of $32 million.
Adjusting for these items in the quarter, total company OIBDA came in at $667 million, a 17% increase. Operating income was up 25%, and diluted EPS of $0.35 was up 40%. Margin expansion continues to be a key area of focus for us. So let's look at that trend.
Total company's OIBDA margin in Q1 2010 was 10% and in Q2, it expanded to 17%. And now in Q3, it has reached 20%, which is near 2007 levels. Our Q3 OIBDA margin is a 300 basis point improvement to last year's third quarter, even without the benefit of the five syndication titles, and these are not only percentage increases we're talking about. They are higher dollars as well. 
Let's quickly look at our year-to-date results. Total company revenue up 7%, OIBDA up 31%, operating income of 50%, and net earnings up 133%. This flow-through demonstrates the strength of our operating leverage.
Looking at our segments for the quarter. Entertainment revenue of $1.6 billion was down 12% due to the five shows that went into syndication last year. Our 7% increase in network advertising revenue accelerated from 5% in Q2. OIBDA for the Entertainment segment finished at $278 million, down $47 million as the syndication benefit from last year more than offset the growth from ad revenues from the Network and Interactive and higher retrans revenues.
At Cable Networks, revenue was up 12%, and OIBDA was up 33%. Telcos and satellite operators drove the subscriber growth. On a year-to-date basis, our Cable OIBDA margin is at 36%, up 500 basis points from the same period a year ago. We expect the fourth quarter margin to be 40-plus percent for Cable.
Publishing revenue of $218 million for the quarter was down 6%. However, Publishing OIBDA for the quarter was up 10% to $31 million as we continue our cost-containment actions. E-books now comprise approximately 7% of total revenue and will continue to be a growing part of the revenue base.
At Local Broadcasting, the strong revenue and profit increases already discussed have improved our OIBDA margin seven percentage points from last year to 29%, and we expect Local Broadcasting's fourth quarter margin to be up in the mid-30s. 
And then Outdoor, revenue for the quarter was 8% to $460 million on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, Outdoor revenue increased 10%. The Americas led the way with a 15% increase, driven by higher occupancy. Outdoor OIBDA of $77 million increased 136% from last year's third quarter as we are benefiting from higher revenue, cost-saving initiatives and more favorable contracts. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Free cash flow came in at $260 million for the quarter compared to a $24 million use of cash last year. And it bears repeating that on a year-to-date basis, free cash flow is $1.4 billion, up 165% from prior year. We've used this cash primarily to strengthen our balance sheet. Our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $1.1 billion. And so far this quarter, we've issued $600 million of new debt at very attractive rates. The 4.3% coupon for our 10-year note is the lowest rate in our history. In fact, it's the lowest rate ever for all of media.
This week, we've also called the $544 million that was due in May 2011, so total gross debt on the balance sheet as of September 30 will decrease by $500-plus million before year-end. The net result from all our financing activities this year leaves only $490 million of debt coming due over the next three years and saves us approximately $90 million per year in interest costs.
So our balance sheet has never been stronger, which brings me to our next topic of returning capital to shareholders. The $1.5 billion share buyback program we announced today is expected to be executed over approximately 18 months starting in January, which will come to about $500 million every six months. At our current share price, this program constitutes about 30% of our shares outstanding. The combination of this buyback, along with our dividend, provides our shareholders a very attractive total return yield. It also represents a significant payout ratio and gives you a clear indication of what we're doing with our cash flow.
Looking ahead, here is what we're seeing in Q4 for our advertising businesses. As stated earlier, network scatter market remains robust. It is up over 35% above the upfront and broad-based among categories. Online display advertising is pacing up mid-teens. TV station revenue is pacing to be up over 20% against tougher comps. Radio stations are pacing to be up double-digits, which is an acceleration from the third quarter.
We're having a record political year at our Local Broadcasting segment, and we expect to exceed our full year $200 million target. Our Outdoor group is currently pacing up high single-digits on a constant-dollar basis. In addition, we expect our fourth quarter total company results to be our highest of the year in terms of revenue and OIBDA.
CapEx for the full year 2010 should be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. We estimate cash taxes to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million for the full year. Also as a reminder, our fourth quarter financing activities will result in an early extinguishment of debt charge of about $45 million.
Looking further out to 2011, we expect to have another strong year. Here is what we know. We know this year's upfront was up high single-digits, which runs through Q3 of 2011, and scatter is tracking well above upfront. Given the strength of our schedule, we expect this trend to continue. We know the cost of the current prime time schedule is less than last year's, and with our revised NCAA agreement, sports costs will be down next year as well. We know we have new retrans agreements that provide meaningful upside in 2011. We know we have more favorable Outdoor contracts. We know we will get cost savings from our 2010 restructuring activities. We know interest expense is going to be lower, and we will generate significant free cash flow. And we know we will be returning a significant portion of that free cash flow to our shareholders via our stock buyback and dividend. 
So we will conclude by saying that our momentum is set to continue into next year and beyond. The overall ad market still has plenty of room to recover, plus we positioned the company to continue to be a big beneficiary in the years to come by taking a number of strategic steps to capitalize on the changing business model. We feel very good about where we are but even better about where we are headed. With that, Ruthie, we can open the line up for questions."

And then one last one for Les. NBC is making a big move all of a sudden, but about looking at alpha boomers  and the older demo, and you guys always get knocked for being the older network. What's going on here? Is this something you think is a significant shift in the broadcast industry in terms of advertising?"

Obviously, we'll use some of that cash to call the debt I said for May of '11.

So again, we're going to buy the stock right into our strength and generating more cash flow. As far as the affiliate and subscription, a little bit does have to do with timing. It's when agreements kick in and stuff, so there is a little bit of timing. But if you look at it on a year-to-date basis, those fluctuations tend to even out."

But the affiliates are aware that they're getting paid retrans and a lot of the reason they're getting paid that retrans money is because of what the network is giving them, and our affiliates certainly appreciate what CBS Primetime is doing for them. When you look at 10:00, we are winning five nights a week, which means their 11:00 local news is doing extremely well. And as I referred to, the NFL is doing extremely well for them.

And have you seen any permanent differences, say, with the reduction of auto dealerships or a reduced amount of spending at the manufacturing level that has impacted you? That's the first question.

Thank you very much for joining us. As you see from the results we're reporting today, we had another terrific quarter, and our momentum continues to build.

As you see from the results we're reporting today, we had another terrific quarter, and our momentum continues to build. Each quarter in 2010 has been better than the one before. Advertising revenues are growing. Profits are higher, and margins are expanding. A great deal of our success comes from how well our content has performed and how well we are monetizing that performance.
The things that we told you would happen over the last several quarters are, in fact, happening. We are benefiting greatly from a return of advertising to historical levels. We are diversifying and derisking our business model by growing our secondary revenue streams. Our major-market local assets are experiencing excellent growth, and once again, most importantly, our content is thriving across the company, also across the country, on a variety of platforms. 
At the same time, we're managing our businesses more efficiently, holding down costs and strengthening our financial position as the markets improve. We have taken a number of steps to greatly improve our balance sheet by paying down debt. All of this is coming through in our results, with double-digit growth in profits in EPS and even better growth in free cash flow. These healthy levels of free cash have enabled us to announce today a $1.5 billion share repurchase program beginning January 1. Returning value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks has been one of our highest priorities all along, and we are pleased to deliver on that objective.
All of these factors that I just mentioned have brought about a structural change that will cause our strong performance to continue into 2011 and beyond. In addition, the two new long-term deals we added with Comcast and the NCAA will only help us that much more. So between the performance of our content, the improving operating environment and our very strong balance sheet, you can forgive me for being even a little bit more bullish than usual today. It's a real good time to be a shareholder of CBS.
I'm going to give some additional comments, then I'll turn it over to our, CFO, Joe Ianniello, and then as always, we'll take your questions. I'll begin with our very strong third quarter financial results. EPS for the quarter of $0.35 was up 40% versus last year's third quarter. OIBDA of $667 million was up 17% as profitability continues to improve significantly, and OIBDA margins are expanding as well. We are now approaching pre-recession levels. This is a trend that should continue into next year as our new and better deals kick in. We grow our secondary revenue streams, and we make sure that the costs we cut a couple of years ago will never return.
Total company advertising revenues were up 10%, and affiliate and subscription fees were up 15%. So healthy underlying growth continues. These increases are even more encouraging, given that last year's third quarter was when the economy began to pick up. We also generated $260 million in free cash flow, a significant improvement over last year's quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $1.4 billion, up 165% over the same time period last year.
Again, it's because of this healthy free cash flow that we were able to announce the $1.5 billion share buyback I mentioned earlier. Let's take a look at each of our businesses and some third quarter highlights. Beginning with our Content Group and its largest segment, Entertainment, where we produced revenue of $1.6 billion and OIBDA of $278 million in the quarter. Underlying advertising growth in the Entertainment segment was very strong, led by a 7% increase at the CBS Television Network. 
As you know, we've had a phenomenal start to the new season, winning the first five weeks of the season in all key measures, viewers 25 to 54 and 18 to 49. This is the first time any network has done this since 1997, and it only happened twice since people meters were introduced in 1987. Our schedule is incredibly stable, and we expect it to continue to shine for the rest of the season. Our returning shows remain very strong, and the five new shows we launched are the top five new shows of the fall, led by the number one new show, Hawaii Five-0. All five of our new shows have been picked up for the entire season.
We not only outperformed the field in this year's upfront marketplace, but we're now reaping the greatest benefits of the increase in scatter pricing as well. Because of the strength of our prime time schedule, scatter is up more than 35% over the upfront, which bodes very well for the fourth quarter and the first quarter of '11 as well.
In addition, NFL ratings are up 12% year-over-year this season. We have extremely high demand for our AFC package, and our sales are phenomenally strong. We expect this to continue right through the AFC Championship Game in January. As you know, advertising is just one way we capitalize on our content. Very positive trends in non-advertising-dependent revenues, including global syndication, retransmission consent and license fees from emerging platforms continue to strengthen the evolving broadcast model. Including the three new CBS-produced dramas on our schedule this season, our studio now owns 27 shows that are currently in production, meaning that ratings success represents just the first length in our increasingly valuable monetary content chain. 
Let me point out just a few of the incremental ways we're getting paid for our content now. First, syndication. Domestically, we're selling our new hit shows earlier and at record prices. And international syndication is becoming a bigger piece of the pie as well, representing an important long-term growth opportunity for us. 
This season, we sold all three of our new dramas internationally for north of $2 million an episode each, meaning that all three were profitable before a single episode air. Within weeks of announcing Hawaii Five-0 was on our schedule, we sold it in more than 100 markets, and now it's in nearly all 200 of our overseas markets . And of course, on this show, domestic syndication is still to come. We're also expanding internationally by gaining equity in new overseas channels. As you know, last year, we partnered with Liberty to rebrand six local U.K. channels as CBS channels and expand our programming there. During the quarter, we entered into two new similar joint ventures. One, with Reliance in India for three channels in India, and another with Network Ten in Australia, the people who own the Ten Network, for a partnership to provide content to the new cable channel 11.
Next, in addition to syndication, retrans is now a very significant and continuing part of our content value chain as well. Our retransmission consent revenue was up more than 40% year-to-date versus the same time period last year and will easily meet our full year target of $100 million. This important revenue stream will keep growing for us, and the economics of our groundbreaking new 10-year deal with Comcast will benefit our bottom line for a long, long time.
We are pleased that without a fuss, the largest cable operator recognized the value of our content in a way that benefited both sides of the negotiations. Retrans, as well as broadcast affiliate compensation to us, will continue to grow every single year. 
And finally, it's becoming increasingly clear that every new online distribution platform needs premium content to successfully launch their service. We continue to talk to all of these companies, companies you all know very well, about ways we can get the proper value for our programming. We have and we'll continue to pick and choose the best deal for our shareholders as we grow this additional revenue stream. 
Meanwhile, our in-house websites led CBS Interactive to a very strong third quarter, with display advertising revenue up 17% year-over-year. Our ad sales, site traffic and audience engagement all continue to grow and to outpace the industry. Clearly, when you have the most successful shows on air, it crosses over to online as well, and not just CBS.com and TV.com, but also social communities like Facebook, where we have nearly 50 million fans for our prime time shows.
The cross-platform presence is appealing to our advertisers who are increasingly making both on-air and digital buys with us. Our Cable Network segment also had a terrific quarter. revenue was up 12%, and OIBDA was up 33% from the same period last year. Year-over-year, we've added more than 4 million subscriptions at Showtime Networks and nearly 5 million at CBS College Sports, and rates have increased as well. We are confident that all of our Cable Networks will continue to add more subscribers and value to our portfolio going forward.
And Cable is another business where the strength of our content is driving our performance. During the quarter, we debuted yet another critically acclaimed Showtime original series, The Big C. The show's launch drew our highest ratings for an original series premier in eight years, and it's staying strong. Our returning series, Weeds and Dexter, also premiered new seasons during the quarter. Both shows had their highest premiers ever. And Dexter was Showtime's best overall original series season premiere in 15 years. 
At Publishing, revenue was $218 million in the third quarter, and OIBDA was $31 million, up 10%, as our expense rationalization efforts keep paying off. Just as with our TV programming, where digital continues to be a growing part of the business, digital competition between Apple, Barnes & Noble, Google, Amazon and the rest has us well-positioned in the e-book space, giving our leading content. We had more New York Times bestsellers in this year's third quarter than we did last year. And our newest releases by authors Vince Flynn and Bob Woodward are outperforming their previous titles.
Turning to Local Broadcasting. We had another outstanding performance as the local ad market recovery continued into the third quarter. Revenue was up 15%, with TV station advertising revenue up 25%, and Radio ad revenue up 9%. At the same time, Local Broadcasting OIBDA increased 49% year-over-year, and our OIBDA margin was 29%.
Strong pacing is continuing into the fourth quarter. Radio is pacing up double-digits, and our TV station group is trending to be up more than 20% over last year. Political advertising will contribute significantly to our fourth quarter results. We saw a very strong political spending right up through the mid-term elections this week, and the demand for political time pushed non-political dollars past the election into the rest of the fourth quarter. The momentum in local TV advertising continues well beyond the fourth quarter. 
Momentum also continues at Outdoor as well. Third quarter revenue was up 10% in constant dollars as the advertising marketplace continued to improve. OIBDA more than doubled year-over-year in the quarter as a result of both the top line growth and this business' new streamlined cost structure. We continue to renegotiate and enter into new contracts at better terms, which will be reflected in our results going forward as well.
One final note on our Local Group. I mentioned to you last quarter that we were launching a single website in New York called cbsnewyork.com. This site combines the resources of WCBS channel 2, 1010 WINS, WCBS 880 and WFAN The Fan to become the premier local information destination in the market. We have since launched six more similar local sites in major markets where we own TV and radio stations, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Dallas and Boston. We are very encouraged by the early results. And going forward, we expect to be generating hundreds of millions of dollars from our local websites within the next few years.
Across the board during the quarter, we were able to once again deliver on our promises and produce results that speak to our ongoing growth and success. Beyond the strong finish we expect this year, there are a number of developments that will drive our continued momentum into '11 and '12. These include the best start any television network has had in 13 years with successful new shows that are already profitable and will generate revenue for years to come.
The increasing value of our content in a dual revenue stream universe including retrans, affiliate compensation and emerging online services, dramatically improve contracts like the new Comcast and NCAA deals, which truly kick in beginning next year, the broad-based recovery at the local ad market where there's still lots of room for more growth. Our lower cost structure, which allows more revenue to translate into profits. Interest expense alone will be down $90 million annually following all of our debt actions this year. And as you saw with our announcement today, a share repurchase program that returns additional value to shareholders as our businesses continue to throw off lots of cash. So yes, we had a terrific quarter. But as you see, the best is yet to come. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe.

Today, I'll provide some more detail on our results for the quarter, highlight our recent financing activities and new share buyback program and update you on what we're seeing in Q4 and the things we know about",1399,"Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide some more detail on our results for the quarter, highlight our recent financing activities and new share buyback program and update you on what we're seeing in Q4 and the things we know about 2011.
Starting with our total company results for the quarter. Total revenue of $3.3 billion compares to $3.35 billion for the same quarter last year when we benefited from the sale of five major television series that went into first cycle syndication. To give you a sense of the size of these titles, we're talking about over $300 million in revenue at about a 35% OIBDA margin, which is not included in this year's third quarter.
Meanwhile, as Les said, total advertising revenue was up 10% and affiliate and subscription revenues were up 15%, illustrating the ongoing strength in our underlying businesses. The 10% advertising growth accelerated from Q2's 9% despite tougher comps this quarter.
Reported OIBDA was up 33% for the quarter to $750 million. Reported operating income increased 46%, and reported diluted EPS increased 53% to $0.46. We are adjusting our reported results for four items in 2010: a favorable legal recovery of $90 million; a gain on sale of a TV station of approximately $8 million; an $18 million tax benefit from the settlements of income tax audits; and restructuring charges of $7 million. In 2009, we are adjusting for three items: another favorable legal recovery of $28 million; $42 million of tax benefits from additional audit settlements; and impairment charges of $32 million.
Adjusting for these items in the quarter, total company OIBDA came in at $667 million, a 17% increase. Operating income was up 25%, and diluted EPS of $0.35 was up 40%. Margin expansion continues to be a key area of focus for us. So let's look at that trend.
Total company's OIBDA margin in Q1 2010 was 10% and in Q2, it expanded to 17%. And now in Q3, it has reached 20%, which is near 2007 levels. Our Q3 OIBDA margin is a 300 basis point improvement to last year's third quarter, even without the benefit of the five syndication titles, and these are not only percentage increases we're talking about. They are higher dollars as well. 
Let's quickly look at our year-to-date results. Total company revenue up 7%, OIBDA up 31%, operating income of 50%, and net earnings up 133%. This flow-through demonstrates the strength of our operating leverage.
Looking at our segments for the quarter. Entertainment revenue of $1.6 billion was down 12% due to the five shows that went into syndication last year. Our 7% increase in network advertising revenue accelerated from 5% in Q2. OIBDA for the Entertainment segment finished at $278 million, down $47 million as the syndication benefit from last year more than offset the growth from ad revenues from the Network and Interactive and higher retrans revenues.
At Cable Networks, revenue was up 12%, and OIBDA was up 33%. Telcos and satellite operators drove the subscriber growth. On a year-to-date basis, our Cable OIBDA margin is at 36%, up 500 basis points from the same period a year ago. We expect the fourth quarter margin to be 40-plus percent for Cable.
Publishing revenue of $218 million for the quarter was down 6%. However, Publishing OIBDA for the quarter was up 10% to $31 million as we continue our cost-containment actions. E-books now comprise approximately 7% of total revenue and will continue to be a growing part of the revenue base.
At Local Broadcasting, the strong revenue and profit increases already discussed have improved our OIBDA margin seven percentage points from last year to 29%, and we expect Local Broadcasting's fourth quarter margin to be up in the mid-30s. 
And then Outdoor, revenue for the quarter was 8% to $460 million on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, Outdoor revenue increased 10%. The Americas led the way with a 15% increase, driven by higher occupancy. Outdoor OIBDA of $77 million increased 136% from last year's third quarter as we are benefiting from higher revenue, cost-saving initiatives and more favorable contracts. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Free cash flow came in at $260 million for the quarter compared to a $24 million use of cash last year. And it bears repeating that on a year-to-date basis, free cash flow is $1.4 billion, up 165% from prior year. We've used this cash primarily to strengthen our balance sheet. Our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $1.1 billion. And so far this quarter, we've issued $600 million of new debt at very attractive rates. The 4.3% coupon for our 10-year note is the lowest rate in our history. In fact, it's the lowest rate ever for all of media.
This week, we've also called the $544 million that was due in May 2011, so total gross debt on the balance sheet as of September 30 will decrease by $500-plus million before year-end. The net result from all our financing activities this year leaves only $490 million of debt coming due over the next three years and saves us approximately $90 million per year in interest costs.
So our balance sheet has never been stronger, which brings me to our next topic of returning capital to shareholders. The $1.5 billion share buyback program we announced today is expected to be executed over approximately 18 months starting in January, which will come to about $500 million every six months. At our current share price, this program constitutes about 30% of our shares outstanding. The combination of this buyback, along with our dividend, provides our shareholders a very attractive total return yield. It also represents a significant payout ratio and gives you a clear indication of what we're doing with our cash flow.
Looking ahead, here is what we're seeing in Q4 for our advertising businesses. As stated earlier, network scatter market remains robust. It is up over 35% above the upfront and broad-based among categories. Online display advertising is pacing up mid-teens. TV station revenue is pacing to be up over 20% against tougher comps. Radio stations are pacing to be up double-digits, which is an acceleration from the third quarter.
We're having a record political year at our Local Broadcasting segment, and we expect to exceed our full year $200 million target. Our Outdoor group is currently pacing up high single-digits on a constant-dollar basis. In addition, we expect our fourth quarter total company results to be our highest of the year in terms of revenue and OIBDA.
CapEx for the full year 2010 should be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. We estimate cash taxes to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million for the full year. Also as a reminder, our fourth quarter financing activities will result in an early extinguishment of debt charge of about $45 million.
Looking further out to 2011, we expect to have another strong year. Here is what we know. We know this year's upfront was up high single-digits, which runs through Q3 of 2011, and scatter is tracking well above upfront. Given the strength of our schedule, we expect this trend to continue. We know the cost of the current prime time schedule is less than last year's, and with our revised NCAA agreement, sports costs will be down next year as well. We know we have new retrans agreements that provide meaningful upside in 2011. We know we have more favorable Outdoor contracts. We know we will get cost savings from our 2010 restructuring activities. We know interest expense is going to be lower, and we will generate significant free cash flow. And we know we will be returning a significant portion of that free cash flow to our shareholders via our stock buyback and dividend. 
So we will conclude by saying that our momentum is set to continue into next year and beyond. The overall ad market still has plenty of room to recover, plus we positioned the company to continue to be a big beneficiary in the years to come by taking a number of strategic steps to capitalize on the changing business model. We feel very good about where we are but even better about where we are headed. With that, Ruthie, we can open the line up for questions.

We have renewed our entire schedule. It's a great luxury to have that. We actually have three mid-season shows, and our problem is where do we put them? So I've never seen anything like this.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to discuss results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010.We continue to grow our business during the quarter, managing approximately 15,500 patient cases, and increasing",824,"Thank you, Marcy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to discuss results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010.
We continue to grow our business during the quarter, managing approximately 15,500 patient cases, and increasing case volumes by approximately 5% over the third quarter in 2009. Our top line performance overall was slightly better than the revised outlook provided in September, just ahead of the quarter's end. Despite the challenges presented by the changing market dynamics and the current environment, revenue for the quarter, excluding the benefit from changes in accounting estimates, improved by 3% year-over-year.
For the first nine months of 2010, total revenue was up by nearly 10% for the first nine months of 2009, as we managed more than 46,000 patient cases year-to-date, an increase of 10% from the same period one year ago.
Our average sales price per case, or ASP, was approximately $3,200 for the third quarter or approximately $3,100 excluding accounting estimates. This was in-line with prior quarters and our expectations going forward even as we expect to sign another contract with a major commercial payer before the end of the year. With the addition of this potential contract, it is our expectation that our average revenue per patient case will continue to remain around $3,000 for 2010, much as it did after the commencement of our most recent major payer contract earlier this year.
We ended the third quarter with more than 1,350 actively ordering customers, growing since the midyear as we continue to place greater emphasis on recruitment of new customers and focus on defending our position in the challenging competitive and economic environment.
We are strategically deploying resources to further gain penetration in key markets, while accepting new market segments to evolve with market trends. To this end, we expect to end the year with approximately 95 sales representatives, who will lead our frontline sales efforts going into 2011.
Beyond establishing a solid sales presence, we are seeking new ways to provide quality services to a broad population of hematologist and oncologist. We continue to develop new and complementary services that differentiate our offering from those of our competitors and to invest in new innovations, working to build demand for our unique and specialized diagnostic services. 
This fall, we are initiating a pilot launch of our first proprietary offering with the introduction of AQUA Technology for the analysis of fluorescent immunohistochemistry to enable quantitative assessment of ER/PR/HER 2 for patients with breast cancer. This new assay expands our NexCourse offering into a new tumor type, with testing that minimizes ER/PR/HER 2 false negative results by utilizing an objective quantified score for protein expression. It is more accurate and reproducible than traditional ISC [ph] testing, providing greater confidence when making the most appropriate therapy decisions. With the introduction of this new commercial technology platform, we are taking another step toward leveraging our investments to provide more comprehensive services to our physician customers and their patients.
It is our belief that our approach to providing comprehensive, correlated and accurate diagnosis will lead to better medicine than the traditional method of diagnosing hematomalignancy. As a step toward validating our thesis, we are making progress in the collection of clinical outcome data from a large regional clinical oncology practice who sees many hematomalignancy cases each year. 
We also have a second study with additional data from a national third party, who is providing us access to their database and statistical analysis is currently underway to identify measurable benefits provided to patients through our integrated case management approach. We will continue to provide update as this important initiative develops over the coming quarters. 
The Cartesian hematopathologists group is now home to approximately 48 physicians, whose services will take us through year end and well into 2011. This sizable organization is characterized by excellence in servicing the diagnostic needs of our physician customers. Our successful recruiting efforts have eliminated capacity constraints, even providing the capability to offer greater interaction with our customers through field visits, publications and presentations, along with additional opportunities for improvements in processes and service levels. 
Lastly, this quarter marks the completion of a year-long expansion process that should provide the infrastructure needed to double the size of our business in the coming years. Our expectation for the year has been for total capital expenditures of approximately $30 million in 2010, which includes approximately $8 million in capital to be used primarily to support our operations and the purchase of new equipment as required to reach our goals.
With our 2010 expansion plan completed, we'll begin to leverage this investment in 2011 and in the years going forward. We are also continuing to evaluate the use of our cash resources and are considering our options and alternatives.
Next, our CFO, Doug Schuling, will provide more detail around the financial results for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2010. Doug?"
27763231,111869061,85683,"CBS Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Paramount Global","Executives","Thanks, Tina. Revenue for the third quarter was $49.5 million, bringing total revenue for the first nine months of 2010 to $147.9 million, including $3.8 million in benefits from changes and prior period accounting estimates, $1.6 million of which was rec",957,"Thanks, Tina. Revenue for the third quarter was $49.5 million, bringing total revenue for the first nine months of 2010 to $147.9 million, including $3.8 million in benefits from changes and prior period accounting estimates, $1.6 million of which was recorded in the third quarter.
These positive changes in estimates are primarily the result of strong cash collections relating to differences between our original revenue estimates for services provided in prior periods and the actual amounts collected.
Due in part to the larger than expected collections recognized at the end of the third quarter, we are increasing our expectation for revenue adjustments to approximately $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Gross profit for the third quarter was $28.4 million or 57% of revenues, as compared to $32.4 million or 64% of revenues, during the same period in 2009.  Gross profit for the first nine months of 2010 was $87.5 million, up from $84.7 million for the same period in 2009. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin was 59% for the first nine months of 2010 as compared to 63% of revenues for the first nine months of 2009.
The reduction in gross margins is primarily due to the increased costs related to the new laboratory facility brought into service at the start of the third quarter, the associated laboratory hiring and the reduction in changes in revenue accounting estimates for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 as compared to the same periods in the prior year. We expect gross margins for the full year to be in the mid- to high 50th percentile range as 2010 comes to a close.
Sales and marketing expense increased as a percentage of revenues, moving up to approximately 21% of revenues for the third quarter of 2010 from approximately 16% of revenues for the third quarter of 2009. This increase is primarily due to an increase in the overall number in sales and marketing headcount, relating to our focus on aligning our sales organization to address the changing market dynamics, while enhancing our existing community-based hem/onc customer relationships.
General and administrative costs were at 17% of revenues for the third quarter of 2010, an increase from 14% of revenues for the third quarter of 2009. This increase was primarily due to employee-related costs in support of our billing and collection efforts, IT initiatives and overall company growth.  Though we anticipate an increase in absolute dollars for G&A expense, we expect these costs to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time.
Also in the third quarter, we recorded bad debt of approximately 2% of revenue, a level consistent with historical trends. In comparison, our third quarter 2009 bad debt provision was unusually low due to higher-than-expected cash collections.
Operating margins for the third quarter were 18% of revenues and 19% for the first nine months of 2010, as compared to operating margins of 32% and 30% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009, respectively. These decreases are reflective of the necessary investments we have made in our facilities and infrastructure over the course of the year, as well as reduced level of changes in revenue accounting estimates. We expect to end the year with operating margins in the high teens for 2010 and leverage these investments over the long term.
Third quarter net income was $4.4 million, taxed at a rate of 52%. This compares to net income of $9.5 million in the third quarter of 2009, taxed at a rate of 43%. For the first nine months of 2010, net income was $15.3 million on a tax rate of 48%, as compared to net income of $23.3 million for the same period in 2009 when we were taxed at rate of 44%.
The increase in our tax rate for the quarter is primarily attributable to the impact of non-deductible stock-based compensation expense and recently implemented changes in state regulations related to corporate taxation. We expect to end 2010 with a tax rate of approximately 48% for the full year, a rate inflated by approximately 2.5% one-time increase relating to a change in California tax regulation. Based on the rejection of California Proposition 24 by voters earlier this week, we expect to see a reduction in our tax rate to the low 40% range for 2011.
Diluted EPS for the third quarter of 2010 was $0.24 based on the 18.1 million weighted average common shares outstanding. This compares to EPS of $0.53 for the third quarter of 2009 on 18 million shares. Diluted EPS for the first nine months of 2010 was $0.84 based on 18.2 million weighted average shares, down from EPS of $1.30 on 17.9 million shares in the same period last year.
The benefit of favorable changes in estimates typically results in margin and income improvements, adding approximately $0.04 and $0.14 to EPS for the third quarter 2010 and 2009, respectively. These benefits added approximately $0.11 and $0.20 to EPS for the first nine months of 2010 and 2009, respectively.
The third quarter of 2010 ended with an average DSO of 77 days, an increase partially due to the decrease in positive changes in prior period revenue accounting estimates, resulting in more revenues being recognized at the time of billing rather than point-of-cash collection.
At the end of the first nine months of 2010, the company's total cash, cash equivalents and investment securities were $143.3 million, including $23.1 million of cash generated from operations in the first three quarters of 2010.
Lastly, purchases of capital equipment for the first nine months of 2010 totaled $26.3 million, an increase primarily attributable to our recently completed laboratory facility and customer service center.

As we look towards this year's close, we expect to end with total revenue of between $192 million to $195 million, assuming no further changes to the physician fee schedule for that last month of 2010. Net income is expected to be between $17 million and $18 million with diluted EPS of between $0.95 and $1 on 18.2 million shares, assuming a tax rate of approximately 48% for the year.
Based on the CMS final rule published earlier this week and assuming that physician fee schedule fixed remains in place as is, we would preliminarily expect an incremental increase of up to 5% of total revenues for 2011. We will provide more detailed guidance on expectations for the coming year early in 2011 as we gain further visibility into the developing economic environment and the Medicare reimbursement update expected to come later this year.
We're now ready to take questions. Operator, please open the line."

Thank you very much for joining us. As you see from the results we're reporting today, we had another terrific quarter, and our momentum continues to build.

As you see from the results we're reporting today, we had another terrific quarter, and our momentum continues to build. Each quarter in 2010 has been better than the one before. Advertising revenues are growing. Profits are higher, and margins are expanding. A great deal of our success comes from how well our content has performed and how well we are monetizing that performance.
The things that we told you would happen over the last several quarters are, in fact, happening. We are benefiting greatly from a return of advertising to historical levels. We are diversifying and derisking our business model by growing our secondary revenue streams. Our major-market local assets are experiencing excellent growth, and once again, most importantly, our content is thriving across the company, also across the country, on a variety of platforms. 
At the same time, we're managing our businesses more efficiently, holding down costs and strengthening our financial position as the markets improve. We have taken a number of steps to greatly improve our balance sheet by paying down debt. All of this is coming through in our results, with double-digit growth in profits in EPS and even better growth in free cash flow. These healthy levels of free cash have enabled us to announce today a $1.5 billion share repurchase program beginning January 1. Returning value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks has been one of our highest priorities all along, and we are pleased to deliver on that objective.
All of these factors that I just mentioned have brought about a structural change that will cause our strong performance to continue in 2011 and beyond. In addition, the two new long-term deals we added with Comcast and the NCAA will only help us that much more. So between the performance of our content, the improving operating environment and our very strong balance sheet, you can forgive me for being even a little bit more bullish than usual today. It's a real good time to be a shareholder of CBS.
I'm going to give some additional comments, then I'll turn it over to our, CFO, Joe Ianniello, and then as always, we'll take your questions. I'll begin with our very strong third quarter financial results. EPS for the quarter of $0.35 was up 40% versus last year's third quarter. OIBDA of $667 million was up 17% as profitability continues to improve significantly, and OIBDA margins are expanding as well. We are now approaching pre-recession levels. This is a trend that should continue into next year as our new and better deals kick in. We grow our secondary revenue streams, and we make sure that the costs we cut a couple of years ago will never return.
Total company advertising revenues were up 10%, and affiliate and subscription fees were up 15%. So healthy underlying growth continues. These increases are even more encouraging, given that last year's third quarter was when the economy began to pick up. We also generated $260 million in free cash flow, a significant improvement over last year's quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $1.4 billion, up 165% over the same time period last year.
Again, it's because of this healthy free cash flow that we were able to announce the $1.5 billion share buyback I mentioned earlier. Let's take a look at each of our businesses and some third quarter highlights. Beginning with our Content Group and its largest segment, Entertainment, where we produced revenue of $1.6 billion and OIBDA of $278 million in the quarter. Underlying advertising growth in the Entertainment segment was very strong, led by a 7% increase at the CBS Television Network. 
As you know, we've had a phenomenal start to the new season, winning the first five weeks of the season in all key measures, viewers 25 to 54 and 18 to 49. This is the first time any network has done this since 1997, and it only happened twice since people meters were introduced in 1987. Our schedule is incredibly stable, and we expect it to continue to shine for the rest of the season. Our returning shows remain very strong, and the five new shows we launched are the top five new shows of the fall, led by the number one new show, Hawaii Five-0. All five of our new shows have been picked up for the entire season.
We not only outperformed the field in this year's upfront marketplace, but we're now reaping the greatest benefits of the increase in scatter pricing as well. Because of the strength of our prime time schedule, scatter is up more than 35% over the upfront, which bodes very well for the fourth quarter and the first quarter of '11 as well.
In addition, NFL ratings are up 12% year-over-year this season. We have extremely high demand for our AFC package, and our sales are phenomenally strong. We expect this to continue right through the AFC Championship Game in January. As you know, advertising is just one way we capitalize on our content. Very positive trends in non-advertising-dependent revenues, including global syndication, retransmission consent and license fees from emerging platforms continue to strengthen the evolving broadcast model. Including the three new CBS-produced dramas on our schedule this season, our studio now owns 27 shows that are currently in production, meaning that ratings success represents just the first link in our increasingly valuable monetary content chain. 
Let me point out just a few of the incremental ways we're getting paid for our content now. First, syndication. Domestically, we're selling our new hit shows earlier and at record prices. And international syndication is becoming a bigger piece of the pie as well, representing an important long-term growth opportunity for us. 
This season, we sold all three of our new dramas internationally for north of $2 million an episode each, meaning that all three were profitable before a single episode air. Within weeks of announcing Hawaii Five-0 was on our schedule, we sold it in more than 100 markets, and now it's in nearly all 200 of our overseas markets . And of course, on this show, domestic syndication is still to come. We're also expanding internationally by gaining equity in new overseas channels. As you know, last year, we partnered with Liberty to rebrand six local U.K. channels as CBS channels and expand our programming there. During the quarter, we entered into two new similar joint ventures. One, with Reliance in India for three channels in India, and another with Network Ten in Australia, the people who own the Ten Network, for a partnership to provide content to the new cable channel 11.
Next, in addition to syndication, retrans is now a very significant and continuing part of our content value chain as well. Our retransmission consent revenue was up more than 40% year-to-date versus the same time period last year and will easily meet our full year target of $100 million. This important revenue stream will keep growing for us, and the economics of our groundbreaking new 10-year deal with Comcast will benefit our bottom line for a long, long time.
We are pleased that without a fuss, the largest cable operator recognized the value of our content in a way that benefited both sides of the negotiations. Retrans, as well as broadcast affiliate compensation to us, will continue to grow every single year. 
And finally, it's becoming increasingly clear that every new online distribution platform needs premium content to successfully launch their service. We continue to talk to all of these companies, companies you all know very well, about ways we can get the proper value for our programming. We have and will continue to pick and choose the best deal for our shareholders as we grow this additional revenue stream. 
Meanwhile, our in-house websites led CBS Interactive to a very strong third quarter, with display advertising revenue up 17% year-over-year. Our ad sales, site traffic and audience engagement all continue to grow and to outpace the industry. Clearly, when you have the most successful shows on air, it crosses over to online as well, and not just CBS.com and TV.com, but also social communities like Facebook, where we have nearly 50 million fans for our prime time shows.
The cross-platform presence is appealing to our advertisers who are increasingly making both on-air and digital buys with us. Our Cable Network segment also had a terrific quarter. Revenue was up 12%, and OIBDA was up 33% from the same period last year. Year-over-year, we've added more than 4 million subscriptions at Showtime Networks and nearly 5 million at CBS College Sports, and rates have increased as well. We are confident that all of our Cable Networks will continue to add more subscribers and value to our portfolio going forward.
And Cable is another business where the strength of our content is driving our performance. During the quarter, we debuted yet another critically acclaimed Showtime original series, The Big C. The show's launch drew our highest ratings for an original series premier in eight years, and it's staying strong. Our returning series, Weeds and Dexter, also premiered new seasons during the quarter. Both shows had their highest premiers ever. And Dexter was Showtime's best overall original series season premiere in 15 years. 
At Publishing, revenue was $218 million in the third quarter, and OIBDA was $31 million, up 10%, as our expense rationalization efforts keep paying off. Just as with our TV programming, where digital continues to be a growing part of the business, digital competition between Apple, Barnes & Noble, Google, Amazon and the rest has us well-positioned in the e-book space, giving our leading content. We had more New York Times bestsellers in this year's third quarter than we did last year. And our newest releases by authors Vince Flynn and Bob Woodward are outperforming their previous titles.
Turning to Local Broadcasting. We had another outstanding performance as the local ad market recovery continued into the third quarter. Revenue was up 15%, with TV station advertising revenue up 25%, and Radio ad revenue up 9%. At the same time, Local Broadcasting OIBDA increased 49% year-over-year, and our OIBDA margin was 29%.
Strong pacing is continuing into the fourth quarter. Radio is pacing up double-digits, and our TV station group is trending to be up more than 20% over last year. Political advertising will contribute significantly to our fourth quarter results. We saw a very strong political spending right up through the mid-term elections this week, and the demand for political time pushed non-political dollars past the election into the rest of the fourth quarter. The momentum in local TV advertising continues well beyond the fourth quarter. 
Momentum also continues at Outdoor as well. Third quarter revenue was up 10% in constant dollars as the advertising marketplace continued to improve. OIBDA more than doubled year-over-year in the quarter as a result of both the top line growth and this business' new streamlined cost structure. We continue to renegotiate and enter into new contracts at better terms, which will be reflected in our results going forward as well.
One final note on our Local Group. I mentioned to you last quarter that we were launching a single website in New York called cbsnewyork.com. This site combines the resources of WCBS channel 2, 1010 WINS, WCBS 880 and WFAN The Fan to become the premier local information destination in the market. We have since launched six more similar local sites in major markets where we own TV and radio stations, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Dallas and Boston. We are very encouraged by the early results. And going forward, we expect to be generating hundreds of millions of dollars from our local websites within the next few years.
Across the board during the quarter, we were able to once again deliver on our promises and produce results that speak to our ongoing growth and success. Beyond the strong finish we expect this year, there are a number of developments that will drive our continued momentum into '11 and '12. These include the best start any television network has had in 13 years with successful new shows that are already profitable and will generate revenue for years to come.
The increasing value of our content in a dual revenue stream universe including retrans, affiliate compensation and emerging online services, dramatically improve contracts like the new Comcast and NCAA deals, which truly kick in beginning next year, the broad-based recovery at the local ad market where there's still lots of room for more growth. Our lower cost structure, which allows more revenue to translate into profits. Interest expense alone will be down $90 million annually following all of our debt actions this year. And as you saw with our announcement today, a share repurchase program that returns additional value to shareholders as our businesses continue to throw off lots of cash. So yes, we had a terrific quarter. But as you see, the best is yet to come. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

Today, I'll provide some more detail on our results for the quarter, highlight our recent financing activities and new share buyback program and update you on what we're seeing in Q4 and the things we know about",1399,"Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide some more detail on our results for the quarter, highlight our recent financing activities and new share buyback program and update you on what we're seeing in Q4 and the things we know about 2011.
Starting with our total company results for the quarter. Total revenue of $3.3 billion compares to $3.35 billion for the same quarter last year when we benefited from the sale of five major television series that went into first cycle syndication. To give you a sense of the size of these titles, we're talking about over $300 million in revenue at about a 35% OIBDA margin, which is not included in this year's third quarter.
Meanwhile, as Les said, total advertising revenue was up 10% and affiliate and subscription revenues were up 15%, illustrating the ongoing strength in our underlying businesses. The 10% advertising growth accelerated from Q2's 9% despite tougher comps this quarter.
Reported OIBDA was up 33% for the quarter to $750 million. Reported operating income increased 46%, and reported diluted EPS increased 53% to $0.46. We are adjusting our reported results for four items in 2010: a favorable legal recovery of $90 million; a gain on sale of a TV station of approximately $8 million; an $18 million tax benefit from the settlements of income tax audits; and restructuring charges of $7 million. In 2009, we are adjusting for three items: another favorable legal recovery of $28 million; $42 million of tax benefits from additional audit settlements; and impairment charges of $32 million.
Adjusting for these items in the quarter, total company OIBDA came in at $667 million, a 17% increase. Operating income was up 25%, and diluted EPS of $0.35 was up 40%. Margin expansion continues to be a key area of focus for us. So let's look at that trend.
Total company's OIBDA margin in Q1 2010 was 10% and in Q2, it expanded to 17%. And now in Q3, it has reached 20%, which is near 2007 levels. Our Q3 OIBDA margin is a 300 basis point improvement to last year's third quarter, even without the benefit of the five syndication titles, and these are not only percentage increases we're talking about. They are higher dollars as well. 
Let's quickly look at our year-to-date results. Total company revenue up 7%, OIBDA up 31%, operating income up 50%, and net earnings up 133%. This flow-through demonstrates the strength of our operating leverage.
Looking at our segments for the quarter. Entertainment revenue of $1.6 billion was down 12% due to the five shows that went into syndication last year. Our 7% increase in network advertising revenue accelerated from 5% in Q2. OIBDA for the Entertainment segment finished at $278 million, down $47 million as the syndication benefit from last year more than offset the growth from ad revenues from the Network and Interactive and higher retrans revenues.
At Cable Networks, revenue was up 12%, and OIBDA was up 33%. Telcos and satellite operators drove the subscriber growth. On a year-to-date basis, our Cable OIBDA margin is at 36%, up 500 basis points from the same period a year ago. We expect the fourth quarter margin to be 40-plus percent for Cable.
Publishing revenue of $218 million for the quarter was down 6%. However, Publishing OIBDA for the quarter was up 10% to $31 million as we continue our cost-containment actions. E-books now comprise approximately 7% of total revenue and will continue to be a growing part of the revenue base.
At Local Broadcasting, the strong revenue and profit increases already discussed have improved our OIBDA margin seven percentage points from last year to 29%, and we expect Local Broadcasting's fourth quarter margin to be up in the mid-30s. 
And then Outdoor, revenue for the quarter was 8% to $460 million on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, Outdoor revenue increased 10%. The Americas led the way with a 15% increase, driven by higher occupancy. Outdoor OIBDA of $77 million increased 136% from last year's third quarter as we are benefiting from higher revenue, cost-saving initiatives and more favorable contracts. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Free cash flow came in at $216 million for the quarter compared to a $24 million use of cash last year. And it bears repeating that on a year-to-date basis, free cash flow is $1.4 billion, up 165% from prior year. We've used this cash primarily to strengthen our balance sheet. Our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $1.1 billion. And so far this quarter, we've issued $600 million of new debt at very attractive rates. The 4.3% coupon for our 10-year note is the lowest rate in our history. In fact, it's the lowest rate ever for all of media.
This week, we've also called the $544 million that was due in May 2011, so total gross debt on the balance sheet as of September 30 will decrease by $500-plus million before year-end. The net result from all our financing activities this year leaves only $490 million of debt coming due over the next three years and saves us approximately $90 million per year in interest costs.
So our balance sheet has never been stronger, which brings me to our next topic of returning capital to shareholders. The $1.5 billion share buyback program we announced today is expected to be executed over approximately 18 months starting in January, which will come to about $500 million every six months. At our current share price, this program constitutes about 13% of our shares outstanding. The combination of this buyback, along with our dividend, provides our shareholders a very attractive total return yield. It also represents a significant payout ratio and gives you a clear indication of what we're doing with our cash flow.
Looking ahead, here is what we're seeing in Q4 for our advertising businesses. As stated earlier, network scatter market remains robust. It is up over 35% above the upfront and broad-based among categories. Online display advertising is pacing up mid-teens. TV station revenue is pacing to be up over 20% against tougher comps. Radio stations are pacing to be up double-digits, which is an acceleration from the third quarter.
We're having a record political year at our Local Broadcasting segment, and we expect to exceed our full year $200 million target. Our Outdoor group is currently pacing up high single-digits on a constant-dollar basis. In addition, we expect our fourth quarter total company results to be our highest of the year in terms of revenue and OIBDA.
CapEx for the full year 2010 should be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. We estimate cash taxes to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million for the full year. Also as a reminder, our fourth quarter financing activities will result in an early extinguishment of debt charge of about $45 million.
Looking further out to 2011, we expect to have another strong year. Here is what we know. We know this year's upfront was up high single-digits, which runs through Q3 of 2011, and scatter is tracking well above upfront. Given the strength of our schedule, we expect this trend to continue. We know the cost of the current prime time schedule is less than last year's, and with our revised NCAA agreement, sports costs will be down next year as well. We know we have new retrans agreements that provide meaningful upside in 2011. We know we have more favorable Outdoor contracts. We know we will get cost savings from our 2010 restructuring activities. We know interest expense is going to be lower, and we will generate significant free cash flow. And we know we will be returning a significant portion of that free cash flow to our shareholders via our stock buyback and dividend. 
So we will conclude by saying that our momentum is set to continue into next year and beyond. The overall ad market still has plenty of room to recover, plus we positioned the company to continue to be a big beneficiary in the years to come by taking a number of strategic steps to capitalize on the changing business model. We feel very good about where we are but even better about where we are headed. With that, Ruthie, we can open the line up for questions."

And then one last one for Les. NBC is making a big move all of a sudden, but about looking at alpha boomers and the older demo, and you guys always get knocked for being the older network. What's going on here? Is this something you think is a significant shift in the broadcast industry in terms of advertising?"

It's not like, ""Okay, if I take off this show for prime time, I'll have another show ready."" The NFL is the NFL, and it's very valuable. But we are hoping that nothing bad happens here."

Thank you very much for joining us. As you see from the results we're reporting today, we had another terrific quarter, and our momentum continues to build. Each quarter in 2010 has been better than the on",2196,"Thank you, Sumner, and good afternoon, everybody. Thank you very much for joining us. As you see from the results we're reporting today, we had another terrific quarter, and our momentum continues to build. Each quarter in 2010 has been better than the one before. Advertising revenues are growing. Profits are higher, and margins are expanding. A great deal of our success comes from how well our content has performed and how well we are monetizing that performance.
The things that we told you would happen over the last several quarters are, in fact, happening. We are benefiting greatly from a return of advertising to historical levels. We are diversifying and derisking our business model by growing our secondary revenue streams. Our major-market local assets are experiencing excellent growth, and once again, most importantly, our content is thriving across the company, also across the country, on a variety of platforms. 
At the same time, we're managing our businesses more efficiently, holding down costs and strengthening our financial position as the markets improve. We have taken a number of steps to greatly improve our balance sheet by paying down debt. All of this is coming through in our results, with double-digit growth in profits in EPS and even better growth in free cash flow. These healthy levels of free cash have enabled us to announce today a $1.5 billion share repurchase program beginning January 1. Returning value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks has been one of our highest priorities all along, and we are pleased to deliver on that objective.
All of these factors that I just mentioned have brought about a structural change that will cause our strong performance to continue in 2011 and beyond. In addition, the two new long-term deals we added with Comcast and the NCAA will only help us that much more. So between the performance of our content, the improving operating environment and our very strong balance sheet, you can forgive me for being even a little bit more bullish than usual today. It's a real good time to be a shareholder of CBS.
I'm going to give some additional comments, then I'll turn it over to our, CFO, Joe Ianniello, and then as always, we'll take your questions. I'll begin with our very strong third quarter financial results. EPS for the quarter of $0.35 was up 40% versus last year's third quarter. OIBDA of $667 million was up 17% as profitability continues to improve significantly, and OIBDA margins are expanding as well. We are now approaching pre-recession levels. This is a trend that should continue into next year as our new and better deals kick in. We grow our secondary revenue streams, and we make sure that the costs we cut a couple of years ago will never return.
Total company advertising revenues were up 10%, and affiliate and subscription fees were up 15%. So healthy underlying growth continues. These increases are even more encouraging, given that last year's third quarter was when the economy began to pick up. We also generated $260 million in free cash flow, a significant improvement over last year's quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $1.4 billion, up 165% over the same time period last year.
Again, it's because of this healthy free cash flow that we were able to announce the $1.5 billion share buyback I mentioned earlier. Let's take a look at each of our businesses and some third quarter highlights. Beginning with our Content Group and its largest segment, Entertainment, where we produced revenue of $1.6 billion and OIBDA of $278 million in the quarter. Underlying advertising growth in the Entertainment segment was very strong, led by a 7% increase at the CBS Television Network. 
As you know, we've had a phenomenal start to the new season, winning the first five weeks of the season in all key measures, viewers 25 to 54 and 18 to 49. This is the first time any network has done this since 1997, and it only happened twice since people meters were introduced in 1987. Our schedule is incredibly stable, and we expect it to continue to shine for the rest of the season. Our returning shows remain very strong, and the five new shows we launched are the top five new shows of the fall, led by the number one new show, Hawaii Five-0. All five of our new shows have been picked up for the entire season.
We not only outperformed the field in this year's upfront marketplace, but we're now reaping the greatest benefits of the increase in scatter pricing as well. Because of the strength of our prime time schedule, scatter is up more than 35% over the upfront, which bodes very well for the fourth quarter and the first quarter of '11 as well.
In addition, NFL ratings are up 12% year-over-year this season. We have extremely high demand for our AFC package, and our sales are phenomenally strong. We expect this to continue right through the AFC Championship Game in January. As you know, advertising is just one way we capitalize on our content. Very positive trends in non-advertising-dependent revenues, including global syndication, retransmission consent and license fees from emerging platforms continue to strengthen the evolving broadcast model. Including the three new CBS-produced dramas on our schedule this season, our studio now owns 27 shows that are currently in production, meaning that ratings success represents just the first link in our increasingly valuable monetary content chain. 
Let me point out just a few of the incremental ways we're getting paid for our content now. First, syndication. Domestically, we're selling our new hit shows earlier and at record prices. And international syndication is becoming a bigger piece of the pie as well, representing an important long-term growth opportunity for us. 
This season, we sold all three of our new dramas internationally for north of $2 million an episode each, meaning that all three were profitable before a single episode air. Within weeks of announcing Hawaii Five-0 was on our schedule, we sold it in more than 100 markets, and now it's in nearly all 200 of our overseas markets . And of course, on this show, domestic syndication is still to come. We're also expanding internationally by gaining equity in new overseas channels. As you know, last year, we partnered with Liberty to rebrand six local U.K. channels as CBS channels and expand our programming there. During the quarter, we entered into two new similar joint ventures. One, with Reliance in India for three channels in India, and another with Network Ten in Australia, the people who own the Ten Network, for a partnership to provide content to the new cable channel 11.
Next, in addition to syndication, retrans is now a very significant and continuing part of our content value chain as well. Our retransmission consent revenue was up more than 40% year-to-date versus the same time period last year and will easily meet our full year target of $100 million. This important revenue stream will keep growing for us, and the economics of our groundbreaking new 10-year deal with Comcast will benefit our bottom line for a long, long time.
We are pleased that without a fuss, the largest cable operator recognized the value of our content in a way that benefited both sides of the negotiations. Retrans, as well as broadcast affiliate compensation to us, will continue to grow every single year. 
And finally, it's becoming increasingly clear that every new online distribution platform needs premium content to successfully launch their service. We continue to talk to all of these companies, companies you all know very well, about ways we can get the proper value for our programming. We have and will continue to pick and choose the best deal for our shareholders as we grow this additional revenue stream. 
Meanwhile, our in-house websites led CBS Interactive to a very strong third quarter, with display advertising revenue up 17% year-over-year. Our ad sales, site traffic and audience engagement all continue to grow and to outpace the industry. Clearly, when you have the most successful shows on air, it crosses over to online as well, and not just CBS.com and TV.com, but also social communities like Facebook, where we have nearly 50 million fans for our prime time shows.
The cross-platform presence is appealing to our advertisers who are increasingly making both on-air and digital buys with us. Our Cable Network segment also had a terrific quarter. Revenue was up 12%, and OIBDA was up 33% from the same period last year. Year-over-year, we've added more than 4 million subscriptions at Showtime Networks and nearly 5 million at CBS College Sports, and rates have increased as well. We are confident that all of our Cable Networks will continue to add more subscribers and value to our portfolio going forward.
And Cable is another business where the strength of our content is driving our performance. During the quarter, we debuted yet another critically acclaimed Showtime original series, The Big C. The show's launch drew our highest ratings for an original series premier in eight years, and it's staying strong. Our returning series, Weeds and Dexter, also premiered new seasons during the quarter. Both shows had their highest premiers ever. And Dexter was Showtime's best overall original series season premiere in 15 years. 
At Publishing, revenue was $218 million in the third quarter, and OIBDA was $31 million, up 10%, as our expense rationalization efforts keep paying off. Just as with our TV programming, where digital continues to be a growing part of the business, digital competition between Apple, Barnes & Noble, Google, Amazon and the rest has us well-positioned in the e-book space, giving our leading content. We had more New York Times bestsellers in this year's third quarter than we did last year. And our newest releases by authors Vince Flynn and Bob Woodward are outperforming their previous titles.
Turning to Local Broadcasting. We had another outstanding performance as the local ad market recovery continued into the third quarter. Revenue was up 15%, with TV station advertising revenue up 25%, and Radio ad revenue up 9%. At the same time, Local Broadcasting OIBDA increased 49% year-over-year, and our OIBDA margin was 29%.
Strong pacing is continuing into the fourth quarter. Radio is pacing up double-digits, and our TV station group is trending to be up more than 20% over last year. Political advertising will contribute significantly to our fourth quarter results. We saw a very strong political spending right up through the mid-term elections this week, and the demand for political time pushed non-political dollars past the election into the rest of the fourth quarter. The momentum in local TV advertising continues well beyond the fourth quarter. 
Momentum also continues at Outdoor as well. Third quarter revenue was up 10% in constant dollars as the advertising marketplace continued to improve. OIBDA more than doubled year-over-year in the quarter as a result of both the top line growth and this business' new streamlined cost structure. We continue to renegotiate and enter into new contracts at better terms, which will be reflected in our results going forward as well.
One final note on our Local Group. I mentioned to you last quarter that we were launching a single website in New York called cbsnewyork.com. This site combines the resources of WCBS channel 2, 1010 WINS, WCBS 880 and WFAN The Fan to become the premier local information destination in the market. We have since launched six more similar local sites in major markets where we own TV and radio stations, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Dallas and Boston. We are very encouraged by the early results. And going forward, we expect to be generating hundreds of millions of dollars from our local websites within the next few years.
Across the board during the quarter, we were able to once again deliver on our promises and produce results that speak to our ongoing growth and success. Beyond the strong finish we expect this year, there are a number of developments that will drive our continued momentum into '11 and '12. These include the best start any television network has had in 13 years with successful new shows that are already profitable and will generate revenue for years to come.
The increasing value of our content in a dual revenue stream universe including retrans, affiliate compensation and emerging online services, dramatically improve contracts like the new Comcast and NCAA deals, which truly kick in beginning next year, the broad-based recovery at the local ad market where there's still lots of room for more growth. Our lower cost structure, which allows more revenue to translate into profits. Interest expense alone will be down $90 million annually following all of our debt actions this year. And as you saw with our announcement today, a share repurchase program that returns additional value to shareholders as our businesses continue to throw off lots of cash. So yes, we had a terrific quarter. But as you see, the best is yet to come. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

Today, I'll provide some more detail on our results for the quarter, highlight our recent financing activities and new share buyback program and update you on what we're seeing in Q4 and the things we know about 2011.
Starting with our total company results for the quarter. Total revenue of $3.3 billion compares to $3.35 billion for the same quarter last year when we benefited from the sale of five major television series that went into first cycle syndication. To give you a sense of the size of these titles, we're talking about over $300 million in revenue at about a 35% OIBDA margin, which is not included in this year's third quarter.
Meanwhile, as Les said, total advertising revenue was up 10% and affiliate and subscription revenues were up 15%, illustrating the ongoing strength in our underlying businesses. The 10% advertising growth accelerated from Q2's 9% despite tougher comps this quarter.
Reported OIBDA was up 33% for the quarter to $750 million. Reported operating income increased 46%, and reported diluted EPS increased 53% to $0.46. We are adjusting our reported results for four items in 2010: a favorable legal recovery of $90 million; a gain on sale of a TV station of approximately $8 million; an $18 million tax benefit from the settlements of income tax audits; and restructuring charges of $7 million. In 2009, we are adjusting for three items: another favorable legal recovery of $28 million; $42 million of tax benefits from additional audit settlements; and impairment charges of $32 million.
Adjusting for these items in the quarter, total company OIBDA came in at $667 million, a 17% increase. Operating income was up 25%, and diluted EPS of $0.35 was up 40%. Margin expansion continues to be a key area of focus for us. So let's look at that trend.
Total company's OIBDA margin in Q1 2010 was 10% and in Q2, it expanded to 17%. And now in Q3, it has reached 20%, which is near 2007 levels. Our Q3 OIBDA margin is a 300 basis point improvement to last year's third quarter, even without the benefit of the five syndication titles, and these are not only percentage increases we're talking about. They are higher dollars as well. 
Let's quickly look at our year-to-date results. Total company revenue up 7%, OIBDA up 31%, operating income up 50%, and net earnings up 133%. This flow-through demonstrates the strength of our operating leverage.
Looking at our segments for the quarter. Entertainment revenue of $1.6 billion was down 12% due to the five shows that went into syndication last year. Our 7% increase in network advertising revenue accelerated from 5% in Q2. OIBDA for the Entertainment segment finished at $278 million, down $47 million as the syndication benefit from last year more than offset the growth from ad revenues from the Network and Interactive and higher retrans revenues.
At Cable Networks, revenue was up 12%, and OIBDA was up 33%. Telcos and satellite operators drove the subscriber growth. On a year-to-date basis, our Cable OIBDA margin is at 36%, up 500 basis points from the same period a year ago. We expect the fourth quarter margin to be 40-plus percent for Cable.
Publishing revenue of $218 million for the quarter was down 6%. However, Publishing OIBDA for the quarter was up 10% to $31 million as we continue our cost-containment actions. E-books now comprise approximately 7% of total revenue and will continue to be a growing part of the revenue base.
At Local Broadcasting, the strong revenue and profit increases already discussed have improved our OIBDA margin seven percentage points from last year to 29%, and we expect Local Broadcasting's fourth quarter margin to be up in the mid-30s. 
And then Outdoor, revenue for the quarter was 8% to $460 million on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, Outdoor revenue increased 10%. The Americas led the way with a 15% increase, driven by higher occupancy. Outdoor OIBDA of $77 million increased 136% from last year's third quarter as we are benefiting from higher revenue, cost-saving initiatives and more favorable contracts. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Free cash flow came in at $216 million for the quarter compared to a $24 million use of cash last year. And it bears repeating that on a year-to-date basis, free cash flow is $1.4 billion, up 165% from prior year. We've used this cash primarily to strengthen our balance sheet. Our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $1.1 billion. And so far this quarter, we've issued $600 million of new debt at very attractive rates. The 4.3% coupon for our 10-year note is the lowest rate in our history. In fact, it's the lowest rate ever for all of media.
This week, we've also called the $544 million that was due in May 2011, so total gross debt on the balance sheet as of September 30 will decrease by $500-plus million before year-end. The net result from all our financing activities this year leaves only $490 million of debt coming due over the next three years and saves us approximately $90 million per year in interest costs.
So our balance sheet has never been stronger, which brings me to our next topic of returning capital to shareholders. The $1.5 billion share buyback program we announced today is expected to be executed over approximately 18 months starting in January, which will come to about $500 million every six months. At our current share price, this program constitutes about 13% of our shares outstanding. The combination of this buyback, along with our dividend, provides our shareholders a very attractive total return yield. It also represents a significant payout ratio and gives you a clear indication of what we're doing with our cash flow.
Looking ahead, here is what we're seeing in Q4 for our advertising businesses. As stated earlier, network scatter market remains robust. It is up over 35% above the upfront and broad-based among categories. Online display advertising is pacing up mid-teens. TV station revenue is pacing to be up over 20% against tougher comps. Radio stations are pacing to be up double-digits, which is an acceleration from the third quarter.
We're having a record political year at our Local Broadcasting segment, and we expect to exceed our full year $200 million target. Our Outdoor group is currently pacing up high single-digits on a constant-dollar basis. In addition, we expect our fourth quarter total company results to be our highest of the year in terms of revenue and OIBDA.
CapEx for the full year 2010 should be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. We estimate cash taxes to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million for the full year. Also as a reminder, our fourth quarter financing activities will result in an early extinguishment of debt charge of about $45 million.
Looking further out to 2011, we expect to have another strong year. Here is what we know. We know this year's upfront was up high single-digits, which runs through Q3 of 2011, and scatter is tracking well above upfront. Given the strength of our schedule, we expect this trend to continue. We know the cost of the current prime time schedule is less than last year's, and with our revised NCAA agreement, sports costs will be down next year as well. We know we have new retrans agreements that provide meaningful upside in 2011. We know we have more favorable Outdoor contracts. We know we will get cost savings from our 2010 restructuring activities. We know interest expense is going to be lower, and we will generate significant free cash flow. And we know we will be returning a significant portion of that free cash flow to our shareholders via our stock buyback and dividend. 
So we will conclude by saying that our momentum is set to continue into next year and beyond. The overall ad market still has plenty of room to recover, plus we positioned the company to continue to be a big beneficiary in the years to come by taking a number of strategic steps to capitalize on the changing business model. We feel very good about where we are but even better about where we are headed. With that, Ruthie, we can open the line up for questions."

And then one last one for Les. NBC is making a big move all of a sudden, but about looking at alpha boomers and the older demo, and you guys always get knocked for being the older network. What's going on here? Is this something you think is a significant shift in the broadcast industry in terms of advertising?"

Obviously, we'll use some of that cash to call the debt I said for May of '11.

So again, we're going to buy the stock right into our strength and generating more cash flow. As far as the affiliate and subscription, a little bit does have to do with timing. It's when agreements kick in and stuff, so there is a little bit of timing. But if you look at it on a year-to-date basis, those fluctuations tend to even out."

One, on local advertising in particular with respect to autos, it seems like autos have come back strong, kind of consistent with the return of purchases of autos. At this point, has the return of auto actually been consistent with that level? Is that what you're seeing? And have you seen any permanent differences, say, with the reduction of auto dealerships or a reduced amount of spending at the manufacturing level that has impacted you? That's the first question. And then the second, on the repurchase decision, this certainly isn't a criticism, I think a $1 billion annual repurchase is very strong, but can you talk a bit about the decision to do a repurchase instead of  returning to a dividend? And what your appetite is in the future once you work through this plan to address the dividend or like an ongoing repurchase, where you want to be?"

Thank you very much for joining us. As you see from the results we're reporting today, we had another terrific quarter, and our momentum continues to build. Each quarter in 2010 has been better than the on",2196,"Thank you, Sumner, and good afternoon, everybody. Thank you very much for joining us. As you see from the results we're reporting today, we had another terrific quarter, and our momentum continues to build. Each quarter in 2010 has been better than the one before. Advertising revenues are growing. Profits are higher, and margins are expanding. A great deal of our success comes from how well our content has performed and how well we are monetizing that performance.
The things that we told you would happen over the last several quarters are, in fact, happening. We are benefiting greatly from a return of advertising to historical levels. We are diversifying and derisking our business model by growing our secondary revenue streams. Our major-market local assets are experiencing excellent growth, and once again, most importantly, our content is thriving across the company, also across the country, on a variety of platforms. 
At the same time, we're managing our businesses more efficiently, holding down costs and strengthening our financial position as the markets improve. We have taken a number of steps to greatly improve our balance sheet by paying down debt. All of this is coming through in our results, with double-digit growth in profits in EPS and even better growth in free cash flow. These healthy levels of free cash have enabled us to announce today a $1.5 billion share repurchase program beginning January 1. Returning value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks has been one of our highest priorities all along, and we are pleased to deliver on that objective.
All of these factors that I just mentioned have brought about a structural change that will cause our strong performance to continue in 2011 and beyond. In addition, the two new long-term deals we added with Comcast and the NCAA will only help us that much more. So between the performance of our content, the improving operating environment and our very strong balance sheet, you can forgive me for being even a little bit more bullish than usual today. It's a real good time to be a shareholder of CBS.
I'm going to give some additional comments, then I'll turn it over to our, CFO, Joe Ianniello, and then as always, we'll take your questions. I'll begin with our very strong third quarter financial results. EPS for the quarter of $0.35 was up 40% versus last year's third quarter. OIBDA of $667 million was up 17% as profitability continues to improve significantly, and OIBDA margins are expanding as well. We are now approaching pre-recession levels. This is a trend that should continue into next year as our new and better deals kick in. We grow our secondary revenue streams, and we make sure that the costs we cut a couple of years ago will never return.
Total company advertising revenues were up 10%, and affiliate and subscription fees were up 15%. So healthy underlying growth continues. These increases are even more encouraging, given that last year's third quarter was when the economy began to pick up. We also generated $260 million in free cash flow, a significant improvement over last year's quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $1.4 billion, up 165% over the same time period last year.
Again, it's because of this healthy free cash flow that we were able to announce the $1.5 billion share buyback I mentioned earlier. Let's take a look at each of our businesses and some third quarter highlights. Beginning with our Content Group and its largest segment, Entertainment, where we produced revenue of $1.6 billion and OIBDA of $278 million in the quarter. Underlying advertising growth in the Entertainment segment was very strong, led by a 7% increase at the CBS Television Network. 
As you know, we've had a phenomenal start to the new season, winning the first five weeks of the season in all key measures, viewers 25 to 54 and 18 to 49. This is the first time any network has done this since 1997, and it only happened twice since people meters were introduced in 1987. Our schedule is incredibly stable, and we expect it to continue to shine for the rest of the season. Our returning shows remain very strong, and the five new shows we launched are the top five new shows of the fall, led by the number one new show, Hawaii Five-0. All five of our new shows have been picked up for the entire season.
We not only outperformed the field in this year's upfront marketplace, but we're now reaping the greatest benefits of the increase in scatter pricing as well. Because of the strength of our prime time schedule, scatter is up more than 35% over the upfront, which bodes very well for the fourth quarter and the first quarter of '11 as well.
In addition, NFL ratings are up 12% year-over-year this season. We have extremely high demand for our AFC package, and our sales are phenomenally strong. We expect this to continue right through the AFC Championship Game in January. As you know, advertising is just one way we capitalize on our content. Very positive trends in non-advertising-dependent revenues, including global syndication, retransmission consent and license fees from emerging platforms continue to strengthen the evolving broadcast model. Including the three new CBS-produced dramas on our schedule this season, our studio now owns 27 shows that are currently in production, meaning that ratings success represents just the first link in our increasingly valuable monetary content chain. 
Let me point out just a few of the incremental ways we're getting paid for our content now. First, syndication. Domestically, we're selling our new hit shows earlier and at record prices. And international syndication is becoming a bigger piece of the pie as well, representing an important long-term growth opportunity for us. 
This season, we sold all three of our new dramas internationally for north of $2 million an episode each, meaning that all three were profitable before a single episode air. Within weeks of announcing Hawaii Five-0 was on our schedule, we sold it in more than 100 markets, and now it's in nearly all 200 of our overseas markets . And of course, on this show, domestic syndication is still to come. We're also expanding internationally by gaining equity in new overseas channels. As you know, last year, we partnered with Liberty to rebrand six local U.K. channels as CBS channels and expand our programming there. During the quarter, we entered into two new similar joint ventures. One, with Reliance in India for three channels in India, and another with Network Ten in Australia, the people who own the Ten Network, for a partnership to provide content to the new cable channel 11.
Next, in addition to syndication, retrans is now a very significant and continuing part of our content value chain as well. Our retransmission consent revenue was up more than 40% year-to-date versus the same time period last year and will easily meet our full year target of $100 million. This important revenue stream will keep growing for us, and the economics of our groundbreaking new 10-year deal with Comcast will benefit our bottom line for a long, long time.
We are pleased that without a fuss, the largest cable operator recognized the value of our content in a way that benefited both sides of the negotiations. Retrans, as well as broadcast affiliate compensation to us, will continue to grow every single year. 
And finally, it's becoming increasingly clear that every new online distribution platform needs premium content to successfully launch their service. We continue to talk to all of these companies, companies you all know very well, about ways we can get the proper value for our programming. We have and will continue to pick and choose the best deal for our shareholders as we grow this additional revenue stream. 
Meanwhile, our in-house websites led CBS Interactive to a very strong third quarter, with display advertising revenue up 17% year-over-year. Our ad sales, site traffic and audience engagement all continue to grow and to outpace the industry. Clearly, when you have the most successful shows on air, it crosses over to online as well, and not just CBS.com and TV.com, but also social communities like Facebook, where we have nearly 50 million fans for our prime time shows.
The cross-platform presence is appealing to our advertisers who are increasingly making both on-air and digital buys with us. Our Cable Network segment also had a terrific quarter. Revenue was up 12%, and OIBDA was up 33% from the same period last year. Year-over-year, we've added more than 4 million subscriptions at Showtime Networks and nearly 5 million at CBS College Sports, and rates have increased as well. We are confident that all of our Cable Networks will continue to add more subscribers and value to our portfolio going forward.
And Cable is another business where the strength of our content is driving our performance. During the quarter, we debuted yet another critically acclaimed Showtime original series, The Big C. The show's launch drew our highest ratings for an original series premier in eight years, and it's staying strong. Our returning series, Weeds and Dexter, also premiered new seasons during the quarter. Both shows had their highest premiers ever. And Dexter was Showtime's best overall original series season premiere in 15 years. 
At Publishing, revenue was $218 million in the third quarter, and OIBDA was $31 million, up 10%, as our expense rationalization efforts keep paying off. Just as with our TV programming, where digital continues to be a growing part of the business, digital competition between Apple, Barnes & Noble, Google, Amazon and the rest has us well-positioned in the e-book space, giving our leading content. We had more New York Times bestsellers in this year's third quarter than we did last year. And our newest releases by authors Vince Flynn and Bob Woodward are outperforming their previous titles.
Turning to Local Broadcasting. We had another outstanding performance as the local ad market recovery continued into the third quarter. Revenue was up 15%, with TV station advertising revenue up 25%, and Radio ad revenue up 9%. At the same time, Local Broadcasting OIBDA increased 49% year-over-year, and our OIBDA margin was 29%.
Strong pacing is continuing into the fourth quarter. Radio is pacing up double-digits, and our TV station group is trending to be up more than 20% over last year. Political advertising will contribute significantly to our fourth quarter results. We saw a very strong political spending right up through the mid-term elections this week, and the demand for political time pushed non-political dollars past the election into the rest of the fourth quarter. The momentum in local TV advertising continues well beyond the fourth quarter. 
Momentum also continues at Outdoor as well. Third quarter revenue was up 10% in constant dollars as the advertising marketplace continued to improve. OIBDA more than doubled year-over-year in the quarter as a result of both the top line growth and this business' new streamlined cost structure. We continue to renegotiate and enter into new contracts at better terms, which will be reflected in our results going forward as well.
One final note on our Local Group. I mentioned to you last quarter that we were launching a single website in New York called cbsnewyork.com. This site combines the resources of WCBS channel 2, 1010 WINS, WCBS 880 and WFAN The Fan to become the premier local information destination in the market. We have since launched six more similar local sites in major markets where we own TV and radio stations, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Dallas and Boston. We are very encouraged by the early results. And going forward, we expect to be generating hundreds of millions of dollars from our local websites within the next few years.
Across the board during the quarter, we were able to once again deliver on our promises and produce results that speak to our ongoing growth and success. Beyond the strong finish we expect this year, there are a number of developments that will drive our continued momentum into '11 and '12. These include the best start any television network has had in 13 years with successful new shows that are already profitable and will generate revenue for years to come.
The increasing value of our content in a dual revenue stream universe including retrans, affiliate compensation and emerging online services, dramatically improve contracts like the new Comcast and NCAA deals, which truly kick in beginning next year, the broad-based recovery at the local ad market where there's still lots of room for more growth. Our lower cost structure, which allows more revenue to translate into profits. Interest expense alone will be down $90 million annually following all of our debt actions this year. And as you saw with our announcement today, a share repurchase program that returns additional value to shareholders as our businesses continue to throw off lots of cash. So yes, we had a terrific quarter. But as you see, the best is yet to come. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

Today, I'll provide some more detail on our results for the quarter, highlight our recent financing activities and new share buyback program and update you on what we're seeing in Q4 and the things we know about",1399,"Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide some more detail on our results for the quarter, highlight our recent financing activities and new share buyback program and update you on what we're seeing in Q4 and the things we know about 2011.
Starting with our total company results for the quarter. Total revenue of $3.3 billion compares to $3.35 billion for the same quarter last year when we benefited from the sale of five major television series that went into first cycle syndication. To give you a sense of the size of these titles, we're talking about over $300 million in revenue at about a 35% OIBDA margin, which is not included in this year's third quarter.
Meanwhile, as Les said, total advertising revenue was up 10% and affiliate and subscription revenues were up 15%, illustrating the ongoing strength in our underlying businesses. The 10% advertising growth accelerated from Q2's 9% despite tougher comps this quarter.
Reported OIBDA was up 33% for the quarter to $750 million. Reported operating income increased 46%, and reported diluted EPS increased 53% to $0.46. We are adjusting our reported results for four items in 2010: a favorable legal recovery of $90 million; a gain on sale of a TV station of approximately $8 million; an $18 million tax benefit from the settlements of income tax audits; and restructuring charges of $7 million. In 2009, we are adjusting for three items: another favorable legal recovery of $28 million; $42 million of tax benefits from additional audit settlements; and impairment charges of $32 million.
Adjusting for these items in the quarter, total company OIBDA came in at $667 million, a 17% increase. Operating income was up 25%, and diluted EPS of $0.35 was up 40%. Margin expansion continues to be a key area of focus for us. So let's look at that trend.
Total company's OIBDA margin in Q1 2010 was 10% and in Q2, it expanded to 17%. And now in Q3, it has reached 20%, which is near 2007 levels. Our Q3 OIBDA margin is a 300 basis point improvement to last year's third quarter, even without the benefit of the five syndication titles, and these are not only percentage increases we're talking about. They are higher dollars as well. 
Let's quickly look at our year-to-date results. Total company revenue up 7%, OIBDA up 31%, operating income up 50%, and net earnings up 133%. This flow-through demonstrates the strength of our operating leverage.
Looking at our segments for the quarter. Entertainment revenue of $1.6 billion was down 12% due to the five shows that went into syndication last year. Our 7% increase in network advertising revenue accelerated from 5% in Q2. OIBDA for the Entertainment segment finished at $278 million, down $47 million as the syndication benefit from last year more than offset the growth from ad revenues from the Network and Interactive and higher retrans revenues.
At Cable Networks, revenue was up 12%, and OIBDA was up 33%. Telcos and satellite operators drove the subscriber growth. On a year-to-date basis, our Cable OIBDA margin is at 36%, up 500 basis points from the same period a year ago. We expect the fourth quarter margin to be 40-plus percent for Cable.
Publishing revenue of $218 million for the quarter was down 6%. However, Publishing OIBDA for the quarter was up 10% to $31 million as we continue our cost-containment actions. E-books now comprise approximately 7% of total revenue and will continue to be a growing part of the revenue base.
At Local Broadcasting, the strong revenue and profit increases already discussed have improved our OIBDA margin seven percentage points from last year to 29%, and we expect Local Broadcasting's fourth quarter margin to be up in the mid-30s. 
And then Outdoor, revenue for the quarter was 8% to $460 million on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, Outdoor revenue increased 10%. The Americas led the way with a 15% increase, driven by higher occupancy. Outdoor OIBDA of $77 million increased 136% from last year's third quarter as we are benefiting from higher revenue, cost-saving initiatives and more favorable contracts. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Free cash flow came in at $216 million for the quarter compared to a $24 million use of cash last year. And it bears repeating that on a year-to-date basis, free cash flow is $1.4 billion, up 165% from prior year. We've used this cash primarily to strengthen our balance sheet. Our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $1.1 billion. And so far this quarter, we've issued $600 million of new debt at very attractive rates. The 4.3% coupon for our 10-year note is the lowest rate in our history. In fact, it's the lowest rate ever for all of media.
This week, we've also called the $544 million that was due in May 2011, so total gross debt on the balance sheet as of September 30 will decrease by $500-plus million before year-end. The net result from all our financing activities this year leaves only $490 million of debt coming due over the next three years and saves us approximately $90 million per year in interest costs.
So our balance sheet has never been stronger, which brings me to our next topic of returning capital to shareholders. The $1.5 billion share buyback program we announced today is expected to be executed over approximately 18 months starting in January, which will come to about $500 million every six months. At our current share price, this program constitutes about 13% of our shares outstanding. The combination of this buyback, along with our dividend, provides our shareholders a very attractive total return yield. It also represents a significant payout ratio and gives you a clear indication of what we're doing with our cash flow.
Looking ahead, here is what we're seeing in Q4 for our advertising businesses. As stated earlier, network scatter market remains robust. It is up over 35% above the upfront and broad-based among categories. Online display advertising is pacing up mid-teens. TV station revenue is pacing to be up over 20% against tougher comps. Radio stations are pacing to be up double-digits, which is an acceleration from the third quarter.
We're having a record political year at our Local Broadcasting segment, and we expect to exceed our full year $200 million target. Our Outdoor group is currently pacing up high single-digits on a constant-dollar basis. In addition, we expect our fourth quarter total company results to be our highest of the year in terms of revenue and OIBDA.
CapEx for the full year 2010 should be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. We estimate cash taxes to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million for the full year. Also as a reminder, our fourth quarter financing activities will result in an early extinguishment of debt charge of about $45 million.
Looking further out to 2011, we expect to have another strong year. Here is what we know. We know this year's upfront was up high single-digits, which runs through Q3 of 2011, and scatter is tracking well above upfront. Given the strength of our schedule, we expect this trend to continue. We know the cost of the current prime time schedule is less than last year's, and with our revised NCAA agreement, sports costs will be down next year as well. We know we have new retrans agreements that provide meaningful upside in 2011. We know we have more favorable Outdoor contracts. We know we will get cost savings from our 2010 restructuring activities. We know interest expense is going to be lower, and we will generate significant free cash flow. And we know we will be returning a significant portion of that free cash flow to our shareholders via our stock buyback and dividend. 
So we will conclude by saying that our momentum is set to continue into next year and beyond. The overall ad market still has plenty of room to recover, plus we positioned the company to continue to be a big beneficiary in the years to come by taking a number of strategic steps to capitalize on the changing business model. We feel very good about where we are but even better about where we are headed. With that, Ruthie, we can open the line up for questions."

Thank you very much for joining us. As you see from the results we're reporting today, we had another terrific quarter, and our momentum continues to build.

As you see from the results we're reporting today, we had another terrific quarter, and our momentum continues to build. Each quarter in 2010 has been better than the one before. Advertising revenues are growing. Profits are higher, and margins are expanding. A great deal of our success comes from how well our content has performed and how well we are monetizing that performance.
 The things that we told you would happen over the last several quarters are, in fact, happening. We are benefiting greatly from a return of advertising to historical levels. We are diversifying and derisking our business model by growing our secondary revenue streams. Our major-market local assets are experiencing excellent growth, and once again, most importantly, our content is thriving across the company, also across the country, on a variety of platforms.
 At the same time, we're managing our businesses more efficiently, holding down costs and strengthening our financial position as the markets improve. We have taken a number of steps to greatly improve our balance sheet by paying down debt. All of this is coming through in our results, with double-digit growth in profits in EPS and even better growth in free cash flow. These healthy levels of free cash have enabled us to announce today a $1.5 billion share repurchase program beginning January 1. Returning value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks has been one of our highest priorities all along, and we are pleased to deliver on that objective.
 All of these factors that I just mentioned have brought about a structural change that will cause our strong performance to continue into 2011 and beyond. In addition, the two new long-term deals we added with Comcast and the NCAA will only help us that much more. So between the performance of our content, the improving operating environment and our very strong balance sheet, you can forgive me for being even a little bit more bullish than usual today. It's a real good time to be a shareholder of CBS.
 I'm going to give some additional comments, then I'll turn it over to our, CFO, Joe Ianniello, and then as always, we'll take your questions. I'll begin with our very strong third quarter financial results. EPS for the quarter of $0.35 was up 40% versus last year's third quarter. OIBDA of $667 million was up 17% as profitability continues to improve significantly, and OIBDA margins are expanding as well. We are now approaching pre-recession levels. This is a trend that should continue into next year as our new and better deals kick in. We grow our secondary revenue streams, and we make sure that the costs we cut a couple of years ago will never return.
 Total company advertising revenues were up 10%, and affiliate and subscription fees were up 15%. So healthy underlying growth continues. These increases are even more encouraging, given that last year's third quarter was when the economy began to pick up. We also generated $260 million in free cash flow, a significant improvement over last year's quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $1.4 billion, up 165% over the same time period last year.
 Again, it's because of this healthy free cash flow that we were able to announce the $1.5 billion share buyback I mentioned earlier. Let's take a look at each of our businesses and some third quarter highlights. Beginning with our Content Group and its largest segment, Entertainment, where we produced revenue of $1.6 billion and OIBDA of $278 million in the quarter. Underlying advertising growth in the Entertainment segment was very strong, led by a 7% increase at the CBS Television Network.
 As you know, we've had a phenomenal start to the new season, winning the first five weeks of the season in all key measures, viewers 25 to 54 and 18 to 49. This is the first time any network has done this since 1997, and it only happened twice since people meters were introduced in 1987. Our schedule is incredibly stable, and we expect it to continue to shine for the rest of the season. Our returning shows remain very strong, and the five new shows we launched are the top five new shows of the fall, led by the number one new show, Hawaii Five-0. All five of our new shows have been picked up for the entire season.
 We not only outperformed the field in this year's upfront marketplace, but we're now reaping the greatest benefits of the increase in scatter pricing as well. Because of the strength of our prime time schedule, scatter is up more than 35% over the upfront, which bodes very well for the fourth quarter and the first quarter of '11 as well.
 In addition, NFL ratings are up 12% year-over-year this season. We have extremely high demand for our AFC package, and our sales are phenomenally strong. We expect this to continue right through the AFC Championship Game in January. As you know, advertising is just one way we capitalize on our content. Very positive trends in non-advertising-dependent revenues, including global syndication, retransmission consent and license fees from emerging platforms continue to strengthen the evolving broadcast model. Including the three new CBS-produced dramas on our schedule this season, our studio now owns 27 shows that are currently in production, meaning that ratings success represents just the first length in our increasingly valuable monetary content chain.
 Let me point out just a few of the incremental ways we're getting paid for our content now. First, syndication. Domestically, we're selling our new hit shows earlier and at record prices. And international syndication is becoming a bigger piece of the pie as well, representing an important long-term growth opportunity for us.
 This season, we sold all three of our new dramas internationally for north of $2 million an episode each, meaning that all three were profitable before a single episode air. Within weeks of announcing Hawaii Five-0 was on our schedule, we sold it in more than 100 markets, and now it's in nearly all 200 of our overseas markets . And of course, on this show, domestic syndication is still to come. We're also expanding internationally by gaining equity in new overseas channels. As you know, last year, we partnered with Liberty to rebrand six local U.K. channels as CBS channels and expand our programming there. During the quarter, we entered into two new similar joint ventures. One, with Reliance in India for three channels in India, and another with Network Ten in Australia, the people who own the Ten Network, for a partnership to provide content to the new cable channel 11.
 Next, in addition to syndication, retrans is now a very significant and continuing part of our content value chain as well. Our retransmission consent revenue was up more than 40% year-to-date versus the same time period last year and will easily meet our full year target of $100 million. This important revenue stream will keep growing for us, and the economics of our groundbreaking new 10-year deal with Comcast will benefit our bottom line for a long, long time.
 We are pleased that without a fuss, the largest cable operator recognized the value of our content in a way that benefited both sides of the negotiations. Retrans, as well as broadcast affiliate compensation to us, will continue to grow every single year.
 And finally, it's becoming increasingly clear that every new online distribution platform needs premium content to successfully launch their service. We continue to talk to all of these companies, companies you all know very well, about ways we can get the proper value for our programming. We have and we'll continue to pick and choose the best deal for our shareholders as we grow this additional revenue stream.
 Meanwhile, our in-house websites led CBS Interactive to a very strong third quarter, with display advertising revenue up 17% year-over-year. Our ad sales, site traffic and audience engagement all continue to grow and to outpace the industry. Clearly, when you have the most successful shows on air, it crosses over to online as well, and not just CBS.com and TV.com, but also social communities like Facebook, where we have nearly 50 million fans for our prime time shows.
 The cross-platform presence is appealing to our advertisers who are increasingly making both on-air and digital buys with us. Our Cable Network segment also had a terrific quarter. revenue was up 12%, and OIBDA was up 33% from the same period last year. Year-over-year, we've added more than 4 million subscriptions at Showtime Networks and nearly 5 million at CBS College Sports, and rates have increased as well. We are confident that all of our Cable Networks will continue to add more subscribers and value to our portfolio going forward.
 And Cable is another business where the strength of our content is driving our performance. During the quarter, we debuted yet another critically acclaimed Showtime original series, The Big C. The show's launch drew our highest ratings for an original series premier in eight years, and it's staying strong. Our returning series, Weeds and Dexter, also premiered new seasons during the quarter. Both shows had their highest premiers ever. And Dexter was Showtime's best overall original series season premiere in 15 years.
 At Publishing, revenue was $218 million in the third quarter, and OIBDA was $31 million, up 10%, as our expense rationalization efforts keep paying off. Just as with our TV programming, where digital continues to be a growing part of the business, digital competition between Apple, Barnes & Noble, Google, Amazon and the rest has us well-positioned in the e-book space, giving our leading content. We had more New York Times bestsellers in this year's third quarter than we did last year. And our newest releases by authors Vince Flynn and Bob Woodward are outperforming their previous titles.
 Turning to Local Broadcasting. We had another outstanding performance as the local ad market recovery continued into the third quarter. Revenue was up 15%, with TV station advertising revenue up 25%, and Radio ad revenue up 9%. At the same time, Local Broadcasting OIBDA increased 49% year-over-year, and our OIBDA margin was 29%.
 Strong pacing is continuing into the fourth quarter. Radio is pacing up double-digits, and our TV station group is trending to be up more than 20% over last year. Political advertising will contribute significantly to our fourth quarter results. We saw a very strong political spending right up through the mid-term elections this week, and the demand for political time pushed non-political dollars past the election into the rest of the fourth quarter. The momentum in local TV advertising continues well beyond the fourth quarter.
 Momentum also continues at Outdoor as well. Third quarter revenue was up 10% in constant dollars as the advertising marketplace continued to improve. OIBDA more than doubled year-over-year in the quarter as a result of both the top line growth and this business' new streamlined cost structure. We continue to renegotiate and enter into new contracts at better terms, which will be reflected in our results going forward as well.
 One final note on our Local Group. I mentioned to you last quarter that we were launching a single website in New York called cbsnewyork.com. This site combines the resources of WCBS channel 2, 1010 WINS, WCBS 880 and WFAN The Fan to become the premier local information destination in the market. We have since launched six more similar local sites in major markets where we own TV and radio stations, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Dallas and Boston. We are very encouraged by the early results. And going forward, we expect to be generating hundreds of millions of dollars from our local websites within the next few years.
 Across the board during the quarter, we were able to once again deliver on our promises and produce results that speak to our ongoing growth and success. Beyond the strong finish we expect this year, there are a number of developments that will drive our continued momentum into '11 and '12. These include the best start any television network has had in 13 years with successful new shows that are already profitable and will generate revenue for years to come.
 The increasing value of our content in a dual revenue stream universe including retrans, affiliate compensation and emerging online services, dramatically improve contracts like the new Comcast and NCAA deals, which truly kick in beginning next year, the broad-based recovery at the local ad market where there's still lots of room for more growth. Our lower cost structure, which allows more revenue to translate into profits. Interest expense alone will be down $90 million annually following all of our debt actions this year. And as you saw with our announcement today, a share repurchase program that returns additional value to shareholders as our businesses continue to throw off lots of cash. So yes, we had a terrific quarter. But as you see, the best is yet to come.

Today, I'll provide some more detail on our results for the quarter, highlight our recent financing activities and new share buyback program and update you on what we're seeing in Q4 and the things we know about",1399," Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide some more detail on our results for the quarter, highlight our recent financing activities and new share buyback program and update you on what we're seeing in Q4 and the things we know about 2011.
 Starting with our total company results for the quarter. Total revenue of $3.3 billion compares to $3.35 billion for the same quarter last year when we benefited from the sale of five major television series that went into first cycle syndication. To give you a sense of the size of these titles, we're talking about over $300 million in revenue at about a 35% OIBDA margin, which is not included in this year's third quarter.
 Meanwhile, as Les said, total advertising revenue was up 10% and affiliate and subscription revenues were up 15%, illustrating the ongoing strength in our underlying businesses. The 10% advertising growth accelerated from Q2's 9% despite tougher comps this quarter.
 Reported OIBDA was up 33% for the quarter to $750 million. Reported operating income increased 46%, and reported diluted EPS increased 53% to $0.46. We are adjusting our reported results for four items in 2010: a favorable legal recovery of $90 million; a gain on sale of a TV station of approximately $8 million; an $18 million tax benefit from the settlements of income tax audits; and restructuring charges of $7 million. In 2009, we are adjusting for three items: another favorable legal recovery of $28 million; $42 million of tax benefits from additional audit settlements; and impairment charges of $32 million.
 Adjusting for these items in the quarter, total company OIBDA came in at $667 million, a 17% increase. Operating income was up 25%, and diluted EPS of $0.35 was up 40%. Margin expansion continues to be a key area of focus for us. So let's look at that trend.
 Total company's OIBDA margin in Q1 2010 was 10% and in Q2, it expanded to 17%. And now in Q3, it has reached 20%, which is near 2007 levels. Our Q3 OIBDA margin is a 300 basis point improvement to last year's third quarter, even without the benefit of the five syndication titles, and these are not only percentage increases we're talking about. They are higher dollars as well.
 Let's quickly look at our year-to-date results. Total company revenue up 7%, OIBDA up 31%, operating income of 50%, and net earnings up 133%. This flow-through demonstrates the strength of our operating leverage.
 Looking at our segments for the quarter. Entertainment revenue of $1.6 billion was down 12% due to the five shows that went into syndication last year. Our 7% increase in network advertising revenue accelerated from 5% in Q2. OIBDA for the Entertainment segment finished at $278 million, down $47 million as the syndication benefit from last year more than offset the growth from ad revenues from the Network and Interactive and higher retrans revenues.
 At Cable Networks, revenue was up 12%, and OIBDA was up 33%. Telcos and satellite operators drove the subscriber growth. On a year-to-date basis, our Cable OIBDA margin is at 36%, up 500 basis points from the same period a year ago. We expect the fourth quarter margin to be 40-plus percent for Cable.
 Publishing revenue of $218 million for the quarter was down 6%. However, Publishing OIBDA for the quarter was up 10% to $31 million as we continue our cost-containment actions. E-books now comprise approximately 7% of total revenue and will continue to be a growing part of the revenue base.
 At Local Broadcasting, the strong revenue and profit increases already discussed have improved our OIBDA margin seven percentage points from last year to 29%, and we expect Local Broadcasting's fourth quarter margin to be up in the mid-30s.
 And then Outdoor, revenue for the quarter was 8% to $460 million on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, Outdoor revenue increased 10%. The Americas led the way with a 15% increase, driven by higher occupancy. Outdoor OIBDA of $77 million increased 136% from last year's third quarter as we are benefiting from higher revenue, cost-saving initiatives and more favorable contracts.
 Turning to our balance sheet. Free cash flow came in at $260 million for the quarter compared to a $24 million use of cash last year. And it bears repeating that on a year-to-date basis, free cash flow is $1.4 billion, up 165% from prior year. We've used this cash primarily to strengthen our balance sheet. Our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $1.1 billion. And so far this quarter, we've issued $600 million of new debt at very attractive rates. The 4.3% coupon for our 10-year note is the lowest rate in our history. In fact, it's the lowest rate ever for all of media.
 This week, we've also called the $544 million that was due in May 2011, so total gross debt on the balance sheet as of September 30 will decrease by $500-plus million before year-end. The net result from all our financing activities this year leaves only $490 million of debt coming due over the next three years and saves us approximately $90 million per year in interest costs.
 So our balance sheet has never been stronger, which brings me to our next topic of returning capital to shareholders. The $1.5 billion share buyback program we announced today is expected to be executed over approximately 18 months starting in January, which will come to about $500 million every six months. At our current share price, this program constitutes about 30% of our shares outstanding. The combination of this buyback, along with our dividend, provides our shareholders a very attractive total return yield. It also represents a significant payout ratio and gives you a clear indication of what we're doing with our cash flow.
 Looking ahead, here is what we're seeing in Q4 for our advertising businesses. As stated earlier, network scatter market remains robust. It is up over 35% above the upfront and broad-based among categories. Online display advertising is pacing up mid-teens. TV station revenue is pacing to be up over 20% against tougher comps. Radio stations are pacing to be up double-digits, which is an acceleration from the third quarter.
 We're having a record political year at our Local Broadcasting segment, and we expect to exceed our full year $200 million target. Our Outdoor group is currently pacing up high single-digits on a constant-dollar basis. In addition, we expect our fourth quarter total company results to be our highest of the year in terms of revenue and OIBDA.
 CapEx for the full year 2010 should be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. We estimate cash taxes to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million for the full year. Also as a reminder, our fourth quarter financing activities will result in an early extinguishment of debt charge of about $45 million.
 Looking further out to 2011, we expect to have another strong year. Here is what we know. We know this year's upfront was up high single-digits, which runs through Q3 of 2011, and scatter is tracking well above upfront. Given the strength of our schedule, we expect this trend to continue. We know the cost of the current prime time schedule is less than last year's, and with our revised NCAA agreement, sports costs will be down next year as well. We know we have new retrans agreements that provide meaningful upside in 2011. We know we have more favorable Outdoor contracts. We know we will get cost savings from our 2010 restructuring activities. We know interest expense is going to be lower, and we will generate significant free cash flow. And we know we will be returning a significant portion of that free cash flow to our shareholders via our stock buyback and dividend.
 So we will conclude by saying that our momentum is set to continue into next year and beyond. The overall ad market still has plenty of room to recover, plus we positioned the company to continue to be a big beneficiary in the years to come by taking a number of strategic steps to capitalize on the changing business model. We feel very good about where we are but even better about where we are headed. With that, Ruthie, we can open the line up for questions.

And then also your revenue breakout, at least the strength versus where we were came in on the affiliate and subscription fees, which the growth was 15% this quarter, an acceleration from the first half. Is that retrans from Comcast kicking in already or CBS Sports Network or Showtime or all of the above? Just want to get a little bit of understanding of what drove that acceleration. And then one last one for Les. NBC is making a big move all of a sudden, but about looking at alpha boomers  and the older demo, and you guys always get knocked for being the older network. What's going on here? Is this something you think is a significant shift in the broadcast industry in terms of advertising?

Obviously, we'll use some of that cash to call the debt I said for May of '11. So we don't really need a lot of cash and as you know, the first six months of the year is our stronger cash flow part of the year. So again, we're going to buy the stock right into our strength and generating more cash flow. As far as the affiliate and subscription, a little bit does have to do with timing. It's when agreements kick in and stuff, so there is a little bit of timing. But if you look at it on a year-to-date basis, those fluctuations tend to even out.

I was sort of booed down by the other networks when they were doing a bit better, that 18 to 49 is the only thing that mattered. Now that we're winning the 18 to 49, suddenly, there's a shift. Now by the way, we still agree with the fact that a 50-year-old is more valuable than a 19-year-old, and we've always welcomed them into the tent. And to us, a viewer is a viewer is a viewer. We like winning them all. We like 18-year-olds and we like 80-year-olds, and the good thing is they're watching CBS.

I'm interested in whether CBS is also getting higher a sports rating. But more importantly, do think the economics flow through that? Or does it go back to where -- on Radio, it sounds like, Joe, you were pretty optimistic about the trend line in Radio going into 4Q. We have been hearing that national is up kind of double-digits, but local remains anemic at low single-digits. And I'm just wondering if you think that's a secular kind of rebuttal of the local merchants against a Radio business. So whether you see those two lines converging in the fourth quarter we're in now?

Before the season even began, it was a great demand for NFL football. And I think it's followed the strong upfront that sports became -- the NFL became even stronger than that. Add to that, what we referenced as ratings that are up in the low-teens, and the demand for the NFL is extremely good. I know the NBC game is doing well. I know FOX is doing well. Football is extraordinarily strong, and the dollars are flowing in greatly for it. The economics of the rest of our sports, as mentioned, the NCAA deal changes our full profile in that event and that becomes a profitable event as does golf and even the U.S. Open tennis tournament, if it wouldn't rain so much. So we are very pleased with our sports portfolio, but the NFL is going through the roof.
