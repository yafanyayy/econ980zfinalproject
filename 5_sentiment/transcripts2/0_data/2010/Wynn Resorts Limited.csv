What we have to say, I think, is going to be very brief because I think these numbers speak for themselves. We had a wonderful year in China. We always want to point out that the most important thing to recognize when looking at numbers in our business is not so much market share per se. That's a measurement of sort of casino revenue.  What really is important is to look at the yield per table and the profitability per table. And I'm very happy to see that again, for the second or third consecutive year, the profitability and the efficiency of our tables in Macau have continued to climb in spite of the existence of some very fanciful competition that appeared this year. The Macau market is beginning to show some maturity. There are fine buildings that have been opened and are being operated. And as market conditions have improved, I think that the rest of the construction that was started and temporarily halted will now continue. That's all good news as we go forward in having that market be mature. We've happily established a niche for ourselves and I think our EBITDA was over $500 million last year. And although I don't make forward-looking statements as a rule, we're tracking substantially ahead of that the first two months of the year. And we haven't even opened Encore, which is about 60 or 90 days away. I think it went to April 24, on a Wednesday. I think Linda decided that we'll do it in April 24, and that is the most beautiful thing we've ever done. And when that kicks in, we're going to have another little boost in our ability to understand and serve the specific needs of our customers. And our customers are, admittedly, the top end. This building, Encore in Macau, and I'm taking just an extra minute or two to comment on it, is a building that was designed after we had two years of experience to understand the needs of our particular guests that gamble and visit Macau. When we built Wynn Macau and opened it in '06, we had done our very best in pre-opening research and design to have a building that would appeal to what we understood to be that market. And I'm happy to say that we weren't very far off the mark and the success that we have enjoyed is a direct reflection of the fact that we were able to get it right, especially in the wonderful employees that we were able to attract to come work for us. The workforce in Macau is totally delicious. I mean, the people that have come to work for us from Macau, from Mainland China, from the Philippines have the most wonderful desire to be trained and to improve and be successful in their jobs. That's probably been our main asset, it's the people that work for us, which is why we never cut back on salaries or the 13th month, or why we never did any of the other things that some of our competitors have done. Because whether it's in Macau or Las Vegas, our principal asset are our employees, period. And the ones we have now in China are just absolutely over the moon. Wonderful, as far as we're concerned. And we have the organization that's going to be in place to open Encore. I'm happy to say in a few months -- and I think when everybody gets a whiff of that place, they're going to realize that we've set a new standard in hospitality, facilities and the way we present our product. It is by far the best thing that I've been part of and I've been doing this for 40 odd years. It's 414 rooms and suites and I'm very excited about April's opening and can't wait to share it with everybody. So much for Macau. We look forward to a very healthy and exciting 2010 and beyond. I wish I could say the same thing about Las Vegas. But I'm still -- as we have been in the past, unlike some of our competitors who've seen all kinds of glitter and wonderment from just around the corner, I think everybody sort of come clean now that we don't see that. The policies in Washington, policies of government, have taken a terrible toll on the working people in America that come to Las Vegas on the corporations that book conventions and meetings in Las Vegas. I'm afraid to say that I think the outlook for 2010 is very conservative, at least. I don't see any major change in the future. I don't see it getting worse per se, but I do think that unless there is some signal from Washington that they can control the deficit that, not only Las Vegas but the country, it faces dire problems. And I don't see any reason whatsoever to have a speck of confidence in the congress or the administration that's there now. And in the end, Las Vegas is almost a perfect reflection of the national mood. So I'm conservative and guarded about the future of Las Vegas, and I think political leadership has now come home to roost as part of every businessman's conference calls.  I mean, imagine that it would be necessary for someone in my position with my job to talk to a group of investors and analysts and have to refer to policies in Washington when discussing the relevance of the quarters that lie ahead. If anybody's got a speck of sophistication, it's listening to my voice now but recognize that, that is, in fact, true. I'll take questions and so will my colleagues who are sitting around the table."

But it's the low end of the range on the VIP side, where as normalized, it would be $2.85 million, which is a lot of money in Macau. $17 billion of turnover versus $11 billion of turnover last year, volumes are very strong. If you look at the corporate expense side, for full year 2008 we had about $36 million of corporate expense excluding the quarters. Full year '09, closer to $45 million. The difference of roughly a $8 million or $9 million is attributable to one-time payments related to the Macau IPO. So '09 corporate expenses would've been roughly flat with 2008 outside of those one-time expenses."

One of the things that has been really cute about this business of quarterly conference calls is sort of a game of cat and mouse about credit.

And once again, here is the oldest story in the book when it comes to our company. Capital structure is your salvation. It's capital structure that allows you to hold your head in a down market. I am not forced with my colleagues to juggle my employees or to juggle my customer service levels. There's nothing left to do in my industry except do the basics better. And doing the basics better is what we're all about right now as we tend to our flock in a market that's sort of rough. So we're building a $67 million beach club and a new nightclub to add to our existing nightclubs called Surrender. And we're improving Swith, our restaurant, that will all be integrated into the Encore beach club. And it's going to open up on May 21, we've got 90 days to go. It's right on schedule. And the Encore Beach Club will be -- and just as our nightclubs' excess in tryst have dominated the market, The Encore Beach Club will take this very profitable sector of the market, the alcoholic beverage recreational tumult that goes along with nightclubs. And the margins are fabulous. We have 65% profit margins in these departments, so better than Blackjack in many respects. Encore Beach Club will take the nightclub mentality into daytime. We've got this gorgeous two-level cabana club that would encore the north end of our property and liven up this end of the Strip. And you can walk from the cabanas out onto a French balcony and look over the Strip. Or on the inside, the cabanas look down on the pool area, which is integrated with the new nightclub, Surrender, and our restaurant, Switch, which will now have a beautiful terrace dining area. This whole complex, which is on the Strip side of Encore where we originally put up portraiture. Unfortunately, the hotels that were supposed to be built across the street from us at the Frontier site and at the Stardust site have been aborted. And we perceived that they will be aborted for the near and distant future. I don't see anything happening with the Echelon Place project in the near future nor do I see anything happening on the Frontier project. So having a fancy portraiture, which we unfortunately built for Encore, was worthless. Now another company would have to live with that. But because we have such a strong financial statement and because we have the working capital that's necessary to keep us competitive, we take off that unused portraiture and we put something on it that would generate profits in 90 days. And that puts more pressure on our competition, more pressure on every level of our competition. We're about to refurbish our rooms in Wynn because they're five years old. It puts more pressure on our competition because our service levels and the targeted attractiveness of our facilities gets more and more effective. Nothing left to do but the basics better. And that's the story of Wynn Resorts in Las Vegas."

So how do you balance putting your name on something that might not have sort of the same appeal?

Those buildings were conceived in a different time, but they exist. So does Encore. So we'd make the best of it. I'll tell you one thing, you better damn well have a strong balance sheet if you want to play on this Strip. And we've got one. I think our cash is equal to our debt. And we don't have any current maturities. We have long maturities, low interest rates. We're protected for stormy weather. And this is again -- I said this before, if you don't understand the capital structures, the backbone of your marketing, then you need to go back to business school. We understand that here. We don't need to learn that lesson anew. Now let's go back to Philadelphia, if we can, Steve. I'm building 3,000 slot machines and a bunch of table games and a poker room, Italian restaurant, a steak house, an Asian restaurant because I'm two blocks from a Vietnamese neighborhood, I'm five blocks from Society Hill, I'm in a town with seven universities, I'm about four blocks from the Walt Whitman Bridge, my 14 or 15 acres is on the Delaware River -- and incidentally, Steve, the almost to the foot, the same size as my property in Macau. Two blocks away or four blocks away is Walt Whitman Bridge. On the other side of the bridge is Cherry Hill, New Jersey, all full of my old friends, Italians and Jews and every conceivable stripe of ethnic group that love to shoot crap and gamble. And they're 10 minutes away in their cars or on a bus from my casino on the Delaware River. I love the proximity to these people. I love the proximity to the Vietnamese neighborhood, and I'm going to put in a beautiful Vietnamese restaurant for them. I'm going to build a very pretty place with the help of my Wynn design and development team that is perfectly responsive just to that market and not a bit more over the top than that. But it will look like us. It won't be a slots in a box. I spent some time this past week with a very good friend of mine, Bob Manoukian, who has, it's called, Philadelphia Parks Casino. And Bob was sharing the results of that casino with me. And I assure you, sir, that is not a below-average return on investment. It is a wonderful return on investment because of the low cost of marketing. Now listen, no Gulfstream jets, no helicopters, no nothing. And the table games and the slot wins are allowing, because of the limited amount of machines in the market, for returns that are handsome, much better than we can get in Las Vegas at the present moment. So I'm not concerned about overshooting the mark. I think we can build a lovely single-level, what would appears to be a single-level on the outside, you put the valet parking and the employee parking on grade and then you lift the casino by 12 or 14 feet and you drive up to that on the portraiture so it looks like it's on grade. And then you have two or three levels of parking on either side of the casino so you can walk right into the casino from the garages. And we make this super friendly place for users. And they can run in, gamble for 3 hours and run out, have a great steak or an Italian dinner or noodles or a slice of pizza and it will be just the right lighting and great colors. All those things, all those little things, they've always given us market superiority. We're going to put them to work for the first time in a straightforward casino, not a destination-integrated resort, which involves all those bells and whistles that are so expensive that you're familiar with in the past. So don't misunderstand the assignment that we have or our clear vision of what we have to do. I don't know if that makes you feel any better. Are you owning our stock these days?"

I was talking about the maturing in the sense of the facilities that were available to choices. One of the reasons Las Vegas has been so successful for so many years is the public has had a wonderful menu of choices. Not one hotel but several that were all different and had a variety of options available to tourists. Macau was very limited when it was a monopoly. And then as the years have come by, since the opening of the Sands and then ourselves and the people from Melbourne, and then this past year, the Four Seasons opened, the Sands people opened the Four Seasons and the Melco people opened the City Of Dreams, that's what I meant by maturity. And then here we come with this sexy little thing called Encore. These are wonderful choices. I noticed that business for Chinese New Year was a little softer, even though Baccarat was good last year. And I think one of the reasons is that business exploded for Chinese New Year in Macau. And I think it's because now the choices in China are so wonderful for people that live in South China, they can go to Macau, they don't have to travel all the way to Las Vegas. Now again, we had a very big Baccarat year last year in Las Vegas in spite of everything else. But I'm convinced that the choices that are presenting themselves to people in Asia just as the government intended, the reason they broke the monopoly and added a couple of more concessions was so that Macau would become more attractive to a broader range of people. And that's exactly what's happening, and that's the kind maturity I was talking about. As far as growth rate, Macau is jumping this year. What's happened is growth rate is keeping up with the expansion. The more places are resulting in more business by a lot. That's what we're seeing at least in this first quarter."

There are more questions of foot in this market in America that will impact '11. And I have hair in my head, I'm happy to say and I still have a full head of hair. No, you'll not get any of that from us. I don't see it. I've got more questions than answers. I have more pessimism than I've had before and it's based upon the political environment in which we are living today. And it definitely is impacting Las Vegas. The President of the United States hasn't missed one single opportunity to squelch to Las Vegas. In our particular case, it's cost us millions of dollars from companies affected by the President's remarks that had no connection whatsoever to Federal bailouts. But we get phone calls and I'm not going to mention the names of the companies from Chairman who say we don't want to appear to be profligate because Barack Obama said this or that about Las Vegas. But it's had an effect on us. The hospitality industry in the United States of America as a whole has suffered disproportionately during this recession. Maybe automobile workers got a break, but all of that hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people that work in hotels, restaurants and bars in the United States of America had been totally and completely overlooked. And this abortive rescue attempt that is squandered billions of dollars in the United States. And I'm being very harsh about it and I've got the data to back it up, and so is everybody else in the hospitality industry. The job formation and the kinds of companies that make jobs are under attack in the United States of America. MGM, aside for a moment, last year we created almost 5,000 jobs and immediately became the target of the administration. Businesses that create a job let alone gaming companies that greater jobs had to be no good. It is preposterous that businesses are under attack in the United States of America. Anybody that makes over $250,000 in the form of a personal income tax return is now by, Washington definition, are rich person. When everybody who has got a college degree knows that the personal income tax rate in the United States of America is the business tax of America. Every Subchapter S, every individual proprietorship and every partnership in the United States of America files tax returns as individuals. And when they do, and they showed that they made $2 million or $3 million or God forbid, $4 million. They pay the income tax rate, they deduct their working expenses, they're living expenses and then they invest in a new store, a new shop. And most of the time 25% of their profits ""are tied up in accounts receivable or inventory."" But all of a sudden, all of those people who make over $250,000 are rich folks to be fleeced. And if that's job formation stimulation in America, I'm Mary Poppins. And if I sound angry about it and discussed it, I am disgusted and angry at the apparent ignorance of the administration and the Congress to recognize the fact that the individual tax rate in the United States of America is in fact the business tax of America. And if you keep banging on that, you will destroy the incentive for job formation in the United States of America. And that's simple truth, simple truth. And whether politicians like it or don't like it, means nothing to me. And that's why I'm pessimistic about Las Vegas, because those are our customers. Those people out there hustling there businesses and God forbid, showing that they made a million dollars as a partnership or as an individual. Yes, they're the enemy now. They're the rich folks. Well, until they get over this, Americas in for hard times because what's going to happen is the people that are going to suffer from what's going on are the working class of America. My 15,000 to 20,000 employees, they're the ones that are in trouble. The reason they're in trouble is this demolition of the dollar, is going to reduce the buying power of the working class of America as sure as hell as if we gave them a salary cut of 25%. And that's another thing that doesn't seem to be clear to the brilliant people in Washington DC. They're not just our customers, they are my employees. And until my employees get the drifts of what's being done to them, America's in trouble."

I thought that it would add at least $200 million or $250 million of EBITDA to our bottom line and nothing remotely like that has happened. Of course, it was conceived in a market that was entirely different today, as you've just pointed out. It is a beautiful thing that cost $2.3 billion. Now, we made a certain amount of money last year in Las Vegas. That money -- we made more money than that without Encore, let alone with it. So now you have to ask yourself a question. If we had no Encore, if we didn't have those other 2,000 other rooms, would we have made even less? Or would we just be better off because we did, we would have had $2.3 billion in cash more than we do now. I would love to have the ability to reconsider that decision at the moment, but I don't. I know this that there's a wonderful powerful synergy that we're seeing in people that stay at Encore and love it and come back. They're not paying enough for the rooms to suit me and to suit our pro forma, but neither is that happening anywhere else in America that I know of or in Europe. So would I build Encore if I had to do it today, no, I'd keep my money. Fortunately, we had enough money that we don't sweat it. We had planned that business cycles go up, business cycles go down. Any sophisticated company plans and has built into its capital structure, an ability to survive such a predictable events. So when Encore opened, we were ready. I don't know when Encore's power will kick in at full tilt. I know that when the Beach Club opens up in a few months, that we're going to have a lot more people in Encore than we do now, especially on that side, on the Strip side of the property. And that those tables and those slot machines are going to be much more fully utilized and there's going to be a big profit margin in the Beach Club and the Surrender Nightclub and then the Switch restaurant. And there will be a lot more excitement on the north end of the Strip because of facade and the structure itself that anchor our landholdings here on the Strip. So I'm very happy about what we've added to Encore. But as far as the rooms and what they're doing for us, we're on hold here. And as I said before, I think we're on hold for a while, unless the government in Washington gives the world a message that America -- Lee Kuan Yew, speaking of Singapore, was in the United States and went to visit the President of the United States. Before the day before he went to visit the President, he was on television on Charlie Rose's show. And Charlie Rose asked this brilliant most elder statesman in the world, the man who founded Singapore, he asked Lee Kuan Yew, what about America and what advice would you give the President of the United States. And this sage Mount Rushmore caliber man said on television on PBS, and I'm sure he repeated it in the White House but I wasn't there of course, he said, unless the government and the administration can learn to control government expenditures, they're wildly out of control. The value of the dollar will be decimated and destroyed to the detriment of the people, of the world and the United States in the world. That's what he said. And until we have a signal that such discipline and common sense has regained its footing, I don't know how to answer the kinds of questions that you're asking. And I don't think other any other businessman does either."

What we have to say, I think, is going to be very brief because I think these numbers speak for themselves. We had a wonderful year in China. We always want to point out that the most important thing to recognize when looking at numbers in our business is not so much market share per se. That's a measurement of sort of casino revenue.  What really is important is to look at the yield per table and the profitability per table. And I'm very happy to see that again, for the second or third consecutive year, the profitability and the efficiency of our tables in Macau have continued to climb in spite of the existence of some very fanciful competition that appeared this year. The Macau market is beginning to show some maturity. There are fine buildings that have been opened and are being operated. And as market conditions have improved, I think that the rest of the construction that was started and temporarily halted will now continue. That's all good news as we go forward in having that market be mature. We've happily established a niche for ourselves and I think our EBITDA was over $500 million last year. And although I don't make forward-looking statements as a rule, we're tracking substantially ahead of that the first two months of the year. And we haven't even opened Encore, which is about 60 or 90 days away. I think it went to April 24, on a Wednesday. I think Linda decided that we'll do it in April 24, and that is the most beautiful thing we've ever done. And when that kicks in, we're going to have another little boost in our ability to understand and serve the specific needs of our customers. And our customers are, admittedly, the top end. This building, Encore in Macau, and I'm taking just an extra minute or two to comment on it, is a building that was designed after we had two years of experience to understand the needs of our particular guests that gamble and visit Macau. When we built Wynn Macau and opened it in '06, we had done our very best in pre-opening research and design to have a building that would appeal to what we understood to be that market. And I'm happy to say that we weren't very far off the mark and the success that we have enjoyed is a direct reflection of the fact that we were able to get it right, especially in the wonderful employees that we were able to attract to come work for us. The workforce in Macau is totally delicious. I mean, the people that have come to work for us from Macau, from Mainland China, from the Philippines have the most wonderful desire to be trained and to improve and be successful in their jobs. That's probably been our main asset, it's the people that work for us, which is why we never cut back on salaries or the 13th month, or why we never did any of the other things that some of our competitors have done. Because whether it's in Macau or Las Vegas, our principal asset are our employees, period. And the ones we have now in China are just absolutely over the moon. Wonderful, as far as we're concerned. And we have the organization that's going to be in place to open Encore. I'm happy to say in a few months -- and I think when everybody gets a whiff of that place, they're going to realize that we've set a new standard in hospitality, facilities and the way we present our product. It is by far the best thing that I've been part of and I've been doing this for 40 odd years. It's 414 rooms and suites and I'm very excited about April's opening and can't wait to share it with everybody. So much for Macau. We look forward to a very healthy and exciting 2010 and beyond. I wish I could say the same thing about Las Vegas. But I'm still -- as we have been in the past, unlike some of our competitors who've seen all kinds of glitter and wonderment from just around the corner, I think everybody sort of come clean now that we don't see that. The policies in Washington, policies of government, have taken a terrible toll on the working people in America that come to Las Vegas on the corporations that book conventions and meetings in Las Vegas. I'm afraid to say that I think the outlook for 2010 is very conservative, at least. I don't see any major change in the future. I don't see it getting worse per se, but I do think that unless there is some signal from Washington that they can control the deficit that, not only Las Vegas but the country, it faces dire problems. And I don't see any reason whatsoever to have a speck of confidence in the congress or the administration that's there now. And in the end, Las Vegas is almost a perfect reflection of the national mood. So I'm conservative and guarded about the future of Las Vegas, and I think political leadership has now come home to roost as part of every businessman's conference calls. I mean, imagine that it would be necessary for someone in my position with my job to talk to a group of investors and analysts and have to refer to policies in Washington when discussing the relevance of the quarters that lie ahead. If anybody's got a speck of sophistication, it's listening to my voice now but recognize that, that is, in fact, true. I'll take questions and so will my colleagues who are sitting around the table."

But it's the low end of the range on the VIP side, whereas normalized, it would be $2.85 million, which is a lot of money in Macau. $17 billion of turnover versus $11 billion of turnover last year, volumes are very strong. If you look at the corporate expense side, for full year 2008 we had about $36 million of corporate expense excluding the quarters. Full year '09, closer to $45 million. The difference of roughly a $8 million or $9 million is attributable to one-time payments related to the Macau IPO.

And once again, here is the oldest story in the book when it comes to our company. Capital structure is your salvation. It's capital structure that allows you to hold your head in a down market. I am not forced with my colleagues to juggle my employees or to juggle my customer service levels. There's nothing left to do in my industry except do the basics better. And doing the basics better is what we're all about right now as we tend to our flock in a market that's sort of rough. So we're building a $67 million beach club and a new nightclub to add to our existing nightclubs called Surrender. And we're improving Switch, our restaurant, that will all be integrated into the Encore beach club. And it's going to open up on May 21, we've got 90 days to go. It's right on schedule. And the Encore Beach Club will be -- just as our nightclubs' excess in Tryst have dominated the market, The Encore Beach Club will take this very profitable sector of the market, the alcoholic beverage recreational tumult that goes along with nightclubs. And the margins are fabulous. We have 65% profit margins in these departments, so better than Blackjack in many respects. The Encore Beach Club will take the nightclub mentality into daytime. We've got this gorgeous two-level cabana club that would anchor the north end of our property and liven up this end of the Strip. And you can walk from the cabanas out onto a French balcony and look over the Strip. Or on the inside, the cabanas look down on the pool area, which is integrated with the new nightclub, Surrender, and our restaurant, Switch, which will now have a beautiful terrace dining area. This whole complex, which is on the Strip side of Encore where we originally put up portraiture. Unfortunately, the hotels that were supposed to be built across the street from us at the Frontier site and at the Stardust site have been aborted. And we perceived that they will be aborted for the near and distant future. I don't see anything happening with the Echelon Place project in the near future nor do I see anything happening on the Frontier project. So having a fancy portraiture, which we unfortunately built for Encore, was worthless. Now another company would have to live with that. But because we have such a strong financial statement and because we have the working capital that's necessary to keep us competitive, we take off that unused portraiture and we put something on it that would generate profits in 90 days. And that puts more pressure on our competition, more pressure on every level of our competition. We're about to refurbish our rooms in Wynn because they're five years old. It puts more pressure on our competition because our service levels and the targeted attractiveness of our facilities gets more and more effective. Nothing left to do but the basics better. And that's the story of Wynn Resorts in Las Vegas."

Because I think one of our theories about you going into a market like Pennsylvania, is that -- on the one hand, you want to give a very Wynn experience, a great experience, a great property. On the other hand, it does have a higher tax rate and it's hard to see how you could get a return that you historically have been comfortable with. So how do you balance putting your name on something that might not have sort of the same appeal? And I guess when I look over my history of looking at the industry, there've been times where people have entered Detroit or Pennsylvania or Mississippi where they've overspent and sort of -- how do you balance that or what constraints you? Then the second is, because Steve, you just mentioned that you could put a lot of pressure on your competition, which I agree you could. Can you talk about Vegas pricing? You're certainly leader here on pricing. You could stay at these rates and put pressure on the rest of the Strip. At the same time, again, given what is a superior experience, if you discount for too long, don't you teach your customers that they can get a great experience for half off or whatever the pricing is right now?"

Those buildings were conceived in a different time, but they exist. So does Encore. So we'd make the best of it. I'll tell you one thing, you better damn well have a strong balance sheet if you want to play on this Strip. And we've got one. I think our cash is equal to our debt. And we don't have any current maturities. We have long maturities, low interest rates. We're protected for stormy weather. And this is again -- I said this before, if you don't understand the capital structures, the backbone of your marketing, then you need to go back to business school. We understand that here. We don't need to learn that lesson anew. Now let's go back to Philadelphia, if we can, Steve. I'm building 3,000 slot machines and a bunch of table games and a poker room, Italian restaurant, a steak house, an Asian restaurant because I'm two blocks from a Vietnamese neighborhood, I'm five blocks from Society Hill, I'm in a town with seven universities, I'm about four blocks from the Walt Whitman Bridge, my 14 or 15 acres is on the Delaware River -- and incidentally, Steve, the almost to the foot, the same size as my property in Macau. Two blocks away or four blocks away is Walt Whitman Bridge. On the other side of the bridge is Cherry Hill, New Jersey, all full of my old friends, Italians and Jews and every conceivable stripe of ethnic group that love to shoot crap and gamble. And they're 10 minutes away in their cars or on a bus from my casino on the Delaware River. I love the proximity to these people. I love the proximity to the Vietnamese neighborhood, and I'm going to put in a beautiful Vietnamese restaurant for them. I'm going to build a very pretty place with the help of my Wynn design and development team that is perfectly responsive just to that market and not a bit more over the top than that. But it will look like us. It won't be a slots in a box. I spent some time this past week with a very good friend of mine, Bob Manoukian, who has, it's called, Philadelphia Parks Casino. And Bob was sharing the results of that casino with me. And I assure you, sir, that is not a below-average return on investment. It is a wonderful return on investment because of the low cost of marketing. Now listen, no Gulfstream jets, no helicopters, no nothing. And the table games and the slot wins are allowing, because of the limited amount of machines in the market, for returns that are handsome, much better than we can get in Las Vegas at the present moment. So I'm not concerned about overshooting the mark. I think we can build a lovely single-level, what would appears to be a single-level on the outside, you put the valet parking and the employee parking on grade and then you lift the casino by 12 or 14 feet and you drive up to that on the portraiture so it looks like it's on grade. And then you have two or three levels of parking on either side of the casino so you can walk right into the casino from the garages. And we make this super friendly place for users. And they can run in, gamble for 3 hours and run out, have a great steak or an Italian dinner or noodles or a slice of pizza and it will be just the right lighting and great colors. All those things, all those little things, they've always given us market superiority. We're going to put them to work for the first time in a straightforward casino, not a destination-integrated resort, which involves all those bells and whistles that are so expensive that you're familiar with in the past. So don't misunderstand the assignment that we have or our clear vision of what we have to do. I don't know if that makes you feel any better. Are you owning our stock these days?"

I was talking about the maturing in the sense of the facilities that were available to choices. One of the reasons Las Vegas has been so successful for so many years is the public has had a wonderful menu of choices. Not one hotel but several that were all different and had a variety of options available to tourists. Macau was very limited when it was a monopoly. And then as the years have come by, since the opening of the Sands and then ourselves and the people from Melbourne, and then this past year, the Four Seasons opened, the Sands people opened the Four Seasons and the Melco people opened the City Of Dreams, that's what I meant by maturity. And then here we come with this sexy little thing called Encore. These are wonderful choices. I noticed that business for Chinese New Year was a little softer, even though Baccarat was good last year. And I think one of the reasons is that business exploded for Chinese New Year in Macau. And I think it's because now the choices in China are so wonderful for people that live in South China, they can go to Macau, they don't have to travel all the way to Las Vegas. Now again, we had a very big Baccarat year last year in Las Vegas in spite of everything else. But I'm convinced that the choices that are presenting themselves to people in Asia just as the government intended, the reason they broke the monopoly and added a couple of more concessions was so that Macau would become more attractive to a broader range of people. And that's exactly what's happening, and that's the kind maturity I was talking about. As far as growth rate, Macau is jumping this year. What's happened is growth rate is keeping up with the expansion. The more places are resulting in more business by a lot. That's what we're seeing at least in this first quarter."

I don't think anybody in America is arguing. There's a furiousness in the country about the irresponsibility. $100 million a month we're supposed to borrow, $100 billion a month we're supposed to borrow for the next five or six years. Why it's totally unsustainable. It's lunacy. I remember the Lexus-Totoca [ph] bill, I think it was around 1909, the great political philosopher from France wrote, ""The American's system of democracy will thrive until that moment when the politicians discover they can bribe the electorate with their own money.""

We raise our money before we break ground so that when we do start to build it, we have all of our money together.

It is totally irresponsible and naive for anybody to say based upon this slight trend we project this infinitely into the future and give you some rosy baloney story about what's going to happen in '11. And I am warning my investors that maybe on the call to the extent that you hear any of that from our competitors, beware. There are more questions afoot in this market in America that will impact '11. And I have hair in my head, I'm happy to say and I still have a full head of hair. No, you'll not get any of that from us. I don't see it. I've got more questions than answers. I have more pessimism than I've had before and it's based upon the political environment in which we are living today. And it definitely is impacting Las Vegas. The President of the United States hasn't missed one single opportunity to squelch Las Vegas. In our particular case, it's cost us millions of dollars from companies affected by the President's remarks that had no connection whatsoever to Federal bailouts. But we get phone calls and I'm not going to mention the names of the companies from Chairman who say we don't want to appear to be profligate because Barack Obama said this or that about Las Vegas. But it's had an effect on us. The hospitality industry in the United States of America as a whole has suffered disproportionately during this recession. Maybe automobile workers got a break, but all of that hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people that work in hotels, restaurants and bars in the United States of America had been totally and completely overlooked. And this abortive rescue attempt that is squandered billions of dollars in the United States. And I'm being very harsh about it and I've got the data to back it up, and so is everybody else in the hospitality industry. The job formation and the kinds of companies that make jobs are under attack in the United States of America. MGM, aside for a moment, last year we created almost 5,000 jobs and immediately became the target of the administration. Businesses that created jobs, let alone gaming companies that created jobs had to be no good. It is preposterous that businesses are under attack in the United States of America. Anybody that makes over $250,000 in the form of a personal income tax return is now by, Washington definition, a rich person. When everybody who has got a college degree knows that the personal income tax rate in the United States of America is the business tax of America. Every Subchapter S, every individual proprietorship and every partnership in the United States of America files tax returns as individuals. And when they do, and they showed that they made $2 million or $3 million or God forbid, $4 million. They pay the income tax rate, they deduct their working expenses, they're living expenses and then they invest in a new store, a new shop. And most of the time 25% of their profits ""are tied up in accounts receivable or inventory."" But all of a sudden, all of those people who make over $250,000 are rich folks to be fleeced. And if that's job formation stimulation in America, I'm Mary Poppins. And if I sound angry about it and disgusted, I am disgusted and angry at the apparent ignorance of the administration and the Congress to recognize the fact that the individual tax rate in the United States of America is in fact the business tax of America. And if you keep banging on that, you will destroy the incentive for job formation in the United States of America. And that's simple truth, simple truth. And whether politicians like it or don't like it, means nothing to me. And that's why I'm pessimistic about Las Vegas, because those are our customers. Those people out there hustling their businesses and God forbid, showing that they made a million dollars as a partnership or as an individual. Yes, they're the enemy now. They're the rich folks. Well, until we get over this, America's in for hard times because what's going to happen is the people that are going to suffer from what's going on are the working class of America. My 15,000 to 20,000 employees, they're the ones that are in trouble. The reason they're in trouble is this demolition of the dollar, is going to reduce the buying power of the working class of America as sure as hell as if we gave them a salary cut of 25%. And that's another thing that doesn't seem to be clear to the brilliant people in Washington DC. They're not just our customers, they are my employees. And until my employees get the drifts of what's being done to them, America's in trouble."

I thought that it would add at least $200 million or $250 million of EBITDA to our bottom line and nothing remotely like that has happened. Of course, it was conceived in a market that was entirely different today, as you've just pointed out. It is a beautiful thing that cost $2.3 billion. Now, we made a certain amount of money last year in Las Vegas. That money -- we made more money than that without Encore, let alone with it. So now you have to ask yourself a question. If we had no Encore, if we didn't have those other 2,000 other rooms, would we have made even less? Or would we just be better off because we did, we would have had $2.3 billion in cash more than we do now. I would love to have the ability to reconsider that decision at the moment, but I don't. I know this that there's a wonderful powerful synergy that we're seeing in people that stay at Encore and love it and come back. They're not paying enough for the rooms to suit me and to suit our pro forma, but neither is that happening anywhere else in America that I know of or in Europe. So would I build Encore if I had to do it today, no, I'd keep my money. Fortunately, we had enough money that we don't sweat it. We had planned that business cycles go up, business cycles go down. Any sophisticated company plans and has built into its capital structure, an ability to survive such a predictable events. So when Encore opened, we were ready. I don't know when Encore's power will kick in at full tilt. I know that when the Beach Club opens up in a few months, that we're going to have a lot more people in Encore than we do now, especially on that side, on the Strip side of the property. And that those tables and those slot machines are going to be much more fully utilized and there's going to be a big profit margin in the Beach Club and the Surrender Nightclub and then the Switch restaurant. And there will be a lot more excitement on the north end of the Strip because of facade and the structure itself that anchor our landholdings here on the Strip. So I'm very happy about what we've added to Encore. But as far as the rooms and what they're doing for us, we're on hold here. And as I said before, I think we're on hold for a while, unless the government in Washington gives the world a message that America -- Lee Kuan Yew, speaking of Singapore, was in the United States and went to visit the President of the United States. Before the day before he went to visit the President, he was on television on Charlie Rose's show. And Charlie Rose asked this brilliant most elder statesman in the world, the man who founded Singapore, he asked Lee Kuan Yew, what about America and what advice would you give the President of the United States. And this sage Mount Rushmore caliber man said on television on PBS, and I'm sure he repeated it in the White House but I wasn't there of course, he said, unless the government and the administration can learn to control government expenditures, they're wildly out of control. The value of the dollar will be decimated and destroyed to the detriment of the people, of the world and the United States in the world. That's what he said. And until we have a signal that such discipline and common sense has regained its footing, I don't know how to answer the kinds of questions that you're asking. And I don't think other any other businessman does either."

What we have to say, I think, is going to be very brief because I think these numbers speak for themselves. We had a wonderful year in China. We always want to point out that the most important thing to recognize when looking at numbers in our business is not so much market share per se. That's a measurement of, sort of, casino revenue.  What really is important is to look at the yield per table and the profitability per table. And I'm very happy to see that again, for the second or third consecutive year, the profitability and the efficiency of our tables in Macau have continued to climb in spite of the existence of some very fanciful competition that appeared this year. The Macau market is beginning to show some maturity. There are fine buildings that have been opened and are being operated. And as market conditions have improved, I think that the rest of the construction that was started and temporarily halted will now continue. That's all good news as we go forward in having that market be mature. We've happily established a niche for ourselves and I think our EBITDA was over $500 million last year. And although I don't make forward-looking statements as a rule, we're tracking substantially ahead of that the first two months of the year. And we haven't even opened Encore, which is about 60 or 90 days away. I think we'll do April 24, on a Wednesday. I think Linda decided that we'll do it in April 24, and that is the most beautiful thing we've ever done. And when that kicks in, we're going to have another little boost in our ability to understand and serve the specific needs of our customers. And our customers are, admittedly, the top end. This building, Encore in Macau, and I'm taking just an extra minute or two to comment on it, is a building that was designed after we had two years of experience, to understand the needs of our particular guests that gamble and visit Macau. When we built Wynn Macau and opened it in '06, we had done our very best in pre-opening research and design to have a building that would appeal to what we understood to be that market. And I'm happy to say that we weren't very far off the mark. And the success that we have enjoyed is a direct reflection of the fact that we were able to get it right, especially in the wonderful employees that we were able to attract to come work for us. The workforce in Macau is totally delicious. I mean, the people that have come to work for us from Macau, from Mainland China, from the Philippines, have the most wonderful desire to be trained and to improve and be successful in their jobs. That's probably been our main asset, is the people that work for us which is why we never cut back on salaries or the 13th month, or why we never did any of the other things that some of our competitors have done. Because whether it's in Macau or Las Vegas, our principal asset are our employees, period. And the ones we have now in China are just absolutely over the moon, wonderful, as far as we're concerned. And we have the organization that's going to be in place to open Encore. I'm happy to say in a few months, and I think when everybody gets a whiff of that place, they're going to realize that we've set a new standard in hospitality, facilities and the way we present our product. It is, by far, the best thing that I've been part of and I've been doing this for 40-odd years. It's 414 rooms and suites and I'm very excited about April's opening and can't wait to share it with everybody. So much for Macau. We look forward to a very healthy and exciting 2010 and beyond. I wish I could say the same thing about Las Vegas. But I'm still -- as we have been in the past, unlike some of our competitors who've seen all kinds of glitter and wonderment, or just around the corner, I think everybody sort of come clean now that we don't see that. The policies in Washington, policies of government, have taken a terrible toll on the working people in America that come to Las Vegas on the corporations that book conventions and meetings in Las Vegas. I'm afraid to say that I think the outlook for 2010 is very conservative, at least. I don't see any major change in the future. I don't see it getting worse per se, but I do think that unless there is some signal from Washington that they can control the deficit that, not only Las Vegas but the country, faces dire problems. And I don't see any reason whatsoever to have a speck of confidence in the Congress or the administration that's there now. And in the end, Las Vegas is almost a perfect reflection of the national mood. So I'm conservative and guarded about the future of Las Vegas. And I think political leadership has now come home to roost as part of every businessman's conference calls. I mean, imagine that it would be necessary for someone in my position, with my job, to talk to a group of investors and analysts and have to refer to policies in Washington when discussing the relevance of the quarters that lie ahead. But if anybody's got a speck of sophistication, it's listening to my voice now but recognize that, that is, in fact, true. I'll take questions and so will my colleagues who are sitting around the table."

But it's the low end of the range on the VIP side, whereas normalized, it would be $2.85 million, which is a lot of money in Macau. $17 billion of turnover versus $11 billion of turnover last year, volumes are very strong. If you look at the corporate expense side, for full year 2008 we had about $36 million of corporate expense excluding the quarters. Full year '09, closer to $45 million. The difference of roughly a $8 million or $9 million is attributable to one-time payments related to the Macau IPO. So 2009 corporate expenses would've been roughly flat with 2008 outside of those one-time expenses."

One of the things that has been really cute about this business of quarterly conference calls is sort of a game of cat and mouse about credit.

And once again, here is the oldest story in the book when it comes to our company. Capital structure is your salvation. It's capital structure that allows you to hold your head in a down market. I am not forced with my colleagues to juggle my employees or to juggle my customer service levels. There's nothing left to do in my industry except do the basics better. And doing the basics better is what we're all about right now as we tend to our flock in a market that's sort of rough. So we're building a $67 million beach club and a new nightclub to add to our existing nightclubs called Surrender. And we're improving Switch, our restaurant, that will all be integrated into the Encore beach club. And it's going to open up on May 21, we've got 90 days to go. It's right on schedule. And the Encore Beach Club will be -- just as our nightclubs' excess in Tryst have dominated the market, The Encore Beach Club will take this very profitable sector of the market, the alcoholic beverage recreational tumult that goes along with nightclubs. And the margins are fabulous. We have 65% profit margins in these departments, so better than Blackjack in many respects. The Encore Beach Club will take the nightclub mentality into daytime. We've got this gorgeous two-level cabana club that would anchor the north end of our property and liven up this end of the Strip. And you can walk from the cabanas out on to a French balcony and look over the Strip. Or on the inside, the cabanas look down on the pool area, which is integrated with the new nightclub, Surrender, and our restaurant, Switch, which will now have a beautiful terrace dining area. This whole complex, which is on the Strip side of Encore, where we originally put a porte-cochere, unfortunately, the hotels that were supposed to be built across the street from us at the Frontier site and at the Stardust site have been aborted. And we perceived that they will be aborted for the near and distant future. I don't see anything happening with the Echelon Place project in the near future nor do I see anything happening on the Frontier project. So having a fancy porte-cochere, which we unfortunately built for Encore, was worthless. Now another company would have to live with that. Because we have such a strong financial statement and because we have the working capital that's necessary to keep us competitive, we take off that unused porte-cochere and we put something on it that would generate profits in 90 days. And that puts more pressure on our competition, more pressure on every level of our competition. We're about to refurbish our rooms in Wynn because they're five years old. It puts more pressure on our competition because our service levels and the targeted attractiveness of our facilities gets more and more effective. Nothing left to do but the basics better. And that's the story of Wynn Resorts in Las Vegas."

Because I think one of our theories about you going into a market like Pennsylvania, is that -- on the one hand, you want to give a very Wynn experience, a great experience, a great property, on the other hand, it does have a higher tax rate and it's hard to see how you could get a return that you historically have been comfortable with. So how do you balance putting your name on something that might not have sort of the same appeal? And I guess when I look over my history of looking at the industry, there've been times where people have entered Detroit or Pennsylvania or Mississippi, where they've overspent and sort of -- how do you balance that or what constraints you?

Those buildings were conceived in a different time, but they exist. So does Encore. So we'd make the best of it. I'll tell you one thing, you better damn well have a strong balance sheet if you want to play on this Strip. And we've got one. I think our cash is equal to our debt. And we don't have any current maturities. We have long maturities, low interest rates. We're protected for a stormy weather. And this is again -- I said this before, if you don't understand the capital structures, the backbone of your marketing, then you need to go back to business school. We understand that here. We don't need to learn that lesson anew. Now let's go back to Philadelphia, if we can, Steve. I'm building 3,000 slot machines and a bunch of table games and a poker room, Italian restaurant, a steak house, an Asian restaurant, because I'm two blocks from a Vietnamese neighborhood. I'm five blocks from Society Hill. I'm in a town with seven universities. I'm about four blocks from the Walt Whitman Bridge. My 14 or 15 acres is on the Delaware River, incidentally, Steve, the -- almost to the foot, the same size as my property in Macau. Two blocks away or four blocks away is Walt Whitman Bridge. On the other side of the bridge is Cherry Hill, New Jersey. All full of my old friends, Italians and Jews and every conceivable stripe of ethnic group that love to shoot crap and gamble. And they're 10 minutes away in their cars or on a bus from my casino on the Delaware River. I love the proximity to these people. I love the proximity to the Vietnamese neighborhood. And I'm going to put in a beautiful Vietnamese restaurant for them. I'm going to build a very pretty place with the help of my Wynn design and development team that is perfectly responsive just to that market and not a bit more over the top than that. But it will look like us. It won't be a slots in a box. I spent some time this past week with a very good friend of mine, Bob Manoukian, who has, it's called, Philadelphia Parks Casino. And Bob was sharing the results of that casino with me. And I assure you, sir, that, that is not a below-average return on investment. It is a wonderful return on investment because of the low cost of marketing. Listen, no Gulfstream jets, no helicopters, no nothing. And the table games and the slot wins are allowing, because of the limited amount of machines in the market, for returns that are handsome, much better than we can get in Las Vegas at the present moment. So I'm not concerned about overshooting the mark. I think we can build a lovely single level, what would appears to be a single level on the outside, you put the valet parking and the employee parking on grade and then you lift the casino by 12 or 14 feet and you drive up to that on the porte-cochere so it looks like it's on grade. And then you have two or three levels of parking on either side of the casino so you can walk right into the casino from the garages. And we make this super-friendly place for users. And they can run in, gamble for 3 hours and run out, have a great steak or an Italian dinner or noodles or a slice of pizza and it'll be just the right lighting and great colors. All those things, all those little things, that have always given us market superiority.

I was talking about the maturing in the sense of the facilities that were available to choices. One of the reasons Las Vegas has been so successful for so many years is the public has had a wonderful menu of choices. Not one hotel but several that were all different and had a variety of options available to tourists. Macau was very limited when it was a monopoly. And then as the years have come by, since the opening of the Sands and then ourselves and the people from Melbourne, and then this past year, the Four Seasons opened, from -- the Sands people opened the Four Seasons and the Melco people opened the City Of Dreams. That's what I meant by maturity. And then here we come with this sexy little thing called Encore. These are wonderful choices. I noticed that the business for Chinese New Year was a little softer, even though Baccarat was good last year. And I think one of the reasons is that business exploded for Chinese New Year in Macau. And I think it's because now the choices in China are so wonderful for people that live in South China, they can go to Macau, they don't have to travel all the way to Las Vegas. Now again, we had a very big Baccarat year last year in Las Vegas in spite of everything else. But I'm convinced that the choices that are presenting themselves to people in Asia just as the government intended, the reason they broke the monopoly and added a couple more concessions was so that Macau would become more attractive to a broader range of people. And that's exactly what's happening. And that's the kind maturity I was talking about. As far as growth rate, Macau is jumping this year. What's happened is growth rate is keeping up with the expansion. The more places are resulting in more business by a lot. That's what we're seeing, at least, this first quarter."

But we get phone calls and I'm not going to mention the names of the companies from Chairman who say we don't want to appear to be profligate because Barack Obama said this or that about Las Vegas. But it's had an effect on us. The hospitality industry in the United States of America as a whole has suffered disproportionately during this recession. Maybe automobile workers got a break, but all of that hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people that work in hotels, restaurants and bars in the United States of America had been totally and completely overlooked. And this abortive rescue attempt that is squandered billions of dollars in the United States. And I'm being very harsh about it and I've got the data to back it up, and so is everybody else in the hospitality industry. The job formation and the kinds of companies that make jobs are under attack in the United States of America. MGM, aside for a moment, last year we created almost 5,000 jobs and immediately became the target of the administration. Businesses that created jobs, let alone gaming companies that created jobs had to be no good. It is preposterous that businesses are under attack in the United States of America. Anybody that makes over $250,000 in the form of a personal income tax return is now by, Washington definition, a rich person. When everybody who has got a college degree knows that the personal income tax rate in the United States of America is the business tax of America. Every Subchapter S, every individual proprietorship and every partnership in the United States of America files tax returns as individuals. And when they do, and they showed that they made $2 million or $3 million or God forbid, $4 million. They pay the income tax rate, they deduct their working expenses, they're living expenses and then they invest in a new store, a new shop. And most of the time 25% of their profits ""are tied up in accounts receivable or inventory."" But all of a sudden, all of those people who make over $250,000 are rich folks to be fleeced. And if that's job formation stimulation in America, I'm Mary Poppins. And if I sound angry about it and disgusted, I am disgusted and angry at the apparent ignorance of the administration and the Congress to recognize the fact that the individual tax rate in the United States of America is in fact the business tax of America. And if you keep banging on that, you will destroy the incentive for job formation in the United States of America. And that's simple truth, simple truth. And whether politicians like it or don't like it, means nothing to me. And that's why I'm pessimistic about Las Vegas, because those are our customers. Those people out there hustling their businesses and God forbid, showing that they made a million dollars as a partnership or as an individual. Yes, they're the enemy now. They're the rich folks. Well, until we get over this, America's in for hard times because what's going to happen is the people that are going to suffer from what's going on are the working class of America. My 15,000, 20,000 employees, they are the ones that are in trouble. The reason they're in trouble is this demolition of the dollar, is going to reduce the buying power of the working class of America as sure as hell as if we gave them a salary cut of 25%. And that's another thing that doesn't seem to be clear to the brilliant people in Washington, D.C. They're not just our customers, they are my employees. And until my employees get the drift of what's being done to them, America's in trouble."

I thought that it would add at least $200 million or $250 million of EBITDA to our bottom line and nothing remotely like that has happened. Of course, it was conceived in a market that was entirely different today, as you've just pointed out. It is a beautiful thing that cost $2.3 billion. Now we made a certain amount of money last year in Las Vegas. That money -- we made more money than that without Encore, let alone with it. So now you have to ask yourself a question. If we had no Encore, if we didn't have those other 2,000 other rooms, would we have made even less? Or would we just be better off because we did, we would have had $2.3 billion in cash more than we do now. I would love to have the ability to reconsider that decision at the moment, but I don't. I know this, that there's a wonderful powerful synergy that we're seeing in people that stay at Encore and love it and come back. They're not paying enough for the rooms to suit me and to suit our pro forma, but neither is that happening anywhere else in America that I know of or in Europe. So would I build Encore if I had to do it today, no, I'd keep my money. Fortunately, we had enough money that we don't sweat it. We have planned that -- business cycles go up, business cycles go down. Any sophisticated company plans and has, built into its capital structure, an ability to survive such unpredictable events. So when Encore opened, we were ready. I don't know when Encore's power will kick in at full tilt. I know that when the Beach Club opens up in a few months, that we're going to have a lot more people in Encore than we do now, especially on that side, on the Strip side of the property. And that those tables and those slot machines are going to be much more fully utilized and there's going to be a big profit margin in the Beach Club than in the Surrender Nightclub and in the Switch restaurant. And there'll be a lot more excitement on the north end of the Strip because of the facades and the structure itself that anchor our landholdings here on the Strip. So I'm very happy about what we've added to Encore. But as far as the rooms and what they're doing for us, we're on hold here. And as I said before, I think we're on hold for a while, unless the government in Washington gives the world a message that America -- Lee Kuan Yew, speaking of Singapore, was in the United States and went to visit the President of the United States. Before -- the day before he went to visit the President, he was on television on Charlie Rose's show. And Charlie Rose asked this brilliant, most-elder statesman in the world, the man who founded Singapore, he asked Lee Kuan Yew, "" What about America and what advice would you give the President of the United States?"" And this sage Mount-Rushmore-caliber man said on television on PBS, and I'm sure he repeated it in the White House but I wasn't there of course, he said, ""Unless the government and the administration can learn to control government expenditures, they're wildly out of control, the value of the dollar will be decimated and destroyed to the detriment of the people, of the world and the United States and the world."" That's what he said. And until we have a signal that such discipline and common sense has regained its footing, I don't know how to answer the kinds of questions that you're asking. And I don't think any other businessman does, either."

What we have to say, I think, is going to be very brief because I think these numbers speak for themselves. We had a wonderful year in China. We always want to point out that the most important thing to recognize when looking at numbers in our business is not so much market share per se. That's a measurement of, sort of, casino revenue.  What really is important is to look at the yield per table and the profitability per table. And I'm very happy to see that again, for the second or third consecutive year, the profitability and the efficiency of our tables in Macau have continued to climb in spite of the existence of some very fanciful competition that appeared this year. The Macau market is beginning to show some maturity. There are fine buildings that have been opened and are being operated. And as market conditions have improved, I think that the rest of the construction that was started and temporarily halted will now continue. That's all good news as we go forward in having that market be mature. We've happily established a niche for ourselves and I think our EBITDA was over $500 million last year. And although I don't make forward-looking statements as a rule, we're tracking substantially ahead of that the first two months of the year. And we haven't even opened Encore, which is about 60 or 90 days away. I think we'll do April 24, on a Wednesday. I think Linda decided that we'll do it in April 24, and that is the most beautiful thing we've ever done. And when that kicks in, we're going to have another little boost in our ability to understand and serve the specific needs of our customers. And our customers are, admittedly, the top end. This building, Encore in Macau, and I'm taking just an extra minute or two to comment on it, is a building that was designed after we had two years of experience, to understand the needs of our particular guests that gamble and visit Macau. When we built Wynn Macau and opened it in '06, we had done our very best in pre-opening research and design to have a building that would appeal to what we understood to be that market. And I'm happy to say that we weren't very far off the mark. And the success that we have enjoyed is a direct reflection of the fact that we were able to get it right, especially in the wonderful employees that we were able to attract to come work for us. The workforce in Macau is totally delicious. I mean, the people that have come to work for us from Macau, from Mainland China, from the Philippines, have the most wonderful desire to be trained and to improve and be successful in their jobs. That's probably been our main asset, is the people that work for us, which is why we never cut back on salaries or the 13th month, or why we never did any of the other things that some of our competitors have done. Because whether it's in Macau or Las Vegas, our principal asset are our employees, period. And the ones we have now in China are just absolutely over the moon, wonderful, as far as we're concerned. And we have the organization that's going to be in place to open Encore. I'm happy to say in a few months, and I think when everybody gets a whiff of that place, they're going to realize that we've set a new standard in hospitality, facilities and the way we present our product. It is, by far, the best thing that I've been part of and I've been doing this for 40-odd years. It's 414 rooms and suites and I'm very excited about April's opening and can't wait to share it with everybody. So much for Macau. We look forward to a very healthy and exciting 2010 and beyond. I wish I could say the same thing about Las Vegas. But I'm still -- as we have been in the past, unlike some of our competitors who've seen all kinds of glitter and wonderment, or just around the corner, I think everybody's sort of come clean now that we don't see that. The policies in Washington, policies of government, have taken a terrible toll on the working people in America that come to Las Vegas on the corporations that book conventions and meetings in Las Vegas. I'm afraid to say that I think the outlook for 2010 is very conservative, at least. I don't see any major change in the future. I don't see it getting worse per se, but I do think that unless there is some signal from Washington that they can control the deficits that, not only Las Vegas but the country, faces dire problems. And I don't see any reason whatsoever to have a speck of confidence in the Congress or the administration that's there now. And in the end, Las Vegas is almost a perfect reflection of the national mood. So I'm conservative and guarded about the future of Las Vegas. And I think political leadership has now come home to roost as part of every businessman's conference calls. I mean, imagine that it would be necessary for someone in my position, with my job, to talk to a group of investors and analysts and have to refer to policies in Washington when discussing the relevance of the quarters that lie ahead. But if anybody's got a speck of sophistication, it's listening to my voice now but recognize that, that is, in fact, true. I'll take questions and so will my colleagues who are sitting around the table."

If we had been in the midpoint of our range, that would've been approximately $15 million of additional EBITDA, had we held 22%. In Macau, you'll notice we only held $2.7 million, which is at the low end of our range, so I'll normalize it for you. But it's the low end of the range on the VIP side, whereas normalized, it would be $2.85 million, which is a lot of money in Macau. $17 billion of turnover versus $11 billion of turnover last year, volumes are very strong. If you look at the corporate expense side, for full year 2008 we had about $36 million of corporate expense excluding the quarters. Full year '09, closer to $45 million. The difference of roughly a $8 million or $9 million is attributable to one-time payments related to the Macau IPO. So 2009 corporate expenses would've been roughly flat with 2008 outside of those one-time expenses."

I know who's on this call so I'm going to talk of all them including my competitors. One of the things that has been really cute about this business of quarterly conference calls is sort of a game of cat and mouse about credit. This company, Wynn Resorts, has a policy that originates in our audit committee, that is consistent with Sarbanes-Oxley, that is iron-fisted tough about the credit, credit reserves and credit accountability. And you've noticed that in my, I think, almost 40 odd years of experience, we've never had a special charge. It wasn't reserved in advance. That's the result of very, very tough cold-blooded assessment of credit when we issue it and when we create our original reserves.

And once again, here is the oldest story in the book when it comes to our company. Capital structure is your salvation. It's capital structure that allows you to hold your head in a down market. I am not forced with my colleagues to juggle my employees or to juggle my customer service levels. There's nothing left to do in my industry except do the basics better. And doing the basics better is what we're all about right now as we tend to our flock in a market that's sort of rough. So we're building a $67 million beach club and a new nightclub to add to our existing nightclubs called Surrender. And we're improving Switch, our restaurant, that will all be integrated into the Encore beach club. And it's going to open up on May 21, we've got 90 days to go. It's right on schedule. And the Encore Beach Club will be -- just as our nightclubs' excess in Tryst have dominated the market, The Encore Beach Club will take this very profitable sector of the market, the alcoholic beverage recreational tumult that goes along with nightclubs. And the margins are fabulous. We have 65% profit margins in these departments, so better than Blackjack in many respects. The Encore Beach Club will take the nightclub mentality into daytime. We've got this gorgeous two-level cabana club that would anchor the north end of our property and liven up this end of the Strip. And you can walk from the cabanas out on to a French balcony and look over the Strip. Or on the inside, the cabanas look down on the pool area, which is integrated with the new nightclub, Surrender, and our restaurant, Switch, which will now have a beautiful terrace dining area. This whole complex, which is on the Strip side of Encore, where we originally put a porte-cochere, unfortunately, the hotels that were supposed to be built across the street from us at the Frontier site and at the Stardust site have been aborted. And we perceived that they will be aborted for the near and distant future. I don't see anything happening with the Echelon Place project in the near future nor do I see anything happening on the Frontier project. So having a fancy porte-cochere, which we unfortunately built for Encore, was worthless. Now another company would have to live with that. Because we have such a strong financial statement and because we have the working capital that's necessary to keep us competitive, we take off that unused porte-cochere and we put something on it that would generate profits in 90 days. And that puts more pressure on our competition, more pressure on every level of our competition. We're about to refurbish our rooms in Wynn because they're five years old. It puts more pressure on our competition because our service levels and the targeted attractiveness of our facilities gets more and more effective. Nothing left to do but the basics better. And that's the story of Wynn Resorts in Las Vegas."

Because I think one of our theories about you going into a market like Pennsylvania, is that -- on the one hand, you want to give a very Wynn experience, a great experience, a great property, on the other hand, it does have a higher tax rate and it's hard to see how you could get a return that you historically have been comfortable with. So how do you balance putting your name on something that might not have sort of the same appeal? And I guess when I look over my history of looking at the industry, there've been times where people have entered Detroit or Pennsylvania or Mississippi, where they have overspent and sort of -- how do you balance that or what constraints you? Then the second thing is, because Steve you just mentioned that you could put a lot of pressure on your competition, which I agree you could, can you talk about Vegas pricing? You're certainly the leader here on pricing. You could stay at these rates and put pressure on the rest of the Strip.

Those buildings were conceived in a different time, but they exist. So does Encore. So we'd make the best of it. I'll tell you one thing, you better damn well have a strong balance sheet if you want to play on this Strip. And we've got one. I think our cash is equal to our debt. And we don't have any current maturities. We have long maturities, low interest rates. We're protected for a stormy weather. And this is again -- I said this before, if you don't understand the capital structures, the backbone of your marketing, then you need to go back to business school. We understand that here. We don't need to learn that lesson anew. Now let's go back to Philadelphia, if we can, Steve. I'm building 3,000 slot machines and a bunch of table games and a poker room, Italian restaurant, a steak house, an Asian restaurant, because I'm two blocks from a Vietnamese neighborhood. I'm five blocks from Society Hill. I'm in a town with seven universities. I'm about four blocks from the Walt Whitman Bridge. My 14 or 15 acres is on the Delaware River, incidentally, Steve, the -- almost to the foot, the same size as my property in Macau. Two blocks away or four blocks away is Walt Whitman Bridge. On the other side of the bridge is Cherry Hill, New Jersey. All full of my old friends, Italians and Jews and every conceivable stripe of ethnic group that love to shoot crap and gamble. And they're 10 minutes away in their cars or on a bus from my casino on the Delaware River. I love the proximity to these people. I love the proximity to the Vietnamese neighborhood. And I'm going to put in a beautiful Vietnamese restaurant for them. I'm going to build a very pretty place with the help of my Wynn design and development team that is perfectly responsive just to that market and not a bit more over the top than that. But it will look like us. It won't be a slots in a box. I spent some time this past week with a very good friend of mine, Bob Manoukian, who has, it's called, Philadelphia -- now Parx Casino. And Bob was sharing the results of that casino with me. And I assure you, sir, that, that is not a below-average return on investment. It is a wonderful return on investment because of the low cost of marketing. Listen, no Gulfstream jets, no helicopters, no nothing. And the table games and the slot wins are allowing, because of the limited amount of machines in the market, for returns that are handsome, much better than we can get in Las Vegas at the present moment. So I'm not concerned about overshooting the mark. I think we can build a lovely single level, what would appears to be a single level on the outside, you put the valet parking and the employee parking on grade and then you lift the casino by 12 or 14 feet and you drive up to that on the porte-cochere so it looks like it's on grade. And then you have two or three levels of parking on either side of the casino so you can walk right into the casino from the garages. And we make this super-friendly place for users. And they can run in, gamble for 3 hours and run out, have a great steak or an Italian dinner or noodles or a slice of pizza and it'll be just the right lighting and great colors. All those things, all those little things, that have always given us market superiority. We're going to put them to work for the first time in a straightforward casino, not a destination-integrated resort, which involves all those bells and whistles that are so expensive that you're familiar with in the past. So don't misunderstand the assignment that we have or our clear vision of what we have to do. I don't know if that makes you feel any better. Are you owning our stock these days?"

And if another regional opportunity presents itself that we understand, we will jump on it, because we got the capital and the experience to do so."

I was talking about the maturing in the sense of the facilities that were available to choices. One of the reasons Las Vegas has been so successful for so many years is the public has had a wonderful menu of choices. Not one hotel but several that were all different and had a variety of options available to tourists. Macau was very limited when it was a monopoly. And then as the years have come by, since the opening of the Sands and then ourselves and the people from Melbourne, and then this past year, the Four Seasons opened, from -- the Sands people opened the Four Seasons and the Melco people opened the City Of Dreams. That's what I meant by maturity. And then here we come with this sexy little thing called Encore. These are wonderful choices. I noticed that the business for Chinese New Year was a little softer, even though Baccarat was good last year. And I think one of the reasons is that business exploded for Chinese New Year in Macau. And I think it's because now the choices in China are so wonderful for people that live in South China, they can go to Macau, they don't have to travel all the way to Las Vegas. Now again, we had a very big Baccarat year last year in Las Vegas in spite of everything else. But I'm convinced that the choices that are presenting themselves to people in Asia just as the government intended, the reason they broke the monopoly and added a couple more concessions was so that Macau would become more attractive to a broader range of people. And that's exactly what's happening. And that's the kind maturity I was talking about. As far as growth rate, Macau is jumping this year. What's happened is growth rate is keeping up with the expansion. The more places are resulting in more business by a lot. That's what we're seeing, at least, this first quarter."

It is totally irresponsible and naive for anybody to say based upon this slight trend we project this infinitely into the future and give you some rosy baloney story about what's going to happen in '11. And I am warning my investors that maybe on the call to the extent that you hear any of that from our competitors, beware. There are more questions afoot in this market in America that will impact '11. And I have hair in my head, I'm happy to say and I still have a full head of hair. No, you'll not get any of that from us. I don't see it. I've got more questions than answers. I have more pessimism than I've had before and it's based upon the political environment in which we are living today. And it definitely is impacting Las Vegas. The President of the United States hasn't missed one single opportunity to squelch Las Vegas. In our particular case, it's cost us millions of dollars from companies affected by the President's remarks that had no connection whatsoever to Federal bailouts. But we get phone calls and I'm not going to mention the names of the companies from Chairman who say we don't want to appear to be profligate because Barack Obama said this or that about Las Vegas. But it's had an effect on us. The hospitality industry in the United States of America as a whole has suffered disproportionately during this recession. Maybe automobile workers got a break, but all of that hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people that work in hotels, restaurants and bars in the United States of America had been totally and completely overlooked. And this abortive rescue attempt that is squandered billions of dollars in the United States. And I'm being very harsh about it and I've got the data to back it up, and so is everybody else in the hospitality industry. The job formation and the kinds of companies that make jobs are under attack in the United States of America. MGM, aside for a moment, last year we created almost 5,000 jobs and immediately became the target of the administration. Businesses that created jobs, let alone gaming companies that created jobs had to be no good. It is preposterous that businesses are under attack in the United States of America. Anybody that makes over $250,000 in the form of a personal income tax return is now by, Washington definition, a rich person. When everybody who has got a college degree knows that the personal income tax rate in the United States of America is the business tax of America. Every Subchapter S, every individual proprietorship and every partnership in the United States of America files tax returns as individuals. And when they do, and they showed that they made $2 million or $3 million or God forbid, $4 million. They pay the income tax rate, they deduct their working expenses, they're living expenses and then they invest in a new store, a new shop. And most of the time 25% of their profits ""are tied up in accounts receivable or inventory."" But all of a sudden, all of those people who make over $250,000 are rich folks to be fleeced. And if that's job formation stimulation in America, I'm Mary Poppins. And if I sound angry about it and disgusted, I am disgusted and angry at the apparent ignorance of the administration and the Congress to recognize the fact that the individual tax rate in the United States of America is in fact the business tax of America. And if you keep banging on that, you will destroy the incentive for job formation in the United States of America. And that's simple truth, simple truth. And whether politicians like it or don't like it, means nothing to me. And that's why I'm pessimistic about Las Vegas, because those are our customers. Those people out there hustling their businesses and God forbid, showing that they made a million dollars as a partnership or as an individual. Yes, they're the enemy now. They're the rich folks. Well, until we get over this, America's in for hard times because what's going to happen is the people that are going to suffer from what's going on are the working class of America. My 15,000, 20,000 employees, they are the ones that are in trouble. The reason they're in trouble is this demolition of the dollar, is going to reduce the buying power of the working class of America as sure as hell as if we gave them a salary cut of 25%. And that's another thing that doesn't seem to be clear to the brilliant people in Washington, D.C. They're not just our customers, they are my employees. And until my employees get the drift of what's being done to them, America's in trouble."

I think that Singapore will develop its own market closer to itself in a very-organic and well-considered way. But to think of the two casinos in Singapore as a direct threat to Macau, I think is to misunderstand the Singapore market. I am very optimistic about the Singapore market, don't misunderstand me. But I think the Singapore market will be Malaysian, I think it would be Indonesian and I think it would be that sort of thing and Thailand and even Brunei, those places that are close within an hour or two. That's how it works for Macau and that's how it will work for Singapore, and you can count the amount of people within the range that I've just described and you can take a look at their ethnicity. There's a big Muslim population that part of the world and you can consider what the size of that market will be. But I don't think -- don't look at Singapore versus Macau in terms of taking customers away. I think you'll miss the boat on that one."

I thought that it would add at least $200 million or $250 million of EBITDA to our bottom line and nothing remotely like that has happened. Of course, it was conceived in a market that was entirely different today,",642,"No, it's not what I thought it would be. I thought that it would add at least $200 million or $250 million of EBITDA to our bottom line and nothing remotely like that has happened. Of course, it was conceived in a market that was entirely different today, as you've just pointed out. It is a beautiful thing that cost $2.3 billion. Now we made a certain amount of money last year in Las Vegas. That money -- we made more money than that without Encore, let alone with it. So now you have to ask yourself a question. If we had no Encore, if we didn't have those other 2,000 other rooms, would we have made even less? Or would we just be better off because we did, we would have had $2.3 billion in cash more than we do now. I would love to have the ability to reconsider that decision at the moment, but I don't. I know this, that there's a wonderful powerful synergy that we're seeing in people that stay at Encore and love it and come back. They're not paying enough for the rooms to suit me and to suit our pro forma, but neither is that happening anywhere else in America that I know of or in Europe. So would I build Encore if I had to do it today, no, I'd keep my money. Fortunately, we had enough money that we don't sweat it. We have planned that -- business cycles go up, business cycles go down. Any sophisticated company plans and has, built into its capital structure, an ability to survive such unpredictable events. So when Encore opened, we were ready. I don't know when Encore's power will kick in at full tilt. I know that when the Beach Club opens up in a few months, that we're going to have a lot more people in Encore than we do now, especially on that side, on the Strip side of the property. And that those tables and those slot machines are going to be much more fully utilized and there's going to be a big profit margin in the Beach Club than in the Surrender Nightclub and in the Switch restaurant. And there'll be a lot more excitement on the north end of the Strip because of the facades and the structure itself that anchor our landholdings here on the Strip. So I'm very happy about what we've added to Encore. But as far as the rooms and what they're doing for us, we're on hold here. And as I said before, I think we're on hold for a while, unless the government in Washington gives the world a message that America -- Lee Kuan Yew, speaking of Singapore, was in the United States and went to visit the President of the United States. Before -- the day before he went to visit the President, he was on television on Charlie Rose's show. And Charlie Rose asked this brilliant, most-elder statesman in the world, the man who founded Singapore, he asked Lee Kuan Yew, "" What about America and what advice would you give the President of the United States?"" And this sage Mount-Rushmore-caliber man said on television on PBS, and I'm sure he repeated it in the White House but I wasn't there of course, he said, ""Unless the government and the administration can learn to control government expenditures, they're wildly out of control, the value of the dollar will be decimated and destroyed to the detriment of the people, of the world and the United States and the world."" That's what he said. And until we have a signal that such discipline and common sense has regained its footing, I don't know how to answer the kinds of questions that you're asking. And I don't think any other businessman does, either."

What we have to say, I think, is going to be very brief because I think these numbers speak for themselves. We had a wonderful year in China. We always want to point out that the most important thing to recognize when looking at numbers in our business is not so much market share per se. That's a measurement of, sort of, casino revenue.  What really is important is to look at the yield per table and the profitability per table. And I'm very happy to see that again, for the second or third consecutive year, the profitability and the efficiency of our tables in Macau have continued to climb in spite of the existence of some very fanciful competition that appeared this year. The Macau market is beginning to show some maturity. There are fine buildings that have been opened and are being operated. And as market conditions have improved, I think that the rest of the construction that was started and temporarily halted will now continue. That's all good news as we go forward in having that market be mature. We've happily established a niche for ourselves and I think our EBITDA was over $500 million last year. And although I don't make forward-looking statements as a rule, we're tracking substantially ahead of that the first two months of the year. And we haven't even opened Encore, which is about 60 or 90 days away. I think we'll do April 24, on a Wednesday. I think Linda decided that we'll do it in April 24, and that is the most beautiful thing we've ever done. And when that kicks in, we're going to have another little boost in our ability to understand and serve the specific needs of our customers. And our customers are, admittedly, the top end. This building, Encore in Macau, and I'm taking just an extra minute or two to comment on it, is a building that was designed after we had two years of experience, to understand the needs of our particular guests that gamble and visit Macau. When we built Wynn Macau and opened it in '06, we had done our very best in pre-opening research and design to have a building that would appeal to what we understood to be that market. And I'm happy to say that we weren't very far off the mark. And the success that we have enjoyed is a direct reflection of the fact that we were able to get it right, especially in the wonderful employees that we were able to attract to come work for us. The workforce in Macau is totally delicious. I mean, the people that have come to work for us from Macau, from Mainland China, from the Philippines, have the most wonderful desire to be trained and to improve and be successful in their jobs. That's probably been our main asset, is the people that work for us, which is why we never cut back on salaries or the 13th month, or why we never did any of the other things that some of our competitors have done. Because whether it's in Macau or Las Vegas, our principal asset are our employees, period. And the ones we have now in China are just absolutely over the moon, wonderful, as far as we're concerned. And we have the organization that's going to be in place to open Encore. I'm happy to say in a few months, and I think when everybody gets a whiff of that place, they're going to realize that we've set a new standard in hospitality, facilities and the way we present our product. It is, by far, the best thing that I've been part of and I've been doing this for 40-odd years. It's 414 rooms and suites and I'm very excited about April's opening and can't wait to share it with everybody. So much for Macau. We look forward to a very healthy and exciting 2010 and beyond. I wish I could say the same thing about Las Vegas. But I'm still -- as we have been in the past, unlike some of our competitors who've seen all kinds of glitter and wonderment, or just around the corner, I think everybody's sort of come clean now that we don't see that. The policies in Washington, policies of government, have taken a terrible toll on the working people in America that come to Las Vegas on the corporations that book conventions and meetings in Las Vegas. I'm afraid to say that I think the outlook for 2010 is very conservative, at least. I don't see any major change in the future. I don't see it getting worse per se, but I do think that unless there is some signal from Washington that they can control the deficits that, not only Las Vegas but the country, faces dire problems. And I don't see any reason whatsoever to have a speck of confidence in the Congress or the administration that's there now. And in the end, Las Vegas is almost a perfect reflection of the national mood. So I'm conservative and guarded about the future of Las Vegas. And I think political leadership has now come home to roost as part of every businessman's conference calls. I mean, imagine that it would be necessary for someone in my position, with my job, to talk to a group of investors and analysts and have to refer to policies in Washington when discussing the relevance of the quarters that lie ahead. But if anybody's got a speck of sophistication, it's listening to my voice now but recognize that, that is, in fact, true. I'll take questions and so will my colleagues who are sitting around the table."

But it's the low end of the range on the VIP side, whereas normalized, it would be $2.85 million, which is a lot of money in Macau. $17 billion of turnover versus $11 billion of turnover last year, volumes are very strong. If you look at the corporate expense side, for full year 2008 we had about $36 million of corporate expense excluding the quarters. Full year '09, closer to $45 million. The difference of roughly a $8 million or $9 million is attributable to one-time payments related to the Macau IPO.

And once again, here is the oldest story in the book when it comes to our company. Capital structure is your salvation. It's capital structure that allows you to hold your head in a down market. I am not forced with my colleagues to juggle my employees or to juggle my customer service levels. There's nothing left to do in my industry except do the basics better. And doing the basics better is what we're all about right now as we tend to our flock in a market that's sort of rough. So we're building a $67 million beach club and a new nightclub to add to our existing nightclubs called Surrender. And we're improving Switch, our restaurant, that will all be integrated into the Encore beach club. And it's going to open up on May 21, we've got 90 days to go. It's right on schedule. And the Encore Beach Club will be -- just as our nightclubs' excess in Tryst have dominated the market, The Encore Beach Club will take this very profitable sector of the market, the alcoholic beverage recreational tumult that goes along with nightclubs. And the margins are fabulous. We have 65% profit margins in these departments, so better than Blackjack in many respects. The Encore Beach Club will take the nightclub mentality into daytime. We've got this gorgeous two-level cabana club that would anchor the north end of our property and liven up this end of the Strip. And you can walk from the cabanas out on to a French balcony and look over the Strip. Or on the inside, the cabanas look down on the pool area, which is integrated with the new nightclub, Surrender, and our restaurant, Switch, which will now have a beautiful terrace dining area. This whole complex, which is on the Strip side of Encore, where we originally put a porte-cochere, unfortunately, the hotels that were supposed to be built across the street from us at the Frontier site and at the Stardust site have been aborted. And we perceived that they will be aborted for the near and distant future. I don't see anything happening with the Echelon Place project in the near future nor do I see anything happening on the Frontier project. So having a fancy porte-cochere, which we unfortunately built for Encore, was worthless. Now another company would have to live with that. Because we have such a strong financial statement and because we have the working capital that's necessary to keep us competitive, we take off that unused porte-cochere and we put something on it that would generate profits in 90 days. And that puts more pressure on our competition, more pressure on every level of our competition. We're about to refurbish our rooms in Wynn because they're five years old. It puts more pressure on our competition because our service levels and the targeted attractiveness of our facilities gets more and more effective. Nothing left to do but the basics better. And that's the story of Wynn Resorts in Las Vegas."

Because I think one of our theories about you going into a market like Pennsylvania, is that -- on the one hand, you want to give a very Wynn experience, a great experience, a great property, on the other hand, it does have a higher tax rate and it's hard to see how you could get a return that you historically have been comfortable with. So how do you balance putting your name on something that might not have sort of the same appeal? And I guess when I look over my history of looking at the industry, there've been times where people have entered Detroit or Pennsylvania or Mississippi, where they have overspent and sort of -- how do you balance that or what constraints you? Then the second thing is, because Steve you just mentioned that you could put a lot of pressure on your competition, which I agree you could, can you talk about Vegas pricing? You're certainly the leader here on pricing. You could stay at these rates and put pressure on the rest of the Strip. At the same time, again, given what is a superior experience, if you discount for too long, don't you teach your customers that they can get a great experience for half off or whatever the pricing is right now?"

Those buildings were conceived in a different time, but they exist. So does Encore. So we'd make the best of it. I'll tell you one thing, you better damn well have a strong balance sheet if you want to play on this Strip. And we've got one. I think our cash is equal to our debt. And we don't have any current maturities. We have long maturities, low interest rates. We're protected for a stormy weather. And this is again -- I said this before, if you don't understand the capital structures, the backbone of your marketing, then you need to go back to business school. We understand that here. We don't need to learn that lesson anew. Now let's go back to Philadelphia, if we can, Steve. I'm building 3,000 slot machines and a bunch of table games and a poker room, Italian restaurant, a steak house, an Asian restaurant, because I'm two blocks from a Vietnamese neighborhood. I'm five blocks from Society Hill. I'm in a town with seven universities. I'm about four blocks from the Walt Whitman Bridge. My 14 or 15 acres is on the Delaware River, incidentally, Steve, the -- almost to the foot, the same size as my property in Macau. Two blocks away or four blocks away is Walt Whitman Bridge. On the other side of the bridge is Cherry Hill, New Jersey. All full of my old friends, Italians and Jews and every conceivable stripe of ethnic group that love to shoot crap and gamble. And they're 10 minutes away in their cars or on a bus from my casino on the Delaware River. I love the proximity to these people. I love the proximity to the Vietnamese neighborhood. And I'm going to put in a beautiful Vietnamese restaurant for them. I'm going to build a very pretty place with the help of my Wynn design and development team that is perfectly responsive just to that market and not a bit more over the top than that. But it will look like us. It won't be a slots in a box. I spent some time this past week with a very good friend of mine, Bob Manoukian, who has, it's called, Philadelphia -- now Parx Casino. And Bob was sharing the results of that casino with me. And I assure you, sir, that, that is not a below-average return on investment. It is a wonderful return on investment because of the low cost of marketing. Listen, no Gulfstream jets, no helicopters, no nothing. And the table games and the slot wins are allowing, because of the limited amount of machines in the market, for returns that are handsome, much better than we can get in Las Vegas at the present moment. So I'm not concerned about overshooting the mark. I think we can build a lovely single level, what would appears to be a single level on the outside, you put the valet parking and the employee parking on grade and then you lift the casino by 12 or 14 feet and you drive up to that on the porte-cochere so it looks like it's on grade. And then you have two or three levels of parking on either side of the casino so you can walk right into the casino from the garages. And we make this super-friendly place for users. And they can run in, gamble for 3 hours and run out, have a great steak or an Italian dinner or noodles or a slice of pizza and it'll be just the right lighting and great colors. All those things, all those little things, that have always given us market superiority. We're going to put them to work for the first time in a straightforward casino, not a destination-integrated resort, which involves all those bells and whistles that are so expensive that you're familiar with in the past. So don't misunderstand the assignment that we have or our clear vision of what we have to do. I don't know if that makes you feel any better. Are you owning our stock these days?"

I was talking about the maturing in the sense of the facilities that were available to choices. One of the reasons Las Vegas has been so successful for so many years is the public has had a wonderful menu of choices. Not one hotel but several that were all different and had a variety of options available to tourists. Macau was very limited when it was a monopoly. And then as the years have come by, since the opening of the Sands and then ourselves and the people from Melbourne, and then this past year, the Four Seasons opened, from -- the Sands people opened the Four Seasons and the Melco people opened the City Of Dreams. That's what I meant by maturity. And then here we come with this sexy little thing called Encore. These are wonderful choices. I noticed that the business for Chinese New Year was a little softer, even though Baccarat was good last year. And I think one of the reasons is that business exploded for Chinese New Year in Macau. And I think it's because now the choices in China are so wonderful for people that live in South China, they can go to Macau, they don't have to travel all the way to Las Vegas. Now again, we had a very big Baccarat year last year in Las Vegas in spite of everything else. But I'm convinced that the choices that are presenting themselves to people in Asia just as the government intended, the reason they broke the monopoly and added a couple more concessions was so that Macau would become more attractive to a broader range of people. And that's exactly what's happening. And that's the kind maturity I was talking about. As far as growth rate, Macau is jumping this year. What's happened is growth rate is keeping up with the expansion. The more places are resulting in more business by a lot. That's what we're seeing, at least, this first quarter."

We think it conceivably could be the most beautiful hotel in the world after Encore, which opens up this year.

We are constrained by the political process itself of getting the entitlements and the details done through planning and public works in Macau, we're full-tilt at that. And our own planning process, it's an ambitious project it will involve a couple of billion dollars. But it's not 4,000 to 5,000 rooms or anything like that, it's one hotel on a property. It has some very novel and new ideas. So we're taking our time with the design, Robin, because we design the hotel first then we build it. We raise our money before we break ground so that when we do start to build it, we have all of our money together. Now I know these are sort old-fashioned concepts, design the hotel before you build it, and have the money before you start. But we're in the process of doing all that. And I think it's going to take another several months before we can answer specific questions that you're asking me today."

It is totally irresponsible and naive for anybody to say based upon this slight trend we project this infinitely into the future and give you some rosy baloney story about what's going to happen in '11. And I am warning my investors that maybe on the call to the extent that you hear any of that from our competitors, beware. There are more questions afoot in this market in America that will impact '11. And I have hair in my head, I'm happy to say and I still have a full head of hair. No, you'll not get any of that from us. I don't see it. I've got more questions than answers. I have more pessimism than I've had before and it's based upon the political environment in which we are living today. And it definitely is impacting Las Vegas. The President of the United States hasn't missed one single opportunity to squelch Las Vegas. In our particular case, it's cost us millions of dollars from companies affected by the President's remarks that had no connection whatsoever to Federal bailouts. But we get phone calls and I'm not going to mention the names of the companies from Chairman who say we don't want to appear to be profligate because Barack Obama said this or that about Las Vegas. But it's had an effect on us. The hospitality industry in the United States of America as a whole has suffered disproportionately during this recession. Maybe automobile workers got a break, but all of that hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people that work in hotels, restaurants and bars in the United States of America had been totally and completely overlooked. And this abortive rescue attempt that is squandered billions of dollars in the United States. And I'm being very harsh about it and I've got the data to back it up, and so is everybody else in the hospitality industry. The job formation and the kinds of companies that make jobs are under attack in the United States of America. MGM, aside for a moment, last year we created almost 5,000 jobs and immediately became the target of the administration. Businesses that created jobs, let alone gaming companies that created jobs had to be no good. It is preposterous that businesses are under attack in the United States of America. Anybody that makes over $250,000 in the form of a personal income tax return is now by, Washington definition, a rich person. When everybody who has got a college degree knows that the personal income tax rate in the United States of America is the business tax of America. Every Subchapter S, every individual proprietorship and every partnership in the United States of America files tax returns as individuals. And when they do, and they showed that they made $2 million or $3 million or God forbid, $4 million. They pay the income tax rate, they deduct their working expenses, they're living expenses and then they invest in a new store, a new shop. And most of the time 25% of their profits ""are tied up in accounts receivable or inventory."" But all of a sudden, all of those people who make over $250,000 are rich folks to be fleeced. And if that's job formation stimulation in America, I'm Mary Poppins. And if I sound angry about it and disgusted, I am disgusted and angry at the apparent ignorance of the administration and the Congress to recognize the fact that the individual tax rate in the United States of America is in fact the business tax of America. And if you keep banging on that, you will destroy the incentive for job formation in the United States of America. And that's simple truth, simple truth. And whether politicians like it or don't like it, means nothing to me. And that's why I'm pessimistic about Las Vegas, because those are our customers. Those people out there hustling their businesses and God forbid, showing that they made a million dollars as a partnership or as an individual. Yes, they're the enemy now. They're the rich folks. Well, until we get over this, America's in for hard times because what's going to happen is the people that are going to suffer from what's going on are the working class of America. My 15,000, 20,000 employees, they are the ones that are in trouble. The reason they're in trouble is this demolition of the dollar, is going to reduce the buying power of the working class of America as sure as hell as if we gave them a salary cut of 25%. And that's another thing that doesn't seem to be clear to the brilliant people in Washington, D.C. They're not just our customers, they are my employees. And until my employees get the drift of what's being done to them, America's in trouble."

I thought that it would add at least $200 million or $250 million of EBITDA to our bottom line and nothing remotely like that has happened. Of course, it was conceived in a market that was entirely different today, as you've just pointed out. It is a beautiful thing that cost $2.3 billion. Now we made a certain amount of money last year in Las Vegas. That money -- we made more money than that without Encore, let alone with it. So now you have to ask yourself a question. If we had no Encore, if we didn't have those other 2,000 other rooms, would we have made even less? Or would we just be better off because we did, we would have had $2.3 billion in cash more than we do now. I would love to have the ability to reconsider that decision at the moment, but I don't. I know this, that there's a wonderful powerful synergy that we're seeing in people that stay at Encore and love it and come back. They're not paying enough for the rooms to suit me and to suit our pro forma, but neither is that happening anywhere else in America that I know of or in Europe. So would I build Encore if I had to do it today, no, I'd keep my money. Fortunately, we had enough money that we don't sweat it. We have planned that -- business cycles go up, business cycles go down. Any sophisticated company plans and has, built into its capital structure, an ability to survive such unpredictable events. So when Encore opened, we were ready. I don't know when Encore's power will kick in at full tilt. I know that when the Beach Club opens up in a few months, that we're going to have a lot more people in Encore than we do now, especially on that side, on the Strip side of the property. And that those tables and those slot machines are going to be much more fully utilized and there's going to be a big profit margin in the Beach Club than in the Surrender Nightclub and in the Switch restaurant. And there'll be a lot more excitement on the north end of the Strip because of the facades and the structure itself that anchor our landholdings here on the Strip. So I'm very happy about what we've added to Encore. But as far as the rooms and what they're doing for us, we're on hold here. And as I said before, I think we're on hold for a while, unless the government in Washington gives the world a message that America -- Lee Kuan Yew, speaking of Singapore, was in the United States and went to visit the President of the United States. Before -- the day before he went to visit the President, he was on television on Charlie Rose's show. And Charlie Rose asked this brilliant, most-elder statesman in the world, the man who founded Singapore, he asked Lee Kuan Yew, "" What about America and what advice would you give the President of the United States?"" And this sage Mount-Rushmore-caliber man said on television on PBS, and I'm sure he repeated it in the White House but I wasn't there of course, he said, ""Unless the government and the administration can learn to control government expenditures, they're wildly out of control, the value of the dollar will be decimated and destroyed to the detriment of the people, of the world and the United States and the world."" That's what he said. And until we have a signal that such discipline and common sense has regained its footing, I don't know how to answer the kinds of questions that you're asking. And I don't think any other businessman does, either."

Our feeling is that with the growth in capacity that we absorbed in the early part of the first quarter that that’s impacted rates citywide certainly for us, and we don’t see that really changing through the summer. The second question related to the slot handle and we talked about how the comp was a bit tough because we were going up against the opening of Encore, where we had a tremendous amount of novelty and local traffic that came through the building and so we benefited from that, and then we have since and are nearly complete, nearly done with constructing our new Beach Club which basically closed down the whole front of Encore, which has impacted what walk-in traffic we were able to generate off of the strip.

The new Beach Club, all of the extensive new construction and improvements on the strip at Encore are completed in the last week in May and we open up with bang on May 28th with the Encore Beach Club, with the new nightclub Surrender, and the revised Cafe Society and the Switch quite a bit, and the new entrance plaza, quite a bit of upgrade on the north end of the strip, on the north end of our property that I believe is going to have a significant effect on walk-in. The last part of the question that I’m going to answer is Cotai. The table caps expire in 2013. We believe that Macau Encore is the loveliest urban hotel in the world. And for people who think that that’s an exaggeration, then it’s very simple to make your own comparisons on pretty much any standard that you like. But it is an urban hotel, much in the same way that the Waldorf Astoria or the Ritz in Paris or the Peninsula in Hong Kong are urban hotels. The hotels that are built on Cotai are pretty much urban as well, because they’re built right up to the curb, they’re mostly steel and concrete. What I believe is missing from Cotai is a legitimate destination resort that has the one thing in China that is so scarce, and that is space. So I want to build a hotel in Cotai and I have designed one that makes use in our 51 acre parcel of extended space of water and gardens, no matter where you are in the building. And that creates an emotional involvement by the guest at a level that cannot be achieved in a city. It just cannot. That issue of extended space, of natural light, of water and planting has an effect on human beings that is sort of hard to explain unless you’re in the space itself. But that’s the difference between a lovely hotel and a destination resort. So, we’re going to build on Cotai, if we’re encouraged to do so, and I believe we will be encouraged to do so at least at this point I believe that. We will build a destination resort, and that will complement the other things that we’ve built in Macau up till now. But that wouldn’t open until 2014.

It’s not very often that the buy-side guys speak up on these conference calls. Tom, the inherent strength of the market in China has been the subject of great discussion and it has been explained and I know that you’re one of the people that has spent a great deal of time with all of your investments in Marsico Capital and understanding the depth of that market. And the pent-up demand that exists there among the 300 million Chinese who are experiencing upper middle class and beyond wealth in that country, that is not to minimize the fact that China faces great challenges for almost 1 billion people or maybe over 1 billion people who have yet to experience such prosperity. But we have to keep in mind that this explosive growth in China and the desire for a consumer experience, and incidentally to a great extent it is encouraged by the government, which is trying to enhance the consumer economy in China. So it is not considered improper to want to aspire to the good life. And to Chinese people, part of the good life is going to Macau and partaking of all of the excitement and activities that take place there. Not just gambling, but shopping and fine service and dining and branding is very important to those people. So we’ve learned that over the years here in Las Vegas. When we opened Mirage, we got all that business away from Caesars because we were the newest greatest thing. When we opened Bellagio, the Chinese business immediately switched to Bellagio. When we opened Wynn we had big-time Asian baccarat business because we were the newest and fanciest thing. The Asian market is very, very aware of the top brands, and that’s why we’re so meticulous in making sure that we meet that demand. For example, it is non-productive for us to appeal to the low-end market in China, because the government does not encourage the low-end of China to go to Macau. They don’t mind if people who can afford it go and gamble but they’re sensitive to people who can’t afford it going across the border to Macau. That’s why they pulled back on the visas. But for those people in Hong Kong and South China from [Dagen] Shanghai who can afford the good life, there’s no stigma attached to that in China. And there are so many of them. The market is so deep and rich and successful people who are in search of the good life that Macau is a natural place and Hong Kong and Macau are natural markets to absorb some of that energy. And we are experiencing it along with the other operators in Macau. We’ve maintained our niche in that market because we protected our brand. Encore was more of the same. And coupled with that, we stay on the good side of the government by attending very carefully to a proper Chinese protocol, which is to be humble as a guest of that community, to be grateful for being allowed to be there, and to show our appreciation in every way possible for that privilege including going public on the Hong Kong exchange to increase our Chinese ownership of our company. Those things have all conspired to produce a result along with the natural flow of people across the borders that have affected all the operators to protect our market share and allow it to grow. And in respect to that Tom, there’s one final point I would make, one young analyst several months ago said, ‘Mr. Wynn, as these hotels have opened, your market shares has gone from 17% to 14% or 15% or 13%.’ And I said, well naturally, when thousands upon thousands of tables are added to the market, our market share would drop in terms of gross revenue. But when you’re analyzing and evaluating a gaming company; whether it’s in the United States or in Asia, the right number is not market share in terms of gross dollars, it’s what percentage of revenue per table you have over the ratio of 1 to 1 that you would have if your revenue equaled the same percentage as the amount of tables you have, or to simplify that if you had 10 hotels each with a 100 tables, they would each do exactly the same amount of revenue than the percentage of tables and the percentage of revenues would be equal. That would be total parity. The ratio of revenue to equipment would be 1 to 1. If the ratio of revenue to equipment is greater than 1 to 1, then you operated a more efficient and more positive way than your neighbors. And as more hotels have opened in Macau, our ratio has grown, not shrunken. And that’s the number, that’s the number, the win per table compared to the percentage of tables, the percentage of revenue you have compared to the percentage of tables you have, and in that respect, our market position has improved, not slackened. Those are the things Tom that come to my mind as I think of this subject. Matt, do you have anything to add to that?

At the time although everybody had good jobs in Macau, their living standard was not going up proportionally, because rents for their homes had increased disproportionately more rapidly than their income and it caused me 1.5 year or so ago to give my line employees a 10% cost of living increase in their wages. So that the wonderful people that work for me wouldn’t have lesser of a life. That was at a time when some of my competitors were cutting back from 48 to 40 weeks, and cutting out the 13th month in order to save money. We kept the 48 hours, we kept the 13th month because it was more important to us to have a satisfied and stable workforce than it was to have an extra $23 million or $24 million. And as we go forward in Cotai, we work very closely with the government, which is very interested in low-cost housing to cooperate with them in any way that we can. I know that the government has plenty of money to deal with this problem in Macau and I know that it is on the front of the focus of Secretary Tam, and Chief Executive Officer Choi as well. So I think that the government has land for this on Coloane, and I believe that they’re going to take advantage of it. And we as you know participate in infrastructure contributions and other types of voluntary contributions for 4% of our revenue every month. And that number is quite substantial if you take the Casino Wynn and calculate it yourself, you’ll see that a lot of money besides the gaming tax itself, which is really an income tax, is in play. So, I think that you will see activity in that, and will it tie up construction. There’s a lot of capacity in South China for construction, Tom. And I think that any projects that will come on stream, remember the government is limiting the amount of construction and is limiting the licenses. They’ve created an oligarchic monopolistic kind of situation there, thank goodness to our benefit along with the other folks that are there now. And there is no plan to expand that so I think that construction is going to be done at a slower pace in the resort industry as a result of the government action. And so, the private sector, the public sector will pick up the activity.

My team and I were curious having never visited the regional casinos from America. We decided that it was quite appropriate for us to take three or four days and go look at what was being done in the hope so we might learn something. And in fact we did. We spotted a few casinos that were really beautifully done. One in particular was the River City Casino owned by Pinnacle Company in St. Louis, a beautiful job done by [Todd Lenahan] who is one of the designers that works for us. So, we saw some nice things and we were just curious, and our visit to these places was just as detached and objective as I’ve just said it. You should read absolutely nothing into it. Being spotted doesn’t mean any thing’s afoot. There is no agenda here. Our next project will undoubtedly be in China, unless we get involved in Massachusetts. The deal in Philadelphia, as we said in our public statement, which I thought was although concise, was very accurate, that we were encouraged by the institution of table game gaming at a 14% tax rate, still a little tough for the slot machine tax rate. But the gaming opportunities in Pennsylvania were interesting and stimulating. But the particular deal we were in, a deal in which we were a participant in someone else’s company. We had never done that before, became unattractive to us at the last minute. And it was the deal itself that caused us to back out. We backed out of a deal more than we backed out of Pennsylvania. And it was that simple. Great people, good friends, but when it was all said and done, the stars didn’t line up for us. And that’s what happens sometimes. You go into deals. You probe and you start to negotiate, and then at some point when you add everything up, you back out, and we did in this particular case.

The goal of broadening and bringing in new concessions in Macau in 2002 was to broaden the appeal of Macau in the Pacific Rim and around the rest of the world to bring new customers, not just baccarat players into the marketplace. And it is fascinating to see exactly how that process works. So I’m going to explain it with regard to Encore. Macau has junket operators that have a budget that we give them a fixed amount of money to pay for their complementaries for their customers in their rooms, unlike the Las Vegas method which just sort of pays for the rooms. There the house pays for the rooms. Now when we built the Wynn Hotel in Macau, we did what a normal hotel operator does. We built a very commodious large generous typical room at 626 square feet. That’s bigger than Bellagio and the same as Wynn America. And then we built extravagant suites starting at 1,800 feet and going up to 3,000. And those rooms were priced at 200 odd dollars, and the suites well above $1,000 as you would expect in any hotel operation including Shanghai and Hong Kong and Tokyo. And that’s what we did as hoteliers. In the hospitality business, it was very, very normal, right up the middle. The junket operators came to us, they came to Linda actually and said just a minute, that’s not what we need. The typical room is beautiful, but it’s not sexy enough for a gambler, and the suites are too expensive for us to waste all of our money at $1,500 or $1,200 a night. What we want is a very theatrical and beautiful room that we can buy for under $400, preferably at $350. Well, there was no such product. And all of a sudden the pressures exerted by gambling interests caused us to create a product an 1,100 square foot suite. We went and did it, and that is Encore. Now what we have done is built a room that is at $350 the most incredible piece of hospitality real estate in the world. And it has an enormous appeal to everybody, especially non-gambling people, because it represents the greatest bargain in the world. So now here’s Macau, creating a product from its organic gambling roots that now changes the city and the market to be more appealing, more broad-based in its attractiveness to everybody. How interesting unintended consequences are or maybe they are intended, but here is a product that was engendered by gaming requests that becomes a non-gaming plus for the city. The most lovely room in the world at a price that is almost half of what a regular room at the Peninsula costs, which would be less than half its size. Interesting how things work. I call that, and I’ve made this point to the government, organic growth. That is not the same thing as trying to pick up Las Vegas and drop it on Macau that will never work. One is China, one is the United States, and China is China is China, and in relationships with the people of that country, in relationships with your employees, you must not forget that it is not Las Vegas, it is not America. And so dropping Las Vegas strip into Macau was always an idea that did not respect the basic fundamental notion of Macau. And so we try in our observation of the people, what we’ve learned since ‘06. We could never have built Encore Wynn in ‘06. We did not have the hands-on experience with the customers. We learned from our customers, as all good businesses do, we learned from our customers and our employees, how to better run our business. And so what we have in Encore Macau is an organic product that grows in Macau out of the soil of Macau’s own beginnings. And I’m glad that that question was asked Robin, because it gives us a chance to clarify what we’ve done. And I hope that adds some color to your question.

The new Beach Club, all of the extensive new construction and improvements on the Strip at Encore are completed in the last week in May, and we open up with a bang on May 28 with the Encore Beach Club with the new nightclub, Surrender, and the revised Café Society and Switch, quite a bit and the new entrance plaza, quite a bit of upgrade on the north end of the Strip, on the north end of our property that I believe is going to have a significant effect on walk-in. The last part of the question, what I'm going to answer is Cotai. The table caps expire on the 13th -- in 2013. We believe that Macau Encore is the loveliest urban hotel in the world. And for people who think that, that's an exaggeration, then it's very simple to make your own comparisons on pretty much any standard that you like. But it is an urban hotel much in the same way that the Waldorf Astoria or the Ritz in Paris or the Peninsula in Hong Kong are urban hotels. The hotels that are built on Cotai are pretty much urban as well because they're built to right up to the curve. They're mostly steel and concrete. What I believe is missing from Cotai is a legitimate destination resort that has the one thing in China that is so scarce and that is space. So I want to build a hotel in Cotai, and I have designed one that makes use of our 51-acre parcel of extended space of water and gardens no matter where you are in the building. And that creates an emotional involvement by the guest at a level that cannot be achieved in a city, it just cannot. That issue of extended space, of natural light, of water and planting has an effect on human beings that is sort of hard to explain unless you're in the space itself. But that's the difference between a lovely hotel and a destination resort. So we're going to build on Cotai if we are encouraged to do so, and I believe we will be encouraged to do so, at least at this point I believe that, we will build a destination resort and that will compliment the other things that we built in Macau, up to now. But that won't happen -- wouldn't open until 2014."

Tom, the inherent strength of the market in China has been the subject of great discussion, and it has been explained -- and I know that you're one of the people that has spent a great deal of time with all of your investment in Marsico Capital at understanding the depth of that market. And the pent-up demand that exists there among the 300 million Chinese who are experiencing upper-middle-class-and-beyond wealth in that country. That is not to minimize the fact that China faces great challenges for almost a billion people or maybe over a billion people who have yet to experience such prosperity. But we have to keep in mind that this explosive growth in China, and the desire for a consumer experience -- and incidentally, to a great extent it is encouraged by the government, which is trying to enhance the consumer economy in Macau. And so -- I mean, in China. So it is not considered improper to want to aspire to the good life. And to Chinese, to Chinese people, part of the good life is going to Macau and partaking of all of the excitement and the activities that take place there, not just gambling, but shopping and fine service and dining. And branding is very important to those people. So we've learned that over the years here in Las Vegas, you know when opened Mirage, we've got all that business away from Caesars because we were the newest, greatest thing. When we opened Bellagio, the Chinese business immediately switched to Bellagio. When we opened Wynn, we had big-time Asian baccarat business because we were the newest and fanciest thing. The Asian market is very, very aware of the top brands and that's why we're so meticulous and making sure that we meet that demand. For example, it is non-productive for us to appeal to the low-end market in China because the government does not encourage the low-end of China to go to Macau. They don't mind if people who can afford it go and gamble, but they're sensitive to people who can't afford it going across the border to Macau. That's why they pulled back on the visas. But for those people in Hong Kong and South China, from Dalian and Shanghai who can afford the good life, there's no stigma attached to that in China. And there are so many of them. The market is so deep and rich in successful people who are in search of the good life that Macau is a natural place -- and Hong Kong and Macau, are natural markets to absorb some of that energy. And we are experiencing it along with the other operators in Macau. And we maintained our niche in that market because we protected our brand. Encore was more of the same and coupled with that, we stay on the good side of the government by attending very carefully to a proper Chinese protocol. Which is to be humble as a guest of that community, to be grateful for being allowed to be there, and to show our appreciation in every way possible for that privilege, including going public on the Hong Kong Exchange to increase our Chinese ownership of our company. Those things have all conspired to produce a result along with the natural flow of people across the borders that have affected all the operators, to protect our market share and allow it to grow. And in respect to that, Tom, there's one final point I would make. One young analyst several months ago said, ""Mr. Wynn, as these hotel have opened, your market share has gone from 17% to 14% or 15% or 13%."" And I said, ""Well, naturally, when thousands upon thousands of tables are added to the market, our market share would drop in terms of gross revenue."" But when you are analyzing and evaluating a gaming company, whether it's in the United States or in Asia, the right number is not market share in terms of gross dollars. It's what percentage of revenue per table you have over the ratio of one-to-one that you would have if your revenue equaled the same percentages as the amount of tables you have. Or to simplify that, if you had ten hotels each with 100 tables, they would each do exactly the same amount of revenue than the percentage of tables and the percentage of revenues would be equal. That would be total parody. The ratio of revenue to equipment would be one-to-one. If the ratio of revenue to equipment is greater than one-to-one, then you operated a more efficient and more positive way than your neighbors. And as more hotels have opened in Macau, our ratio has grown, not shrunk. And that's the number, that's the number. The win per table compared to the percentage of tables. The percentage of revenue you have compared to the percentage of tables you have. And in that respect, our market position has improved, not slackened. Those are the things, Tom, that come to my mind as I think of the subject. Matt, do you anything to add to that?"

At the time, although everybody had good jobs in Macau, their living standard was not going up proportionally because rents for their homes had increased disproportionately, more rapidly than their income. And it caused me a year and a half or so ago to give my line employees a 10% cost-of-living increase in their wages. So that the wonderful people that work for me wouldn't have lesser of a life. That was at a time when some of my competitors were cutting back from 48 to 40 hour weeks and cutting out the 13th month in order to save money. We kept the 48 hours, we kept the 13th month because it was more important to us to have a satisfied and stable workforce than it was to have an extra $23 million or $24 million. As we go forward in Cotai, we work very closely with the government, which is very interested in low-cost housing, to cooperate with them in any way that we can. I know that the government has plenty of money to deal with this problem in Macau, and I know that it is on the front of focus of Secretary Tam and Chief Executive Officer Choy as well. So I think that the government has land for this on Colo 1 [ph] and I believe that they're going to take advantage of it. And we, as you know, participate in infrastructure contributions and other types of voluntary contributions for 4% of our revenue every month. And that number is quite substantial if you take the casino win and calculate it yourself, you'll see that a lot of money besides the gaming tax itself, which is really an income tax, is in play. So I think that you'll see activity on that. And will it tie-up construction? There's a lot of capacity in South China for construction, Tom. And I think that any projects that will come out of stream -- remember the government is limiting the amount of construction and is limiting the licenses. They've created an oligarchic, monopolistic kind of situation there, thank goodness to our benefit, along with the other folks that are there now. And there is no plan to expand that. So I think that construction is going to be done at a slower pace in the resort industry as a result of the government action. And so the private sector, the public sector will pick up the activity."

My team and I were curious having never visited the regional casinos of America. We decided that it was quite appropriate for us to take three or four days and go look at what was being done. In the hopes that we might learn something, and in fact we did. We spotted a few casinos that were really beautifully done. One, in particular, was the River City Casino owned by a medical company in St. Louis. A beautiful job done by Todd Lenihan, who is one of the designers that works for us. So we saw some nice things and we were just curious and our visit to these places was just as detached and objective as I have just said it, you should read absolutely nothing into it. Being spotted doesn't mean anything is afoot, there is no agenda here. Our next project will undoubtedly be in China, unless we get involved in Massachusetts. The deal in Philadelphia, as we said in our public statement, which I thought was very -- although concise, was very accurate. That we were encouraged by the institution of table game gaming at a 14% tax rate -- still a little tough for the slot machine tax rate, but that the gaming opportunities in Pennsylvania were interesting and stimulating. But the particular deal we were in, a deal in which we were a participant in someone else's company --we had never done that before -- became unattractive to us at the last minute. And it was the deal itself that caused us to back out. We backed out of a deal more than we backed out of Pennsylvania, and it was that simple. Great people, good friends, but when it was all said and done, the stars didn't line up for us. And that's what happens sometimes. You go into deals, you probe and you start to negotiate and then at some point, when you add everything up, you back out, and we did in this particular case."

The goal of broadening and bringing in new concessions in Macau in 2002, was to broaden the appeal of Macau in the Pacific Rim and around the rest of the world to bring new customers, not just baccarat players into the marketplace. And it is fascinating to see exactly how that process works. So I'm going to explain it with regard to Encore. Macau has junket operators that have a budget that we give them, a fixed amount of money to pay for their complementaries for their customers and their rooms. Unlike the Las Vegas method which just sort of pays for the rooms -- the house pays for the rooms. Now, when we built the Wynn Hotel in Macau, we did what a normal hotel operator does. We built a very commodious, large, generous, typical room at 626 square feet. That's bigger than Bellagio and the same as Wynn America. And then we built extravagant suites starting at 1800 feet and going up to 3000 . And those rooms were priced at $200-odd dollars and the suites well above a $1000, as you would expect in any hotel operation, including Shanghai and Hong Kong and Tokyo. And that's what we did as hoteliers in the hospitality business. It was very, very normal, right up the middle. The junket operators came to us, they came to Linda actually and said, ""Just a minute, that's not what we need. The typical room is beautiful, but it's not sexy enough for a gambler. And the suites are too expensive for us to waste all of our money at $1500 or $1200 a night. What we want is a very theatrical and beautiful room that we can buy for under $400, preferably at $350."" Well, there was no such product and all of a sudden, the pressures exerted by gambling interests caused us to create a product, an 1100 square-foot suite. We went and did it and that is Encore. Now, what we have done is built a room that is at $350 the most incredible piece of hospitality real estate in the world. And it has an enormous appeal to everybody, especially non-gambling people, because it represents the greatest bargain in the world. So now here's Macau, creating a product from its organic gambling roots that now changes the city and the market to be more appealing, more broad-based in its attractiveness to everybody. How interesting unintended consequences are, or maybe they are intended. But here is a product that was engendered by a gaming request that becomes a non-gaming plus for the city. The most lovely room in the world at a price that is almost half of what a regular room at the Peninsula costs, which would be less than half its size. Interesting how things work. I call that, and I've made this point to the government, organic growth. That is not the same thing as trying to pick up Las Vegas and drop it on Macau. That will never work. One is China, one is the United States and China is China is China. And in relationships with the people of that country, in relationships with your employees, you must not forget that it is not Las Vegas. It is not America. And so dropping the Las Vegas Strip into Macau was always an idea that did not respect the basic fundamental notion of Macau. And so we try in our observation of the people, what we have learned since '06, we could never have build Encore Wynn in '06. We did not have the hands-on experience with our customers. We learned from our customers, as all good businesses do, we learn from our customers and employees how to better run our business. And so what we have in Encore Macau is an organic product that grows in Macau out of the soil of Macau's own beginnings. And I'm glad that, that question was asked, Robin, because it gives us a chance to clarify what we've done. And I hope that adds some color to your question."

The last part of the question, what -- that I'm going to answer is Cotai. The table caps expire on the 13 -- in 2013. We believe that Macau Encore is the loveliest urban hotel in the world. And for people who think that, that's an exaggeration, then it's very simple to make your own comparisons on pretty much any standard that you like. But it is an urban hotel much in the same way that the Waldorf Astoria or the Ritz in Paris or the Peninsula in Hong Kong are urban hotels. The hotels that are built on Cotai are pretty much urban as well because they're built to right up to the curve. They're mostly steel and concrete. What I believe is missing from Cotai is a legitimate destination resort that has the one thing in China that is so scarce and that is space. So I want to build a hotel in Cotai, and I have designed one that makes use of our 51-acre parcel of extended space of water and gardens no matter where you are in the building. And that creates an emotional involvement by the guest at a level that cannot be achieved in a city, it just cannot. That issue of extended space, of natural light, of water and planting has an effect on human beings that is sort of hard to explain unless you're in the space itself. But that's the difference between a lovely hotel and a destination resort. So we're going to build on Cotai if we are encouraged to do so, and I believe we will be encouraged to do so, at least at this point I believe that, we will build a destination resort and that will compliment the other things that we've built in Macau up till now. But that won't happen -- wouldn't open until 2014."

It's not very often that the buy-side guys speak up at this conference calls. Tom, the inherent strength of the market in China has been the subject of great discussion, and it has been explained -- and I know that you're one of the people that has spent a great deal of time with all of your investments in Marsico Capital in understanding the depth of that market. And the pent-up demand that exists there among the 300 million Chinese who are experiencing upper-middle-class-and-beyond wealth in that country. That is not to minimize the fact that China faces great challenges for almost a billion people or maybe over a billion people who have yet to experience such prosperity. But we have to keep in mind that this explosive growth in China and the desire for a consumer experience -- and incidentally, to a great extent it is encouraged by the government, which is trying to enhance the consumer economy in Macau. And so -- I mean, in China. So it is not considered improper to want to aspire to the good life. And to Chinese, to Chinese people, part of the good life is going to Macau and partaking of all of the excitement and the activities that take place there, not just gambling, but shopping and fine service and dining. And branding is very important to those people. So we've learned that over the years here in Las Vegas, you know when opened Mirage, we've got all that business away from Caesars because we were the newest, greatest thing. When we opened Bellagio, the Chinese business immediately switched to Bellagio. When we opened Wynn, we had big-time Asian baccarat business because we were the newest and fanciest thing. The Asian market is very, very aware of the top brands and that's why we're so meticulous in making sure that we meet that demand. For example, it is non-productive for us to appeal to the low-end market in China because the government does not encourage the low-end of China to go to Macau. They don't mind if people who can afford it go and gamble, but they're sensitive to people who can't afford it going across the border to Macau. That's why they pulled back on the visas. But for those people in Hong Kong and South China, from Dalian and Shanghai who can afford the good life, there's no stigma attached to that in China. And there are so many of them. The market is so deep and rich in successful people who are in search of the good life that Macau is a natural place -- and Hong Kong and Macau, are natural markets to absorb some of that energy. And we are experiencing it along with the other operators in Macau. And we maintained our niche in that market because we protected our brand. Encore was more of the same and coupled with that, we stay on the good side of the government by attending very carefully to a proper Chinese protocol, which is to be humble as a guest of that community, to be grateful for being allowed to be there, and to show our appreciation in every way possible for that privilege, including going public on the Hong Kong Exchange to increase our Chinese ownership of our company. Those things have all conspired to produce a result along with the natural flow of people across the borders that have affected all the operators, to protect our market share and allow it to grow. And in respect to that, Tom, there's one final point I would make. One young analyst several months ago said, ""Mr. Wynn, as these hotels have opened, your market share has gone from 17% to 14% or 15% or 13%."" And I said, ""Well, naturally, when thousands upon thousands of tables are added to the market, our market share would drop in terms of gross revenue."" But when you're analyzing and evaluating a gaming company, whether it's in the United States or in Asia, the right number is not market share in terms of gross dollars. It's what percentage of revenue per table you have over the ratio of one-to-one that you would have if your revenue equaled the same percentage as the amount of tables you have. Or to simplify that, if you had ten hotels each with 100 tables, they would each do exactly the same amount of revenue then the percentage of tables and the percentage of revenues would be equal. That would be total parody. The ratio of revenue to equipment would be one-to-one. If the ratio of revenue to equipment is greater than one-to-one, then you operated a more efficient and more positive way than your neighbors. And as more hotels have opened in Macau, our ratio has grown, not shrunk. And that's the number, that's the number. The win per table compared to the percentage of tables. The percentage of revenue you have compared to the percentage of tables you have. And in that respect, our market position has improved, not slackened. Those are the things, Tom, that come to my mind as I think of this subject. Matt, do you anything to add to that?"

And it",412,"Well, your observation is very insightful. At the time, although everybody had good jobs in Macau, their living standard was not going up proportionally because rents for their homes had increased disproportionately, more rapidly than their income. And it caused me a year and a half or so ago to give my line employees a 10% cost-of-living increase in their wages. So that the wonderful people that work for me wouldn't have lesser of a life. That was at a time when some of my competitors were cutting back from 48 to 40 hour weeks and cutting out the 13th month in order to save money. We kept the 48 hours, we kept the 13th month because it was more important to us to have a satisfied and stable workforce than it was to have an extra $23 million or $24 million. As we go forward in Cotai, we work very closely with the government, which is very interested in low-cost housing, to cooperate with them in any way that we can. I know that the government has plenty of money to deal with this problem in Macau, and I know that it is on the front of focus of Secretary Tam and Chief Executive Officer Choy as well. So I think that the government has land for this on Coloane and I believe that they're going to take advantage of it. And we, as you know, participate in infrastructure contributions and other types of voluntary contributions for 4% of our revenue every month. And that number is quite substantial if you take the casino win and calculate it yourself, you'll see that a lot of money besides the gaming tax itself, which is really an income tax, is in play. So I think that you'll see activity on that. And will it tie-up construction? There's a lot of capacity in South China for construction, Tom. And I think that any projects that will come out of stream -- remember the government is limiting the amount of construction and is limiting the licenses. They've created an oligarchic, monopolistic kind of situation there, thank goodness to our benefit, along with the other folks that are there now. And there is no plan to expand that. So I think that construction is going to be done at a slower pace in the resort industry as a result of the government action. And so the private sector, the public sector will pick up the activity."

My team and I were curious having never visited the regional casinos of America. We decided that it was quite appropriate for us to take three or four days and go look at what was being done. In the hopes that we might learn something, and in fact we did. We spotted a few casinos that were really beautifully done. One, in particular, was the River City Casino owned by a medical company in St. Louis. A beautiful job done by Todd Lenihan, who is one of the designers that works for us. So we saw some nice things and we were just curious and our visit to these places was just as detached and objective as I have just said it, you should read absolutely nothing into it. Being spotted doesn't mean anything is afoot, there is no agenda here. Our next project will undoubtedly be in China, unless we get involved in Massachusetts. The deal in Philadelphia, as we said in our public statement, which I thought was very -- although concise, was very accurate. That we were encouraged by the institution of table game gaming at a 14% tax rate -- still a little tough for the slot machine tax rate, but that the gaming opportunities in Pennsylvania were interesting and stimulating. But the particular deal we were in, a deal in which we were a participant in someone else's company --we had never done that before -- became unattractive to us at the last minute. And it was the deal itself that caused us to back out. We backed out of a deal more than we backed out of Pennsylvania, and it was that simple. Great people, good friends, but when it was all said and done, the stars didn't line up for us. And that's what happens sometimes. You go into deals, you probe and you start to negotiate and then at some point, when you add everything up, you back out, and we did in this particular case."

The goal of broadening and bringing in new concessions in Macau in 2002, was to broaden the appeal of Macau in the Pacific Rim and around the rest of the world to bring new customers, not just baccarat players into the marketplace. And it is fascinating to see exactly how that process works. So I'm going to explain it with regard to Encore. Macau has junket operators that have a budget that we give them, a fixed amount of money to pay for their complementaries for their customers and their rooms. Unlike the Las Vegas method which just sort of pays for the rooms -- the house pays for the rooms. Now, when we built the Wynn Hotel in Macau, we did what a normal hotel operator does. We built a very commodious, large, generous, typical room at 626 square feet. That's bigger than Bellagio and the same as Wynn America. And then we built extravagant suites starting at 1800 feet and going up to 3000 . And those rooms were priced at $200-odd dollars and the suites well above a $1000, as you would expect in any hotel operation, including Shanghai and Hong Kong and Tokyo. And that's what we did as hoteliers in the hospitality business. It was very, very normal, right up the middle. The junket operators came to us, they came to Linda actually and said, ""Just a minute, that's not what we need. The typical room is beautiful, but it's not sexy enough for a gambler. And the suites are too expensive for us to waste all of our money at $1500 or $1200 a night. What we want is a very theatrical and beautiful room that we can buy for under $400, preferably at $350."" Well, there was no such product and all of a sudden, the pressures exerted by gambling interests caused us to create a product, an 1100 square-foot suite. We went and did it and that is Encore. Now, what we have done is built a room that is at $350 the most incredible piece of hospitality real estate in the world. And it has an enormous appeal to everybody, especially non-gambling people, because it represents the greatest bargain in the world. So now here's Macau, creating a product from its organic gambling roots that now changes the city and the market to be more appealing, more broad-based in its attractiveness to everybody. How interesting unintended consequences are, or maybe they are intended. But here is a product that was engendered by a gaming request that becomes a non-gaming plus for the city. The most lovely room in the world at a price that is almost half of what a regular room at the Peninsula costs, which would be less than half its size. Interesting how things work. I call that, and I've made this point to the government, organic growth. That is not the same thing as trying to pick up Las Vegas and drop it on Macau. That will never work. One is China, one is the United States and China is China is China. And in relationships with the people of that country, in relationships with your employees, you must not forget that it is not Las Vegas. It is not America. And so dropping the Las Vegas Strip into Macau was always an idea that did not respect the basic fundamental notion of Macau. And so we try in our observation of the people, what we have learned since '06, we could never have build Encore Wynn in '06. We did not have the hands-on experience with our customers. We learned from our customers, as all good businesses do, we learn from our customers and employees how to better run our business. And so what we have in Encore Macau is an organic product that grows in Macau out of the soil of Macau's own beginnings. And I'm glad that, that question was asked, Robin, because it gives us a chance to clarify what we've done. And I hope that adds some color to your question."

And we opened up the Beach Club on May 30, which was right in",1078,"Not much to say that isn't explained on our press release except this. Business is slightly better in Las Vegas. We're noticing a little improvement because we've been working on our hotel mix. And we opened up the Beach Club on May 30, which was right in the last section of the quarter. But that's helped and been profitable and is ahead of plan. And it also has a related nightclub called Surrender. It had a minimal impact on our other clubs. So that segment of our business is quite incredible in Las Vegas. And that's in sharp contrast to the softness in the market, the nightclub and younger-person recreational market represented by Tryst, Blush, XS, Surrender and the Beach Club. That's a business that could do over $150 million for us, with a profit margin in the mid-40s. So we're really happy about that. 
We opened up Encore on April 22 or 21, so we had the benefit of it for all but 40 days. Its impact on our operations in Macau was, interestingly enough, accretive. There's a number that I mentioned on these conference calls in the past that I consider to be the critical number in understanding the gaming industry in any given jurisdiction. That number we refer to as fair share. And you measure the percentage of equipment you have in a market like the Strip or Macau, and then you measure the percentage of revenue. If you have the same percentage of revenue as you do of equipment, then you have your fair share, and that's a one-to-one. To the extent that, that number is less than one, then you are a dormitory for your neighbors and a net donor to the neighbor. And if it's more than one-to-one, then you are a net receiver, and you've made a dormitory out of your neighbors. 
Prior to the opening of our Encore facility, we had 8.5% of the equipment and 10.5% or -- and 13% of roughly of the revenue. After, we didn't add much equipment, we went to 10% of the equipment, but we went to 17% of the revenue or 16% or 17%. Our ratio before Encore was 1.6. And I think that was by far the best in the market with our 500 tables now. Interestingly enough, we would have been very happy if we dropped down to 1.5. In fact, we went to 1.62. So not only do we add more equipment, but it increased our fair share ratio slightly. And that meant that our tables and our facility were well received. And that's, of course, gratifying for us. We're on the way to having the biggest year in the history of this company or any other company that I've been involved in, in my 42 years. 
So we're very happy. We had a board meeting a few minutes ago in this company. And after months of work, I was very proud to show the board of directors the Cotai project, which is now assembled. We now know what it's going to look like, what its components will be, where its romance and excitement will come from and how it will attempt, and I think very successfully attempt, to gain the upper hand competitively in a very competitive market, which is Cotai and Macau. 
So all of that, we’re underway now. We're finishing the back of the house, and we'll be starting the drawings for the foundation now almost in a matter of weeks. So we're a little ahead of schedule in where we thought we would be in Cotai. The design development period went much faster than it's gone in my career in the past, when we did all those other hotels, like Golden Nugget, Golden Nugget of Atlantic City, Beau Rivage, Treasure island, Mirage, Bellagio, Wynn, Encore in Las Vegas, Wynn in Macau and Encore in Macau. 
This was the best job, and it went the quickest, so -- and you can count up all those properties. But maybe the combined experience that our -- all of our design team has spent together all that time. And this time, interestingly enough, we used a different approach. We included in the design process the key operating executives in the casino and other departments, not just consulting them but having them at the table making the very meticulous A/B decisions. Designing one of these hotels, these massive places, is a whole myriad endless chain of A/B, yes/no decisions. And without them, it wouldn't be possible to get where we got as quickly as we did. And it was a very satisfying process. So we're excited about our new project. And we're all deeply involved with the next stage of getting it ready for groundbreaking. 
Those are my observations in general about what's happened in the last 90 days. We hope for continued improvement in Las Vegas. Or let me put it differently. We hope that we'll get smarter in Las Vegas in dealing with the peculiarities of this market and this very, very mercurial national economic economy that we're living with. The national economy and the political environment in the country as we head up to the elections is very, very touchy. And it is impacting all businesses. 
Today, we got a report at a -- various of our board committees meetings about the impact of the bill, the Financial Reform Bill that the President signed, with its hundreds of new committees and regulations to be formed, bodies and government bureaucrats to be created who will then tell us what we should be doing or what standards we have to live up to, both at the SEC and in other bureaus that have been created by this Financial Reform Act that the President was so enthused about. There isn't one single person in the United States of America that has a clue of where the Financial Reform Act will lead and what it really means. In spite of the fact that there are undoubtedly some good things in it, it has the potential of being a catastrophic interference with business, very much like the Healthcare Bill. So we're living through this along with the rest of America. And you can decide whether you want to be pessimistic or optimistic. You can decide whether the glass is half full or half empty. I'm at the point where I hope we just don't tip the glass over. 
So let's take questions."

And we're trading that business for a little stronger kind of Convention and Group business, which last year averaged somewhere around 12.5% of our mix. And it's trending closer to 17%, 18% now. So I don't know that this one data point is something that we can rely upon yet as a trend, but we're a little bit encouraged. And we hope that we’ll continue to see some modest improvement through the balance of the year."

And I don't want to get ahead of the people that run the board. As far as what the place is in terms of its market position, I was in China for half of June. And having worked on the hotel for quite some time, I thought it was time for me to check myself. And I got everybody that had anything to do with customers and the business in a big conference room and went around the room one person at a time and asked the very same question that you ask. Who are we? And what are we doing in Cotai? Where are we going? How are we going to present ourselves? Where do we fit in? What should the public expect? Because consistency and -- is very important to business, just as it is in life, so -- and I was really excited and very gratified that there are very diverse personalities in the group. And they were relaxed and comfortable enough to express themselves. And what was really fascinating was that to the man and woman that were in the room -- there were men and women. Every one of them, in their own way, said the same thing. Dance with the girl that you brought to the party, or dance with the guy that brought you, whatever that old anecdote is. We know who we are. We know what we do best. Stick to what we do best. Take advantage of Cotai, and do it better than anybody's ever done it, including us, in history. And that had been what Mr. DeRuyter Butler and I have been doing in our design development exercise to date. And when I went to the people that I work with there that really run the place, that was their advice as well. So that did it, and that ended the conversation. We are going beyond what we've been before in appealing to people of good taste and judgment. And we're going to just build the most amazing hotel that anybody’s ever seen. And it will be -- it will accommodate a lot of people. It will have between 1,500 and 1,600 rooms. Each of the rooms caters to a different segment. But in each case, the rooms are bigger and more beautiful than any we've ever built. And that's saying a lot, if you see Encore in Macau or Encore in Wynn. But we've gone a notch up in every respect. And we also were able to take complete and total advantage of our experience. Even when we built Encore in Macau, I made the point that, that tower was built as a result of our experience in Macau and therefore was really pointed right where it should be pointed. And the results since it opened proved that. But we still had to live with our urban environment and the land that we had downtown on the avenue, 24 July. Or June, 24 June. I always get that wrong. And this time, we had a blank sheet of paper. We could do it from scratch, armed with the experience and the knowledge gained from that experience, and, oh, boy, was it fun.

I guess, first, I want to make sure that my tone hasn't been misinterpreted. I’ve spoken to some modest improvement in Convention segment, but again, I don't want that to be misinterpreted as our being overly optimistic. So to answer your question directly, we don't hold back inventory. We look at the pace of demand by segment, and then we price our hotel in order to capitalize on what we think’s the opportunity. If the demand’s not there, then we tend to reduce the price and try and stimulate some demand. And if it is, well then, we’re able to yield it up. But as far as just generally holding back inventory, that's not our practice."

And just make it equal, whether it’s on a forty-year schedule or a ten-year schedule. Makes no difference to me. And you'll get to the fact that the money left over afterwards is greater with the smaller company, in terms of Macau. Bigger ain’t better. Better is better. Because when you borrow all that money, you got to pay it back. And when you build all of those facilities, you got to depreciate them and take care of them. So you better damn well make sure that they carry their weight. Now I'm a big fan of the development in Cotai and the things that my competitors have done. And they're making the future bright for Macau, and I'm proud to be part of it and proud to be their neighbor. But when you're analyzing what's going on, don't get confused. So we're a younger company than the Sands and MGM. And we are a little bit more, oh, steady, or a little slower. And it's the old hare and the turtle story. We're a little bit more like a turtle than a hare. But at the end of the day, we're going to build Macau, and it's going to be the Cotai project. And it's going to be a big increment to the wealth of our company. And we'll go somewhere else at that same time. And when you take the four- or eight-year difference in age between us and the Sands or the 20-year difference between us, 16-year difference between us and MGM, we'll catch all those guys. We'll catch all those guys. But we'll do it in a very steady, processional way. And each of our properties’ll have the kind of characteristics we're describing now. And we wouldn’t do as well if it wasn't for them. Don't misunderstand. I'm not deprecating them. But I am pointing out that we’re a different kind of company. And we’re going to stay that way. And maybe we don't move quite as fast as the other guys, but we don't borrow money quite as flagrantly. We don't take on projects that we can't really control down to really fine point. And maybe that disadvantages us competitively on occasion. And I'm willing to accept that myself in exchange for having security for my employees, predictability for my investors. I’m willing to make that exchange. I'm willing to take longer to get where I want to go. And where I want to go is where we dominate the gaming industry in terms of quality and performance."

And secondly, the reason our customer acquisition cost is up is that when companies, namely, our competitors, get desperate, there’s two things happen. They stop taking care of the building, and they increase their promotional allowances, to no avail, I might add. It's a one-way street to oblivion. But that's the natural knee-jerk reaction when they get desperate. They don't take care of their building, and they grasp for customers. And then it has an effect in the marketplace, and it takes everybody down. The person who starts this kind of stuff doesn't do themselves a bit of good. It takes awhile before they wake up to it, and then they get new executives or something. It's been the oldest story in the history of Las Vegas. We go through this cycle all the time with inexperienced help and unsophisticated management. They spend too much. They over-comp. They do all this stuff. This is as old as Methuselah around here. Maybe I'm getting old. I've been doing this for 42 years. But I’ve seen this about 11 times. And then there's a new group of young, inexperienced managers. Again, they fire the other guys, and the people, okay, well, we can’t do this anymore. Stop -- we can’t comp people that don't play that much. We can’t afford this. There’s no margin in this business. They got Blackjack at some of these hotels down to where the game isn’t worth it, the space it takes up on the floor. But what the hell? They got the tables. They got the dealers. They want to protect the jobs. They go and give the joint away. If their rooms are empty, they figure they've got nothing to lose, even if they’re new rooms."

But we've got these nightclubs, and there, we're able to get an advantage because it's the management of atmosphere. And so there, knowledge and experience really matter. A Blackjack game’s a Blackjack game. Unfortunately, a slot machine’s a slot machine. They're all a commodity. When we get into the areas where there's a difference that matters, like the way we treat people, how beautiful the places are, the management of environment, then the competition can't run with us, and we're safer. And that's where Linda's customers come in. They're brand-oriented. They’re very conscious of the little things, the quality of their experience, how clean the place is and how they're cared for. Nightclubs, believe it or not, in a strange way, it's a similar kind of thing. So those are the two segments where we hold our own."

Business is slightly better in Las Vegas. We're noticing a little improvement because we've been working on our hotel mix. And we opened up the Beach Club on May 30, which was right in",1081,"Not much to say that isn't explained on our press release except this. Business is slightly better in Las Vegas. We're noticing a little improvement because we've been working on our hotel mix. And we opened up the Beach Club on May 30, which was right in the last section of the quarter. But that's helped and been profitable and is ahead of plan. And it also has a related nightclub called Surrender. It had a minimal impact on our other clubs. So that segment of our business is quite incredible in Las Vegas. And that's in sharp contrast to the softness in the market, the nightclub and younger-person recreational market represented by Tryst, Blush, XS, Surrender and the Beach Club. That's a business that could do over $150 million for us, with a profit margin in the mid-40s. So we're really happy about that. 
We opened up Encore on April 22 or 21, so we had the benefit of it for all but 40 days. Its impact on our operations in Macau was, interestingly enough, accretive. There's a number that I mentioned on these conference calls in the past that I consider to be the critical number in understanding the gaming industry in any given jurisdiction. That number we refer to as fair share. And you measure the percentage of equipment you have in a market like the Strip or Macau, and then you measure the percentage of revenue. If you have the same percentage of revenue as you do of equipment, then you have your fair share, and that's a 1:1. To the extent that, that number is less than 1, then you are a dormitory for your neighbors and a net donor to the neighbor. And if it's more than 1, then you are a net receiver, and you've made a dormitory out of your neighbors. 
Prior to the opening of our Encore facility, we had 8.5% of the equipment and 10.5% or -- and 13% of roughly of the revenue. After, we didn't add much equipment, we went to 10% of the equipment, but we went to 17% of the revenue or 16% or 17%. Our ratio before Encore was 1.6. And I think that was by far the best in the market with our 500 tables now. Interestingly enough, we would have been very happy if we dropped down to 1.5. In fact, we went to 1.62. So not only do we add more equipment, but it increased our fair share ratio slightly. And that meant that our tables and our facility were well received. And that's, of course, gratifying for us. We're on the way to having the biggest year in the history of this company or any other company that I've been involved in, in my 42 years. 
So we're very happy. We had a board meeting a few minutes ago in this company. And after months of work, I was very proud to show the Board of Directors the Cotai project, which is now assembled. We now know what it's going to look like, what its components will be, where its romance and excitement will come from and how it will attempt, and I think very successfully attempt, to gain the upper hand competitively in a very competitive market, which is Cotai and Macau. 
So all of that, we’re under way now. We're finishing the back of the house, and we'll be starting the drawings for the foundation now almost in a matter of weeks. So we're a little ahead of schedule in where we thought we would be in Cotai. The design development period went much faster than it's gone in my career in the past, when we did all those other hotels, like Golden Nugget, Golden Nugget of Atlantic City, Beau Rivage, Treasure island, Mirage, Bellagio, Wynn, Encore in Las Vegas, Wynn in Macau and Encore in Macau. This was the best job, and it went the quickest, so -- and you can count up all those properties. But maybe the combined experience that our --, no, all of our design team has been together all that time. 
And this time, interestingly enough, we used a different approach. We included in the design process the key operating executives in the casino and other departments, not just consulting them but having them at the table making the very meticulous A/B decisions. Designing one of these hotels, these massive places, is a whole myriad endless chain of A/B, yes/no decisions. And without them, it wouldn't be possible to get where we got as quickly as we did. And it was a very satisfying process. So we're excited about our new project. And we're all deeply involved with the next stage of getting it ready for groundbreaking. 
Those are my observations in general about what's happened in the last 90 days. We hope for continued improvement in Las Vegas. Or let me put it differently. We hope that we'll get smarter in Las Vegas in dealing with the peculiarities of this market and this very, very mercurial national economic -- economy that we're living with. The national economy and the political environment in the country as we head up to the elections is very, very touchy. And it is impacting all businesses. 
Today, we got a report at a -- various of our board committees meetings about the impact of the bill, the financial reform bill that the President signed, with its hundreds of new committees and regulations to be formed, bodies and government bureaucrats to be created who will then tell us what we should be doing or what standards we have to live up to, both at the SEC and in other bureaus that have been created by this financial reform act that the President was so enthused about. There isn't one single person in the United States of America that has a clue of where the financial reform act will lead and what it really means. In spite of the fact that there are undoubtedly some good things in it, it has the potential of being a catastrophic interference with business, very much like the healthcare bill. So we're living through this along with the rest of America. And you can decide whether you want to be pessimistic or optimistic. You can decide whether the glass is half full or half empty. I'm at the point where I hope we just don't tip the glass over. 
So let's take questions."

And I don't want to get ahead of the people that run the board. As far as what the place is in terms of its market position, I was in China for half of June. And having worked on the hotel for quite some time, I thought it was time for me to check myself. And I got everybody that had anything to do with customers and the business in a big conference room and went around the room one person at a time and asked the very same question that you ask. Who are we? And what are we doing in Cotai? Where are we going? How are we going to present ourselves? Where do we fit in? What should the public expect? Because consistency and -- is very important to business, just as it is in life, so -- and I was really excited and very gratified that there are very diverse personalities in the group. And they were relaxed and comfortable enough to express themselves. And what was really fascinating was that to the man and woman that were in the room -- there were men and women. Every one of them, in their own way, said the same thing. Dance with the girl that you brought to the party, or dance with the guy that brought you, whatever that old anecdote is. We know who we are. We know what we do best. Stick to what we do best. Take advantage of Cotai, and do it better than anybody's ever done it, including us, in history. And that had been what Mr. DeRuyter Butler and I have been doing in our design development exercise to date. And when I went to the people that I work with there that really run the place, that was their advice as well. So that did it, and that ended the conversation. We are going beyond what we've been before in appealing to people of good taste and judgment. And we're going to just build the most amazing hotel that anybody’s ever seen. And it will be -- it will accommodate a lot of people. It will have between 1,500 and 1,600 rooms. Each of the rooms caters to a different segment. But in each case, the rooms are bigger and more beautiful than any we've ever built. And that's saying a lot, if you see Encore in Macau or Encore in Wynn. But we've gone a notch up in every respect. And we also were able to take complete and total advantage of our experience. Even when we built Encore in Macau, I made the point that, that tower was built as a result of our experience in Macau and therefore was really pointed right where it should be pointed. And the results since it opened proved that. But we still had to live with our urban environment and the land that we had downtown on the avenue, 24 July. Or June, 24 June. I always get that wrong. And this time, we had a blank sheet of paper. We could do it from scratch, armed with the experience and the knowledge gained from that experience, and, oh, boy, was it fun. And the choices we were able to make and the kinds of things we could offer our customers are truly scrumptious. So we're very excited. But that's who we’re going to be. We're going to be Wynn Resorts, Cotai. Wynn Cotai. We're not going to look like Sheraton or a Hilton or a different company. We're going to look like us. And you know what to expect when I say that."

I’ve spoken to some modest improvement in Convention segment, but again, I don't want that to be misinterpreted as our being overly optimistic. So to answer your question directly, we don't hold back inventory. We look at the pace of demand by segment, and then we price our hotel in order to capitalize on what we think’s the opportunity. If the demand’s not there, then we tend to reduce the price and try and stimulate some demand. And if it is, well then, we’re able to yield it up.

And secondly, the reason our customer acquisition cost is up is that when companies, namely, our competitors, get desperate, there’s two things happen. They stop taking care of the building, and they increase their promotional allowances, to no avail, I might add. It's a one-way street to oblivion. But that's the natural knee-jerk reaction when they get desperate. They don't take care of their building, and they grasp for customers. And then it has an effect in the marketplace, and it takes everybody down. The person who starts this kind of stuff doesn't do themselves a bit of good. It takes awhile before they wake up to it, and then they get new executives or something. It's been the oldest story in the history of Las Vegas. We go through this cycle all the time with inexperienced help and unsophisticated management. They spend too much. They over-comp. They do all this stuff. This is as old as Methuselah around here. Maybe I'm getting old. I've been doing this for 42 years. But I’ve seen this about 11 times. And then there's a new group of young, inexperienced managers. Again, they fire the other guys, and the people, okay, well, we can’t do this anymore. Stop -- we can’t comp people that don't play that much. We can’t afford this. There’s no margin in this business. They got Blackjack at some of these hotels down to where the game isn’t worth it, the space it takes up on the floor. But what the hell? They got the tables. They got the dealers. They want to protect the jobs. They go and give the joint away. If their rooms are empty, they figure they've got nothing to lose, even if they’re new rooms."

This is the first time on the conference call that I'm going to say I believe that we've seen the bottom in Las Vegas and I don't know how fast it",1149,"Okay, so we had a nice quarter. Made a couple of $100 million [ph] in Macau and not bad in Las Vegas either. This is the first time on the conference call that I'm going to say I believe that we've seen the bottom in Las Vegas and I don't know how fast it's going to get better, but I don't think it's going to get any worse and we had a really nice October too, and we had a record-breaking October in China. So business is pretty good actually all the way around. I think with two months to go, we're over $900 million of EBITDA, so speaking after my 40-odd years, first year we're going to go well over $1 billion in profit, in EBITDA at least. Although I stress again that this EBITDA number, which is what everybody likes to flash around is sort of a fake number because you have to pay your interest so lots got to do with what you make as how much money you owe. And depreciation isn't something that can be discarded. The more hotels you have, the more depreciation you've got. And the more money you have to spend taking care of these places, which reminds me that our remodeling and upgrading of the whole Las Vegas facility, the Wynn Las Vegas facility is proceeding greatly and the public is receiving it well. It's caused our room rates to go up in the newly remodeled and refurbished rooms. Our baccarat is closed until Christmas, it's being re-configured and we opened a restaurant a few days ago in Las Vegas called the Lakeside Grill, which is jumping and doing big business for us. And our night clubs continue to be as a group, probably the most successful on the planet. We're going to do $150 million or $160 million in Nightclub business in Las Vegas and make 45% profit or something.
So generally speaking, we like the way we're configured and we're happy that things aren't going to get worse. I think the election today is a great moment in stabilizing what has been overwhelming uncertainty and fear of this administration by businessmen around the country. And I think that the message that the American people are sending to Washington tonight is clear, decisive rejection of the policies that have put us in this position lately. And so I think that we're going to see a more positive, a more consumer confidence after tonight, as the administration sort of gets put in its place about overwhelming government control and ridiculous spending and stuff like that. We were damaged as a company by the healthcare bill. We have been the victim of 8% escalation of healthcare costs and our insurance program and we self-insure. We are healthcare provider. And we have never touched the benefits to our employees or raised their costs of their contributions in co-pay and such. Since we opened this hotel five years ago, we've just taken the hit on 8% a year. As a result of this ridiculous 2700-page fiasco that this Congress passed, our escalation of healthcare cost is going to close to 11% or 12%. Thank you very much, Congress, for all the help. They made it tougher on large businesses, small businesses, they've made it tougher on unions. In many cases, the culinary union contract with us, for example, and calls for a fixed contribution or cost of living escalation every year to be put into healthcare or wages whichever the union wants. And when it all goes to healthcare, their wages can't be increased. Or put in even a worse situation that the amount of money that we can give the union to cover their healthcare escalation doesn't equal what the union has to pay out in its policy to our employees. So the healthcare bill was a fiasco across the Board. We can only hope that maybe when the new legislation reconvenes, they will somehow undo the damage that has been done by this ill-conceived piece of legislation, which is very important to companies like ourselves, which employ and ensure tens of thousands of people. So I think that the elections have very positive moment and maybe we'll get some relief from the government in the months ahead.
The President, as you know, told everybody not to go to Las Vegas in more or less terms and that didn't help us. So all of this is going to get cleared up I think now, and we're filling terrific about China now. I think I'll finish my part of this meeting before it get into questions about Cotai.
My designed partners and I have been working on an average of 6 hours a day as many as 12 this summer, but six hours a day every week for months now. And maybe it was because of experience and maybe it was because of opportunity, but it's gone much faster than it usually has. And we have a plan and we have our building drawn. We haven't finished construction documents for bidding, but we're ready to begin and we will. We're doing soil testing on the location of the tower as we speak in China. It has begun. And site clearance begins in a few weeks. And we're off to the races with the Cotai project, which is a stunning, remarkable piece of business. And it's been the most fun, the most challenging and the most rewarding experience of my 42-year career in this job. And I believe that it's a breakaway property physically and conceptually and operationally compared to any other facility of its kind in the world. I'm very, very proud of it. And we're going to be showing pictures and models in a few weeks as we complete renderings and other visual studies that would allow us to explain this hotel to the public. But it is a dilly. And it's going to be the photo-op of China's gaming scene in much a way that our other properties in the past to become the photo-op of each community. It will introduce concepts and ideas into the casino architecture and casino organization of parts as they relate to the whole that have not been seen before. So I'm very happy. And it will also introduce concepts in terms of a room product that have not been seen before.
Now I know I'm craving a lot of expectation with that kind of talk, and I wouldn't be doing it if I haven't seen the building and know that we could keep that promise. On the phone call like this, it's not possible to create, to show you pictures, but they will be available soon enough. And I think that since everybody is sort of done, what they're going to do, it will be tough for everybody to copy it. Now we'll take questions."

Some of the other fellas are a little desperate about their performance. And they've been trying to buy business. I guess in order to make an impression for an IPO or something, it's a scheme that doesn't work very well. They increased the top line but they don't increase the bottom line. October was the best month we ever had. We made over $90 million last month in Macau. And so they don't really lay a glove on us. We've got our own customers. And you've all written about the fact that we tend to be resistant to such change. Our fair share increases, that comparison of the percentage of tables to the percentage of money compared to the percentage of equipment. Our fair share improves, our competitive posture improves with competition. It doesn't deteriorate. So we like the fact that the market is strong and growing and vital. We would prefer that the competition adhere to the rules, but we'll leave that to the government. But we run our business based upon creating a good experience for our customers and that's what pays off. So with regard to Cotai's costs, we know what the building looks like now, and how where all the parts are and how they relate to one another. We don't want to publish our estimated budget for the building until we've had a chance to finish certain parts of the back of the house that we have to place. And then we're going to do a final take-off and we're going to budget the footage. And I'll do that and have a budget by the next time we have a conference call in three months. But it's a little early for me to say it, but I could say it's between $2 billion and $3 billion, probably closer to $2.5 billion, but I'm not sure. I'd like to finish doing the whole take-off. We'll break ground and we'll actually get started -- because remember it's a landfill. We'll be working on the site and what is the beginning of the construction of the project within a few weeks. We'll do site clearance immediately. We're doing the test borings this week because we know the exact location of the high rise. We'll be cleaning up the site and starting the remediation. Remember, it's a dump in effect, it's a landfill. They dump all kinds of junk on the ground and they put dirt over it. And when the ground settles unevenly because of the unstable base, and in order to put our foundation and we have to clean that stuff out and go through it with pilings and other forms of foundational structure. And all that will be done during the year of '11. We're underway and we'll finish and be open for business in '15, so four years from now. That's what the whole thing takes. And we'll show you the building in great detail probably next time, the end of the next quarter. We'll start using showing all the pretty pictures and stuff that might Board saw today. We had a board meeting a few minutes ago and I showed the building to the directors, enjoying it as we have been. Did I answer your question, Joe?"

It's a strange thing for Westerners to understand how it works in Macau sometimes. You lease the land with ground rent from the government for a specific purpose and you must comply with that purpose when you ask for the concession. And the amount of money you pay for the concession is directly related to the purpose and the amount of footage and the description of the footage on the property. They commit to the property for you in advance and allow you, in our case, to put a fence around it, to build a warehouse. The final lease payment is determined by the publication of the plan in the gazette. Prior to that time, you're encouraged to go ahead and begin. And we do. And hotels are built that way. Sometimes the gazette process trails, but in all cases, you are given instructions by the government in advance on what to do and what you're allowed to do as we have been given in the past two years. So that's why there's a warehouse and plans and our procedure has gone all the way to the end of the regulatory process to execute the final lease and that will happen in the next several weeks. But as far as the commitment that you have to use the property and do your project, you get that way in advance, and we've got that. And it comes in writing as a matter of fact. That came quite a while ago. So there's stability, there's predictability there. Again, I stress, it's not like here we nobody knows what to expect tomorrow because of our particular political problems we've had in the past two years with this administration. But in Macau, it's not that way at all. I mean there's rules and there's procedures and you follow them. And then you go about your business."

Once the businessmen and -- all this cash in America is being held on the side, it maybe a couple of trillion. It's locked up. Unfortunately, most of it is being lent to the government at no interest and treasuries. Between the family and the company, we have probably couple of billion dollars in treasury bills with no interest. Nobody wants to take their bankroll out of their pocket because they don't know what's going to happen to them. The minute that this election is straightened out and this administration is properly put in its place, I believe there's going to be a change in consumer confidence in America. And if they're smart enough in Washington to not touch with the tax rate that we enjoy now, you will see businesses heave a sigh of relief and there'll be a lot of unexpected good things happen. If this money that's on the side comes out, it's not only good for Las Vegas, it's good for America. And if we get some people in there that stops squandering money, and the government will even be in better shape. And we get some intelligent leadership on entitlements, there's going to wave of confidence and optimism in America that will radically and rapidly change the doldrums that we're in. One of the problems we got is that the people who are in elected positions in Washington do not have the intellectual firepower to deal with the problems or understand them in America today. The damned farm system for the Washington is the state legislature. For example, that really affects our business, we've been told over and over again by the President that everybody who's got $250,000 a year income or more is a rich person that should pay their fair share, presumably because we're not now. Well, the fact of the matter is that the personal tax rate is the business tax of small and medium businesses in America. And the people that are making $2 million and $3 million and $4 million in subchapter S corporations are proprietorships or partnerships. They're paying their taxes as individuals. They're subtracting their income expenses and then paying a tax as ordinary tax rates and then opening up shops and new offices with what the balance of the $2 million or $3 million or $4 million or $5 million they're making. And incidentally, they're not really making the $2 million or $3 million or $4 million or $5 million. Usually, 25% or 30% of that is tied up in inventory or accounts receivable. And yet, in spite of this overwhelming truth, the President of the United States and leaders of the parties that support him keep calling everybody who files a tax return with $250,000 or more a rich person. It is a total and deliberate misstatement of the structure of the American economy. It's a form of hypocrisy that defies understanding. It's also an insult to the intelligence of the American people. An insult, which I think is going to be answered as this day proceeds very clearly by the voters. But this kind of foolishness and hypocrisy has to stop. And that's when people come to Las Vegas, to spend money, go shopping and do all the other things they do, it will loosen things up. And we call all of these consumer confidence. Right now, it's consumer disgust and fear of -- when our leaders in Washington are guilty of blatant hypocrisy, anybody with a brain in their head is frightened by it. And I think that when that disappears, if it does tonight, we're going to see a much a more optimistic frame of mind in the United States that will directly benefit Las Vegas. And if Harry Reid survives his challenge in this election, I think Harry will go back to a Senate with a different flavor. And I think that maybe Harry will be in a position to help Nevada more than he has in the past with the different constituency in the Senate and it will be good for Las Vegas. Those are the things to look at for this town. We are very much a sounding board for America."

And incidentally, Tom, I don't know how, since you and I are talking to each other in front of everybody else, I don't know after tonight how this administration could possibly interpret the mood of America any differently than what the results are clearly going to show, which is a rebuke and repudiation of this move towards massive government expansion overcontrol and ridiculous, ridiculous is the only word for it, spending. And I don't know how this President or any member of that administration or politician, regardless of party, could stand up and not get the message from the citizens of this country that, that stuff doesn't go. It's got to change, Democrat or Republican. And I vote both ways. It's got to stop or America is headed for problems that -- I mean, one of the reasons I'm so angry about this, and there's no question I am, is that I have always had a sort of a protective attitude towards my employees. I consider us a family. And I've always thought that we, as a company, if we stayed healthy, that we could protect our employees in every way possible. And now I see the government destroying the value of the dollar, lowering the quality of life and the standard of living for the working class of America, the very people that they're supposed to represent. And sure, we're going to give paychecks out, but they're going to be $0.60 on a dollar paychecks. And all these people are coming up for Social Security and Medicare. They're going to get paid with $0.60 and $0.70 on a dollar, dollars. I remember hearing the President say that the middle class has gone down and the rich get richer. The reason the middle-class relative position deteriorates, if it does at all, is because of the government. Not because of people that creates jobs and build companies. It's because of the government. And what happened now is the American public has awakened to this miserable truth. And they see right through with phony rhetoric. And if that's true, we're going to get a different kind of leadership in Congress that recognizes what it takes to run this country properly using common sense. And that's the reason that I think that this stinging rebuke that the President is going to get tonight has to have a proper effect on him and other like-thinking hypocrites."

So obviously, they go hand-in-hand. One is giving more incentive, which is commissioned back to the customer to bring the business. The second is you need credit. You need to give them facility to get the business. So they use both of them hand-in-hand to gain short-term market share, whether it's for IPO or they're trying to do different purpose to gain that short-term market share. However, the danger with that is first, we believe in stability. Obviously, if you give something more weight on the commission, then you have to cut something back, whether it's salary or renovation dollars. So you're taking -- there's only so much dollars in the 100% that you can give away. So if you're giving it too much away on the commission, then you got to cut back to other places. That creates unstable business model for the whole operation. But second, it's not good for the customers where you go in and out. Today I'm giving you more and then tomorrow, as it's found out that it's not a profitable business, now I'm going to take it back. It doesn't buy long-term loyalty with the customer or the junket. And that's what we do well. If you look at people always talking about market share, they said, ""Have we lost market share?"" Actually, what's the growth of the whole Macau market, we maintained our market share quite well. And that speaks a lot with even additional tables from Encore. So our penetration level had actually increased with the additional table. People don't look at that, they just keep saying as a whole market share has decreased. But in a growing market that's grown 60%, maintaining market share is already a lot of dollars and we maintain very healthy business model, where we take all those additional business to the same profitability down to the bottom line."

The answer comes back from Linda and company and Ian and company and JD and Doreen and Frankie Zhao [ph] and all my colleagues, no, Steve, we're not going to cannibalize it. This market growth, we are right on schedule. We didn't build each one of the things we built. We built in due course. We let sands go first with the one that they built with the down and dirty quick one, the sands. We took our time and we opened Wynn, and then we took our time and we added tower at Encore and our penetration got better. We didn't cannibalize anything. We increased our fair share. We planned and took our time and we're ready now to build and we're starting to build Cotai because we knew, understanding market rates of growth and seeing that the operation of our competitors have been learning from that, that we would arrive at the date of opening that would allow us to achieve parity with our operation on the peninsula. And grow intelligently with our feet underneath us, gathered up and collected, like a good show horse that goes over a jump, collected. So I think that we're going to make a lot of money on Cotai. I think we're going to have 10,000 or so, 1,200, 15,000 employees and it's going to be a very stable happy experience because we did it in due course. We didn't try and do it all at once. We didn't think it being master of the universe. We thought only of one thing. How do you build with a solid foundation, a steady, predictable, long-term business and be a useful part of the community to be welcomed as a good addition to the community. To sort of be part of keeping the promise of the plan, in this case, of the government of Macau. And that's a slower, more carefully studied and considered process. And that's why our third hotel is going to open up in four years. The first one was in '06, the second one was in '09 or '10 and the third is going to be in '14 or '15. That's the arc of our development in China, but those hotels will be there forever, long after I'm gone. When my time is up in this world, those hotels are still be viable wonderful businesses providing security for their employees and the people that run them and the shareholders. And as far as giving you more information about Macau, it looks like I want to do when I got the pictures. I've shown it to all of us here know what the hotel looks like and what it got in it. But to dribble it out conversationally in this format, I think there's better ways of us doing it. I think we probably will call for an investment conference, one in China and one in Las Vegas, that Matt and I will put on with Linda and Ian and the guys and all of us. And we'll show what we're going to do. We'll have a model and we'll unveil its beauty to our joy and to the chagrin of our competitors."

How many developers have been given the opportunity to build really remarkable places for people to visit the way most of us in this industry in China have been blessed. And for that matter, in Singapore, K.T. Lim and Sheldon Adelson's operations are enjoying a wonderful opportunity to create wonderful places because Asia has offered up this moment historically to our industry. It's wonderfully exciting and I think that all of us, whether I'm speaking for Sheldon and K.T., my friend K.T. at Genting Resorts World, is the name of his company or whether I'm speaking for my gang here, my family.

That's what happened. But we have a model of Encore Macau on the Wynn Macau model. We attached it and we had it on display upstairs in the Executive offices and showed it to everybody. Anybody could've seen it. So we don't intend to keep it. Once we design the hotel, we show it and if somebody wants to go, I remember going to Atlantic City this past year, I was making a tour of various jurisdictions to learn about what was going on in America because I haven't done it in so long. And I was walking out of the Borganta, which I want to look at and there next-door was Harra's, with a curved tower and asymmetrical roof, a very poor, homely copy of the Wynn Las Vegas. And I called up Gary Loveman, and I said, ""Hey man, have you no shame?"" I mean, and in the building was in the wrong proportion. In order to do what we do with our building, it has to be horizontal in its proportion or doesn't look right. And this one was verticals, which just looked like sort of a tall rectangle with point on one end. And he said he gave me an answer, he said ""Well, duplication is a serious form of flattery."" I found that relatively unsatisfactory answer. I think maybe someone should try to do their own thing instead of doing bad copies of other people's things. But we do give the boys a chance to louse up what they think we're doing. But there always one hotel behind and that reminds me of the story when Waylon Jennings met a kid that imitated the western singer. He told the kid, ""Listen, I know you're a nice kid and you sing good and you're good-looking, but if you do well in Jennings, I'm already doing well in Jennings and you got to be yourself if you want to be successful in life, because I'll tell you something, son, and the boy's name was Wendell Atkins. Is it Wendell? Is it Waylon Jennings? If you do me, you're always going to be one record behind. And I thought that was a great funny remark. I was standing there when he said it. So if people copy our hotels, they're always one hotel behind. It's okay with me. Linda?"

Made a couple of $100 million [ph] in Macau and not bad in Las Vegas either. This is the first time on the conference call that I'm going to say I believe that we've seen the bottom in Las Vegas and I don't know how fast it's going to get better, but I don't think it's going to get any worse and we had a really nice October too, and we had a record-breaking October in China. So business is pretty good actually all the way around. I think with two months to go, we're over $900 million of EBITDA, so speaking after my 40-odd years, first year we're going to go well over $1 billion in profit, in EBITDA at least. Although I stress again that this EBITDA number, which is what everybody likes to flash around is sort of a fake number because you have to pay your interest so lots got to do with what you make as how much money you owe. And depreciation isn't something that can be discarded. The more hotels you have, the more depreciation you've got. And the more money you have to spend taking care of these places, which reminds me that our remodeling and upgrading of the whole Las Vegas facility, the Wynn Las Vegas facility is proceeding greatly and the public is receiving it well. It's caused our room rates to go up in the newly remodeled and refurbished rooms. Our baccarat is closed until Christmas, it's being re-configured and we opened a restaurant a few days ago in Las Vegas called the Lakeside Grill, which is jumping and doing big business for us. And our night clubs continue to be as a group, probably the most successful on the planet. We're going to do $150 million or $160 million in Nightclub business in Las Vegas and make 45% profit or something.
So generally speaking, we like the way we're configured and we're happy that things aren't going to get worse. I think the election today is a great moment in stabilizing what has been overwhelming uncertainty and fear of this administration by businessmen around the country. And I think that the message that the American people are sending to Washington tonight is clear, decisive rejection of the policies that have put us in this position lately. And so I think that we're going to see a more positive, a more consumer confidence after tonight, as the administration sort of gets put in its place about overwhelming government control and ridiculous spending and stuff like that. We were damaged as a company by the healthcare bill. We have been the victim of 8% escalation of healthcare costs and our insurance program and we self-insure. We are healthcare provider. And we have never touched the benefits to our employees or raised their costs of their contributions in co-pay and such. Since we opened this hotel five years ago, we've just taken the hit on 8% a year. As a result of this ridiculous 2700-page fiasco that this Congress passed, our escalation of healthcare cost is going to close to 11% or 12%. Thank you very much, Congress, for all the help. They made it tougher on large businesses, small businesses, they've made it tougher on unions. In many cases, the culinary union contract with us, for example, and calls for a fixed contribution or cost of living escalation every year to be put into healthcare or wages whichever the union wants. And when it all goes to healthcare, their wages can't be increased. Or put in even a worse situation that the amount of money that we can give the union to cover their healthcare escalation doesn't equal what the union has to pay out in its policy to our employees. So the healthcare bill was a fiasco across the Board. We can only hope that maybe when the new legislation reconvenes, they will somehow undo the damage that has been done by this ill-conceived piece of legislation, which is very important to companies like ourselves, which employ and ensure tens of thousands of people. So I think that the elections have very positive moment and maybe we'll get some relief from the government in the months ahead.
The President, as you know, told everybody not to go to Las Vegas in more or less terms and that didn't help us. So all of this is going to get cleared up I think now, and we're filling terrific about China now. I think I'll finish my part of this meeting before it get into questions about Cotai.
My designed partners and I have been working on an average of 6 hours a day as many as 12 this summer, but six hours a day every week for months now. And maybe it was because of experience and maybe it was because of opportunity, but it's gone much faster than it usually has. And we have a plan and we have our building drawn. We haven't finished construction documents for bidding, but we're ready to begin and we will. We're doing soil testing on the location of the tower as we speak in China. It has begun. And site clearance begins in a few weeks. And we're off to the races with the Cotai project, which is a stunning, remarkable piece of business. And it's been the most fun, the most challenging and the most rewarding experience of my 42-year career in this job. And I believe that it's a breakaway property physically and conceptually and operationally compared to any other facility of its kind in the world. I'm very, very proud of it. And we're going to be showing pictures and models in a few weeks as we complete renderings and other visual studies that would allow us to explain this hotel to the public. But it is a dilly. And it's going to be the photo-op of China's gaming scene in much a way that our other properties in the past to become the photo-op of each community. It will introduce concepts and ideas into the casino architecture and casino organization of parts as they relate to the whole that have not been seen before. So I'm very happy. And it will also introduce concepts in terms of a room product that have not been seen before.
Now I know I'm craving a lot of expectation with that kind of talk, and I wouldn't be doing it if I haven't seen the building and know that we could keep that promise. On the phone call like this, it's not possible to create, to show you pictures, but they will be available soon enough. And I think that since everybody is sort of done, what they're going to do, it will be tough for everybody to copy it. Now we'll take questions.

I guess in order to make an impression for an IPO or something, it's a scheme that doesn't work very well. They increased the top line but they don't increase the bottom line. October was the best month we ever had. We made over $90 million last month in Macau. And so they don't really lay a glove on us. We've got our own customers. And you've all written about the fact that we tend to be resistant to such change. Our fair share increases, that comparison of the percentage of tables to the percentage of money compared to the percentage of equipment. Our fair share improves, our competitive posture improves with competition. It doesn't deteriorate. So we like the fact that the market is strong and growing and vital. We would prefer that the competition adhere to the rules, but we'll leave that to the government. But we run our business based upon creating a good experience for our customers and that's what pays off. So with regard to Cotai's costs, we know what the building looks like now, and how where all the parts are and how they relate to one another. We don't want to publish our estimated budget for the building until we've had a chance to finish certain parts of the back of the house that we have to place. And then we're going to do a final take-off and we're going to budget the footage. And I'll do that and have a budget by the next time we have a conference call in three months. But it's a little early for me to say it, but I could say it's between $2 billion and $3 billion, probably closer to $2.5 billion, but I'm not sure. I'd like to finish doing the whole take-off. We'll break ground and we'll actually get started -- because remember it's a landfill. We'll be working on the site and what is the beginning of the construction of the project within a few weeks. We'll do site clearance immediately. We're doing the test borings this week because we know the exact location of the high rise. We'll be cleaning up the site and starting the remediation. Remember, it's a dump in effect, it's a landfill. They dump all kinds of junk on the ground and they put dirt over it. And when the ground settles unevenly because of the unstable base, and in order to put our foundation and we have to clean that stuff out and go through it with pilings and other forms of foundational structure. And all that will be done during the year of '11. We're underway and we'll finish and be open for business in '15, so four years from now. That's what the whole thing takes. And we'll show you the building in great detail probably next time, the end of the next quarter. We'll start using showing all the pretty pictures and stuff that might Board saw today. We had a board meeting a few minutes ago and I showed the building to the directors, enjoying it as we have been. Did I answer your question, Joe?

The final lease payment is determined by the publication of the plan in the gazette. Prior to that time, you're encouraged to go ahead and begin. And we do. And hotels are built that way. Sometimes the gazette process trails, but in all cases, you are given instructions by the government in advance on what to do and what you're allowed to do as we have been given in the past two years. So that's why there's a warehouse and plans and our procedure has gone all the way to the end of the regulatory process to execute the final lease and that will happen in the next several weeks. But as far as the commitment that you have to use the property and do your project, you get that way in advance, and we've got that. And it comes in writing as a matter of fact. That came quite a while ago. So there's stability, there's predictability there. Again, I stress, it's not like here we nobody knows what to expect tomorrow because of our particular political problems we've had in the past two years with this administration. But in Macau, it's not that way at all. I mean there's rules and there's procedures and you follow them. And then you go about your business.

So if you run through the math, you'll see that that's anywhere in the neighborhood of less than 50% of the cash flow. So when I think about financing it, we'll probably put an extra add-on to our bank facility down there. Once we really know what the final budget is, and then use the substantial free cash flow. But what you give with Wynn Macau is, you get both the dividend-paying company and the growth of Cotai. So we want to be able to execute and we will execute both.

And going into next year, we're looking at 65% of our convention room nights on the books. So we're happy to see that segment is going to return to somewhere between 18%, 19% of our overall occupancy. And also we're seeing some rate improvement. The hardest hit in terms of the segments, in terms of the overall rate decline and we saw that bottomed out. We're starting to see some rate improvement there as well.

We try and have the best hotel in every market that we're in. That means our customers are discriminating, well-to-do, very intelligent people. And they have money. And in the United States of America, people with money have been in the defensive crouch if they run a business because of the administration in Washington. It's an anti-business, socialistic and aggressively anti-business. We've never seen like this in our life. Where there's a cross here, printed on the back of anybody that creates jobs or makes money. My customers, my guests are frightened of these people. And so they are clutching their bankrolls and hiding out. Now what's going to affect the Las Vegas and companies like MGM and The Venetian and myself, our gang will be, the phrase they use is consumer confidence. But its absence of fear. Once the businessmen and -- all this cash in America is being held on the side, it maybe a couple of trillion. It's locked up. Unfortunately, most of it is being lent to the government at no interest and treasuries. Between the family and the company, we have probably couple of billion dollars in treasury bills with no interest. Nobody wants to take their bankroll out of their pocket because they don't know what's going to happen to them. The minute that this election is straightened out and this administration is properly put in its place, I believe there's going to be a change in consumer confidence in America. And if they're smart enough in Washington to not touch with the tax rate that we enjoy now, you will see businesses heave a sigh of relief and there'll be a lot of unexpected good things happen. If this money that's on the side comes out, it's not only good for Las Vegas, it's good for America. And if we get some people in there that stops squandering money, and the government will even be in better shape. And we get some intelligent leadership on entitlements, there's going to wave of confidence and optimism in America that will radically and rapidly change the doldrums that we're in. One of the problems we got is that the people who are in elected positions in Washington do not have the intellectual firepower to deal with the problems or understand them in America today. The damned farm system for the Washington is the state legislature. For example, that really affects our business, we've been told over and over again by the President that everybody who's got $250,000 a year income or more is a rich person that should pay their fair share, presumably because we're not now. Well, the fact of the matter is that the personal tax rate is the business tax of small and medium businesses in America. And the people that are making $2 million and $3 million and $4 million in subchapter S corporations are proprietorships or partnerships. They're paying their taxes as individuals. They're subtracting their income expenses and then paying a tax as ordinary tax rates and then opening up shops and new offices with what the balance of the $2 million or $3 million or $4 million or $5 million they're making. And incidentally, they're not really making the $2 million or $3 million or $4 million or $5 million. Usually, 25% or 30% of that is tied up in inventory or accounts receivable. And yet, in spite of this overwhelming truth, the President of the United States and leaders of the parties that support him keep calling everybody who files a tax return with $250,000 or more a rich person. It is a total and deliberate misstatement of the structure of the American economy. It's a form of hypocrisy that defies understanding. It's also an insult to the intelligence of the American people. An insult, which I think is going to be answered as this day proceeds very clearly by the voters. But this kind of foolishness and hypocrisy has to stop. And that's when people come to Las Vegas, to spend money, go shopping and do all the other things they do, it will loosen things up. And we call all of these consumer confidence. Right now, it's consumer disgust and fear of -- when our leaders in Washington are guilty of blatant hypocrisy, anybody with a brain in their head is frightened by it. And I think that when that disappears, if it does tonight, we're going to see a much a more optimistic frame of mind in the United States that will directly benefit Las Vegas. And if Harry Reid survives his challenge in this election, I think Harry will go back to a Senate with a different flavor. And I think that maybe Harry will be in a position to help Nevada more than he has in the past with the different constituency in the Senate and it will be good for Las Vegas. Those are the things to look at for this town. We are very much a sounding board for America.

And I don't know how this President or any member of that administration or politician, regardless of party, could stand up and not get the message from the citizens of this country that, that stuff doesn't go. It's got to change, Democrat or Republican. And I vote both ways. It's got to stop or America is headed for problems that -- I mean, one of the reasons I'm so angry about this, and there's no question I am, is that I have always had a sort of a protective attitude towards my employees. I consider us a family. And I've always thought that we, as a company, if we stayed healthy, that we could protect our employees in every way possible. And now I see the government destroying the value of the dollar, lowering the quality of life and the standard of living for the working class of America, the very people that they're supposed to represent. And sure, we're going to give paychecks out, but they're going to be $0.60 on a dollar paychecks. And all these people are coming up for Social Security and Medicare. They're going to get paid with $0.60 and $0.70 on a dollar, dollars. I remember hearing the President say that the middle class has gone down and the rich get richer. The reason the middle-class relative position deteriorates, if it does at all, is because of the government. Not because of people that creates jobs and build companies. It's because of the government. And what happened now is the American public has awakened to this miserable truth. And they see right through with phony rhetoric. And if that's true, we're going to get a different kind of leadership in Congress that recognizes what it takes to run this country properly using common sense. And that's the reason that I think that this stinging rebuke that the President is going to get tonight has to have a proper effect on him and other like-thinking hypocrites.

I think the worst mistake someone could make is use the credit as a marketing tool and to buy the business. And its stability. You can't do whether it's credit or incentive for short-term purpose. And there are operators, whether they're trying to boost up their revenue for whatever purpose that they go in and out of increased commission or credit.

So obviously, they go hand-in-hand. One is giving more incentive, which is commissioned back to the customer to bring the business. The second is you need credit. You need to give them facility to get the business. So they use both of them hand-in-hand to gain short-term market share, whether it's for IPO or they're trying to do different purpose to gain that short-term market share. However, the danger with that is first, we believe in stability. Obviously, if you give something more weight on the commission, then you have to cut something back, whether it's salary or renovation dollars. So you're taking -- there's only so much dollars in the 100% that you can give away. So if you're giving it too much away on the commission, then you got to cut back to other places. That creates unstable business model for the whole operation. But second, it's not good for the customers where you go in and out. Today I'm giving you more and then tomorrow, as it's found out that it's not a profitable business, now I'm going to take it back. It doesn't buy long-term loyalty with the customer or the junket. And that's what we do well. If you look at people always talking about market share, they said, ""Have we lost market share?"" Actually, what's the growth of the whole Macau market, we maintained our market share quite well. And that speaks a lot with even additional tables from Encore. So our penetration level had actually increased with the additional table. People don't look at that, they just keep saying as a whole market share has decreased. But in a growing market that's grown 60%, maintaining market share is already a lot of dollars and we maintain very healthy business model, where we take all those additional business to the same profitability down to the bottom line.

You get bad debts and what happens is, the company has fired the dimwitted executive that did it. I been watching this for 42 years and you see one President after another get dumped one marketing tie after another gets switched. And then a new guy comes in or a new lady comes in and sanity returns and the bottom line returns and they realize finally, and irrevocably, there is only one way known to mankind to increase business, and that is by increasing the quality of customer experience. This market in China is a repeat market, they come once a week. And the quality of their experience is the only thing that matters. Consistency is what they depend upon. Predictability is what they want, just like everything else alike. Predictability, consistency, when you get the short-term thinking nitwits jumping around, it just means that pretty soon there'll be a new name on the business card. I've been watching it for 42 years, I mean, it's very difficult. It's almost unimaginable that you would need to explain at this day and age that all the casinos in Macau were paying the right amount of commission. That is to say the most amount they could give and maintain a stable business. And then some Yahoo shows up and says, ""What go up by 20%?"" We just discovered juicy fruit. It is the dumbest thing I've ever seen. We watched this happen because there's always a new dumbbell. And then there's an ex-dumbbell and until finally they end up with someone who knows how to run the business properly and they pay attention to what really does increase market share or market penetration and that is the quality of the customer experience. And that is all there is to say about this subject. And if you see somebody given more money away than the rest of us can give to attract the customers more promotional allowances, then you are looking at the walking dead. Call that person a zombie because their days are numbered.

And when I sit with them and say who are we going to be in Cotai and can we afford to have the two places, are we just going to cannibalize the one we've got. The answer comes back from Linda and company and Ian and company and JD and Doreen and Frankie Zhao [ph] and all my colleagues, no, Steve, we're not going to cannibalize it. This market growth, we are right on schedule. We didn't build each one of the things we built. We built in due course. We let sands go first with the one that they built with the down and dirty quick one, the sands. We took our time and we opened Wynn, and then we took our time and we added tower at Encore and our penetration got better. We didn't cannibalize anything. We increased our fair share. We planned and took our time and we're ready now to build and we're starting to build Cotai because we knew, understanding market rates of growth and seeing that the operation of our competitors have been learning from that, that we would arrive at the date of opening that would allow us to achieve parity with our operation on the peninsula. And grow intelligently with our feet underneath us, gathered up and collected, like a good show horse that goes over a jump, collected. So I think that we're going to make a lot of money on Cotai. I think we're going to have 10,000 or so, 1,200, 15,000 employees and it's going to be a very stable happy experience because we did it in due course. We didn't try and do it all at once. We didn't think it being master of the universe. We thought only of one thing. How do you build with a solid foundation, a steady, predictable, long-term business and be a useful part of the community to be welcomed as a good addition to the community. To sort of be part of keeping the promise of the plan, in this case, of the government of Macau. And that's a slower, more carefully studied and considered process. And that's why our third hotel is going to open up in four years. The first one was in '06, the second one was in '09 or '10 and the third is going to be in '14 or '15. That's the arc of our development in China, but those hotels will be there forever, long after I'm gone. When my time is up in this world, those hotels are still be viable wonderful businesses providing security for their employees and the people that run them and the shareholders. And as far as giving you more information about Macau, it looks like I want to do when I got the pictures. I've shown it to all of us here know what the hotel looks like and what it got in it. But to dribble it out conversationally in this format, I think there's better ways of us doing it. I think we probably will call for an investment conference, one in China and one in Las Vegas, that Matt and I will put on with Linda and Ian and the guys and all of us. And we'll show what we're going to do. We'll have a model and we'll unveil its beauty to our joy and to the chagrin of our competitors.

That's what happened. But we have a model of Encore Macau on the Wynn Macau model. We attached it and we had it on display upstairs in the Executive offices and showed it to everybody. Anybody could've seen it. So we don't intend to keep it. Once we design the hotel, we show it and if somebody wants to go, I remember going to Atlantic City this past year, I was making a tour of various jurisdictions to learn about what was going on in America because I haven't done it in so long. And I was walking out of the Borganta, which I want to look at and there next-door was Harra's, with a curved tower and asymmetrical roof, a very poor, homely copy of the Wynn Las Vegas. And I called up Gary Loveman, and I said, ""Hey man, have you no shame?"" I mean, and in the building was in the wrong proportion. In order to do what we do with our building, it has to be horizontal in its proportion or doesn't look right. And this one was verticals, which just looked like sort of a tall rectangle with point on one end. And he said he gave me an answer, he said ""Well, duplication is a serious form of flattery."" I found that relatively unsatisfactory answer. I think maybe someone should try to do their own thing instead of doing bad copies of other people's things. But we do give the boys a chance to louse up what they think we're doing. But there always one hotel behind and that reminds me of the story when Waylon Jennings met a kid that imitated the western singer. He told the kid, ""Listen, I know you're a nice kid and you sing good and you're good-looking, but if you do well in Jennings, I'm already doing well in Jennings and you got to be yourself if you want to be successful in life, because I'll tell you something, son, and the boy's name was Wendell Atkins. Is it Wendell? Is it Waylon Jennings? If you do me, you're always going to be one record behind. And I thought that was a great funny remark. I was standing there when he said it. So if people copy our hotels, they're always one hotel behind. It's okay with me. Linda?

This is the first time on the conference call that I'm going to say I believe that we've seen the bottom in Las Vegas and I don't know how fast it's going to get better, but I don't think it's going to get any worse and we had a really nice October too, and we had a record-breaking October in China. So business is pretty good actually all the way around. I think with two months to go we're over $900 million of EBITDA, so speaking after my 40-odd years, first year we're going to go well over $1 billion in profit, in EBITDA at least. Although I stress again that this EBITDA number, which is what everybody likes to flash around is sort of a fake number because you have to pay your interest so lots got to do with what you make as how much money you owe. And depreciation isn't something that can be discarded. The more hotels you have, the more depreciation you've got. And the more money you have to spend taking care of these places, which reminds me that our remodel and upgrade of the whole Las Vegas facility, the Wynn Las Vegas facility is proceeding greatly and the public is receiving it well. It's caused our room rates to go up in the newly remodeled and refurbished rooms. Our baccarat [ph] is closed until Christmas, it's being re-configured and we opened a restaurant a few days ago in Las Vegas called the Lakeside Grill, which is jumping and doing big business for us. And our night clubs continue to be as a group, probably the most successful on the planet. We're going to do $150 million or $160 million in Nightclub business in Las Vegas and make 45% profit or something.
So generally speaking, we like the way we're configured and we're happy that things aren't going to get worse. I think the election today is a great moment in stabilizing what has been overwhelming uncertainty and fear of this administration by businessmen around the country. And I think that the message that the American people are sending to Washington tonight is clear, decisive rejection of the policies that have put us in this position lately. And so I think that we're going to see a more positive, a more consumer confidence after tonight, as the administration sort of gets put in its place about overwhelming government control and ridiculous spending and stuff like that. We were damaged as a company by the healthcare bill. We have been the victim of 8% escalation of healthcare costs and our insurance program and we're self-insured. We are healthcare provider. And we have never touched the benefits to our employees or raised their costs of their contributions in co-pay and such. Since we opened this hotel five years ago, we've just taken the hit on 8% a year. As a result of this ridiculous 2700-page fiasco that this Congress passed, our escalation of healthcare cost is going to close to 11% or 12%. Thank you very much, Congress, for all the help. They made it tougher on large businesses, small businesses, they've made it tougher on unions. In many cases, the culinary union contract with us, for example, and calls for a fixed contribution or cost of living escalation every year to be put into healthcare or wages whichever the union wants. And when it all goes to healthcare, their wages can't be increased. Or put in even a worse situation that the amount of money that we can give the union to cover their healthcare escalation doesn't equal what the union has to pay out in its policy to our employees. So the healthcare bill was a fiasco across the Board. We can only hope that maybe when the new legislation reconvenes, they will somehow undo the damage that has been done by this ill-conceived piece of legislation, which is very important to companies like ourselves, which employ and ensure tens of thousands of people. So I think that the elections have very positive moment and maybe we'll get some relief from the government in the months ahead.
The President, as you know, told everybody not to go to Las Vegas in more or less terms and that didn't help us. So all of this is going to get cleared up I think now, and we're filling terrific about China now. I think I'll finish my part of this meeting before it get into questions about Cotai.
My designed partners and I have been working on an average of 6 hours a day as many as 12 this summer, but six hours a day every week for months now. And maybe it was because of experience and maybe it was because of opportunity, but it's gone much faster than it usually has. And we have a plan and we have our building drawn. We haven't finished construction documents for bidding, but we're ready to begin and we will. We're doing soil testing on the location of the tower as we speak in China. It has begun. And site clearance begins in a few weeks. And we're off to the races with the Cotai project, which is a stunning, remarkable piece of business. And it's been the most fun, the most challenging and the most rewarding experience of my 42-year career in this job. And I believe that it's a breakaway property physically and conceptually and operationally compared to any other facility of its kind in the world. I'm very, very proud of it. And we're going to be showing pictures and models in a few weeks as we complete renderings and other visual studies that would allow us to explain this hotel to the public. But it is a dilly. And it's going to be the photo-op of China's gaming scene in much the way that our other properties in the past to become the photo-op of each community. It will introduce concepts and ideas into the casino architecture and casino organization of parts as they relate to the whole that have not been seen before. So I'm very happy. And it will also introduce concepts in terms of a room product that have not been seen before.
Now I know I'm creating a lot of expectation with that kind of talk, and I wouldn't be doing it if I haven't seen the building and know that we could keep that promise. On the phone call like this, it's not possible to create, to show you pictures, but they will be available soon enough. And I think that since everybody is sort of done what they're going to do, it will be tough for everybody to copy it. Now we'll take questions."

Some of the other fellas are a little desperate about their performance. And they've been trying to buy business. I guess in order to make an impression for an IPO or something, it's a scheme that doesn't work very well. They increased the top line but they don't increase the bottom line. October was the best month we ever had. We made over $90 million last month in Macau. And so they don't really lay a glove on us. We've got our own customers. And you've all written about the fact that we tend to be resistant to such change. Our fair share increases, that comparison of the percentage of tables to the percentage of money compared to the percentage of equipment. Our fair share improves, our competitive posture improves with competition. It doesn't deteriorate. So we like the fact that the market is strong and growing and vital. We would prefer that the competition adhere to the rules, but we'll leave that to the government. But we run our business based upon creating a good experience for our customers and that's what pays off. So with regard to Cotai's costs, we know what the building looks like now, and how where all the parts are and how they relate to one another. We don't want to publish our estimated budget for the building until we've had a chance to finish certain parts of the back of the house that we have to place. And then we're going to do a final take-off and we're going to budget the footage. And I'll do that and have a budget by the next time we have a conference call in three months. But it's a little early for me to say it, but I could say it's between $2 billion and $3 billion, probably closer to $2.5 billion, but I'm not sure. I'd like to finish doing the whole take-off. We'll break ground and we'll actually get started -- because remember it's a landfill. We'll be working on the site and what is the beginning of the construction of the project within a few weeks. We'll do site clearance immediately. We're doing the test borings this week because we know the exact location of the high rise. We'll be cleaning up the site and starting the remediation. Remember, it's a dump in effect, it's a landfill. They dump all kinds of junk on the ground and they put dirt over it. And when the ground settles unevenly because of the unstable base, and in order to put our foundation and we have to clean that stuff out and go through it with pilings and other forms of foundational structure. And all that will be done during the year of '11. We're underway and we'll finish and be open for business in '15, so four years from now. That's what the whole thing takes. And we'll show you the building in great detail probably next time, the end of the next quarter. We'll start using showing all the pretty pictures and stuff that might Board saw today. We had a Board meeting a few minutes ago and I showed the building to the directors, enjoying it as we have been. Did I answer your question, Joe?"

It's a strange thing for Westerners to understand how it works in Macau sometimes. You lease the land with ground rent from the government for a specific purpose and you must comply with that purpose when you ask for the concession. And the amount of money you pay for the concession is directly related to the purpose and the amount of footage and the description of the footage on the property. They commit to the property for you in advance and allow you, in our case, to put a fence around it, to build a warehouse. The final lease payment is determined by the publication of the plan in the gazette. Prior to that time, you're encouraged to go ahead and begin. And we do. And hotels are built that way. Sometimes the gazette process trails, but in all cases, you are given instructions by the government in advance on what to do and what you're allowed to do as we have been given in the past two years. So that's why there's a warehouse and plans and our procedure has gone all the way to the end of the regulatory process to execute the final lease and that will happen in the next several weeks. But as far as the commitment that you have to use the property and do your project, you get that way in advance, and we've got that. And it comes in writing as a matter of fact. That came quite a while ago. So there's stability, there's predictability there. Again, I stress, it's not like here where nobody knows what to expect tomorrow because of our particular political problems we've had in the past two years with this administration. But in Macau, it's not that way at all. I mean, there's rules and there's procedures and you follow them. And then you go about your business."

We try and have the best hotel in every market that we're in. That means our customers are discriminating, well-to-do, very intelligent people. And they have money. And in the United States of America, people with money have been in the defensive crouch if they run a business because of the administration in Washington. It's an anti-business, socialistic and aggressively anti-business. We've never seen like this in our life. Where there's a cross here, printed on the back of anybody that creates jobs or makes money. My customers, my guests are frightened of these people. And so they are clutching their bankrolls and hiding out. Now what's going to affect the Las Vegas and companies like MGM and The Venetian and myself, our gang will be, the phrase they use is consumer confidence. But its absence of fear. Once the businessmen and -- all this cash in America is being held on the side, it maybe a couple of trillion. It's locked up. Unfortunately, most of it is being lent to the government at no interest and treasuries. Between the family and the company, we have probably couple of billion dollars in treasury bills with no interest. Nobody wants to take their bankroll out of their pocket because they don't know what's going to happen to them. The minute that this election is straightened out and this administration is properly put in its place, I believe there's going to be a change in consumer confidence in America. And if they're smart enough in Washington to not touch with the tax rate that we enjoy now, you will see businesses heave a sigh of relief and there'll be a lot of unexpected good things happen. If this money that's on the side comes out, it's not only good for Las Vegas, it's good for America. And if we get some people in there that stops squandering money, and the government will even be in better shape. And we get some intelligent leadership on entitlements, there's going to wave of confidence and optimism in America that will radically and rapidly change the doldrums that we're in. One of the problems we got is that the people who are in elected positions in Washington do not have the intellectual firepower to deal with the problems or understand them in America today. The damned farm system for the Washington is the state legislature. For example, that really affects our business, we've been told over and over again by the President that everybody who's got $250,000 a year income or more is a rich person that should pay their fair share, presumably because we're not now. Well, the fact of the matter is that the personal tax rate is the business tax of small and medium businesses in America. And the people that are making $2 million and $3 million and $4 million in subchapter S corporations are proprietorships or partnerships. They're paying their taxes as individuals. They're subtracting their income expenses and then paying a tax as ordinary tax rates and then opening up shops and new offices with what the balance of the $2 million or $3 million or $4 million or $5 million they're making. And incidentally, they're not really making the $2 million or $3 million or $4 million or $5 million. Usually, 25% or 30% of that is tied up in inventory or accounts receivable. And yet, in spite of this overwhelming truth, the President of the United States and leaders of the parties that support him keep calling everybody who files a tax return with $250,000 or more a rich person. It is a total and deliberate misstatement of the structure of the American economy. It's a form of hypocrisy that defies understanding. It's also an insult to the intelligence of the American people. An insult, which I think is going to be answered as this day proceeds very clearly by the voters. But this kind of foolishness and hypocrisy has to stop. And that's when people come to Las Vegas, to spend money, go shopping and do all the other things they do, it will loosen things up. And we call all of this consumer confidence. Right now, it's consumer disgust and fear of -- when our leaders in Washington are guilty of blatant hypocrisy, anybody with a brain in their head is frightened by it. And I think that when that disappears, if it does tonight, we're going to see a much a more optimistic frame of mind in the United States that will directly benefit Las Vegas. And if Harry Reid survives his challenge in this election, I think Harry will go back to a Senate with a different flavor. And I think that maybe Harry will be in a position to help Nevada more than he has in the past with the different constituency in the Senate and it will be good for Las Vegas. Those are the things to look at for this town. We are very much a sounding board for America."

It's got to change, Democrat or Republican. And I vote both ways. It's got to stop or America is headed for problems that -- I mean, one of the reasons I'm so angry about this, and there's no question I am, is that I have always had a sort of a protective attitude towards my employees. I consider us a family. And I've always thought that we, as a company, if we stayed healthy, that we could protect our employees in every way possible. And now I see the government destroying the value of the dollar, lowering the quality of life and the standard of living for the working class of America, the very people that they're supposed to represent. And sure, we're going to give paychecks out, but they're going to be $0.60 on a dollar paychecks. And all these people are coming up for Social Security and Medicare. They're going to get paid with $0.60 and $0.70 on a dollar, dollars. I remember hearing the President say that the middle class has gone down and the rich get richer. The reason the middle-class relative position deteriorates, if it does at all, is because of the government. Not because of people that creates jobs and build companies. It's because of the government. And what happened now is the American public has awakened to this miserable truth. And they see right through with phony rhetoric. And if that's true, we're going to get a different kind of leadership in Congress that recognizes what it takes to run this country properly using common sense. And that's the reason that I think that this stinging rebuke that the President is going to get tonight has to have a proper effect on him and other like-thinking hypocrites."

So obviously, they go hand-in-hand. One is giving more incentive, which is commissioned back to the customer to bring the business. The second is you need credit. You need to give them facility to get the business. So they use both of them hand-in-hand to gain short-term market share, whether it's for IPO or they're trying to do different purpose to gain that short-term market share. However, the danger with that is first, we believe in stability. Obviously, if you give something more weight on the commission, then you have to cut something back, whether it's salary or renovation dollars. So you're taking -- there's only so much dollars in the 100% that you can give away. So if you're giving it too much away on the commission, then you got to cut back to other places. That creates unstable business model for the whole operation. But second, it's not good for the customers where you go in and out. Today I'm giving you more and then tomorrow, as it's found out that it's not a profitable business, now I'm going to take it back. It doesn't buy long-term loyalty with the customer or the junket. And that's what we do well. If you look at people always talking about market share, they said, ""Have we lost market share?"" Actually, what's the growth of the whole Macau market, we maintained our market share quite well. And that speaks a lot with even additional tables from Encore. So our penetration level had actually increased with the additional table. People don't look at that, they just keep saying as a whole market share has decreased. But in a growing market that's grown 60%, maintaining market share is already a lot of dollars and we maintain very healthy business model, where we take all those additional business to the same profitability down to the bottom line."

This market in China is a repeat market, they come once a week. And the quality of their experience is the only thing that matters. Consistency is what they depend upon. Predictability is what they want, just like everything else in life. Predictability, consistency, when you get the short-term thinking nitwits jumping around, it just means that pretty soon there'll be a new name on the business card.

And then there's an ex-dumbbell and until finally they end up with someone who knows how to run the business properly and they pay attention to what really does increase market share or market penetration and that is the quality of the customer experience.

The answer comes back from Linda and company and Ian and company and JD and Doreen and Frankie Zhao [ph] and all my colleagues, no, Steve, we're not going to cannibalize it. This market growth, we are right on schedule. We didn't build each one of the things we built. We built in due course. We let Sands go first with the one that they built with the down and dirty quick one, the Sands. We took our time and we opened Wynn, and then we took our time and we added tower at Encore and our penetration got better. We didn't cannibalize anything. We increased our fair share. We planned and took our time and we're ready now to build and we're starting to build Cotai because we knew, understanding market rates of growth and seeing that the operation of our competitors have been learning from that, that we would arrive at the date of opening that would allow us to achieve parity with our operation on the Peninsula. And grow intelligently with our feet underneath us, gathered up and collected, like a good show horse that goes over a jump, collected. So I think that we're going to make a lot of money on Cotai. I think we're going to have 10,000 or so, 12,000, 15,000 employees and it's going to be a very stable happy experience because we did it in due course. We didn't try and do it all at once. We didn't think it being master of the universe. We thought only of one thing. How do you build with a solid foundation, a steady, predictable, long-term business and be a useful part of the community to be welcomed as a good addition to the community. To sort of be part of keeping the promise of the plan, in this case, of the government of Macau. And that's a slower, more carefully studied and considered process. And that's why our third hotel is going to open up in four years. The first one was in '06, the second one was in '09 or '10 and the third one is going to be in '14 or '15. That's the arc of our development in China, but those hotels will be there forever, long after I'm gone. When my time is up in this world, those hotels are still be viable wonderful businesses providing security for their employees and the people that run them and the shareholders. And as far as giving you more information about Macau, it looks like I want to do when I got the pictures. I've shown it to all of us here know what the hotel looks like and what it got in it. But to dribble it out conversationally in this format, I think there's better ways of us doing it. I think we probably will call for an investment conference, one in China and one in Las Vegas, that Matt and I will put on with Linda and Ian and the guys and all of us. And we'll show what we're going to do. We'll have a model and we'll unveil its beauty to our joy and to the chagrin of our competitors."

And I called up Gary Loveman, and I said, ""Hey man, have you no shame?"" I mean, and in the building was in the wrong proportion. In order to do what we do with our building, it has to be horizontal in its proportion or doesn't look right. And this one was vertical, so it just looked like sort of a tall rectangle with point on one end. And he said he gave me an answer, he said ""Well, duplication is a serious form of flattery."" I found that relatively unsatisfactory answer. I think maybe someone should try to do their own thing instead of doing bad copies of other people's things. But we do give the boys a chance to louse up what they think we're doing. But there always one hotel behind and that reminds me of the story when Waylon Jennings met a kid that imitated him as a singer. He told the kid, ""Listen, I know you're a nice kid and you sing good and you're good-looking, but if you do well in Jennings, I'm already doing well in Jennings and you got to be yourself if you want to be successful in life, because I'll tell you something, son,"" -- and the boy's name was Wendell Atkins. Is it Wendell? Is it Waylon Jennings? ""If you do me, you're always going to be one record behind."" And I thought that was a great funny remark. I was standing there when he said it. So if people copy our hotels, they're always one hotel behind. It's okay with me. Linda?"

Made a couple of $100 million [ph] in Macau and not bad in Las Vegas either. This is the first time on the conference call that I'm going to say I believe that we've seen the bottom in Las Vegas and I don't know how fast it's going to get better, but I don't think it's going to get any worse and we had a really nice October too, and we had a record-breaking October in China. So business is pretty good actually all the way around. I think with two months to go we're over $900 million of EBITDA, so speaking after my 40-odd years, first year we're going to go well over $1 billion in profit, in EBITDA at least. Although I stress again that this EBITDA number, which is what everybody likes to flash around is sort of a fake number because you have to pay your interest so lots got to do with what you make as how much money you owe. And depreciation isn't something that can be discarded. The more hotels you have, the more depreciation you've got. And the more money you have to spend taking care of these places, which reminds me that our remodel and upgrade of the whole Las Vegas facility, the Wynn Las Vegas facility is proceeding greatly and the public is receiving it well. It's caused our room rates to go up in the newly remodeled and refurbished rooms. Our baccarat [ph] is closed until Christmas, it's being re-configured and we opened a restaurant a few days ago in Las Vegas called the Lakeside Grill, which is jumping and doing big business for us. And our night clubs continue to be as a group, probably the most successful on the planet. We're going to do $150 million or $160 million in Nightclub business in Las Vegas and make 45% profit or something.
So generally speaking, we like the way we're configured and we're happy that things aren't going to get worse. I think the election today is a great moment in stabilizing what has been overwhelming uncertainty and fear of this administration by businessmen around the country. And I think that the message that the American people are sending to Washington tonight is clear, decisive rejection of the policies that have put us in this position lately. And so I think that we're going to see a more positive, a more consumer confidence after tonight, as the administration sort of gets put in its place about overwhelming government control and ridiculous spending and stuff like that. We were damaged as a company by the healthcare bill. We have been the victim of 8% escalation of healthcare costs and our insurance program and we're self-insured. We are healthcare provider. And we have never touched the benefits to our employees or raised their costs of their contributions in co-pay and such. Since we opened this hotel five years ago, we've just taken the hit on 8% a year. As a result of this ridiculous 2700-page fiasco that this Congress passed, our escalation of healthcare cost is going to close to 11% or 12%. Thank you very much, Congress, for all the help. They made it tougher on large businesses, small businesses, they've made it tougher on unions. In many cases, the culinary union contract with us, for example, and calls for a fixed contribution or cost of living escalation every year to be put into healthcare or wages whichever the union wants. And when it all goes to healthcare, their wages can't be increased. Or put in even a worse situation that the amount of money that we can give the union to cover their healthcare escalation doesn't equal what the union has to pay out in its policy to our employees. So the healthcare bill was a fiasco across the Board. We can only hope that maybe when the new legislation reconvenes, they will somehow undo the damage that has been done by this ill-conceived piece of legislation, which is very important to companies like ourselves, which employ and ensure tens of thousands of people. So I think that the elections have very positive moment and maybe we'll get some relief from the government in the months ahead.
The President, as you know, told everybody not to go to Las Vegas in more or less terms and that didn't help us. So all of this is going to get cleared up I think now, and we're filling terrific about China now. I think I'll finish my part of this meeting before it get into questions about Cotai.
My designed partners and I have been working on an average of 6 hours a day as many as 12 this summer, but six hours a day every week for months now. And maybe it was because of experience and maybe it was because of opportunity, but it's gone much faster than it usually has. And we have a plan and we have our building drawn. We haven't finished construction documents for bidding, but we're ready to begin and we will. We're doing soil testing on the location of the tower as we speak in China. It has begun. And site clearance begins in a few weeks. And we're off to the races with the Cotai project, which is a stunning, remarkable piece of business. And it's been the most fun, the most challenging and the most rewarding experience of my 42-year career in this job. And I believe that it's a breakaway property physically and conceptually and operationally compared to any other facility of its kind in the world. I'm very, very proud of it. And we're going to be showing pictures and models in a few weeks as we complete renderings and other visual studies that would allow us to explain this hotel to the public. But it is a dilly. And it's going to be the photo-op of China's gaming scene in much the way that our other properties in the past to become the photo-op of each community. It will introduce concepts and ideas into the casino architecture and casino organization of parts as they relate to the whole that have not been seen before. So I'm very happy. And it will also introduce concepts in terms of a room product that have not been seen before.
Now I know I'm creating a lot of expectation with that kind of talk, and I wouldn't be doing it if I haven't seen the building and know that we could keep that promise. On the phone call like this, it's not possible to create, to show you pictures, but they will be available soon enough. And I think that since everybody is sort of done what they're going to do, it will be tough for everybody to copy it. Now we'll take questions."

Some of the other fellows are a little desperate about their performance. And they've been trying to buy business. I guess in order to make an impression for an IPO or something, it's a scheme that doesn't work very well. They increased the top line but they don't increase the bottom line. October was the best month we ever had. We made over $90 million last month in Macau. And so they don't really lay a glove on us. We've got our own customers. And you've all written about the fact that we tend to be resistant to such change. Our fair share increases, that comparison of the percentage of tables to the percentage of money compared to the percentage of equipment. Our fair share improves, our competitive posture improves with competition. It doesn't deteriorate. So we like the fact that the market is strong and growing and vital. We would prefer that the competition adhere to the rules, but we'll leave that to the government. But we run our business based upon creating a good experience for our customers and that's what pays off. So with regard to Cotai's costs, we know what the building looks like now, and how where all the parts are and how they relate to one another. We don't want to publish our estimated budget for the building until we've had a chance to finish certain parts of the back of the house that we have to place. And then we're going to do a final take-off and we're going to budget the footage. And I'll do that and have a budget by the next time we have a conference call in three months. But it's a little early for me to say it, but I could say it's between $2 billion and $3 billion, probably closer to $2.5 billion, but I'm not sure. I'd like to finish doing the whole take-off. We'll break ground and we'll actually get started -- because remember it's a landfill. We'll be working on the site and what is the beginning of the construction of the project within a few weeks. We'll do site clearance immediately. We're doing the test borings this week because we know the exact location of the high rise. We'll be cleaning up the site and starting the remediation. Remember, it's a dump in effect, it's a landfill. They dump all kinds of junk on the ground and they put dirt over it. And when the ground settles unevenly because of the unstable base, and in order to put our foundation and we have to clean that stuff out and go through it with pilings and other forms of foundational structure. And all that will be done during the year of '11. We're underway and we'll finish and be open for business in '15, so four years from now. That's what the whole thing takes. And we'll show you the building in great detail probably next time, the end of the next quarter. We'll start using showing all the pretty pictures and stuff that might Board saw today. We had a Board meeting a few minutes ago and I showed the building to the directors, enjoying it as we have been. Did I answer your question, Joe?"

It's a strange thing for Westerners to understand how it works in Macau sometimes. You lease the land with ground rent from the government for a specific purpose and you must comply with that purpose when you ask for the concession. And the amount of money you pay for the concession is directly related to the purpose and the amount of footage and the description of the footage on the property. They commit to the property for you in advance and allow you, in our case, to put a fence around it, to build a warehouse. The final lease payment is determined by the publication of the plan in the gazette. Prior to that time, you're encouraged to go ahead and begin. And we do. And hotels are built that way. Sometimes the gazette process trails, but in all cases, you are given instructions by the government in advance on what to do and what you're allowed to do as we have been given in the past two years. So that's why there's a warehouse and plans and our procedure has gone all the way to the end of the regulatory process to execute the final lease and that will happen in the next several weeks. But as far as the commitment that you have to use the property and do your project, you get that way in advance, and we've got that. And it comes in writing as a matter of fact. That came quite a while ago. So there's stability, there's predictability there. Again, I stress, it's not like here where nobody knows what to expect tomorrow because of our particular political problems we've had in the past two years with this administration. But in Macau, it's not that way at all. I mean, there's rules and there's procedures and you follow them. And then you go about your business."

We try and have the best hotel in every market that we're in. That means our customers are discriminating, well-to-do, very intelligent people. And they have money. And in the United States of America, people with money have been in the defensive crouch if they run a business because of the administration in Washington. It's an anti-business, socialistic and aggressively anti-business. We've never seen like this in our life. Where there's a cross here, printed on the back of anybody that creates jobs or makes money. My customers, my guests are frightened of these people. And so they are clutching their bankrolls and hiding out. Now what's going to affect the Las Vegas and companies like MGM and The Venetian and myself, our gang will be, the phrase they use is consumer confidence. But its absence of fear. Once the businessmen and -- all this cash in America is being held on the side, it maybe a couple of trillion. It's locked up. Unfortunately, most of it is being lent to the government at no interest and treasuries. Between the family and the company, we have probably couple of billion dollars in treasury bills with no interest. Nobody wants to take their bankroll out of their pocket because they don't know what's going to happen to them. The minute that this election is straightened out and this administration is properly put in its place, I believe there's going to be a change in consumer confidence in America. And if they're smart enough in Washington to not touch with the tax rate that we enjoy now, you will see businesses heave a sigh of relief and there'll be a lot of unexpected good things happen. If this money that's on the side comes out, it's not only good for Las Vegas, it's good for America. And if we get some people in there that stops squandering money, and the government will even be in better shape. And we get some intelligent leadership on entitlements, there's going to wave of confidence and optimism in America that will radically and rapidly change the doldrums that we're in. One of the problems we got is that the people who are in elected positions in Washington do not have the intellectual firepower to deal with the problems or understand them in America today. The damned farm system for the Washington is the state legislature. For example, that really affects our business, we've been told over and over again by the President that everybody who's got $250,000 a year income or more is a rich person that should pay their fair share, presumably because we're not now. Well, the fact of the matter is that the personal tax rate is the business tax of small and medium businesses in America. And the people that are making $2 million and $3 million and $4 million in subchapter S corporations are proprietorships or partnerships. They're paying their taxes as individuals. They're subtracting their income expenses and then paying a tax as ordinary tax rates and then opening up shops and new offices with what the balance of the $2 million or $3 million or $4 million or $5 million they're making. And incidentally, they're not really making the $2 million or $3 million or $4 million or $5 million. Usually, 25% or 30% of that is tied up in inventory or accounts receivable. And yet, in spite of this overwhelming truth, the President of the United States and leaders of the parties that support him keep calling everybody who files a tax return with $250,000 or more a rich person. It is a total and deliberate misstatement of the structure of the American economy. It's a form of hypocrisy that defies understanding. It's also an insult to the intelligence of the American people. An insult, which I think is going to be answered as this day proceeds very clearly by the voters. But this kind of foolishness and hypocrisy has to stop. And that's when people come to Las Vegas, to spend money, go shopping and do all the other things they do, it will loosen things up. And we call all of this consumer confidence. Right now, it's consumer disgust and fear of -- when our leaders in Washington are guilty of blatant hypocrisy, anybody with a brain in their head is frightened by it. And I think that when that disappears, if it does tonight, we're going to see a much a more optimistic frame of mind in the United States that will directly benefit Las Vegas. And if Harry Reid survives his challenge in this election, I think Harry will go back to a Senate with a different flavor. And I think that maybe Harry will be in a position to help Nevada more than he has in the past with the different constituency in the Senate and it will be good for Las Vegas. Those are the things to look at for this town. We are very much a sounding board for America."

And incidentally, Tom, I don't know how, since you and I are talking to each other in front of everybody else, I don't know after tonight how this administration could possibly interpret the mood of America any differently than what the results are clearly going to show, which is a rebuke and repudiation of this move towards massive government expansion over control and ridiculous, ridiculous is the only word for it, spending. And I don't know how this President or any member of that administration or politician, regardless of party, could stand up and not get the message from the citizens of this country that, that stuff doesn't go. It's got to change, Democrat or Republican. And I vote both ways. It's got to stop or America is headed for problems that -- I mean, one of the reasons I'm so angry about this, and there's no question I am, is that I have always had a sort of a protective attitude towards my employees. I consider us a family. And I've always thought that we, as a company, if we stayed healthy, that we could protect our employees in every way possible. And now I see the government destroying the value of the dollar, lowering the quality of life and the standard of living for the working class of America, the very people that they're supposed to represent. And sure, we're going to give paychecks out, but they're going to be $0.60 on a dollar paychecks. And all these people are coming up for Social Security and Medicare. They're going to get paid with $0.60 and $0.70 on a dollar, dollars. I remember hearing the President say that the middle class has gone down and the rich get richer. The reason the middle-class relative position deteriorates, if it does at all, is because of the government. Not because of people that creates jobs and build companies. It's because of the government. And what happened now is the American public has awakened to this miserable truth. And they see right through with phony rhetoric. And if that's true, we're going to get a different kind of leadership in Congress that recognizes what it takes to run this country properly using common sense. And that's the reason that I think that this stinging rebuke that the President is going to get tonight has to have a proper effect on him and other like-thinking hypocrites."

So obviously, they go hand-in-hand. One is giving more incentive, which is commissioned back to the customer to bring the business. The second is you need credit. You need to give them facility to get the business. So they use both of them hand-in-hand to gain short-term market share, whether it's for IPO or they're trying to do different purpose to gain that short-term market share. However, the danger with that is first, we believe in stability. Obviously, if you give something more weight on the commission, then you have to cut something back, whether it's salary or renovation dollars. So you're taking -- there's only so much dollars in the 100% that you can give away. So if you're giving it too much away on the commission, then you got to cut back to other places. That creates unstable business model for the whole operation. But second, it's not good for the customers where you go in and out. Today I'm giving you more and then tomorrow, as it's found out that it's not a profitable business, now I'm going to take it back. It doesn't buy long-term loyalty with the customer or the junket. And that's what we do well. If you look at people always talking about market share, they said, ""Have we lost market share?"" Actually, what's the growth of the whole Macau market, we maintained our market share quite well. And that speaks a lot with even additional tables from Encore. So our penetration level had actually increased with the additional table. People don't look at that, they just keep saying as a whole market share has decreased. But in a growing market that's grown 60%, maintaining market share is already a lot of dollars and we maintain very healthy business model, where we take all those additional business to the same profitability down to the bottom line."

When I sit down with my colleagues and although my name may be on the sign, the projects belong to all of us and a reflection of all of us, not me. And when I sit with them and say who are we going to be in Cotai and can we afford to have the two places, are we just going to cannibalize the one we've got. The answer comes back from Linda and company and Ian and company and JD and Doreen and Frankie Zhao [ph] and all my colleagues, no, Steve, we're not going to cannibalize it. This market growth, we are right on schedule. We didn't build each one of the things we built. We built in due course. We let Sands go first with the one that they built with the down and dirty quick one, the Sands. We took our time and we opened Wynn, and then we took our time and we added tower at Encore and our penetration got better. We didn't cannibalize anything. We increased our fair share. We planned and took our time and we're ready now to build and we're starting to build Cotai because we knew, understanding market rates of growth and seeing that the operation of our competitors have been learning from that, that we would arrive at the date of opening that would allow us to achieve parity with our operation on the Peninsula. And grow intelligently with our feet underneath us, gathered up and collected, like a good show horse that goes over a jump, collected. So I think that we're going to make a lot of money on Cotai. I think we're going to have 10,000 or so, 12,000, 15,000 employees and it's going to be a very stable happy experience because we did it in due course. We didn't try and do it all at once. We didn't think it being master of the universe. We thought only of one thing. How do you build with a solid foundation, a steady, predictable, long-term business and be a useful part of the community to be welcomed as a good addition to the community. To sort of be part of keeping the promise of the plan, in this case, of the government of Macau. And that's a slower, more carefully studied and considered process. And that's why our third hotel is going to open up in four years. The first one was in '06, the second one was in '09 or '10 and the third one is going to be in '14 or '15. That's the arc of our development in China, but those hotels will be there forever, long after I'm gone. When my time is up in this world, those hotels are still be viable wonderful businesses providing security for their employees and the people that run them and the shareholders. And as far as giving you more information about Macau, it looks like I want to do when I got the pictures. I've shown it to all of us here know what the hotel looks like and what it got in it. But to dribble it out conversationally in this format, I think there's better ways of us doing it. I think we probably will call for an investment conference, one in China and one in Las Vegas, that Matt and I will put on with Linda and Ian and the guys and all of us. And we'll show what we're going to do. We'll have a model and we'll unveil its beauty to our joy and to the chagrin of our competitors."

That's what happened. But we have a model of Encore Macau on the Wynn Macau model. We attached it and we had it on display upstairs in the Executive offices and showed it to everybody. Anybody could've seen it. So we don't intend to keep it. Once we design the hotel, we show it and if somebody wants to go, I remember going to Atlantic City this past year, I was making a tour of various jurisdictions to learn about what was going on in America because I haven't done it in so long. And I was walking out of the Borganta, which I want to look at and there next-door was Harrah's, with a curved tower and asymmetrical roof, a very poor homely copy of the Wynn Las Vegas. And I called up Gary Loveman, and I said, ""Hey man, have you no shame?"" I mean, and in the building was in the wrong proportion. In order to do what we do with our building, it has to be horizontal in its proportion or doesn't look right. And this one was vertical, so it just looked like sort of a tall rectangle with point on one end. And he said he gave me an answer, he said ""Well, duplication is a serious form of flattery."" I found that relatively unsatisfactory answer. I think maybe someone should try to do their own thing instead of doing bad copies of other people's things. But we do give the boys a chance to louse up what they think we're doing. But there always one hotel behind and that reminds me of the story when Waylon Jennings met a kid that imitated him as a singer. He told the kid, ""Listen, I know you're a nice kid and you sing good and you're good-looking, but if you do well in Jennings, I'm already doing well in Jennings and you got to be yourself if you want to be successful in life, because I'll tell you something, son,"" -- and the boy's name was Wendell Atkins. Is it Wendell? Is it Waylon Jennings? ""If you do me, you're always going to be one record behind."" And I thought that was a great funny remark. I was standing there when he said it. So if people copy our hotels, they're always one hotel behind. It's okay with me. Linda?"

Made a couple of $100 million [ph] in Macau and not bad in Las Vegas either. This is the first time on the conference call that I'm going to say I believe that we've seen the bottom in Las Vegas and I don't know how fast it's going to get better, but I don't think it's going to get any worse and we had a really nice October too, and we had a record-breaking October in China. So business is pretty good actually all the way around. I think with two months to go, we're over $900 million of EBITDA, so speaking after my 40-odd years, first year we're going to go well over $1 billion in profit, in EBITDA at least. Although I stress again that this EBITDA number, which is what everybody likes to flash around is sort of a fake number because you have to pay your interest so lots got to do with what you make as how much money you owe. And depreciation isn't something that can be discarded. The more hotels you have, the more depreciation you've got. And the more money you have to spend taking care of these places, which reminds me that our remodeling and upgrading of the whole Las Vegas facility, the Wynn Las Vegas facility is proceeding greatly and the public is receiving it well. It's caused our room rates to go up in the newly remodeled and refurbished rooms. Our baccarat is closed until Christmas, it's being re-configured and we opened a restaurant a few days ago in Las Vegas called the Lakeside Grill, which is jumping and doing big business for us. And our night clubs continue to be as a group, probably the most successful on the planet. We're going to do $150 million or $160 million in Nightclub business in Las Vegas and make 45% profit or something.
 So generally speaking, we like the way we're configured and we're happy that things aren't going to get worse. I think the election today is a great moment in stabilizing what has been overwhelming uncertainty and fear of this administration by businessmen around the country. And I think that the message that the American people are sending to Washington tonight is clear, decisive rejection of the policies that have put us in this position lately. And so I think that we're going to see a more positive, a more consumer confidence after tonight, as the administration sort of gets put in its place about overwhelming government control and ridiculous spending and stuff like that. We were damaged as a company by the healthcare bill. We have been the victim of 8% escalation of healthcare costs and our insurance program and we self-insure. We are healthcare provider. And we have never touched the benefits to our employees or raised their costs of their contributions in co-pay and such. Since we opened this hotel five years ago, we've just taken the hit on 8% a year. As a result of this ridiculous 2700-page fiasco that this Congress passed, our escalation of healthcare cost is going to close to 11% or 12%. Thank you very much, Congress, for all the help. They made it tougher on large businesses, small businesses, they've made it tougher on unions. In many cases, the culinary union contract with us, for example, and calls for a fixed contribution or cost of living escalation every year to be put into healthcare or wages whichever the union wants. And when it all goes to healthcare, their wages can't be increased. Or put in even a worse situation that the amount of money that we can give the union to cover their healthcare escalation doesn't equal what the union has to pay out in its policy to our employees. So the healthcare bill was a fiasco across the Board. We can only hope that maybe when the new legislation reconvenes, they will somehow undo the damage that has been done by this ill-conceived piece of legislation, which is very important to companies like ourselves, which employ and ensure tens of thousands of people. So I think that the elections have very positive moment and maybe we'll get some relief from the government in the months ahead.
 The President, as you know, told everybody not to go to Las Vegas in more or less terms and that didn't help us. So all of this is going to get cleared up I think now, and we're filling terrific about China now. I think I'll finish my part of this meeting before it get into questions about Cotai.
 My designed partners and I have been working on an average of 6 hours a day as many as 12 this summer, but six hours a day every week for months now. And maybe it was because of experience and maybe it was because of opportunity, but it's gone much faster than it usually has. And we have a plan and we have our building drawn. We haven't finished construction documents for bidding, but we're ready to begin and we will. We're doing soil testing on the location of the tower as we speak in China. It has begun. And site clearance begins in a few weeks. And we're off to the races with the Cotai project, which is a stunning, remarkable piece of business. And it's been the most fun, the most challenging and the most rewarding experience of my 42-year career in this job. And I believe that it's a breakaway property physically and conceptually and operationally compared to any other facility of its kind in the world. I'm very, very proud of it. And we're going to be showing pictures and models in a few weeks as we complete renderings and other visual studies that would allow us to explain this hotel to the public. But it is a dilly. And it's going to be the photo-op of China's gaming scene in much a way that our other properties in the past to become the photo-op of each community. It will introduce concepts and ideas into the casino architecture and casino organization of parts as they relate to the whole that have not been seen before. So I'm very happy. And it will also introduce concepts in terms of a room product that have not been seen before.
 Now I know I'm craving a lot of expectation with that kind of talk, and I wouldn't be doing it if I haven't seen the building and know that we could keep that promise. On the phone call like this, it's not possible to create, to show you pictures, but they will be available soon enough. And I think that since everybody is sort of done, what they're going to do, it will be tough for everybody to copy it. Now we'll take questions.

Some of the other fellas are a little desperate about their performance. And they've been trying to buy business. I guess in order to make an impression for an IPO or something, it's a scheme that doesn't work very well. They increased the top line but they don't increase the bottom line. October was the best month we ever had. We made over $90 million last month in Macau. And so they don't really lay a glove on us. We've got our own customers. And you've all written about the fact that we tend to be resistant to such change. Our fair share increases, that comparison of the percentage of tables to the percentage of money compared to the percentage of equipment. Our fair share improves, our competitive posture improves with competition. It doesn't deteriorate. So we like the fact that the market is strong and growing and vital. We would prefer that the competition adhere to the rules, but we'll leave that to the government. But we run our business based upon creating a good experience for our customers and that's what pays off. So with regard to Cotai's costs, we know what the building looks like now, and how where all the parts are and how they relate to one another. We don't want to publish our estimated budget for the building until we've had a chance to finish certain parts of the back of the house that we have to place. And then we're going to do a final take-off and we're going to budget the footage. And I'll do that and have a budget by the next time we have a conference call in three months. But it's a little early for me to say it, but I could say it's between $2 billion and $3 billion, probably closer to $2.5 billion, but I'm not sure. I'd like to finish doing the whole take-off. We'll break ground and we'll actually get started -- because remember it's a landfill. We'll be working on the site and what is the beginning of the construction of the project within a few weeks. We'll do site clearance immediately. We're doing the test borings this week because we know the exact location of the high rise. We'll be cleaning up the site and starting the remediation. Remember, it's a dump in effect, it's a landfill. They dump all kinds of junk on the ground and they put dirt over it. And when the ground settles unevenly because of the unstable base, and in order to put our foundation and we have to clean that stuff out and go through it with pilings and other forms of foundational structure. And all that will be done during the year of '11. We're underway and we'll finish and be open for business in '15, so four years from now. That's what the whole thing takes. And we'll show you the building in great detail probably next time, the end of the next quarter. We'll start using showing all the pretty pictures and stuff that might Board saw today.

Where it all ends up is murky at best at this moment. They've got to accept the budget. And in a parliamentary form of government in Japan, it could fail or be accepted. It could cause a crisis that would require an election. And there could be a change of power or continuation of power, there could be consolidation of power by the Democrats or the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] and the players could change and the attitudes could change. Matt, what did you tell me that the average lifespan of a Prime Minister in Japan is how long?

It's a strange thing for Westerners to understand how it works in Macau sometimes. You lease the land with ground rent from the government for a specific purpose and you must comply with that purpose when you ask for the concession. And the amount of money you pay for the concession is directly related to the purpose and the amount of footage and the description of the footage on the property. They commit to the property for you in advance and allow you, in our case, to put a fence around it, to build a warehouse. The final lease payment is determined by the publication of the plan in the gazette. Prior to that time, you're encouraged to go ahead and begin. And we do. And hotels are built that way. Sometimes the gazette process trails, but in all cases, you are given instructions by the government in advance on what to do and what you're allowed to do as we have been given in the past two years. So that's why there's a warehouse and plans and our procedure has gone all the way to the end of the regulatory process to execute the final lease and that will happen in the next several weeks. But as far as the commitment that you have to use the property and do your project, you get that way in advance, and we've got that. And it comes in writing as a matter of fact. That came quite a while ago. So there's stability, there's predictability there. Again, I stress, it's not like here we nobody knows what to expect tomorrow because of our particular political problems we've had in the past two years with this administration. But in Macau, it's not that way at all. I mean there's rules and there's procedures and you follow them. And then you go about your business.

So if you run through the math, you'll see that that's anywhere in the neighborhood of less than 50% of the cash flow.

We try and have the best hotel in every market that we're in. That means our customers are discriminating, well-to-do, very intelligent people. And they have money. And in the United States of America, people with money have been in the defensive crouch if they run a business because of the administration in Washington. It's an anti-business, socialistic and aggressively anti-business. We've never seen like this in our life. Where there's a cross here, printed on the back of anybody that creates jobs or makes money. My customers, my guests are frightened of these people. And so they are clutching their bankrolls and hiding out. Now what's going to affect the Las Vegas and companies like MGM and The Venetian and myself, our gang will be, the phrase they use is consumer confidence. But its absence of fear. Once the businessmen and -- all this cash in America is being held on the side, it maybe a couple of trillion. It's locked up. Unfortunately, most of it is being lent to the government at no interest and treasuries. Between the family and the company, we have probably couple of billion dollars in treasury bills with no interest. Nobody wants to take their bankroll out of their pocket because they don't know what's going to happen to them. The minute that this election is straightened out and this administration is properly put in its place, I believe there's going to be a change in consumer confidence in America. And if they're smart enough in Washington to not touch with the tax rate that we enjoy now, you will see businesses heave a sigh of relief and there'll be a lot of unexpected good things happen. If this money that's on the side comes out, it's not only good for Las Vegas, it's good for America. And if we get some people in there that stops squandering money, and the government will even be in better shape. And we get some intelligent leadership on entitlements, there's going to wave of confidence and optimism in America that will radically and rapidly change the doldrums that we're in. One of the problems we got is that the people who are in elected positions in Washington do not have the intellectual firepower to deal with the problems or understand them in America today. The damned farm system for the Washington is the state legislature. For example, that really affects our business, we've been told over and over again by the President that everybody who's got $250,000 a year income or more is a rich person that should pay their fair share, presumably because we're not now. Well, the fact of the matter is that the personal tax rate is the business tax of small and medium businesses in America. And the people that are making $2 million and $3 million and $4 million in subchapter S corporations are proprietorships or partnerships. They're paying their taxes as individuals. They're subtracting their income expenses and then paying a tax as ordinary tax rates and then opening up shops and new offices with what the balance of the $2 million or $3 million or $4 million or $5 million they're making. And incidentally, they're not really making the $2 million or $3 million or $4 million or $5 million. Usually, 25% or 30% of that is tied up in inventory or accounts receivable. And yet, in spite of this overwhelming truth, the President of the United States and leaders of the parties that support him keep calling everybody who files a tax return with $250,000 or more a rich person. It is a total and deliberate misstatement of the structure of the American economy. It's a form of hypocrisy that defies understanding. It's also an insult to the intelligence of the American people. An insult, which I think is going to be answered as this day proceeds very clearly by the voters. But this kind of foolishness and hypocrisy has to stop. And that's when people come to Las Vegas, to spend money, go shopping and do all the other things they do, it will loosen things up. And we call all of these consumer confidence. Right now, it's consumer disgust and fear of -- when our leaders in Washington are guilty of blatant hypocrisy, anybody with a brain in their head is frightened by it. And I think that when that disappears, if it does tonight, we're going to see a much a more optimistic frame of mind in the United States that will directly benefit Las Vegas. And if Harry Reid survives his challenge in this election, I think Harry will go back to a Senate with a different flavor. And I think that maybe Harry will be in a position to help Nevada more than he has in the past with the different constituency in the Senate and it will be good for Las Vegas. Those are the things to look at for this town. We are very much a sounding board for America.

And I don't know how this President or any member of that administration or politician, regardless of party, could stand up and not get the message from the citizens of this country that, that stuff doesn't go. It's got to change, Democrat or Republican. And I vote both ways. It's got to stop or America is headed for problems that -- I mean, one of the reasons I'm so angry about this, and there's no question I am, is that I have always had a sort of a protective attitude towards my employees. I consider us a family. And I've always thought that we, as a company, if we stayed healthy, that we could protect our employees in every way possible. And now I see the government destroying the value of the dollar, lowering the quality of life and the standard of living for the working class of America, the very people that they're supposed to represent. And sure, we're going to give paychecks out, but they're going to be $0.60 on a dollar paychecks. And all these people are coming up for Social Security and Medicare. They're going to get paid with $0.60 and $0.70 on a dollar, dollars. I remember hearing the President say that the middle class has gone down and the rich get richer. The reason the middle-class relative position deteriorates, if it does at all, is because of the government. Not because of people that creates jobs and build companies. It's because of the government. And what happened now is the American public has awakened to this miserable truth. And they see right through with phony rhetoric. And if that's true, we're going to get a different kind of leadership in Congress that recognizes what it takes to run this country properly using common sense. And that's the reason that I think that this stinging rebuke that the President is going to get tonight has to have a proper effect on him and other like-thinking hypocrites.

I think the worst mistake someone could make is use the credit as a marketing tool and to buy the business. And its stability. You can't do whether it's credit or incentive for short-term purpose.

So obviously, they go hand-in-hand. One is giving more incentive, which is commissioned back to the customer to bring the business. The second is you need credit. You need to give them facility to get the business. So they use both of them hand-in-hand to gain short-term market share, whether it's for IPO or they're trying to do different purpose to gain that short-term market share. However, the danger with that is first, we believe in stability. Obviously, if you give something more weight on the commission, then you have to cut something back, whether it's salary or renovation dollars. So you're taking -- there's only so much dollars in the 100% that you can give away. So if you're giving it too much away on the commission, then you got to cut back to other places. That creates unstable business model for the whole operation. But second, it's not good for the customers where you go in and out. Today I'm giving you more and then tomorrow, as it's found out that it's not a profitable business, now I'm going to take it back. It doesn't buy long-term loyalty with the customer or the junket. And that's what we do well. If you look at people always talking about market share, they said, ""Have we lost market share?"" Actually, what's the growth of the whole Macau market, we maintained our market share quite well. And that speaks a lot with even additional tables from Encore. So our penetration level had actually increased with the additional table. People don't look at that, they just keep saying as a whole market share has decreased. But in a growing market that's grown 60%, maintaining market share is already a lot of dollars and we maintain very healthy business model, where we take all those additional business to the same profitability down to the bottom line.

You get bad debts and what happens is, the company has fired the dimwitted executive that did it. I been watching this for 42 years and you see one President after another get dumped one marketing tie after another gets switched. And then a new guy comes in or a new lady comes in and sanity returns and the bottom line returns and they realize finally, and irrevocably, there is only one way known to mankind to increase business, and that is by increasing the quality of customer experience. This market in China is a repeat market, they come once a week. And the quality of their experience is the only thing that matters. Consistency is what they depend upon. Predictability is what they want, just like everything else alike. Predictability, consistency, when you get the short-term thinking nitwits jumping around, it just means that pretty soon there'll be a new name on the business card. I've been watching it for 42 years, I mean, it's very difficult. It's almost unimaginable that you would need to explain at this day and age that all the casinos in Macau were paying the right amount of commission. That is to say the most amount they could give and maintain a stable business. And then some Yahoo shows up and says, ""What go up by 20%?"" We just discovered juicy fruit. It is the dumbest thing I've ever seen. We watched this happen because there's always a new dumbbell. And then there's an ex-dumbbell and until finally they end up with someone who knows how to run the business properly and they pay attention to what really does increase market share or market penetration and that is the quality of the customer experience. And that is all there is to say about this subject. And if you see somebody given more money away than the rest of us can give to attract the customers more promotional allowances, then you are looking at the walking dead. Call that person a zombie because their days are numbered.

And when I sit with them and say who are we going to be in Cotai and can we afford to have the two places, are we just going to cannibalize the one we've got. The answer comes back from Linda and company and Ian and company and JD and Doreen and Frankie Zhao [ph] and all my colleagues, no, Steve, we're not going to cannibalize it. This market growth, we are right on schedule. We didn't build each one of the things we built. We built in due course. We let sands go first with the one that they built with the down and dirty quick one, the sands. We took our time and we opened Wynn, and then we took our time and we added tower at Encore and our penetration got better. We didn't cannibalize anything. We increased our fair share. We planned and took our time and we're ready now to build and we're starting to build Cotai because we knew, understanding market rates of growth and seeing that the operation of our competitors have been learning from that, that we would arrive at the date of opening that would allow us to achieve parity with our operation on the peninsula. And grow intelligently with our feet underneath us, gathered up and collected, like a good show horse that goes over a jump, collected. So I think that we're going to make a lot of money on Cotai. I think we're going to have 10,000 or so, 1,200, 15,000 employees and it's going to be a very stable happy experience because we did it in due course. We didn't try and do it all at once. We didn't think it being master of the universe. We thought only of one thing. How do you build with a solid foundation, a steady, predictable, long-term business and be a useful part of the community to be welcomed as a good addition to the community. To sort of be part of keeping the promise of the plan, in this case, of the government of Macau. And that's a slower, more carefully studied and considered process. And that's why our third hotel is going to open up in four years. The first one was in '06, the second one was in '09 or '10 and the third is going to be in '14 or '15. That's the arc of our development in China, but those hotels will be there forever, long after I'm gone. When my time is up in this world, those hotels are still be viable wonderful businesses providing security for their employees and the people that run them and the shareholders. And as far as giving you more information about Macau, it looks like I want to do when I got the pictures. I've shown it to all of us here know what the hotel looks like and what it got in it. But to dribble it out conversationally in this format, I think there's better ways of us doing it. I think we probably will call for an investment conference, one in China and one in Las Vegas, that Matt and I will put on with Linda and Ian and the guys and all of us. And we'll show what we're going to do. We'll have a model and we'll unveil its beauty to our joy and to the chagrin of our competitors.

Anybody could've seen it. So we don't intend to keep it. Once we design the hotel, we show it and if somebody wants to go, I remember going to Atlantic City this past year, I was making a tour of various jurisdictions to learn about what was going on in America because I haven't done it in so long. And I was walking out of the Borganta, which I want to look at and there next-door was Harra's, with a curved tower and asymmetrical roof, a very poor, homely copy of the Wynn Las Vegas. And I called up Gary Loveman, and I said, ""Hey man, have you no shame?"" I mean, and in the building was in the wrong proportion. In order to do what we do with our building, it has to be horizontal in its proportion or doesn't look right. And this one was verticals, which just looked like sort of a tall rectangle with point on one end. And he said he gave me an answer, he said ""Well, duplication is a serious form of flattery."" I found that relatively unsatisfactory answer. I think maybe someone should try to do their own thing instead of doing bad copies of other people's things. But we do give the boys a chance to louse up what they think we're doing. But there always one hotel behind and that reminds me of the story when Waylon Jennings met a kid that imitated the western singer. He told the kid, ""Listen, I know you're a nice kid and you sing good and you're good-looking, but if you do well in Jennings, I'm already doing well in Jennings and you got to be yourself if you want to be successful in life, because I'll tell you something, son, and the boy's name was Wendell Atkins. Is it Wendell? Is it Waylon Jennings? If you do me, you're always going to be one record behind. And I thought that was a great funny remark. I was standing there when he said it. So if people copy our hotels, they're always one hotel behind. It's okay with me. Linda?
