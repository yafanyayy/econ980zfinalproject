Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ted Wise, our Chief Operating Officer; David O'Reilly, our executive Chai",2235,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ted Wise, our Chief Operating Officer; David O'Reilly, our executive Chairman is also present. I'd like to start off by thanking all our dedicated team members who worked so hard each and everyday to make sure our loyal customers receive the very best service in our business. All they way from our company headquarters, distribution centers, regional offices and most importantly, our stores, our dedication to making customer service our top priority is clearly evident. All of you are to be commended on the solid results we generated in 2009 and I know we're all looking forward to continuing the growth of our company as we work to make 2010 another great year. It's now been a little over a year and a half since we began the process of integrating CSK with O'Reilly. During this relatively short period of time, we feel we've accomplished a lot and are clearly on pace with integration plan that we put in place directly following the acquisition. At the end of 2009, we had integrated many of the headquarters functions, renegotiated most of our supplier agreement, changed over and enhanced most of the product offering in the CSK stores, completely changed over 185 stores in the center of the country, we merged the Minneapolis distribution center into the O'Reilly distribution center in Brooklyn Park, converted the Detroit distribution center to O'Reilly systems and material handling, converted the Detroit Murray's stores to R systems, opened the Seattle distribution center, converted 141 of the 193 stores that are supplied by Seattle to R systems, along with a long list of other accomplishments necessary to integrate CSK with O'Reilly.Since the first of the year, we've completed the remaining system conversions in the stores supplied out of Seattle. We opened our Moreno Valley, California distribution center in January 18 and has since started converting the computer systems and has converted 148 stores supplied by Moreno Valley and hedges 90 to go to complete the Moreno Valley distribution area. These distribution center openings, along with the subsequent store system conversions, are the most important step in our integration process. As we'd outlined before, the 185 stores that were converted in the center of the country, which included the Minnesota, Montana, West Texas and New Mexico Checker Stores, along with the Chicago Murray's stores were very disruptive. These complete changeovers involve closing the stores for a week on average, removing the stores existing inventory, resetting the store layout, installing a new inventory, along with new computer systems, operational procedures and everything else that goes along with an O'Reilly store, we basically turned these stores into O'Reilly stores in one week time. This process again was very disruptive to the operation of the business. The conversions that we're currently doing at West are simply computer system and procedural conversions. These conversions do not require us to close the store and are not nearly as disruptive as the changeovers that were done in the center of the country. We're progressing with these changeovers at a rate of 30 stores per week and are being completed as we open our new Western distribution centers. To complete these, we send a tenured O'Reilly team member to each of the stores to be converted on Saturday before the stores plan conversion. This team member's job is to connect the computer terminals, get the system up and running and physically attend a data conversion, which builds the inventory, customer and accounting files necessary to do business on O'Reilly systems.These conversions take place after the close of business each Saturday night and we have a very qualified conversion and support staff here in Springfield that runs these conversions each weekend. On Sunday morning, the stores open on O'Reilly system and are connected to their new servicing DC. The team members of the store would have previously had training on how to use our point of sale system and the tenured O'Reilly team member acts as the trainer for the first week of business and stays there, at the store, for just first week. We then have a second trainer coming the following Saturday to spend another week with the store to make sure the store manager and team members not only have complete training on making point of sale transactions but also on all the various daily routine functions and procedures. So far, these conversions have gone very well and we're pleased with the results we're seeing. We remained very confident in our ability to complete the conversions according to the schedule we said as part of our integration plan. As most of you know, this plan involves putting a much robust distribution network in place in the western half of the country. This network basically emulates the network we have in place in the core O'Reilly markets and when completed, all of our stores will get the level of distribution and service and support that has allowed our company to prosper in both the do-it-yourself business and as a preferred supplier and business partner to commercial customers in the core O'Reilly market.Once we complete Moreno Valley, we will proceed with the opening of our Denver, Colorado distribution center in March then the opening of Salt Lake City in May, the relocation of our Dixon, California distribution center to Stockton, California in late August and then final step of these conversions will be the system conversion of our Phoenix distribution center along with the 151 stores supplied by Phoenix, which is currently planned for December 6. Like I said, these conversions are going very well and we're clearly not seeing the disruption in business that we were seeing with the complete changeovers that we completed in the center of the country.Now onto our fourth quarter performance. As I mentioned on our third quarter conference call, primarily for competitive reasons, the fourth quarter is the last quarter we plan to disclose the level of comparable stores sales detail that we've been disclosing since the third quarter of 2008. We plan to go back to reporting our company's total comparable store sales performance as a single consolidated comparison with our 2010 report. I know most of you read on our press release last night that during the fourth quarter, we generated consolidated comparable store sales of 2.7%. Our guidance estimate in our third quarter earnings release was consolidated comparable store sales in the 2% to 4% range. So we were within our range. This is slightly below the midpoint of our guidance due to a drop in our comparable store sales performance in December. This was partly due to the tough comparisons we had from December of last year and partly due to the macroeconomic factors that we assume, applied more pressure during the Christmas holiday with consumer spending more of their discretionary income and available credit on the holidays.Comps in the first quarter are on a solid trend and we think we'll see continued incremental improvements as the year progresses and we are able to take advantage of our distribution infrastructure in the western states. The stores on O'Reilly systems generated comparable store sales of 2.4% on top of the 6.2% comp increase they generated in fourth quarter last year. Considering the relatively tough comparisons, we're reasonably pleased with the performance of the stores on O'Reilly systems. The obvious exception to that comment would of course be the 141 converted Murray's stores, which had a comp store sales decrease of 11%. Included in these stores are the Detroit area stores. These stores operate in one of the most challenging economies in the country with unemployment almost 3x the national rate.It's hard to be pleased with the comp performance of these stores that as we've explained before they are in a state of transition and are moving to a more sustainable business model comprised of a healthy mix of both retail and commercial business, focused on auto parts and supplies as opposed to the substantial amount of non-automotive products these stores have previously been selling. Many of the core hard parts category are performing well in these stores as we drive this transition and as we continue to establish ourselves as an outstanding auto parts store for the do-it-yourself customers and as a great business partner and supplier to the commercial accounts in the Chicago and Detroit areas. Overtime, we'll see significant improvement in the performance of these stores.The 123 converted Checker Stores located primarily in the upper Midwest, Texas and New Mexico are performing well. The business model in these stores was more similar to that of O'Reilly and we're doing a good job in these stores, in these markets, establishing relationships with commercial customers and starting to build that side of the business. The Checker Store conversions in the center of the country generated an impressive 8.5% comparable store sales growth for the quarter. The western stores operating on the CSK systems generated 3.5% comparable store sales. Please keep in mind, as you consider our Western CSK store performance, that the 5.2% comp we generated in these stores during the third quarter was comparing to a 4.3% decrease in comps in the prior year. The 3.5% comp we generated in the fourth quarter was comparing to an 80 basis point positive comp in the prior year. So the positive sales trend we've been on in these stores continues.We remain very confident and excited about the opportunities we have to grow market share on both sides of our business in the Western states and we're looking forward to the complete rollout of our distribution capabilities as we continue the execution of our CSK integration plan. Generally speaking, we are very pleased with our performance to this point with the integration CSK. It's clearly represented a significant challenge and we still have a long ways to go to complete the integration but the pieces are coming together very well. Our team has worked very hard to execute our integration plan and our vendors have been very supportive of integration. I think the outstanding vendor support we've received is clearly exemplified in the improvements we've seen in our gross margin. We ended the year with a 48% gross margin compared to a 45.5% in 2008, a 250 basis point improvement.Tom will be giving specific gross margin guidance in a moment. But generally, we expect to be able to maintain these higher gross margin levels and our company will benefit nicely as we work to leverage our fixed cost by implementing our dual market strategy, allowing us to grow our sales in many markets, in which we feel CSK was underperforming. At the end of the year, we ended the year with an 11.1% operating margin, well on our way to getting our operating margin back to the pre-CSK levels and beyond. Having made many of the capital investments that needed to be made in order to enable the CSK stores to execute our dual market strategy, we're looking forward to getting back to positive cash flow generation this year. Again, Tom will be reviewing all our financials in detail in a moment. Just looking at our business from a very high level for a moment, the tailwinds for our industry continue to be the increasing average Asia vehicles in operation due to the improved engineering of newer vehicles and the decreases we've seen in new car and truck sales. The potential for continued increases in the number of vehicles on the road as the U.S. population continues to grow, the closing of OE dealerships, which potentially puts some of the service that was being done at dealerships into the automotive aftermarket. And for us, continued consolidation of the industry. At last count, the top 10 chains in the U.S. represented only 42% at the total parts stores and with many of our larger competitors modifying their business models to try and execute modified versions of a dual market strategy, we expect many of the weaker stores and smaller chains will fall under increased pressure, creating more expansion opportunities for companies like ours to see opportunity for continued growth. The headwinds are obviously the general economic condition in the U.S. with unemployment hovering around 10%, increased fuel prices. For example, at the end of 2009, we showed the average price per gallon of gas at $2.60 per gallon compared to $1.64 at the end of 2008, an almost 60% increase. This obviously takes more money out of our customers' pockets and has proven over time can put pressure on the total miles driven in the U.S. However, we see a lot of opportunity. Over time, we feel we can become a significant factor in the supply of parts to commercial customers in Western U.S. and at the same time, feel we can improve our penetration on the do-it-yourself side of the business in all the markets we serve. All 45,000 members of Team O'Reilly are working hard to make those things happen and we're looking forward to a successful 2010 as we work toward completing the integration of CSK and making O'Reilly an auto parts brand that will be easily recognized from coast-to-coast. I'll now turn the call over to Ted Wise for some additional comments."

Before discussing CSK integration, I would like to quickly review our fourth quarter expansion and then summarize our growth for last year. By design, we ended the year by installing 10 new stores in the fourth qua",1727,"Thanks, Greg and good morning, everyone. Before discussing CSK integration, I would like to quickly review our fourth quarter expansion and then summarize our growth for last year. By design, we ended the year by installing 10 new stores in the fourth quarter. This enabled us to redirect much of the store installation department in our field team's attention to plan and start the store resets in the West. The fourth quarter expansion included three stores in North Carolina, three stores in Ohio, three stores in Wisconsin and one store in South Carolina and one store in Virginia. We also relocated two stores into new buildings, which brought us up to 14 relocations for the year. We completed 21 store renovations in the fourth quarter for a total of 53 store renovations last year. Then as I mentioned, in the last part of the year, our installation team's completed 27 store resets in the Checker and Kragen stores in the western state. New store expansion for the year reached our 150 store goal and covered 25 of our 28 stores we operate in.As planned to support our new distribution center in Greensboro this year, North Carolina let the growth of 29 new stores. Ohio had 21 stores, Texas continued to contribute good markets with 60 new stores. Georgia had 12 stores, South Carolina and Wisconsin end up with 11 new stores and our growth continues into Florida with eight new stores. Tennessee had seven stores. The remaining 35 stores were spread out in 17 additional states. As I've mentioned the past, the geographic coverage of our distribution centers allow us to more effectively and strategically plan and execute our store growth. While the majority of our growth is focused towards supporting the newer distribution centers like Greensboro and Indianapolis, we continue to see [indiscernible] good store opportunities within our more mature markets. Our continued expansion into markets like Texas, Arkansas and Missouri, provide additional leverage in our distribution centers, our field management team and our overall corporate infrastructure. The execution of our dual market sales plan to both the DIY customer and the professional customers gives us the opportunity from an O'Reilly store growth in many small, but very profitable markets that fall in our nightly distribution model.Since we are in the middle of the CSK conversions, we have decided to set our goal for new store growth next year at 150 installations. There are few new stores planned for the West Coast this coming year. Our expansion will continue to be more concentrated in the Eastern states, serviced out at Greensboro and Atlanta as well as the Ohio Valley state, serviced out of the NDDC and have nearly converted the Detroit distribution center. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the great job that the corporate department and the teams in the field have done in planning, installing and staffing our new store expansions. Especially considering they have also been very involved in the CSK acquisition and the integration plan.Now for some additional remarks on the CSK store and distribution center conversions. As Greg outlined in his comments, the computer conversions in the and stores the expansion of the distribution centers is moving forward across the according to plan. Last spring, the Detroit distribution center was converted to start servicing the 79 converted Murray's stores in the Detroit area. It also played important role in supporting and supplying our new stores in Ohio and Michigan this year. The remaining converted Murray's stores in Chicago moved to our Indianapolis, DC and our distribution centers in Lubbock [ph], Minneapolis and Billings begin supplying the other 133 converted Checker Stores.As you may recall, this first group of Murray's and Checker Stores involve complete inventory lift, resets to the front display floor, new computer installations and going to our daily inventory replenishment. We have now finished installing interior O'Reilly packages in all these stores and with the exception of couple of stores, all the exterior signage has been converted to the O'Reilly Brand. Now moving to the West, the Seattle, DC was opened in November and as Greg described, 193 Kragen stores have been converted to the O'Reilly computer systems. Our Moreno Valley, DC opened last month and with all the same conversion schedule for the 238 Kragen stores that we get in Seattle of approximately 30 stores per weekend.Then in March, we will open a new distribution center in Denver and begin the conversion of the 84 Checker Stores in that market. In May, we will open the distribution center in Salt Lake City and follow with the 86 Checker Store conversion. And then in August, we will return to California to move our current distribution center in Dixon into a brand new 520 square foot building in Stockton. This will allow us to complete the conversion of the remaining 276 stores, again, following a 30 store per week schedule. Then in early December, the last piece in the puzzle will be converted to the system in our Phoenix distribution center. And the last Checker Store in Arizona and New Mexico will be converted. Since this will be the last conversion in the chain, the store conversions will take place on the same weekend. The end result will be all CSK DC and all CSK stores will be fully converted to O'Reilly system and the O'Reilly distribution model by the end of 2010.Our entire team has done a great job of planning and executing the conversion process in both DCs and the stores. These conversions, especially with the tight schedule we are working within, would not be possible without the contribution of literary thousands of team members from the core O'Reilly stores going to the CSK conversion stores for weeks at a time to help install and train. It is very rewarding to see our core O'Reilly team members work side-by-side with our new West Coast team as we implement our systems and our full dual market business strategy.Our store installation teams have started the reset at the front floors in the West Coast stores, which is entirely different and independent of the computer conversion schedule. Depending on the scope of the project, we will be able to do around 30 store projects per week. Immediately following the resets of the store fixtures and the new plan to grant each store will have interior remodel work done and the new O'Reilly interior decor package installed. The planning and the permitting for the new O'Reilly signs to rebrand the stores is well underway in the West Coast. Our goal is to have the store rebranding completed by the middle of next year, as well as any interior upgrade and maintenance needed. Now to add a few comments regarding the progress and growth of our business out West. With the exception of a few front room lines left to be converted, the product line upgrades and hard parts additions are finished. We have very good coverage in all stores that is supported by a larger inventory and strategically-placed hub stores. Of course, as the new DCs open, we gained the advantage of having over 100,000 SKUs available each night and sometimes during the day, if the stores are closed to the DC. Our DIY pricing has been adjusted to be more competitive in each market and our retail advertising, which includes print and radio is focusing on the increased product availability and more competitive prices along with continue to educate the customer to the transition to the O'Reilly Brand.The co-branding has gone very well, which helped us decide to rebrand the stores to O'Reilly sooner than what we had originally planned. In regard to the installer side of our business, the inventory upgrades have been important in growing our business along with improving our service level and providing great delivery service to our professional customers. Our sales team, consisting of full-time territory sales managers, and store sales specialists are very focused on developing sound relationships with our professional customers. We are very pleased with how the new O'Reilly team members and the conversion CSK stores have taken the new O'Reilly program and our are executing the dual market sales strategy in their markets. We are also very confident we will continue to have strong sales results and gain market share as the stores convert to our computer systems have better inventory availability with the new distribution centers.Now I'd like to briefly take a few comments to discuss our O'Reilly Managers Conference that was held last month in Nashville at the Granville Opryland Hotel and Convention Center [ph]. There were 45 management and a sales team member from our stores, distribution centers and corporate offices. The conference program involved both operations and sales training, which were customized to the individual store division. In addition to the O'Reilly training sessions, our vendors held a product and show [ph], as well as a number of key in-depth product training seminars for our team. Our general sessions were designed to recognize our high achievers, as well as to discuss the challenges and opportunities ahead of our company and the role that each of us play in achieving our sales and profitability. This is also the first time that our new West Coast store managers attended the conference and proved to be a huge benefit in helping them feel more part of the team and see up close what the O'Reilly culture is all about. Our management sales team's left Nashville very enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead of us and with an increased level of determination to gain market share this year in their individual markets. To finish my comments, I would like to thank our 45,000 O'Reilly team members for the hard work and their commitment to help make this a very successful year for the company. This success has been based on a true team effort and contribution and many of our team members were part of the CSK conversion stores. Others were very involved in the actual conversion and planning and execution. And core O'Reilly stores and distribution centers team member stayed totally focused on growing our core O'Reilly business. Judging from our company's performance, everyone did an outstanding job. And again, I would like to thank everyone for that job last year. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

Now we'll move on to the numbers. For the quarter, sales increased $59 million, 5% over the prior year to up $1.17 billion.

For the quarter, sales increased $59 million, 5% over the prior year to up $1.17 billion. The increase was attributable to a $30 million increase in comp store sales, $31 million increase in non-comp new store sales, flat sales in non-comp, non-store in sales and a $2 million decrease in stores merged and closed in 2008. For the year, sales have increased $1.27 billion, 36% over the prior year to $4.85 billion, the increase was attributable to a $189 million increase in comp store sales, $145 million increase in non-comps new store sales, a $4 million increase in non-comps, non-store sales. $935 million in a CSK sales for the period, we did not own CSK from the comparative period of 2008, which was January 1 through July 11 and a $2 million decrease in stores merged and closed in 2008.  For 2010, we estimate our total revenue will be between $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. Moving on to gross profit. Gross profit was up 48.5% of sales for the quarter versus 46.2% in the prior year. The improvement was driven by the improved product acquisition costs negotiated with vendors based on our increased post-acquisition purchasing levels. For 2010, we estimate gross profit, as a percent of sales, will be 48.1% to 48.4% of sales. Inherent in this range, this $25 million of incremental buying synergies, we will see primarily in the first quarter, offset in part by decreased distribution cost associated with the ramp up of efficiency at our new distribution centers and pressure on the gross margin as the larger mix of the total business is done on the commercial side, which carries a lower gross margin percentage. Where we end up in the range would be driven largely by how successful we are at adding commercial sales in the converted stores, which will put pressure on the gross margin percent of sales but will be incremental to the gross margin dollars per store, which is our focus.SG&A for the quarter was 37.8% of sales versus 39.0% in the prior year. Excluding acquisition-related charges, SG&A was 37.7% of sales versus 37.9% in the prior year. Leverage on SG&A came from increased sales per store. On a per store basis, excluding adjustments, SG&A dollars were up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2008. That slight increase is comprised of decreases in headquarters, advertising and general store expenses, offset by increases in store payroll related to the cost of store conversions and the cost of launch in additional commercial programs and converted stores. For 2010, we expect SG&A dollars per store to be slightly down. We'll continue to invest significant dollars in store conversions, training and new commercial programs where we expect this to be fully offset by increased synergies on headquarters and advertising and increased sales driven by our store investment made in 2009.Operating margin for the quarter was 10.7% of sales, an improvement of 345 basis points over the prior year. Excluding acquisition adjustment, the quarterly operating margin increased 244 basis points. For 2009, operating margin was 11.1% of sales and is quickly closing in on our pre-acquisition outcome operating margin of 11.8% for the period ended June, 2008. We're very encouraged on the rapid progress we've made in returning our operating margin to pre-acquisition levels in such a relatively short period of time. We expect our operating margins for 2010 to exceed the pre-acquisition of operating margins.A little bit about interest, net interest expense for the quarter was $11 million, which was $2 million less than prior year and lower LIBOR offset in part by higher debt levels. For 2010, we expect net interest expense of $41 million to $43 million based and lower average debt levels. This estimate is also subject to unforeseen changes in LIBOR levels to the extent our debt is not swapped in fixed rates. The tax provision for the quarter was 38.0% of pretax income as compared to 37.7% in the prior year. The fourth quarter results were favorable to our third quarter guidance due to the favorable resolution of certain tax issues. For 2010, we expect our tax rate as a percent of pretax income to be 38.0% up to 38.4% as compared to 38.1% for all of 2009. Where we fall within this range will be dependent on resolution of open tax year audit that occur during the year.Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.52 per share, which represents an increase of 41% over the fourth quarter 2008. For the year, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.26, a 38% increase over the prior year. Now we'll move on to the balance sheet. The average inventory per store at the end of the year was $559,000, which was a 17% increase from the prior year average of $478,000. The increase was in the CSK stores as the core O'Reilly stores average inventory approximated historical levels. The increase was the result of the changeovers at CSK storage, which added a much wider breadth of SKUs available at each store combined with stores on the CSK system receiving only one-stock order a week, which necessitates more stocking debt.In 2009, we intentionally flooded the CSK stores with hard parts to get them back in the hard parts business. In 2010, we are focused on the refining inventory mix at the CSK stores and as a new distribution centers come online, we will be able to reduce the stocking debt at the CSK stores. Based on these 2010 initiatives, we expect only increase our total inventory investment slightly in 2010, despite opening 150 new stores and adding three distribution centers. Our reserve for LIFO at the end of the quarter was $8.7 million, which was a decrease of $4.1 million in the previous quarter. This change in our last pie to LIFO inventory reserve did not have a material impact on gross margin for the fourth quarter. Our accounts payable of $818 million was 42.8% of inventory compared to 46.9% in the prior year. Our AP to inventory ratio at the end of 2008 benefited from special extend dating and changeover orders. In 2010, we expect our AP to inventory ratio will continue to be under pressure as we work excess inventory out of and through the system.Capital expenditures were $98 million for the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $415 million, which was within our estimate of the 2009 CapEx spend of $400 million to $420 million we discussed on the third quarter call. For 2010, we anticipate capital expenditures will be $400 million to $440 million as we complete our DC projects and continue to invest heavily in store conversions. Excluding conversion CapEx, maintenance CapEx in our 150 new stores would be an approximately the $250 million range. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $37 million and $148 million respectively. For 2010, we expect depreciation and amortization to be $154 million to $159 million. Moving on to debt. Total borrowings were $791 billion at the end of December this year compared to $733 million at the end of 2008. The increased debt of $58 million has been used to fund new store growth at the core O'Reilly stores and the conversion of investment including book CapEx and net inventory at required CSK stores. However, the majority of these investments had been covered by internally generated cash flow. For the year, we've increased our debt outstanding on our ABL-backed 62 $5 million [ph] . However, because of the increase in our borrowing base, availability under the revolver has actually increased slightly to $445 million, providing us with ample available credit. For 2010, we expect to reduce our total outstanding borrowings by $150 million to $250 million.

Our plan is to fund this with our existing ABL [ph], which will still as significant financial flexibility.Now for some other financial information. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was a use of $4 million versus the positive $9 million in the prior year. Both numbers reflect the seasonal nature of our cash flows from operating activity. For the year, cash flow from operating activity decreased $30 million to $285 million, driven by the higher income, offset by our large investment in net inventory. For the year, free cash flow was a use of $130 million as we invested heavily on inventory and CapEx to the DC expansion and store conversions. We expect free cash flow to swing to a positive $120 million to $150 million in 2010 as we continue, again, invest heavily in CapEx but did not have a significant investment in net inventory.CapEx with the DC expansion and store conversions. We expect free cash flow to swing to a positive $120 million to $150 million in 2010 as we continue again, invest heavily in CapEx but do not have a significant investment in net inventory.Stock option expense for the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $2.5 million in the prior year and the year-to-date stock option expense was $13.5 million compared to $8 million in the prior year. With the increase being driven by the options issued in connection with the CSK acquisition. For 2010, we expect stock option expense to be approximately $16 million. We finished by recapping our overall guidance. For the first quarter, our comparable store sales guidance is 2% to 4%. And for the year, our comparable store sales guidance increases 3% to 5% as we see the positive impact of more converted CSK stores. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance for the first quarter is from $0.56 to $0.60 on $139.5 million shares and our adjusted GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance for the full year is from $2.50 to $2.56 on a 140.3 million shares. At this time, I would like to ask Mandy, our operator to come back and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

Although the ultimate result we feel would be very similar. I think the comparison there would be that in the stores in the center of the country, we saw pretty significant dips in performance that were the result of closing the store for a week as we did the conversion and then just the shock of training, all the products being relocated in the store. A very disruptive process that caused the sales to be soft and for the stores not to comp very well for maybe a four-week period or maybe even longer than that in some cases. We won't see the downturn in sales to the degree that we did in the center of the country stores, in the western stores but I think the end result will be similar and that varies by market. We have more opportunity in some markets than others, obviously.

December business from a comp store sales perspective soften some on tough comparisons. We had a good December last year. In 2007, we had a soft December. We related the softer comps comparing 2008 of course, to the fact that consumers have been under a lot of pressure. Gas prices were up over 2008 and that there wasn't as much discretionary spending as what there would be and what there was available was being used as much as possible for holiday gifts and things like that. From a competitive standpoint, we've heard the same things that you've heard about the things our two competitors said. And as earlier mentioned, of course, they went through a process, I think, of adjusting their pricing. I think they're more competitive than they were before, retail. I don't think we've seen that so much on the commercial side. I don't know to what degree that affects us. We would be limited on the other competitor from an exposure standpoint to just the eastern half of the country. But we really haven't seen a material effect from that at this point. It's hard to measure that, of course. We work hard to keep our prices competitive and we never feel that we've gotten ourselves to a point that we're just done. It's a weekly process, a daily process. There's a whole team here that works on maintaining competitive retail prices and competitive prices for our repair shop partners and that's never a completed process. And there's never a time that we shop a complete line as some of our competitors having changed their prices.

We started last year as far as looking at the staffing models in the store, realizing that we were going to have a better hard parts selection first of all, very, very soon, immediately. But then we opened the DCs, we'd have the next layer of supply. So we started building stronger teams in the store from what we call them ISS, installer service specialist. Improving the hard parts mix, evaluating the territories around the stores and building new territories for more accounts. Their model was to call on a lot of the large accounts, but they overlooked a lot of small shops around the stores. So we sort of reengineered how they made sales calls, increased the number of TSMs. And like I said, it's a work in progress of implementing new installer service centers in the stores. We call them first call centers and in this consistency. And building relationships at the installer level, and it's working. We feel like the additional inventory now, particularly some of the brands that we have added towards the end of the year, last year and the last one, for instance, [indiscernible] we just changed over, which is a more additional line of oil filters and air filters. So we're really in good shape from a product standpoint. Obviously, with the new DCs, couldn't be in better shape with the supply chain. We'll just continue making consistent calls and give great customer service level. Dial-in to the competitive pricing, which there's different competitors in different markets. So you have to be competitive if you're going to get the business, and just grow the business. It's a process, it doesn't happen overnight because it is so relationship based. And quite honestly, the Seattle area had a pretty good foundation to grow from. They had a proportionally probably a better installer mix of business than what a lot of the Kragen and Checker stores did."

Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ted Wise, our Chief Operating Officer; David O’Reilly, our Executive Chai",2285,"Good morning, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ted Wise, our Chief Operating Officer; David O’Reilly, our Executive Chairman is also present.
I would like to start off by thanking all of our dedicated team members who work so hard each and everyday to make sure our loyal customers receive the very best service in our business. All the way from our company headquarters, distribution centers, regional offices, and most importantly our stores, our dedication to making customer service our top priority is clearly evident. All of you to be commended on all the solid results we generated in 2009, and I know we are all looking forward to continuing the growth of our company as we work to make 2010 other great year.
It’s now been a little over a year and half since we began the process of integrating CSK with O’Reilly. During this relatively short period of time, we feel we have accomplished a lot and are clearly on pace with the integration plan that we put in place directly following the acquisition.
At the end of 2009, we had integrated many of that headquarters function. We negotiated most of our supplier agreement, changed over and enhanced most of the product offering in the CSK stores, completely changed over a 185 stores in the center of the country. We merged Minneapolis Distribution Center into the O’Reilly Distribution Center in Brooklyn Park, converted the Detroit Distribution Center to O’Reilly systems and material handing, converted the Detroit Murray Stores to our systems, opened the Seattle Distribution Center, converted a 141 of the 193 stores that are supplied by Seattle to our systems along with a long list of other accomplishments necessary to integrate CSK with O’Reilly.
Since the course of the year, we completed the remaining system conversions in the stores supplied out of Seattle. We opened our Moreno Valley California Distribution Center on January 18th and have since started converting the computer system and have converted 148 stores supplied by Moreno Valley and have just 90 [ph] to go to complete the complete Moreno Valley distribution area. These distribution center openings along with the subsequent store system conversions are the most important step in our integration process.
As we have outlined before, the 185 stores that were converted in the center of country, which included the Minnesota, Montana, West Texas and New Mexico Checker Stores along with the Chicago Murray stores were very disruptive. These complete changeovers involve closing the stores for a week on average or moving the stores’ existing inventory, resetting the store layout, installing a new inventory along with new computer systems, operational procedures and every thing else that goes along with an O’Reilly store, we basically turn these into O’Reilly stores in one weeks’ time. This process, again, was very disruptive to the operation of the business.
The conversions that we are currently doing are now left are simply computer system and procedural conversion. These conversions do not require us to close the store and are not nearly as disruptive as the changeovers that were done in the center of the country.
We are progressing with these changeovers at a rate of 30 stores per week and are being completed as we open our new western distribution centers. To complete these, we send a tenured O’Reilly team member to each of the stores to be converted on Saturday, the four of the stores planned to conversion. This team member’s job is to connect the computer terminals, get the system up and running and physically attend the data conversion which builds the inventory, customer and accounting files necessary to do business on O’Reilly systems.
These conversions take place after the close of business each Saturday night, and we have a very qualified conversion and support staff here in Springfield that run these conversions each weekend. On Sunday morning, the stores open on O’Reilly systems and are connected to their new servicing DC. The team member of the store would have previously had training on how to use our point of sale system and the tenured O’Reilly team member access the trainer for the first week of business and stays there at the store for this first week. We then have a second trainer come in the following Saturday to spend another week with the store to make sure the store manager and team members not only have complete training on making point of sale transactions, but also on all the various daily routine functions and procedures.
So far these conversions have gone very well, and we are pleased with the result we are seeing. We remain very confident in our ability to complete the conversions according to the schedule we set as part of our integration plan. As most of you know, this plan of ours is putting a much more robust distribution network in place in the western half of the country. This network basically emulates the network we have in place in the core O’Reilly markets. And when completed all of our stores will get the level of distribution, service and support that it has allowed our company to prosper in both at do-it-yourself business and as a preferred supplier and business partner to commercial customers in the core O’Reilly markets.
Once we complete Moreno Valley, we’ll proceed with the opening of our Denver, Colorado, distribution center in March, then the opening of Salt Lake City in May to relocation of our Dixon, California distribution center to Stockton, California, in late August, and then the final step of these conversions will be the system conversion of our Phoenix distribution center along with the 151 stores supplied by Phoenix, which is currently planned for December 6th. Like I said, these conversions are going very well and we’re clearly not seeing the disruption in business that we’re seeing with the complete changeovers that we completed in the center of the country.
Now on to our fourth quarter performance. As I mentioned on our third quarter conference call, primarily for competitive reasons, the fourth quarter is the last quarter we planned to disclose the level of comparable stores sales detail that we have been disclosing since the third quarter of 2008. We planned to go back to reporting our company’s total comparable store sales performance as a single consolidated comparison with our 2010 reporting.
I know most of you read on our press release last night that during the fourth quarter we generated consolidated comparable store sales of 2.7%. Our guidance estimate in our third quarter earnings release was consolidated comparable store sales in the 2% to 4% range, so we were within our range, but slightly below the midpoint of our guidance due to a drop in our comparable store sales performance in December. This was partly due to the tough comparisons we had from December of last year and partly due to the macroeconomic factors that we assume applied more pressure during the Christmas holiday with consumer spending more of their discretionary income and available credit on the holidays. Comps in the first quarter are on a solid trend and we think we’ll see continued incremental improvements as the year progresses and we’re able to take advantage of our distribution infrastructure in the western states.
The store on O’ Reilly system generated comparable store sales of 2.4% on top of the 6.2% comp increase they generated in fourth quarter last year. Considering the relatively tough comparisons, we are reasonably pleased with the performance of the stores on O’Reilly systems. The obvious exception to that comment would of course be the 141 converted Murray stores, which had a comp stores sales decrease of 11%. Included in these stores are the Detroit area stores. These stores operate in one of the challenging economies in the country with unemployment almost three times than national rate.
It’s hard to be pleased with the comp performance of these stores that as we have explained before, they are in a state of transition, and are moving to a more sustainable business model comprised of a healthy mix of both retail and commercial business focused on auto parts and supplies as opposed to the substantial amount of non-automotive products these stores had previously been selling.
Many of the core hard parts categories are performing well in these stores as we drive this transition and as we continue to establish ourselves as an outstanding auto parts stores for the do-it-yourself customers, and as a great business partner and supplier to the commercial accounts in the Chicago and Detroit areas.
Over time we will see significant improvement in the performance of these stores. The 123 converted Checker stores located primarily in the upper Midwest, Texas and New Mexico are performing well. The business model in these stores was more similar to that of O’ Reilly and we are doing a good job in these stores - in these markets establishing relationship with commercial customers and starting to build the size of business.
The Checker store conversions in the center of the country generated an impressive 8.5 comparable store sales growth for the quarter. The Western Stores operating on CSK systems generated 3.5% comparable store sales. Please keep in mind, as you consider our Western CSK store performance that the 5.2% comp we generated in these stores during the third quarter was comparing to a 4.3% decrease in comps in the prior year. The 3.5% comp we generated in the fourth quarter was comparing to an 80 basis points positive comp in the prior year. So, the positive sales trend we have been on in these stores continues.
We remain very confident and excited about the opportunities we have to grow market share on both sides of our business in the western states. And we are looking forward to the complete rollout of our distribution capabilities as we continue with the execution of our CSK integration plan. Generally speaking, we are very pleased with our performance at this point with the integration of CSK. It’s clearly represented a significant challenge and we still have a long ways to go to complete the integration but the pieces are coming together very well. Our team has worked very hard to execute our integration plan and our vendors have been very supportive of the integration. I think the outstanding vendor support we’ve received is clearly exemplified in the improvements we have seen in our gross margin.
We ended the year with a 48% gross margin compared to a 45.5% in 2008, a 250 basis point improvement. Tom will be giving specific gross margin guidance in a moment, but generally, we expect to be able to maintain these higher gross margin levels and our company will benefit nicely as we work to leverage our fixed costs by implementing our dual market strategy allowing us to grow our sales in many markets in which we deal CSK with underperforming.
At the end of the year - we ended the year with an 11.1% operating margin, well on our way to getting our operating margin back to pre-CSK levels and beyond. Having made many of the capital investments that needed to be made in order to enable the CSK stores execute our dual market strategy, we are looking forward to getting back to positive cash flow generation this year. Again, Tom will be reviewing all our financials in detail in a moment.
Just looking at our business from a very high level for a moment, the tailwinds for our industry continue to be the increasing average age of vehicles in operation due to the improved engineering of newer vehicles and the decreases we have seen in new car and truck sales. The potential for continued increases in the number of vehicles on the road as the US population continues to grow, the closing of OED dealerships which potentially puts some of the service that was being done at dealerships into the automotive aftermarket, and for us continued consolidation of the industry.
At last count, the top ten chains in the US represented only 42% as the total part stores, and with many of our larger competitors modifying their business models to try and execute modified versions of a dual market strategy, we expect many of the weaker stores and small chains will fall under increased pressure creating more expansion opportunities for companies like ours to see opportunity for continued growth.
The headwinds are obviously the general economic condition in the US with unemployment hovering around 10% increased fuel prices. For example, at the end of 2009 we showed the average price per gallon of gas at over 260 per gallon compared to $1.64 at the end of 2008, an almost 60% increase. This obviously takes more money out of our customer’s pockets and has proven over time can put pressure on the total miles driven in the US.
However, we see a lot of opportunity, and over time we feel we can become a significant factor in the supply of parts to commercial customers in the Western US, and at the same time feel we can improve our penetration on the Do-it-Yourself side of the business in all the markets we serve. All 45,000 members of team O’Reilly are working hard to make those things happen and we are looking forward to a successful 2010 as we work towards completing the integration of CSK and making O’Reilly an auto parts brands that will be easily recognized from coast to coast.
I’ll now turn the call over to your Ted Wise for some additional comments.

Before discussing CSK integration, I would like to quickly review our fourth quarter expansion and summarize our growth for last year. By design, we ended the year by installing 10 new stores in the fourth quarter.",1743,"Thanks, Greg and good morning everyone. Before discussing CSK integration, I would like to quickly review our fourth quarter expansion and summarize our growth for last year. By design, we ended the year by installing 10 new stores in the fourth quarter. This enabled us to redirect much of the stores installation department in our field team attention to plan and start the store resets in the west.
The fourth quarter expansion included three stores in North Carolina, three stores in Ohio, three stores in Wisconsin and one store in South Carolina, and one store in Virginia. We also relocated two stores into new buildings which brought us to 14 relocations for the year. We completed 21 store renovations in the fourth quarter for a total of 53 store renovations last year. And as I mentioned in the last part of the year, our installation team has completed 27 stores reset in the Checker and Kragen Stores in the western state.
New stores expansion for the year reached our 150 store goal and covered 25 of our 28 stores we operate in. As planned to support our new distribution center in Greensboro this year, North Carolina led the growth to 29 new stores, Ohio had 21 stores, Texas continued to contribute good markets with 16 new stores, Georgia had 12 stores, South Carolina and Wisconsin ended up with 11 new stores, and our growth continues into Florida with eight new stores. Tennessee had seven stores. The remaining 35 stores were spread out in 17 additional states. As I have mentioned in the past the geographic coverage of our distribution centers allow us to more effectively and strategically plan and execute our store growth.
While the majority of our growth is focused towards supporting the newer distribution centers like Greensboro and Indianapolis, we continue to seek out and find good store growth opportunities within our more mature markets. Our continued expansion into markets like Texas, Arkansas and Missouri provide additional leverage in our distribution centers, our field management team and our overall corporate infrastructure. The execution of our dual market sales plan to both the DIY customer and the professional customers gives us the opportunity for an O’Reilly store growth in many small but very profitable markets that fall when they are on nightly [ph] distribution model.
Since we are in the middle of the CSK conversion, we have decided to set our goal for new store growth next year at 150 installations. There are few new stores planned for the West Coast this coming year. The expansion will continue to be more concentrated in the Eastern states serviced out at Greensboro and Atlanta as well as the Ohio Valley state serviced out at the NDDC and our recently converted Detroit distribution center.
I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the great job that the corporate departments and the teams in the field have done in planning, installing and staffing our new store expansion, especially considering they had also been very involved in the CSK acquisition and the integration plans.
Now for some additional remarks on the CSK store and distribution center conversions. As Greg outlined in his comments, the computer conversions in the stores and the expansion of the distribution centers is moving forward according to plan. Last spring, the Detroit distribution center was converted to start servicing the 79 converted Murray stores in the Detroit area. It also played an important role in supporting and supplying our new stores in Ohio, in Michigan this year. The remaining converted Murray stores in Chicago moved to our Indianapolis DC. And our distribution centers in Lubbock, Minneapolis, and Billings began supplying the other 123 converted Checker stores.
As you may recall, this first group of Murray and Checker stores involve complete inventory list, resets of the front display floor, new computer installations, and going to our daily inventory replenishment. We have now finished installing interior O’Reilly packages in all these stores, and with the exception of a couple of stores, all the exterior signage has been converted to the O’Reilly brand.
Now moving to the west. The Seattle DC was opened in November, and as Greg described, 193 stores Kragen had been converted over to a lot of computer system. Our Moreno Valley DC opened last month and will follow the same conversion schedule for the 238 Kragen stores that we did in Seattle of approximately 30 stores per weekend. And then in March we will reopen a new distribution center in Denver and begin the conversion of the 84 Checker stores in that market. In May we have opened the distribution center in Salt Lake City and followed with the 86 Checker store conversion.
And then in August we returned to California to move our current distribution center in Dixon into a brand new 520 square foot building in Stockton. This will allow us to complete the conversion of the remaining 276 stores, again following a 30 store per week schedule.
Then in early December the last piece in the puzzle will be converted to the system in our Phoenix distribution center, and the last Checker stores in Arizona, New Mexico will be converted. This will be last conversion in the change. The store conversions will take place on the same weekend.
The end result will be all CHK DCs and all CHK stores will be fully converted to O’Reilly system and the O’Reilly distribution model by the end of 2010. Our entire team has done a great job of planning and executing the conversion process in both the DCs and the stores.
These conversions especially with the tight schedule we are working within would not be possible without the contribution of literally thousands of team members in the core O’Reilly stores going to the CSK conversion stores for weeks at a time to help install and train. It is very rewarding to see our core O’Reilly team members work side by side with our new West Coast team as we implement our systems and our goal dual market business strategy.
Our store installation teams have started to reset of the front floors in the West Coast stores, which is entirely different and independent of the computer conversion schedule. Depending on the scope of the project, we will be able to do around 30 store projects per week. Immediately following the resets of the store fixtures and a new plan grant each store will have interior remodel work done and new O’Reilly interior to cope that is installed. The planning and the permitting for new O’Reilly signs to re-brand the stores is well underway in the West Coast. Our goal is to have the store re-branding completed by the middle of next year as well as any interior upgrade and maintenance needed.
Now to add a few comments regarding the progress and the growth of our business at west. With the exception of this few front room lines left to be converted the product line upgrade and hard part additions are finished. We have very good coverage in all stores that is supported by larger inventory and strategically placed hub stores. Of course as the new DC is opened we gained the advantage of having over 100,000 skews available each night and some time during the day with the store close to the DC. Our DIY pricing has been adjusted to be more competitive in each market and our retail advertising which includes print and radio is focusing on the increase product availability and more competitive prices along with continue to educate the customer on the transition to the O’Reilly brand.
The co-branding is done very well, which helped us to decided re-brand store to O’Reilly soon than what we have originally planned. In regard to the installer side of our business, the inventory upgrade have been important in rolling our business along with improving our service levels and providing great delivery service to our professional customers. Our sales team consisting of full time territory sales managers and store sales specialist are very focused on developing sound relationships with our professional customers.
We are very pleased with how the new O’Reilly team members in the conversion CSK Stores have taken the new O’Reilly programs, and are executing the dual market sales strategy in their markets. We are also very confident we will continue to have strong sales results and gain market share as the stores convert to our computer systems, and have better inventory availability with the new distribution centers.
Now, I would like to briefly take a few comments to discuss our O’Reilly manager’s conference that was held last month in Nashville at the Grand Ole Opry Hotel Convention Center. There were over 4500 O’Reilly management and sales team members from our stores, distribution centers and corporate offices. The conference program involved both operations and sales training, which was customized to the individual store divisions. In addition to the O’Reilly training sessions, our vendors held a product show, as well as a number of key, in-depth product training seminars for our team.
Our general sessions were designed to recognize our high achievers, as well as to discuss the challenges and opportunities ahead of our company, and the role that each of us play in achieving our sales and profit goal. This is also the first time that our new West Coast store managers attended the conference, and proved to be a huge benefit in helping them feel more part of the team, and see up close what the O’Reilly culture is all about. Our management sales teams left Nashville very enthusiastically about the opportunities ahead of us, and with an increased level of determination to gain market share this year in their individual markets.
To finish my comments, I would like to thank our 45,000 O’Reilly team members for their hard work and their commitment to help make this a very successful year for the Company. This success has been based on a true team effort and contribution. Many of our team members were part of the CSK conversion stores. Others were very involved in the actual conversion, and planning and execution. And core O’Reilly stores and distribution center team members stayed totally focused on growing our core O’Reilly business.
Judging from our Company’s performance, everyone did an outstanding job, and again, I would like to thank everyone for that job last year. With that, I’ll turn it over to Tom.

For the quarter, sales increased $59 million, 5% over the prior year to $1.17 billion. The increase was attributable to a $30 million increase in comp store sales, a $31 million increase in non-comp new store sales, flat sales and non-comp non-store sales, and a $2 million decrease in stores merged and closed in 2008.
For the year, sales increased $1.27 billion, 36% over the prior year to $4.85 billion. The increase was attributable to $189 million increase in comp store sales, a $145 million increase in non-comp new store sales, a $4 million increase in non-comp non-store sales, $935 million in CSK sales for the period when we did not own CSK in the comparative period in 2008, which was January 1st through July 11th, and the $2 million decrease in stores merged and closed in 2008. For 2010, we estimate our total revenue will be between $5.1 billion and $5.2 billion.
Moving on to gross profit, gross profit was 48.5% of sales for the quarter versus 46.2% the prior year. The improvement was driven by the improved product acquisition costs negotiated with vendors, based on our increased post-acquisition purchasing levels. For 2010, we have to make gross profit as a percent of sales, will be 48.1% to 48.4% of sales. And inherent in this range, is $25 million of incremental buying synergies we will see primarily in the first quarter, offset in part by decreased distribution costs associated with the ramp up of the efficiencies at our new distribution centers, and pressure on the gross margin as a larger mix of the total business is done on a commercial side, which carries a lower gross margin percentage. Where we end up in the range, will be driven largely by how successful we are at adding commercial sales in the converted stores, which will put pressure on the gross margin percent sales, but will be incremental to gross margin dollars per store which is our focus.
SG&A for the quarter was 37.8% of sales, versus 39.0% in the prior year. Excluding acquisition related charges, SG&A was 37.7% of sales, versus 37.9% in the prior year. Leverage on SG&A came from increased sales per store. On a per store basis excluding adjustments, SG&A dollars were up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2008. That slight increase is comprised of decreases in headquarters, advertising and general store expenses, offset by increases in store payroll, related to the cost of store conversions and the cost of launching additional commercial programs in converted stores. For 2010, we expect SG&A dollars per store to be slightly down. We’ll continue to invest significant dollars in store conversions, training, and new commercial programs, but we expect this to be fully offset by increased synergies on headquarters and advertising and increased sales driven by our store investments made in 2009.
Operating margin for the quarter was 10.7% of sales, an improvement of 345 basis points over the prior year. Excluding acquisition adjustments, the quarterly operating margin increased 244 basis points. For 2009, operating margin was 11.1% of sales, and is quickly closing in on our pre-acquisition LTM operating margin of 11.8% for the period ended June, 2008. We were very encouraged on the rapid progress we have made in returning our operating margin to pre-acquisition levels, in such a relatively short period of time. We expect our operating margins for 2010 to exceed the pre-acquisition operating margins.
A little bit about interest. Net interest expense for the quarter was $11 million, which was $2 million less than the prior year on lower LIBOR, offset in part by higher debt levels. For 2010, we expect net interest expense of $41million to $43 million based on lower average debt levels. This estimate is also subject to unforeseen changes in LIBOR levels to the extent our debt is not swapped to fixed rate.
The tax provision for the quarter was 38.0% of pretax income, as opposed - excuse me - as compared to 37.7% in the prior year. The fourth quarter results were favorable to our third quarter guidance due to the favorable resolution of certain tax issues. For 2010, we expect our tax rate as a percent of pretax income to be 38.0% to 38.4%, as compared to 38.1% for all of 2009. Where we fall within this range, will be dependent on resolution of open tax year audits that occurred during the year.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.52 per share, which represents an increase of 41% over the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.26, a 38% increase over the prior year.
Now moving on to the balance sheet. The average inventory per store at the end of the year was $559,000, which was a 17% increase from the prior year average of $478,000. The increase was in the CSK stores, as the core O’Reilly stores average inventory approximated historical levels. The increase was a result of changeovers of CSK stores, which added a much wider breadth of SKUs available at each store, combined with the CSK stores systems - excuse me, combined with the stores on the CSK System, receiving only one stock order a week which necessitates more stocking depth.
In 2009, we intentionally flooded the CSK stores with hard parts, to get them back in our hard parts business. In 2010, we are focused on refining the inventory mix at the CSK stores, and as the new distribution centers come online, we’ll be able to reduce the stocking depth at the CSK stores. Based on these 2010 initiatives, we expect only to increase our total investment slightly in 2010, despite opening a 150 new stores and adding three distribution centers.
Our reserve for LIFO at the end of the quarter was $8.7 million, which was a decrease of $4.1 million in the previous quarter. This change in our last buy to LIFO inventory reserve did not have material impact on gross margin for the quarter. Accounts payable of $818 million was 42.8% of inventory, as compared to 46.9% in the prior year. Our AP to inventory ratio at the end of 2008, benefited from special extended dating on changeover orders.
In 2010, we expect our AP to inventory ratio will continue to be under pressure as we work excess inventory out of, and through the system. Capital expenditures were $98 million for the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $415 million, which was within our estimate of a 2009 CapEx spend of $400 million to $420 million we discussed on our third quarter call. For 2010, we anticipate capital expenditures will be $400 million to $440 million, as we complete our DC projects and continue to invest heavily in store conversions. Excluding conversion CapEx, maintenance CapEx in our 150 new stores would be approximately in the $250 million range. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $37 million, and a $148 million respectively. For 2010, we expect depreciation and amortization to be $154 million to $159 million.
Moving on to debt. Total borrowings were $791 million at the end of December, this year, compared $733 million at the end of 2008. The increased debt of $58 million has been used to fund new store growth at the core O’Reilly stores, and a conversion investment, including both CapEx and net inventory of the acquired CSK stores. However, the majority of these investments have been covered by internally generated cash flow.
For the year, we have increased our debt outstanding on our ABL by $65 million. However, because of the increases in our borrowing base, availability under the revolver has actually increased slightly to $445 million, providing us with ample available credit. For 2010, we expect to reduce our total outstanding borrowings by a $150 million to $200 million. Included in this reduction, is our planned redemption of a $100 million legacy CSK convertible notes in December. Our plan is to fund this with our existing ABL, which will still allow us significant financial flexibility.
Now for some other financial information. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was a use of $4 million versus a positive $9 million in the prior year. Both numbers reflect the seasonal nature of our cash flows from operating activities. For year, cash flow from operating activities decreased $13 million to $285 million, driven by the higher income, offset by our large investment in net inventory. For the year, free cash flow was the use of a $130 million as we invested heavily in inventory and CapEx for the DC expansion and store conversions. We expect free cash flow to swing to a positive $120 million to $150 million in 2010, as we continue again to invest heavily in CapEx, but do not have a significant investment in that inventory.
Stock option expense for the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $2.5 million in the prior year, and the year-to-date stock option expense was $13.5 million, compared to $8 million in the prior year, with the increase being driven by the options issued in connection with the CSK acquisition. For 2010, we expect stock option expense to be approximately $16 million.
Let me finish by recapping our overall guidance. For the first quarter, our comparable store sales guidance is 2% to 4%, and for the year, our comparable store sales guidance increases to 3% to 5%, as we see the positive impact of more converted CSK stores. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance for the first quarter is from $0.56 to $0.60 on a 139.5 million shares, and our adjusted GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance for the full year is from $2.50 to $2.56 on 140.3 million shares.
At this time, I’d like to ask Mandy our operator to come back, and we’ll be happy to answer questions. Mandy?

Although the ultimate result, we feel would be very similar. I think the comparison there would be, that in the stores in the center of the country, we saw pretty significant dips in performance that were the result of closing the store for a week, as we did the conversion. And then just the shock of training, all the products being relocated in the store, just a very disruptive process that caused the sales to be soft, and for the stores not to comp very well for a maybe a four week period, or maybe longer than that in some cases.
We won’t see the downturn in sales to the degree that we did in the center of the country stores, in the western stores that I think the end result will be similar. And that varies by market. We have more opportunity in some markets than others obviously. But I don’t think it would be unreasonable to ultimately expect performance comparable to what we’re seeing now in the Checker stores.

But as we open more DCs, and we have more DCs that aren’t fully efficient, there’ll be more of a drag in the end of the year.

December business from a comp store sales perspective softened some on tough comparisons. And we had a good December last year, 2007, we had a soft December. We related the softer comps comparing to 2008, of course, to the fact that the consumers have been under a lot of pressure, gas prices were up over 2008. And that there wasn’t as much discretionary spending as what there would be and what there was available was being used as much as possible holiday gifts and things like that.
From a competitive standpoint, we’ve heard the same things that you have heard about the things our two competitors said. And the earlier mention, of course, they went through a process I think of adjusting their pricing and I think they are more competitive than they were before. Retail, I don’t think we’ve seen that on the commercial side.
I don’t know to what degree that affects us. We would be limited on the other competitor from an exposure standpoint to just the eastern half of the country. But we really haven’t seen a material effect from that at this point. It’s hard to measure that of course.
We work hard to keep our prices competitive. And we never feel that we’ve gotten ourselves to a point where we’re just done. I mean, it’s a weekly process, a daily process. There is a team here that works on maintaining competitive retail prices and competitive prices for our repair shop partners and that’s never a completed process. And there’s never a time that we shop a complete line and some of our competitors haven’t changed their prices.

We started last year, as far as looking at the staffing models in the store, realizing that we were going to have a better hard parts selection, first of all, very soon, immediately. But then as we opened the DCs, we had the next layer of supply. So we started building stronger teams in the store from a - we call him ISS installer service specialists, improving the hard parts mix, evaluating the territories around the stores and building new territories for more accounts. Their model was to call on a lot of the large accounts, but they overlooked a lot of the small shops around the store.
So we’ve sort of reengineered how they made sales calls, increased the number of TSMs. and like I said, progress it’s a work in progress of implementing new installer service centers in the stores, we call them first call centers, and just consistency, and building relationships at the installer level and it’s working. And we feel like the additional inventory now, particularly some of the brands that we had added towards the end of the year, last year. In the last one, for instance, was like wick filters, we just changed over which is a more traditional line of oil filters and air filters.
So we’re really in good shape from a product standpoint obviously with the new DCs, couldn’t be in better shape with the supply chain. And we’ll just continue to make consistent calls, and give great customer service level. Dial into the competitive pricing, which there’s different competitors in different markets, so you have to be competitive if you’re going to get the business. And just grow the business. Which is - it’s a process, it doesn’t happen overnight, because it’s so relationship based. And quite honestly, the Seattle area had a pretty good foundation to grow from. They had proportionately, probably a better installer mix of business, than what a lot of the Kragen and Checker stores did.

From a margin standpoint, where we get to an operating margin is going to be driven by where we can build the commercial business in the total average store sales to leverage both the payroll that we’ve put in from a commercial standpoint and the high fixed cost of CSK. We’re not prepared at this point to quantify what our payroll percentage is, but after this year, we have a significant opportunity to get better on leveraging payroll. And there’s a decent discrepancy between the core O’Reilly payroll percentage, and what we are running at CSK now is which is kind of what you would expect.
The second question on inventory - the answer to that is no. The margin that we’ve driven is based on the products that we sell. And converting or really reducing our inventory I call it right sizing our inventory this year will not have a material impact on our gross margin percentages.

I think the guidance that we gave for the year is reasonable. I think that our internal expectation would be that we generate comparable store sales higher than our guidance, which is the reason that we bought CSK. And we have every reason to believe that we’ll end up being very successful in the commercial business in the western half of the country, which would drive higher comps.
Now, the time frames in which we’re able to penetrate those markets are a bit of an unknown. And then we’ll continue to update our guidance throughout the year as we’re able to measure the effectiveness of the programs we put in place. So, right now we’d like to stick with the 3% to 5% guidance we have put in place for the year. But over time, we would hope that we’d do better than that, at least in the western CSK stores.

Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ted Wise, our Chief Operating Officer; David O'Reilly, our executive Chairman is also present. I'd like to start off by thanking all our dedicated team members who worked so hard each and everyday to make sure our loyal customers receive the very best service in our business. All they way from our company headquarters, distribution centers, regional offices and most importantly, our stores, our dedication to making customer service our top priority is clearly evident. All of you are to be commended on the solid results we generated in 2009 and I know we're all looking forward to continuing the growth of our company as we work to make 2010 another great year. It's now been a little over a year and a half since we began the process of integrating CSK with O'Reilly. During this relatively short period of time, we feel we've accomplished a lot and are clearly on pace with integration plan that we put in place directly following the acquisition. At the end of 2009, we had integrated many of the headquarters functions, renegotiated most of our supplier agreement, changed over and enhanced most of the product offering in the CSK stores, completely changed over 185 stores in the center of the country, we merged the Minneapolis distribution center into the O'Reilly distribution center in Brooklyn Park, converted the Detroit distribution center to O'Reilly systems and material handling, converted the Detroit Murray's stores to R systems, opened the Seattle distribution center, converted 141 of the 193 stores that are supplied by Seattle to R systems, along with a long list of other accomplishments necessary to integrate CSK with O'Reilly.Since the first of the year, we've completed the remaining system conversions in the stores supplied out of Seattle. We opened our Moreno Valley, California distribution center in January 18 and has since started converting the computer systems and has converted 148 stores supplied by Moreno Valley and hedges 90 to go to complete the Moreno Valley distribution area. These distribution center openings, along with the subsequent store system conversions, are the most important step in our integration process. As we'd outlined before, the 185 stores that were converted in the center of the country, which included the Minnesota, Montana, West Texas and New Mexico Checker Stores, along with the Chicago Murray's stores were very disruptive. These complete changeovers involve closing the stores for a week on average, removing the stores existing inventory, resetting the store layout, installing a new inventory, along with new computer systems, operational procedures and everything else that goes along with an O'Reilly store, we basically turned these stores into O'Reilly stores in one week time. This process again was very disruptive to the operation of the business. The conversions that we're currently doing at West are simply computer system and procedural conversions. These conversions do not require us to close the store and are not nearly as disruptive as the changeovers that were done in the center of the country. We're progressing with these changeovers at a rate of 30 stores per week and are being completed as we open our new Western distribution centers. To complete these, we send a tenured O'Reilly team member to each of the stores to be converted on Saturday before the stores plan conversion. This team member's job is to connect the computer terminals, get the system up and running and physically attend a data conversion, which builds the inventory, customer and accounting files necessary to do business on O'Reilly systems.These conversions take place after the close of business each Saturday night, and we have a very qualified conversion and support staff here in Springfield that runs these conversions each weekend. On Sunday morning, the stores open on O'Reilly system and are connected to their new servicing DC. The team members of the store would have previously had training on how to use our point-of-sale system, and the tenured O'Reilly team member acts as the trainer for the first week of business and stays there, at the store, for this first week. We then have a second trainer come in the following Saturday to spend another week with the store to make sure the store manager and team members not only have complete training on making point-of-sale transactions but also on all the various daily routine functions and procedures. So far, these conversions have gone very well and we're pleased with the results we're seeing. We remain very confident in our ability to complete the conversions according to the schedule we set as part of our integration plan. As most of you know, this plan involves putting a much robust distribution network in place in the western half of the country. This network basically emulates the network we have in place in the core O'Reilly markets, and when completed, all of our stores will get the level of distribution and service and support that has allowed our company to prosper in both the do-it-yourself business and as a preferred supplier and business partner to commercial customers in the core O'Reilly markets.Once we complete Moreno Valley, we’ll proceed with the opening of our Denver, Colorado distribution center in March, then the opening of Salt Lake City in May, the relocation of our Dixon, California distribution center to Stockton, California in late August and then the final step of these conversions will be the system conversion of our Phoenix distribution center along with the 151 stores supplied by Phoenix, which is currently planned for December 6. Like I said, these conversions are going very well, and we're clearly not seeing the disruption in business that we were seeing with the complete changeovers that we completed in the center of the country.Now onto our fourth quarter performance. As I mentioned on our third quarter conference call, primarily for competitive reasons, the fourth quarter is the last quarter we plan to disclose the level of comparable stores’ sales detail that we've been disclosing since the third quarter of 2008. We plan to go back to reporting our company's total comparable store sales performance as a single consolidated comparison with our 2010 report. I know most of you read on our press release last night that during the fourth quarter we generated consolidated comparable store sales of 2.7%. Our guidance estimate in our third quarter earnings release was consolidated comparable store sales in the 2% to 4% range. So we were within our range, just slightly below the midpoint of our guidance due to a drop in our comparable store sales performance in December. This was partly due to the tough comparisons we had from December of last year and partly due to the macroeconomic factors that we assume applied more pressure during the Christmas holiday with consumers spending more of their discretionary income and available credit on the holidays.Comps in the first quarter are on a solid trend, and we think we'll see continued incremental improvements as the year progresses and we’re able to take advantage of our distribution infrastructure in the western states. The stores on O'Reilly systems generated comparable store sales of 2.4% on top of the 6.2% comp increase they generated in fourth quarter last year. Considering the relatively tough comparisons, we're reasonably pleased with the performance of the stores on O'Reilly systems. The obvious exception to that comment would of course be the 141 converted Murray's stores, which had a comp store sales decrease of 11%. Included in these stores are the Detroit-area stores. These stores operate in one of the most challenging economies in the country with unemployment almost 3x the national rate.It's hard to be pleased with the comp performance of these stores that as we've explained before they are in a state of transition and are moving to a more sustainable business model comprised of a healthy mix of both retail and commercial business, focused on auto parts and supplies as opposed to the substantial amount of non-automotive products these stores have previously been selling. Many of the core hard parts category are performing well in these stores as we drive this transition and as we continue to establish ourselves as an outstanding auto parts store for the do-it-yourself customers and as a great business partner and supplier to the commercial accounts in the Chicago and Detroit areas. Overtime, we'll see significant improvement in the performance of these stores.The 123 converted Checker Stores located primarily in the upper Midwest, Texas and New Mexico are performing well. The business model in these stores was more similar to that of O'Reilly and we're doing a good job in these stores, in these markets, establishing relationships with commercial customers and starting to build that side of the business. The Checker Store conversions in the center of the country generated an impressive 8.5% comparable store sales growth for the quarter. The western stores operating on the CSK systems generated 3.5% comparable store sales. Please keep in mind, as you consider our Western CSK store performance, that the 5.2% comp we generated in these stores during the third quarter was comparing to a 4.3% decrease in comps in the prior year. The 3.5% comp we generated in the fourth quarter was comparing to an 80 basis point positive comp in the prior year. So the positive sales trend we've been on in these stores continues.We remain very confident and excited about the opportunities we have to grow market share on both sides of our business in the Western states and we're looking forward to the complete rollout of our distribution capabilities as we continue the execution of our CSK integration plan. Generally speaking, we are very pleased with our performance to this point with the integration CSK. It's clearly represented a significant challenge and we still have a long ways to go to complete the integration but the pieces are coming together very well. Our team has worked very hard to execute our integration plan and our vendors have been very supportive of integration. I think the outstanding vendor support we've received is clearly exemplified in the improvements we've seen in our gross margin. We ended the year with a 48% gross margin compared to a 45.5% in 2008, a 250 basis point improvement.Tom will be giving specific gross margin guidance in a moment. But generally, we expect to be able to maintain these higher gross margin levels and our company will benefit nicely as we work to leverage our fixed cost by implementing our dual market strategy, allowing us to grow our sales in many markets, in which we feel CSK was underperforming. At the end of the year, we ended the year with an 11.1% operating margin, well on our way to getting our operating margin back to the pre-CSK levels and beyond. Having made many of the capital investments that needed to be made in order to enable the CSK stores to execute our dual market strategy, we're looking forward to getting back to positive cash flow generation this year. Again, Tom will be reviewing all our financials in detail in a moment. Just looking at our business from a very high level for a moment, the tailwinds for our industry continue to be the increasing average Asia vehicles in operation due to the improved engineering of newer vehicles and the decreases we've seen in new car and truck sales. The potential for continued increases in the number of vehicles on the road as the U.S. population continues to grow, the closing of OE dealerships, which potentially puts some of the service that was being done at dealerships into the automotive aftermarket. And for us, continued consolidation of the industry. At last count, the top 10 chains in the U.S. represented only 42% at the total parts stores and with many of our larger competitors modifying their business models to try and execute modified versions of a dual market strategy, we expect many of the weaker stores and smaller chains will fall under increased pressure, creating more expansion opportunities for companies like ours to see opportunity for continued growth. The headwinds are obviously the general economic condition in the U.S. with unemployment hovering around 10%, increased fuel prices. For example, at the end of 2009, we showed the average price per gallon of gas at $2.60 per gallon compared to $1.64 at the end of 2008, an almost 60% increase. This obviously takes more money out of our customers' pockets and has proven over time can put pressure on the total miles driven in the U.S. However, we see a lot of opportunity. Over time, we feel we can become a significant factor in the supply of parts to commercial customers in Western U.S. and at the same time, feel we can improve our penetration on the do-it-yourself side of the business in all the markets we serve. All 45,000 members of Team O'Reilly are working hard to make those things happen and we're looking forward to a successful 2010 as we work toward completing the integration of CSK and making O'Reilly an auto parts brand that will be easily recognized from coast-to-coast. I'll now turn the call over to Ted Wise for some additional comments."

Before discussing CSK integration, I would like to quickly review our fourth quarter expansion and then summarize our growth for last year. By design, we ended the year by installing 10 new stores in the fourth quarter. This enabled us to redirect much of the store installation department in our field team's attention to plan and start the store resets in the West. The fourth quarter expansion included three stores in North Carolina, three stores in Ohio, three stores in Wisconsin and one store in South Carolina and one store in Virginia. We also relocated two stores into new buildings, which brought us up to 14 relocations for the year. We completed 21 store renovations in the fourth quarter for a total of 53 store renovations last year. And as I mentioned, in the last part of the year our installation teams completed 27 store resets in the Checker and Kragen stores in the western state. New store expansion for the year reached our 150-store goal and covered 25 of our 28 stores we operate in.As planned to support our new distribution center in Greensboro this year, North Carolina led the growth with 29 new stores. Ohio had 21 stores, Texas continued to contribute good markets with 60 new stores. Georgia had 12 stores, South Carolina and Wisconsin ended up with 11 new stores, and our growth continues into Florida with eight new stores. Tennessee had seven stores. The remaining 35 stores were spread out in 17 additional states. As I've mentioned the past, the geographic coverage of our distribution centers allow us to more effectively and strategically plan and execute our store growth. While the majority of our growth is focused towards supporting the newer distribution centers like Greensboro and Indianapolis, we continue to seek out and find good store opportunities within our more mature markets. Our continued expansion into markets like Texas, Arkansas and Missouri provide additional leverage in our distribution centers, our field management team and our overall corporate infrastructure. The execution of our dual market sales plan to both the DIY customer and the professional customers gives us the opportunity from an O'Reilly store growth in many small, but very profitable markets, that fall in our nightly distribution model.Since we are in the middle of the CSK conversions, we have decided to set our goal for new store growth next year at 150 installations. There are few new stores planned for the West Coast this coming year. Our expansion will continue to be more concentrated in the Eastern states, serviced out at Greensboro and Atlanta as well as the Ohio Valley state, serviced out of the NDDC and have nearly converted the Detroit distribution center. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the great job that the corporate department and the teams in the field have done in planning, installing and staffing our new store expansions. Especially considering they have also been very involved in the CSK acquisition and the integration plan.Now for some additional remarks on the CSK store and distribution center conversions. As Greg outlined in his comments, the computer conversions in the and stores the expansion of the distribution centers is moving forward across the according to plan. Last spring, the Detroit distribution center was converted to start servicing the 79 converted Murray's stores in the Detroit area. It also played important role in supporting and supplying our new stores in Ohio and Michigan this year. The remaining converted Murray's stores in Chicago moved to our Indianapolis, DC and our distribution centers in Lubbock, Minneapolis and Billings began supplying the other 133 converted Checker Stores.As you may recall, this first group of Murray's and Checker Stores involved complete inventory lift, reset to the front display floor, new computer installations and going to our daily inventory replenishment. We have now finished installing interior O'Reilly packages in all these stores, and with the exception of couple of stores all the exterior signage has been converted to the O'Reilly Brand. Now moving to the West. The Seattle DC was opened in November, and as Greg described, 193 Kragen stores have been converted to the O'Reilly computer systems. Our Moreno Valley DC opened last month and will follow the same conversion schedule for the 238 Kragen stores that we did in Seattle of approximately 30 stores per weekend.Then in March, we’ll open a new distribution center in Denver and begin the conversion of the 84 Checker Stores in that market. In May, we will open the distribution center in Salt Lake City and follow with the 86 Checker Store conversion. And then in August, we will return to California to move our current distribution center in Dixon into a brand new 520-square-foot building in Stockton. This will allow us to complete the conversion of the remaining 276 stores, again following a 30-store-per-week schedule. Then in early December, the last piece in the puzzle will be converted to the system in our Phoenix distribution center. And the last Checker Store in Arizona and New Mexico will be converted. Since this will be the last conversion in the chain, the store conversions will take place on the same weekend. The end result will be all CSK DC and all CSK stores will be fully converted to O'Reilly system and the O'Reilly distribution model by the end of 2010.Our entire team has done a great job of planning and executing the conversion process in both DCs and the stores. These conversions, especially with the tight schedule we are working within, would not be possible without the contribution of literary thousands of team members from the core O'Reilly stores going to the CSK conversion stores for weeks at a time to help install and train. It is very rewarding to see our core O'Reilly team members work side-by-side with our new West Coast team as we implement our systems and our full dual market business strategy.Our store installation teams have started the reset at the front floors in the West Coast stores, which is entirely different and independent of the computer conversion schedule. Depending on the scope of the project, we will be able to do around 30 store projects per week. Immediately following the resets of the store fixtures and the new plan to grant each store will have interior remodel work done and the new O'Reilly interior decor package installed. The planning and the permitting for the new O'Reilly signs to rebrand the stores is well underway in the West Coast. Our goal is to have the store rebranding completed by the middle of next year, as well as any interior upgrade and maintenance needed. Now to add a few comments regarding the progress and growth of our business out West. With the exception of a few front room lines left to be converted, the product line upgrades and hard parts additions are finished. We have very good coverage in all stores that is supported by a larger inventory and strategically-placed hub stores. Of course, as the new DCs open, we gained the advantage of having over 100,000 SKUs available each night and sometimes during the day, if the stores are closed to the DC. Our DIY pricing has been adjusted to be more competitive in each market and our retail advertising, which includes print and radio is focusing on the increased product availability and more competitive prices along with continue to educate the customer to the transition to the O'Reilly Brand.The co-branding has gone very well, which helped us decide to rebrand the stores to O'Reilly sooner than what we had originally planned. In regard to the installer side of our business, the inventory upgrades have been important in growing our business along with improving our service level and providing great delivery service to our professional customers. Our sales team, consisting of full-time territory sales managers, and store sales specialists are very focused on developing sound relationships with our professional customers. We are very pleased with how the new O'Reilly team members and the conversion CSK stores have taken the new O'Reilly program and our are executing the dual market sales strategy in their markets. We are also very confident we will continue to have strong sales results and gain market share as the stores convert to our computer systems have better inventory availability with the new distribution centers.Now I'd like to briefly take a few comments to discuss our O'Reilly Managers Conference that was held last month in Nashville at the Granville Opryland Hotel and Convention Center [ph]. There were 45 management and a sales team member from our stores, distribution centers and corporate offices. The conference program involved both operations and sales training, which were customized to the individual store division. In addition to the O'Reilly training sessions, our vendors held a product and show [ph], as well as a number of key in-depth product training seminars for our team. Our general sessions were designed to recognize our high achievers, as well as to discuss the challenges and opportunities ahead of our company and the role that each of us play in achieving our sales and profitability. This is also the first time that our new West Coast store managers attended the conference and proved to be a huge benefit in helping them feel more part of the team and see up close what the O'Reilly culture is all about. Our management sales team's left Nashville very enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead of us and with an increased level of determination to gain market share this year in their individual markets. To finish my comments, I would like to thank our 45,000 O'Reilly team members for the hard work and their commitment to help make this a very successful year for the company. This success has been based on a true team effort and contribution and many of our team members were part of the CSK conversion stores. Others were very involved in the actual conversion and planning and execution. And core O'Reilly stores and distribution centers team member stayed totally focused on growing our core O'Reilly business. Judging from our company's performance, everyone did an outstanding job. And again, I would like to thank everyone for that job last year. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

For the quarter, sales increased $59 million, 5% over the prior year to up $1.17 billion. The increase was attributable to a $30 million increase in comp store sales, $31 million increase in non-comp new store sales, flat sales in non-comp, non-store in sales and a $2 million decrease in stores merged and closed in 2008. For the year, sales have increased $1.27 billion, 36% over the prior year to $4.85 billion, the increase was attributable to a $189 million increase in comp store sales, $145 million increase in non-comps new store sales, a $4 million increase in non-comps, non-store sales. $935 million in a CSK sales for the period, we did not own CSK from the comparative period of 2008, which was January 1 through July 11 and a $2 million decrease in stores merged and closed in 2008.  For 2010, we estimate our total revenue will be between $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. Moving on to gross profit. Gross profit was up 48.5% of sales for the quarter versus 46.2% in the prior year. The improvement was driven by the improved product acquisition costs negotiated with vendors based on our increased post-acquisition purchasing levels. For 2010, we estimate gross profit, as a percent of sales, will be 48.1% to 48.4% of sales. Inherent in this range, this $25 million of incremental buying synergies, we will see primarily in the first quarter, offset in part by decreased distribution cost associated with the ramp up of efficiency at our new distribution centers and pressure on the gross margin as the larger mix of the total business is done on the commercial side, which carries a lower gross margin percentage. Where we end up in the range would be driven largely by how successful we are at adding commercial sales in the converted stores, which will put pressure on the gross margin percent of sales but will be incremental to the gross margin dollars per store, which is our focus.SG&A for the quarter was 37.8% of sales versus 39.0% in the prior year. Excluding acquisition-related charges, SG&A was 37.7% of sales versus 37.9% in the prior year. Leverage on SG&A came from increased sales per store. On a per store basis, excluding adjustments, SG&A dollars were up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2008. That slight increase is comprised of decreases in headquarters, advertising and general store expenses, offset by increases in store payroll related to the cost of store conversions and the cost of launch in additional commercial programs and converted stores. For 2010, we expect SG&A dollars per store to be slightly down. We'll continue to invest significant dollars in store conversions, training and new commercial programs where we expect this to be fully offset by increased synergies on headquarters and advertising and increased sales driven by our store investment made in 2009.Operating margin for the quarter was 10.7% of sales, an improvement of 345 basis points over the prior year. Excluding acquisition adjustment, the quarterly operating margin increased 244 basis points. For 2009, operating margin was 11.1% of sales and is quickly closing in on our pre-acquisition outcome operating margin of 11.8% for the period ended June, 2008. We're very encouraged on the rapid progress we've made in returning our operating margin to pre-acquisition levels in such a relatively short period of time. We expect our operating margins for 2010 to exceed the pre-acquisition of operating margins.A little bit about interest, net interest expense for the quarter was $11 million, which was $2 million less than prior year and lower LIBOR offset in part by higher debt levels. For 2010, we expect net interest expense of $41 million to $43 million based and lower average debt levels. This estimate is also subject to unforeseen changes in LIBOR levels to the extent our debt is not swapped in fixed rates. The tax provision for the quarter was 38.0% of pretax income as compared to 37.7% in the prior year. The fourth quarter results were favorable to our third quarter guidance due to the favorable resolution of certain tax issues. For 2010, we expect our tax rate as a percent of pretax income to be 38.0% up to 38.4% as compared to 38.1% for all of 2009. Where we fall within this range will be dependent on resolution of open tax year audit that occur during the year.Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.52 per share, which represents an increase of 41% over the fourth quarter 2008. For the year, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.26, a 38% increase over the prior year. Now we'll move on to the balance sheet. The average inventory per store at the end of the year was $559,000, which was a 17% increase from the prior year average of $478,000. The increase was in the CSK stores as the core O'Reilly stores average inventory approximated historical levels. The increase was the result of the changeovers at CSK storage, which added a much wider breadth of SKUs available at each store combined with stores on the CSK system receiving only one-stock order a week, which necessitates more stocking debt.In 2009, we intentionally flooded the CSK stores with hard parts to get them back in the hard parts business. In 2010, we are focused on the refining inventory mix at the CSK stores and as a new distribution centers come online, we will be able to reduce the stocking debt at the CSK stores. Based on these 2010 initiatives, we expect only increase our total inventory investment slightly in 2010, despite opening 150 new stores and adding three distribution centers. Our reserve for LIFO at the end of the quarter was $8.7 million, which was a decrease of $4.1 million in the previous quarter. This change in our last pie to LIFO inventory reserve did not have a material impact on gross margin for the fourth quarter. Our accounts payable of $818 million was 42.8% of inventory compared to 46.9% in the prior year. Our AP to inventory ratio at the end of 2008 benefited from special extend dating and changeover orders. In 2010, we expect our AP to inventory ratio will continue to be under pressure as we work excess inventory out of and through the system.Capital expenditures were $98 million for the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $415 million, which was within our estimate of the 2009 CapEx spend of $400 million to $420 million we discussed on the third quarter call. For 2010, we anticipate capital expenditures will be $400 million to $440 million as we complete our DC projects and continue to invest heavily in store conversions. Excluding conversion CapEx, maintenance CapEx in our 150 new stores would be an approximately the $250 million range. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $37 million and $148 million respectively. For 2010, we expect depreciation and amortization to be $154 million to $159 million. Moving on to debt. Total borrowings were $791 billion at the end of December this year compared to $733 million at the end of 2008. The increased debt of $58 million has been used to fund new store growth at the core O'Reilly stores and the conversion of investment including book CapEx and net inventory at required CSK stores. However, the majority of these investments had been covered by internally generated cash flow. For the year, we've increased our debt outstanding on our ABL-backed 62 $5 million [ph]. However, because of the increase in our borrowing base, availability under the revolver has actually increased slightly to $445 million, providing us with ample available credit. For 2010, we expect to reduce our total outstanding borrowings by $150 million to $250 million. Including this reduction is our plan redemption of the $100 million legacy, CSK convertible note in December. Our plan is to fund this with our existing ABL [ph], which will still as significant financial flexibility.Now for some other financial information. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was a use of $4 million versus the positive $9 million in the prior year. Both numbers reflect the seasonal nature of our cash flows from operating activity. For the year, cash flow from operating activity decreased $30 million to $285 million, driven by the higher income, offset by our large investment in net inventory. For the year, free cash flow was a use of $130 million as we invested heavily on inventory and CapEx to the DC expansion and store conversions. We expect free cash flow to swing to a positive $120 million to $150 million in 2010 as we continue, again, invest heavily in CapEx but did not have a significant investment in net inventory.Stock option expense for the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $2.5 million in the prior year and the year-to-date stock option expense was $13.5 million compared to $8 million in the prior year. With the increase being driven by the options issued in connection with the CSK acquisition. For 2010, we expect stock option expense to be approximately $16 million. We finished by recapping our overall guidance. For the first quarter, our comparable store sales guidance is 2% to 4%. And for the year, our comparable store sales guidance increases 3% to 5% as we see the positive impact of more converted CSK stores. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance for the first quarter is from $0.56 to $0.60 on $139.5 million shares and our adjusted GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance for the full year is from $2.50 to $2.56 on a 140.3 million shares. At this time, I would like to ask Mandy, our operator to come back and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

Although the ultimate result we feel would be very similar. I think the comparison there would be that in the stores in the center of the country we saw pretty significant dips in performance that were the result of closing the store for a week as we did the conversion and then just the shock of training, all the products being relocated in the store. Just a very disruptive process that caused the sales to be soft and for the stores not to comp very well for maybe a four-week period or maybe even longer than that in some cases. We won't see the downturn in sales to the degree that we did in the center of the country stores in the western stores, but I think the end result will be similar. And that varies by market. We have more opportunity in some markets than others, obviously. But, yes, I don't think it would be unreasonable to ultimately expect performance comparable to what we're seeing now in the Checker Stores."

December business from a comp store sales perspective softened some on tough comparisons. We had a good December last year. In 2007, we had a soft December. We related the softer comps, comparing 2008 of course, to the fact that the consumers have been under a lot of pressure.

We would be limited on the other competitor from an exposure standpoint to just the eastern half of the country. But we really haven't seen a material effect from that at this point. It's hard to measure that, of course. We work hard to keep our prices competitive and we never feel that we've gotten ourselves to a point that we're just done.

Those stores we knew were coming up on an unusual winter storm they had last year that caused a real high spike in sales in those stores last year. So we knew we had some comparison issues. And looking at those stores’ sales trend, their sales really stayed on track and we didn't see much disruption from the conversion. Now you certainly, that first day, two days you have training issues, you're not as fast at point-of-sale.

Our opportunity, as Ted said, is to just operate these stores more efficiently, which we're working towards through the ways that we manage payroll, the way we manage what we call a wage pyramid in the store to make sure that we have team members that are entry-level team members that are in the middle of the wage range. That are good parts specialist and then of course, the management of the store."

These stores were very different than an O'Reilly Auto Part store. We focus on hard parts, application parts, automotive only merchandise, being a great supplier to the -- I'll call it the medium to heavy do-it-yourself-er and to commercial customers. And these stores were stores that carried a lot of -- they have a lot of automotive coverage of course not nearly to the degree that we would. But they had many ancillary products and non-automotive products that they would run promotions on at aggressive prices to bring traffic into the store and by taking those out, we've put ourselves in a comparison position to where we don't compare very well from a compare standpoint, yet on by-category basis, several of our hard parts categories are performing very well and we're very committed to turning these into very profitable auto parts stores over time and being a dominant factor in Chicago and in Detroit."

We started last year as far as looking at the staffing models in the store, realizing that we were going to have a better hard parts selection first of all, very, very soon, immediately. But then we opened the DCs, we'd have the next layer of supply. So we started building stronger teams in the store from what we call them ISS, installer service specialist. Improving the hard parts mix, evaluating the territories around the stores and building new territories for more accounts. Their model was to call on a lot of the large accounts, but they overlooked a lot of small shops around the stores. So we sort of reengineered how they made sales calls, increased the number of TSMs. And like I said, it's a work in progress of implementing new installer service centers in the stores. We call them first call centers and in this consistency. And building relationships at the installer level, and it's working. We feel like the additional inventory now, particularly some of the brands that we have added towards the end of the year, last year and the last one, for instance, [indiscernible] we just changed over, which is a more additional line of oil filters and air filters. So we're really in good shape from a product standpoint. Obviously, with the new DCs, couldn't be in better shape with the supply chain. We'll just continue making consistent calls and give great customer service level. Dial-in to the competitive pricing, which there's different competitors in different markets. So you have to be competitive if you're going to get the business, and just grow the business. It's a process, it doesn't happen overnight because it is so relationship based. And quite honestly, the Seattle area had a pretty good foundation to grow from. They had a proportionally probably a better installer mix of business than what a lot of the Kragen and Checker stores did."

I think that our internal expectations would be that we generate comparable store sales higher than our guidance, which is the reason that we bought CSK. And we have every reason to believe that we'll end up being very successful in the commercial business in the western half of the country, which would drive higher comps. Now the time frames in which we're able to penetrate those markets are a bit of an unknown and will continue to update our guidance throughout the year as we're able to measure the effectiveness of the programs we put in place. So right now, we'd like to stick with the 3% to 5% guidance we have put in place for the year. But over time, we would hope we would do better than that at least in the Western CSK stores."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter Conference Call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ted Wise, our Chief Operating Officer; David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman, is also present. 
I'd like to start off, again, by saying thanks to all our dedicated team members who work so hard each and every day to make sure our loyal customers receive the very best service in our business. This past quarter was an outstanding quarter for Team O'Reilly, and I want to recognize each and every one of you for the great job you're doing, taking care of our customers and systematically working us through the integration of CSK.
Clearly, we have a very bright future ahead of us as we complete this integration and focus on expansion and executing our dual market strategy coast-to-coast. Congratulations to all of you on the great performance in the first quarter.
Looking back to our fourth quarter conference call, it's clear that we underestimated the amount of demand that was pent up as a result of the relatively soft sales our industry experienced for much of the winter. As I mentioned on the call, we attributed the softness in the fourth quarter to the continued strain the economic conditions in the U.S. has placed on consumer budgets. We believe this was amplified during the holiday season as many spent their discretionary cash on gift and holiday activities and deferred spending on auto repairs that didn't need absolute immediate attention. 
Comparable store sales are always difficult to forecast, and we've once again proven that sales trends can change relatively quickly. As you know, we were forecasting consolidated comparable store sales in the 2% to 4% range for the first quarter. As it turned out, early spring weather arrived in many markets, and sales in the last half of the quarter accelerated dramatically. And we were able to generate a robust 6.9% growth in consolidated comparable store sales for the quarter, on top of comparable store sales increase of 5.7% in the first quarter of 2009.
As previously mentioned, the fourth quarter of last year was the last time we're going to disclose the details of our comparable store sales by store type. From this point forward, we plan to provide only our consolidated total company comparable store sales performance. However, I do want to reflect and add some color to our comp store sales performance for the quarter. 
The stronger trends we saw in the last half of the quarter were present in the majority of our markets across the country. We saw a better retail traffic in our stores and our Installer business picked up significantly. Again, I relate some portion of this strong increase in business to maintenance and repairs that were deferred last winter, and with the early spring weather in many markets, we benefited from this pent-up demand. It would be very difficult for us to forecast the expectation that sales will continue for the full second quarter at the strong pace we saw in the last half of the first quarter. However, we do anticipate continued solid business trends. We're off to a good start to the quarter in April, and as a result, are providing guidance of comparable store sales in the range of 4% to 6% for both the second quarter and for the year. We'll continue to update our annual guidance quarterly as we progress through this year. 
July 11 will be the second anniversary of our purchase of CSK. As you know, following the purchase, we put in place an aggressive plan to implement our distribution model in the Western half of the country, which establishes the foundation for us to execute our dual market strategy. We also put in place an aggressive plan to convert the inventories and store layouts to fit our model. Many team members have worked extremely hard to execute this plan, and I'm very happy to announce that we're completing the integration plan on time, and we're seeing very positive performance results as our efforts and investments gain traction.
The CSK stores, as a whole, have generated positive comparable store sales each full quarter that we've owned them. And in the first quarter, we continue to see good business trends. The fully converted Checker stores in the Central part of the country, which were the first to be converted, are performing extremely well. We've also seen solid improvements in the performance of the Murray stores; that given the economy in these markets, especially in Michigan, these stores continue to lag the other stores.
In the Western half of the country, it's very clear that we have a lot of opportunity to grow our business as we establish our company as a capable partner to the commercial customers in each market. These stores have done very well and are incrementally taking advantage of the additional parts availability afforded them by our distribution expansion in the West. Even the stores that are still on CSK systems and distribution model are doing much better as a result of better access to inventory, more competitive pricing and our team's focus on providing great customer service.
Ted will be in the reviewing our integration plan in detail in a moment. But in general, I want to convey that we remain very enthusiastic about the opportunity we have to grow same-store sales in the acquired CSK stores. Many of the markets in which these acquired stores do business generate an incredible amount of auto part sales, and the level of CSK's underperformance due to the lack of inventory availability and non-competitive pricing is clearly apparent. 
As we stated before, we've put a lot of effort into correcting this. We reset our pricing over a year ago and over time, the perception consumers have of our competitive price position will continue to improve. The same thing applies to inventory availability. CSK had developed a reputation of not having robust hard part inventories. We corrected this, and our marketing and advertising efforts are now geared toward giving customers a reason to give us a chance to prove that we're the best choice when it comes to helping them with their automotive needs. We feel we'd come a long way on these fronts, but still have a long way to go.
In reviewing our first quarter sales performance, we'd be remiss not to mention the continued solid performance of the core O'Reilly stores. We have a very strong team in our core markets, and we're very pleased with the performance of our core stores. One of the early concerns among analysts and investors with the acquisition of CSK was that we could potentially lose focus in market share in our core markets. And with almost two years of CSK ownership under our belt, I can assure you, as reflected in our performance, that our core stores continue to perform extremely well.
The strong comparable store sales we generated during the quarter leveraged our expenses nicely. And coupled with the significant improvement in gross margin we're now able to sustain as a result of the buying synergies we've experienced as part of the CSK acquisition, we're very pleased with the 13.2% operating margin we were able to generate. This operating margin is the highest first quarter of margin we've generated since going public in 1993.
Tom will be reviewing our financials in more detail in a moment, but I just want to express that we're very encouraged with the solid start we've had to 2010. As planned, the acquisition of CSK is proving to have been a very good investment for our company, and we're very excited about what the future will bring as we continue to establish our presence in the markets that are relatively new to us. 
As of the industry, while a more robust economy would certainly be helpful, we feel we continue to benefit from the growth of the average age of vehicles on the road in the U.S. as new car and truck sales have decreased. We feel that many consumers have established a new perception of how far a vehicle can be safely driven, and we expect, for years to come, autos will be driven at higher and higher mileages than in the past. The higher-mileage vehicles obviously require more maintenance.
We also see a lot of opportunity for continued growth as our industry continues to consolidate. At the end of this year, we will have opened 115 net new stores, but will still have the distribution capacity in existing facilities to add approximately 500 stores using our existing distribution methods. So we won't need to add any additional distribution capacity to support our new store growth until approximately late 2013 or 2014.
We're also working as diligently as ever to continue to improve our levels of customer service and operating efficiencies. We have several initiatives currently underway to ensure we maintain our industry-leading customer service levels. These include point-of-sale system improvements, parts cataloguing enhancements, inventory management system improvements and better productivity management in our distribution centers just to name a few. As I've mentioned, we're very encouraged by the strong start we've had this year and are looking forward to the continued solid performance throughout the year as we work through the final chapters of the CSK integration. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ted Wise."

Like Greg, I would like to begin by saying a quick thank you to Team O'Reilly for the fantastic sales and profit performance we are here to discuss this morning. Through our team's commitment to great customer service and execution of our dual market sales programs, we continued to expand our market share. A 10% top line growth and a 6.9% comp sales performance is truly remarkable. So once again, thanks to all of our team members throughout the organization for your contribution last quarter.
In regard to our new store growth in the first quarter, we finished with a net 48 new locations, bringing us to a total of 3,469 stores. Our expansion plans for new stores this year is 150 locations, so we're in excellent shape on our schedule. We continue to share and balance the time of our installation teams between new store installations and performing front floor resets on CSK stores out West. Our real estate group is aggressively working on new store expansion around our core O'Reilly markets, as well as the new West Coast states. As a result of a slower economy, we are finding good sites for future expansion at reasonable rates. 
In regard to the CSK stores, we have completed individual store and market assessments and had developed a stay or relocation strategy for all stores. We have also identified our potential expansion opportunities in the undeveloped markets and growth in new markets. Opening stores with our dual market plan with the expanded product offering and daily distribution service to the store opens up new markets that would not have fit the CSK retail sales plan.
Now for a brief overview of our store expansion for first quarter. Once again, the great state of Texas led our growth for the first quarter with seven new stores, which brings us to 528 Texas stores that are serviced from our distribution centers located in Houston, Dallas and Lubbock. Following Texas, North Carolina and South Carolina contributed five stores each. And rounding out our growth in the southeast part of the country, we added three new stores in Virginia. There were also five new stores in Ohio and three new stores in Michigan that are being serviced from our recently converted Murray's distribution center in Detroit. Indiana, Florida and Tennessee all contributed three stores each. The remaining 12 new stores were spread out in eight more states and includes our first new store in California. 
To summarize, our store expansion involved 17 different states, which, as I had mentioned in the past, gives us the ability to be more selective and have better planning and execution in rolling out our new stores.
In the first quarter, we also moved five older stores to new locations and had 12 major store renovation projects going on. In addition to our normal new store growth, we made good progress on phase two of our CSK store conversion on the West Coast. Our installation team has performed 90 CSK store resets to the O'Reilly retail format. As you may recall, these are resets of the front display area and do not typically involve the back room since the hard parts inventory changeovers were completed throughout most of last year. 
These front floor resets are also independent from their computer system conversions. This is totally different from how we handle the major projects in the first phase of the changeover of the Murray stores and the Midwest Checker stores, which were total inventory list, new computer systems and store reset all at the same time. Needless to say, it is much less disruptive to the business allowing the store to stay open during all the work and maintaining a high level of customer service.
As I mentioned, the hard part line changeover are for the most part finished, and the product department is working on the final phase of front floor volume evaluations and changeovers. As these out-front lines are reviewed, new planogram changes and product line upgrades are being rolled out to the stores. And by the end of this year, all stores will have a fresh upgraded planogram retail mix. We will continue to step up the pace on the store reset schedule throughout the remainder of the year and plan on having all CSK store reset and the O'Reilly interior decor and image package installed during the next 12 months.
Now to outline the DC [distribution center] openings and the conversions scheduled, which also includes our store computer conversions, the West Coast schedule began with the opening of our new 388,000 square-foot Seattle DC last December and the following conversions of 193 Schuck's stores to daily replenishment and installation of the new O'Reilly computer system. As a reminder, the store computer conversions does involve any inventory or physical changes to the store. It is basically changing the store computer and going through O'Reilly POS and store operations systems. The point-of-sale orientation and systems training is handled at the store by sending seasoned, experienced O'Reilly team members from the core O'Reilly store to work side-by-side with the manager and team members during the conversion, and then they stay at the store for at least one week following the conversion.
Following Seattle, our new Moreno Valley 408,000 square-foot distribution center in Southern California opened in January, and the store computer system conversions for the 238 surrounding Kragen stores were completed. Then in the middle of March, we opened a 225,000 square-foot distribution center in Denver, Colorado servicing the surrounding 84 stores, and these stores are now finished with their computer conversion systems.
Next on the schedule in May is the opening of our 205,000 square-foot Salt Lake City distribution center, which will service the 86 stores that will follow the same computer conversion schedule. Then we will have a short breather until September when we move our existing Dixon DC to a new 520,000 square-foot DC in nearby Stockton, California. This DC will service the surrounding 274 Kragen stores that, again, will start their computer system conversions at that time.
To finish the DC in-store conversions, we will return to feet the first week in November and convert the CSK distribution center over to the O'Reilly system and begin transition to a data replenishment at the store level. This will include converting the 151 Checker stores to O'Reilly computer systems at the same time the DC converts. 
So by the end of November, we will have completed all the store computer system conversions, installed five new distribution centers, converted the existing CSK distribution centers to O'Reilly systems, and the stores will all be receiving daily stock order replenishment. This is an amazing accomplishment and has required a lot of hard work and great planning to have executed these tasks in such short of a time.
As I mentioned, the store resets will be progressing throughout the year and while most of them will be finished by the end of this year, there will be a small group of stores to finish resetting in the first half of next year. We are also well underway with our signed conversions to O'Reilly Auto Parts, and we will project rebranding all the stores to be completed by early next year.
Now in regard to the business development on the West Coast, our stores continue to gain sales traction on both the Retail and Installer side of the business. A key factor in growing our sales has been the increased hard part selection at the store level. The store inventories have also been supported by hub-and-spoke systems that have set routes throughout store groups. Also, as new distribution centers open and area stores begin receiving nightly replenishment, they also have special order availability for the broad SKUs at the distribution center overnight or in the case when the store is in the immediate area, they have same-day access to the distribution centers' inventory.
In addition to having a wide inventory, our market competitive pricing is in place and beginning to change the perceptions that customers have developed of the CSK store inventory and pricing model. It took CSK years to establish these customers' perception and although we feel good about the sales trend and traffic customer, changing these perceptions will take a while. We definitely feel there's a lot of additional opportunity ahead of us as we continue to convert the stores and establish the O'Reilly name in these markets.
Now on the Installer side of the business, we are seeing great results from our consistent sales calls in developing customer relationships over this last year. Our territory sales managers and in-store sales specialists are in front of the customers, selling the O'Reilly program of quality parts, competitive pricing and, most important, great service.
We have improved service levels with additional trucks and staffing our First Call Installer counters with experienced parts professionals. No different than changing the perception of the retail customer, we still have a lot of work to do and lots of opportunity ahead of us as we establish the O'Reilly brand and win the wholesale customers business. 
Improving our sales skills, product knowledge and overall service level of our store sales teams will be the key to growing our business. As the stores go on the O'Reilly computer systems, our O'Reilly LMS, or learning management system, and all the O'Reilly training programs are available to our store teams. CSK did not have a computer-based training system, and this addition is being well accepted and would be a great tool in increasing our parts knowledge and providing better customer service level.
Our store operations and sales teams continue to grow stronger and become more effective O'Reilly leaders as they fully comprehend our programs, and they see the results of implementing them. We are very fortunate to have had so many quality team members in the CSK stores that are willing to adopt the O'Reilly culture and become part of the new West Coast O'Reilly management team. We continue to evaluate our staffing requirements that are required to manage these stores and will continue to add district managers, territory sales managers and other field positions critical to the control and management of our store operations and sales. 
It's very exciting to think that much of the task-oriented work of the changes we were making that occupied so much of our team's time in these stores is behind us, and we now have more time to totally concentrate on servicing our customer and growing the sales and profits in these stores. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

Now we'll move on to the numbers. For the quarter, sales increased $116 million, 10% over the prior year, to $1.28 billion. The increase was attributable to a $78 million increase in comp store sales, a $35 million increase in non-comp new st",1285,"Thanks, Ted. Now we'll move on to the numbers. For the quarter, sales increased $116 million, 10% over the prior year, to $1.28 billion. The increase was attributable to a $78 million increase in comp store sales, a $35 million increase in non-comp new store sales and a $3 million increase in non-comp non-store sales. For the quarter, both ticket average and ticket count contributed to our comparable store sales increase. But the majority of the comp increase was driven by the comps ticket count. For 2010, we're increasing our total revenue guidance to $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion, which is a $100 million increase from our previous guidance.
Gross profit was 48.3% of sales for the quarter versus 46.6% in the prior year. The 167 basis point improvement was driven by the acquisition buying synergies, which were not in the comparable 2009 period. As you will recall, the majority of the new vendor deals were signed at the end of the first quarter and beginning of the second quarter of 2009. 
As a result, this will be the last significant non-comparable quarter for buying synergies. 
For 2010, we continue to estimate gross profit as a percent of sales will be 48.1% to 48.4%. Where we end up in this range will be driven largely by how successfully our hired adding commercial sales in the acquired stores as commercial sales carry a lower gross profit percentage. Based on our performance in the first quarter, we would anticipate being in the lower end of this range.
SG&A for the quarter was 35.1% of sales versus 36.9% in the prior year. The leverage on SG&A was the result of strong comparable store sales. On a per store basis, SG&A per store was up approximately 1%, which allowed for strong leverage on 6.9% comparable store sales. For 2010, we're now expecting SG&A dollars per store to be slightly up from 2009 as we see opportunity to more aggressively invest in store SG&A to drive sales. We anticipate that total SG&A for 2010 will increase approximately 4.5% over the prior year.
Operating margin for the quarter was an extremely strong 13.2% of sales, an improvement of 342 basis points over the prior year. This large improvement is a result of full year run rate of buying synergies, strong comp sales and tight expense control. The 13.2% first quarter operating margin represents the highest first quarter operating margin we've had as a public company and one of the highest quarters of all time. For the full year, we expect our operating margins to be in the mid-12% range.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $11 million, which was $1 million less than the prior year on lower average interest rates. For 2010, we expect net interest expense to be 39% million to $42 million based on lower average debt levels. This estimate is also subject to unforeseen changes in LIBOR levels to the extent our debt is not spot to fixed rates. The tax provision for the quarter was 38.5% of pretax income, which was flat with the prior year. For 2010, we expect our tax rate as a percent of pretax income to be 38.0% to 38.4%. Where we fall within the rage will be dependent on the resolution of open tax year audits that occurred during the year. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.70 per share, which represents a 52% increase over the first quarter of 2009. 
Now we'll move on to the balance sheet. The average inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $549,000, which was a 13% increase over the prior year average of $487,000. This increase is a result of significantly increasing the hard parts SKUs stocked in the acquired stores and the addition of the Western DCs to support our dual market strategy. 
In 2010, we're focused on refining the inventory mix at the CSK stores, and as the new DCs come on line, we would be able to reduce the stock investments at CSK stores. Based on these 2010 initiatives, we expect to only increase our inventory investment slightly in 2010 despite opening 150 new stores and three new DCs. Through the first quarter, we added 48 net new stores, but reduced our total inventory by $10 million, which equates to a 2% reduction in the average inventory per store.
Our reserve for LIFO at the end of the quarter was $13.1 million, which is an increase of $4.4 million from the previous quarter. This change, our last behind the LIFO reserve, did not have a material impact on gross margins for the quarter.
Accounts payable of $795 million was 41.8% of inventories compared to 46.8% in the prior year. Our AP to inventory ratio at the end of the first quarter of 2009 benefited from special extended dating and change of roll orders. That said, in 2010, we expect our AP to inventory ratio will continue to be under pressure as we work excess inventories through and out of this system.
Capital expenditures were $91 million for the quarter. For 2010, we continue to estimate capital expenditures will be in the range of $400 million to $440 million as we complete our DC projects and continue to invest heavily in store conversions. 
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $40 million. For 2010, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be $154 million to $159 million.
Total borrowings at the end of the quarter were $703 million compared to $791 million at the end of Q1 2009. Also, at the end of the quarter, we had $531 million of availability under our ABL Facility. For 2010, we expect to reduce our total outstanding borrowings by $178 million to $220 million. Included in this reduction is our planned redemption of the $100 million legacy CSK convertible notes in December. Our plan is to fund this with our existing ABL, which will still allow us significant financial flexibility.
Now for some other financial information. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was $171 million, an increase of $84 million over the first quarter of 2009. The improvement was driven by higher net income and deferred taxes and the lower increase in net inventory investment in comparison to the first quarter of 2009. For the quarter, free cash flow was $80 million versus a use of $65 million in the first quarter of 2009. The improvement of $145 million was driven by the previously mentioned increase in cash flow from operations and a $60 million decrease in capital expenditures. We now expect free cash flow to be $140 million to $160 million in 2010 as we again invest heavily in CapEx, but do not have a significant increase in the investment in that inventory.
Stock option expense for the quarter was $3.6 million compared to $3.3 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by our year-over-year increase in stock price. For 2010, we continue to expect stock option expense to be approximately $16 million. 
To recap our overall guidance, for the second quarter, our comparable store sales guidance is 4% to 6%. And for the year, we're increasing our comparable store sales guidance from an increase of 3% to 5% to an increase of 4% to 6%. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance for the second quarter is from $0.70 to $0.74 on 140.6 million shares. And we are raising our GAAP diluted EPS guidance for the full year to a range of $2.65 to $2.75 on 140.7 million shares. 
At this time, I'd like to ask Lisa, the operator, to come back, and we'll be happy to answer your questions. Lisa?"

This is my 26th year here, and David's here and he's lived with these businesses, so have I. We've constantly evolved, really, everything we do: Point-of-sale, catalog, the way we manage productivity and things like that. Today, with technology being what it is, there are so much opportunity to incrementally improve the function of our POS, the content that we make available to our parts specialists, just the whole interaction experience with our customers in general. And then also, just continuing to improve the way that we manage inventories, measure productivity in our distribution centers, incent our distribution team members to be as productive as they can be and so forth. So we have teams in our IT department and operational departments that manage these projects that we work on ongoing. Some of these are things that we implement in pieces, and some of the improvements that we're making will be implemented this year. Some of the -- for instance, the way that we handle what would be considered a minor thing to many, but it's a major thing when it comes to running a store, is the way you deal with sales tax, for instance, when it comes to Installer customers. A lot of Installer customers want to not pay tax. If they bill their customer for tax and state laws in most states allows us not to bill them for tax, but they require tax on certain items, making that as automated as it can possibly be enhances our POS system. Another example would be just making sure that we have pictures of all of our products and, those pictures are available from different views of the product. So if we don't have it in stock, we can match it up at the counter and make sure we order the right part. Things like that are implemented incrementally. And then something specifically that we're implementing over the next couple of months is a, what we call, labor management system in our distribution centers that basically kind of set standards for productivity in our distribution center based on the layout of the DC, where the products are located, the amount of time it takes to stock or pick a product. And then we're putting in place an incentive program for our distribution team members to be as productive as they can be. And we'll start that here in the next couple of months, in Detroit."

As we complete these conversions and as we become more productive in the Western stores and our new team members get more proficient on our POS, their sales per month increase, we will become more productive.

A lot of the wholesale volume is just now starting to be material, because of the distribution centers and the nightly service and we got all the traditional product lines in place and the hub and spoke system is working good. And again, there's a lot of strong competitors on the West Coast and it's taken a while to develop the relationships. And again, now we totally have the tools in place. So again, they're growing about the same, we anticipate the Wholesale business will be much better this coming year, because of the tools we have and the fact that it takes more than just a few sales calls to build a relationship. In regard to the competitors out there, on the West Coast, it's basically a two-step market. There's a lot of undercards, small warehouses. They're regional, they have strengths and they have weaknesses. They've got good inventories, but not necessarily broad inventories. They don't have this good replenishment frequency as we do. So again, now that we have the distribution centers in place and we have our inventory levels where they should be, we'll continue to make progress on taking market share in that regard. A lot of it's tied to the personnel we have at the store. And again, as we mature our programs out there, we're going to be able to attract and recruit a higher level of professional parts person away from these more traditional two-step top competitors. And when that starts happening, you hire one or two in the market and then two or three more and pretty soon, the profile of your installer service specialist changed to where you basically have experienced parts people on the ISS count. And not to say that we don't have a lot today.

And if they price something else, CSK proved to them that they weren't price competitive with our primary retail competitors.

There's a, I think, variance in the O'Reilly stores with, if you compare rural markets to more metro markets. But we generally, have been able, at core O'Reilly, to keep the balance at approximately 50/50. Again, not by intent necessarily, but just by trying to do to as much business on both sides as we can. In the Western CSK stores, there are some stores, I would say approximately 10% of the stores that are in locations that aren't necessarily conducive or as conducive as we would like them to be to doing a large amount of Wholesale Commercial business. Those stores most likely will never get to a 50/50 mix, but the remainder of the stores over time, we believe, can do as much Wholesale business as the O'Reilly stores do on average and our efforts are to work to build that."

We've all been in the business a long time and we've seen periods when economic pressures placed on consumers result in comp store sales growth that is not as robust as we would like it to be. Generally, directly following those periods, you'll have pretty robust sales, as people take care of the things that maybe they deferred. So I think, that with the winter weather we have in many markets, I think, prevented people from working in their driveways on vehicles on the DIY side. I think, that caused some release of pent-up demand in the spring time. I think, the economy in general, over the past couple of years has caused people to try and defer as many things as they could that didn't absolutely have to be repaired. So I think, that's more of maybe a slow release of pent-up demand, as people's individual financial situations improve with a growing economy. So I think, you'll see some benefit of it over a longer period of time, but I feel like we had an immediate benefit when the spring weather got here, from some of the things that had been deferred over the winter, and some catch-up for some things that maybe weren't done during the pre-holiday season, as discretionary income was spent on more holiday-activity type of thing. Again, that's all speculation on my part, based on my experience in the business. But my observation would be that demand for parts right now has been strong, based on the older vehicles and being driven on the road and some release of the pent-up demand that we feel like has kind of accrued over the past year or two."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ted Wise, our Chief Operating Officer.I'd like to start of",1604,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ted Wise, our Chief Operating Officer.
I'd like to start off by congratulating Team O’Reilly on the outstanding second quarter results. Our solid performance and continued success across the 38 states in which we do business is the result of the commitment each of you has made to our culture values. Embracing these values has been the bedrock of our company's phenomenal growth over the years, and it's so encouraging to see that the way we do business continues to be so successfully ingrained in our stores and distribution centers across all markets. I strongly believe that we offer the very best service levels in our business and want to thank all of you for your hard work and dedication to the company's continued success. 
Before moving on to the discussion of our operational performance during the quarter, I want to comment on the $15 million reserve we accrued in the second quarter to potentially fund settlement and related costs of the investigation of CSK Auto being performed by the United States Department of Justice. This investigation is related to the alleged wrongdoings at CSK Auto in 2006 and prior. As most of you know, we didn't purchase the company until July of 2008. Part of our due diligence process prior to this purchase was, of course, evaluating the exposure the company could have related to the alleged issues.
After extensive work, we reached the conclusion that the actions of the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission would most likely stop short of penalizing or charging CSK based on the level of cooperation with the SEC and the DOJ, the merits of our acquisition, prior actions by the SEC and DOJ, our track record of solid management, Sarbanes-Oxley [Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002] compliance, along with many other factors. 
As expected, in March 2009, the SEC determined to close the matter with respect to CSK without fine or penalties. In recent discussions with the DOJ, it's become clear that they feel a penalty against CSK is in order, and we've been working with them to reach an agreement as to the amount of that penalty.
I know all of our shareholders, many of which were previously CSK shareholders, will have difficulty understanding how penalizing our company at this point could be fair and justified. All I can tell you is that I completely understand your sentiments. We're doing our best to communicate our position to the DOJ as we continue to cooperate with their investigation of these legacy issues related to the individuals that were involved. We hope our good-faith efforts will bring closure to these matters in the near future.
Now on to our quarterly performance. I think it probably goes without saying that we're very pleased with our second quarter results. The strong business trend that began for us during the middle of the first quarter continued to the second quarter, and we continue to see solid sales results to this point in the current quarter.
These solid trends exist pretty much in all markets across the U.S. and yielded a very solid comparable store sales increase of 7.9% for the quarter on top of the 4.8% increase we had last year. We attribute the continued strong comp performance to a combination of solid execution in both the core O'Reilly stores and the CSK stores, along with the help from the tailwinds that are present for the automotive aftermarket as we benefit from the reduction in new vehicle sales in the U.S. 
This reduction in sales has contributed to increasing the average age of vehicles on the road in the U.S. to 10.2 years, up from 8.8 years just 10 years ago. This average age increase, along with the stabilization of fuel costs and increases in miles driven, has been helpful to our business as motorists focus on better maintaining these older vehicles in order to keep them on the road.
These factors are, of course, mitigated to some degree by the overhang of high unemployment, but the net effect seems to bode well for the automotive aftermarket. Comparable store sales are always difficult to forecast, and we clearly exceeded our second quarter estimate of 4% to 6%. As I've already mentioned, sales to this point in the third quarter have continued on a solid trend, but we feel like it would be imprudent on our part to forecast same-store sales beyond the 4% to 6% range for the third quarter on top of the 5.3% comps we generated last year. So our comp store sales estimate for the third quarter is to generate comparable store sales in the range of 4% to 6%. And considering our performance in the first half of the year, we are increasing our full year 2010 guidance to 5% to 7%.
Adjusting for the non-recurring $15 million expense item I mentioned, we generated a 14.2% operating margin for the quarter. This is a quarterly record for our company, and it's the result of our continued efforts on all fronts to drive the profitability of the company through diligent management of our gross margin and relentless expense control, while continuing to robustly grow sales. We're very pleased with our efforts on all fronts to grow our profits as we incrementally work to complete the integration of the CSK stores.
This month marks the second anniversary of the acquisition of CSK. While there's been a lot of effort put into this integration to get us to this point, I think I speak for all of Team O’Reilly when I say it's been very satisfying work. It's been a pleasure for all of us to see these stores pull out of the negative comparable store sales trend that had been present at CSK for several consecutive quarters prior to the acquisition to generating positive comps for the first full quarter we owned them and every subsequent quarter. 
It's been very satisfying to see our newest team members tell our customers that we have the part they need in stock or that we can get a hard-to-find fine part out of one of our hub stores or local distribution centers that same day. It's also been pleasing to see the stores gain momentum as they gain confidence and realize that they have all the tools they need to go out and develop strong relationships with the best commercial customers in their markets.
There's no question that this integration has been a lot of work and that it's tested the strength of many areas of our company. We've come a long way in two short years we've owned CSK and are proud of success we've had to date and feel we're laying the groundwork for a very successful future as we complete the integration work and our dual-market strategy gains traction in these expansion markets.
We continue to be pleased with the performance results of all the CSK converted stores. The Checker stores in the center portion of the country that are completely converted are performing extremely well, and the Murray [Murray's] conversions have clearly turned the corner and continue to make great progress.
In the Western U.S., the converted stores are incrementally benefiting from the new distribution of service and inventory availability they have, and we're clearly establishing our company as a very capable supplier and partner to the commercial customers in each market. As we discussed previously, we see a lot of opportunity in the Western half of the country. We feel we're just scratching the surface on the amount of business we can incrementally do as a commercial supplier in many major markets in the West.
We're on track with our integration plan and are looking forward to completing our distribution and computer system conversions before the end of this year, as previously announced. We also continue to make good progress with our store layout resets and sign changes. We still have a lot of work ahead of us in this area, and permitting in some of the Western states can be challenging, but we're making good progress.
We're nearing the completion of the product changes we'll be making in the CSK stores. We completed the back-room merchandise changes quite some time ago, and we've now completed a good majority of the display area changes. The remaining display area product changes are still on track to be finished this fall, as previously announced.
Ted will be reviewing more details of our integration progress and timing in a moment. Generally speaking, we remain very enthused about the future prospects of our business. We feel our dual-market strategy has proven over time to be the most effective business model in aftermarket retail. That said, we continue to work to refine and improve our operational execution and our ability to manage our inventory coverage, pricing, operating expenses and all other key aspects of our business.
We also continue to feel that many of the changes we've seen in the vehicle population and consumer behavior with regard to better maintaining their vehicles will be long-lasting. White cars and trucks are being driven to mileages beyond what these vehicles have been driven in the past, and we feel consumers will, over time, gain confidence in the reliability and safety of well-maintained vehicles being driven at even higher mileages.
Again, congratulations to all of Team O’Reilly on the outstanding second quarter results. I'll now turn the call over to Ted Wise."

While much of our attention in the corporate office has and continues to be on the C",1841,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Let me also start by saying thanks to our team for the sales and profit growth that O'Reilly accomplished in the second quarter. While much of our attention in the corporate office has and continues to be on the CSK to O’Reilly transition, the core O'Reilly's store operations, sales teams and distribution group are totally focused on our customers and managing our profitability. The results are very evident in last quarter's 7.9% comp sales growth and the increase in our operating margin to 14.2%.
During the last couple of years leading up to the purchase of CSK, several new tools and systems had been implemented in the stores and DCs. Our new store-scheduling system, our store-based computer training, electronic sales call tracking, regional installer pricing and voice pick in the DCs are some of the key initiatives that have enabled our stores and DCs better and more efficiently service the customer. Of course, we know that key to our growth and success is the culture and the dedication of our team members.
It's important that we also acknowledge all the team members from the core O'Reilly's stores who have been involved in the training for the CSK to O'Reilly store computer conversions and store resets. We have had thousands of team members volunteer and spend weeks at a time away from their families to help in these conversions. Needless to say, we couldn't have physically done it without them, and it has been an important part of replicating the O'Reilly culture out West to our new team members.
Prior to discussing the CSK conversions, I would like to quickly update everyone on our second quarter expansion results. Our total store count increased to 3,492 with the addition of 24 new store locations. We closed two stores, one originally identified as a closure in our initial CSK review and the second that we chose not to renew our lease. This gives us a net 71 new stores for the year, which puts us on track to reach our goal of 150 net new stores for the year.
Due to a late spring and late construction start dates on stores in the Northern states, about 10 stores that was originally scheduled in the second quarter was moved to the third quarter, which will result in approximately 50 stores in the third quarter. This will put us well ahead of our schedule going into the fourth quarter. 
Our 24 new stores were spread out in seven states. The top expansion areas were: North Carolina with seven stores; Texas with six stores; and Georgia with five stores. We continue to concentrate much of our growth in the South and the Southeast states around and out of our new Greensboro, North Carolina distribution center, as well as the Atlanta, Georgia distribution center. We're seeing great improvement in store performance in both comp sales and new store sales as our store count increases and our O’Reilly Brand continues to grow in the Southeast.
Now in addition to the new stores, we relocated three stores to new prototype buildings and performed 14 renovations in the core markets. For the year, this puts us at seven relocations and 26 renovations for the total company. We continue to evaluate and make improvements as needed in our older core markets.
Now to move on to an update on our CSK conversion progress. As reported last quarter, our new Seattle, DC and computer and point-of-sale conversion of the 193 Schuck's stores started in December. The new distribution center in Moreno Valley and the surrounding 238 Kragen stores followed with their computer conversion in January. And in March, we opened a new distribution center in Denver, Colorado and converted the 85 area stores. 
We have concentrated on providing good training ahead of the actual computer conversions, as well as having experienced core O'Reilly's team members in all stores following the conversion. This helped provide a smooth transition, but still understanding that the learning and total transition in each store would take time to be fully comprehended and become efficient on the systems. 
The new O'Reilly system included point-of-sale and electronic cataloging, store operational procedures, inventory management and daily stock replenishment, which were all much different than what the stores have been accustomed to. We've been very pleased with the ability of the store teams to learn and adjust to the new systems and procedures. And most importantly, we were able to keep a high level of customer service. Our service levels will continue to improve with time and as our team members become better and more trained to do business the O'Reilly way.
Now that the conversions are finished in these markets, we are moving forward with the changing exterior signs and doing interior layout and remodels. In May, and on schedule, we opened our new Salt Lake City 209,000-square-foot distribution center to service the 85 surrounding stores. It was a smooth opening, and all stores are up and running on O'Reilly's systems. 
This September, we will be opening our 519,000-square-foot distribution center in Stockton, California. As you may recall, this is actually a relocation of the smaller CSK distribution center located 60 miles away in Dixon, California. This also involves the largest number of store conversions, 276 Kragen stores that are primarily located in Central and Northern California. We are currently installing store training systems, and the distribution center is on schedule to open.
Immediately following the opening of Stockton, the closing of Dixon and the sell-down of the inventory, we will distribute the leftover inventory to other DCs. The last of the conversions will take place in the first part of November and includes the existing CSK Phoenix distribution center and the last 151 Checker Stores. The remodel of the Phoenix DC is well underway, allowing us to reset and make it ready to stock more parts and convert to our nightly distribution model.
Store systems will soon be installed, and training started at the store level. This conversion will differ, somewhat, in that the stores will all convert on one night, and the distribution of these stores will change to a nightly replenishment over the following five weeks. This plan will allow us to finish all stores and all distribution-center conversions by the holidays, enable us to be off the CSK computer systems by year end. Based on our past experience and proper planning and preparation, we are very confident that this conversion will be successful.
Now to recap the store changeover progress. To start, in regard to the products, all of the hard parts lines that we saw as our biggest priority are now finished. We do continue to fine-tune the inventory coverage in the individual markets as we open new distribution centers and reconfigure our hub-and-spoke store models. Also, as the stores convert over to a nightly replenishment, store-stocking models are being adjusted down.
Now in regard to the out-front merchandise, as Greg mentioned, we are well past the halfway point of changing product lines and getting the new O'Reilly planograms out to the stores. We anticipate we will be finished in the first part of the fourth quarter. Our plan was to hold off on the out-front changeovers and balance the workload at both the distribution centers and at the stores. And again, knowing that our highest priority and biggest opportunity to grow the Installer business was in the hard parts line, our goal now is to have all stores changed to the new and updated O'Reilly merchandise mix and the new planograms set in the stores by this late fall. 
The planning and execution of the reset of the store interiors and image upgrade is well underway, and we're making good progress. To redesign the various store layouts, order fixtures, draw plans and obtain proper city permits and then coordinate the projects around the distribution center and store computer conversions is a large task. We also have to factor in the terms of the lease and the possible relocations of certain stores.
At this time, all store computer conversions -- at the time the store computer conversions are finished, we will set a final schedule that will finish the interior remodels during the first part of next year. This is a little behind our original schedule due to permitting issues that we have found to be so challenging and take longer in the California and West Coast markets. It is important, and I want to point out again, that all the CSK store planograms will be updated and refreshed by this late fall, which is definitely the most important part of the re-merchandising of the stores. 
Now in regard to the sign conversions, we have reached the point now with our co-branding, advertising that we are very comfortable with moving forward with re-branding the stores' exteriors and signage. We are on schedule and planning to have new O'Reilly signage on most stores by the end of this year. Based on timing of permitting and acquiring landlord approvals, there will be small group of stores who will fall into the first quarter of next year. 
Our advertising will transition from the co-branding format we are using now to the O'Reilly auto parts only during the first half of next year. We are using much more radio, as well as an aggressive print schedule to educate our customers on the brand transition.
Our advertising theme and messages are designed to reinforce a competitive out-front accessory and chemical selection, but most important, create a new image of having good hard parts inventory coverage at competitive prices. We see a lot of opportunity to grow our sales with the retail customer in hard parts going forward. But it will take time to reinforce and establish this new store image.
Now on the Installer side of the business. We continue to work at building customer relationships with very aggressive sales work in the field. We are using every tool we have in our First Call program to build these relation and most important, working very hard to improve the quality of service that we provide at the stores to our Installer customers. We experienced good results as our experience level grow within stores and our sales teams build stronger ties to the customer. 
While we have made great progress this year, we are definitely looking forward to the time when the stores are totally and fully converted, distribution is in place and our teams are trained and ready to do business the O'Reilly way. There's been a tremendous amount of work in changes put on our West Coast team members. And in such a short period of time, we appreciate their great attitude, long hours and hard work and most importantly, willingness to accept and execute the O'Reilly program. 
It is an exciting time for everyone involved to see and experience the success and most importantly, realize the future opportunities we have to look forward to. I will now turn this over to Tom McFall."

Now I'll move on to the numbers. For the quarter, sales increased to $130 million, 10% over the prior year to $1.38 billion.

For the quarter, sales increased to $130 million, 10% over the prior year to $1.38 billion. The increase was attributable to a $97 million increase in comp store sales, a $32 million increase in non-comp new store sales and a $1 million increase in non-comp non-store sales. 
For the quarter, ticket average and ticket count contributed equally to our comparable store sales increase. The increase in the ticket average was driven mainly by mix. The sales of hard parts, which typically carry our higher ticket accounted for a larger portion of the overall sales volume. 
For 2010, our total revenue guidance remains at $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion. Gross profit was 48.7% of sales for the quarter versus 48.2% in the prior year. The 45 basis point improvement was driven by improved acquisition costs, more favorable product mix and decreasing at the stores converted to the O'Reilly POS system, which provides more robust tools for managers to control shrink. These improvements were in part offset by de-leverage on distribution costs, which is the result of the new distribution centers coming online and consistent with our expectations.
Year-to-date gross profit stands at 48.5% of sales. For the full fiscal year, we continue to estimate gross profit as percent of sales will be 48.1% to 48.4% of sales. While we've been very successful in growing the Commercial business, which typically carry a lower gross margin percent, the shift in mix of sales to more hard parts has helped us maintain our margins, and we now expect to be in the upper end of our guidance range.
SG&A for the quarter was 34.5% of sales versus 36.3% in the prior year. The leverage on SG&A was the result of strong comparable store sales. On a per-store basis, SG&A per store was up 1.4%, which allowed for strong leverage on the 7.9% increase in comparable store sales.
Year-to-date SG&A has improved to 177 basis points as a result of strong sales and expense control. For the full year, we expect SG&A dollars per store to be slightly up from 2009 as we continue to see opportunities to be more aggressive and investing in store SG&A to drive stronger sales results. We anticipate the SG&A for 2010, in total, will increase approximately 4.5% over the prior year.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter, which excludes the impact of the legacy CSK DOJ matter discussed by Greg earlier, was extremely strong at 14.2% of sales, an improvement of 224 basis points over the prior year. This large improvement was the result of strong comp sales and tight expense control that represent the highest quarterly operating margin in the company history. For the full year, we expect our adjusted operating margin to approach 13%, with variability being driven primarily by sales volumes.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $11 million, which was flat with the prior year. The reduced expense from less-outstanding debt during the quarter was offset by a reduction in capitalized interest based on fewer major capital projects under construction this year. For 2010, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $41 million.
The tax provision for the quarter and year-to-date was 41.9% and 40.3% of pretax income, respectively. The tax rate was negatively impacted by the charge related to the legacy CSK DOJ matter, which we currently do not anticipate to be tax-deductible. Excluding this onetime charge, the quarterly and year-to-date rate was 38.5% of pretax income, which was slightly lower than the prior year.
For 2010, we expect our tax rate as a percent of pretax income to be 39.1% to 39.4%. Included in this estimate is a 90 basis point onetime increase related to the reserve settle the DOJ matter. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.81 per share, which represents an increase of 31% over the second quarter of 2009. For the year, adjusted EPS of $1.51 increased 40% over the prior year.
Now we move on to the balance sheet. The average inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $553,000, which represents an 8% increase over the prior-year average of $513,000. This increase is a result of significantly increasing the hard parts SKUs stocked in the acquired stores and the addition of the Western DCs to our dual-market strategy. 
Since the beginning of the year, we've added 71 net new stores and three new DCs, and our total inventory has only increased $19 million. For the remainder of the year, we will remain focused on refining the inventory mix at the CSK stores and leveraging the new DCs to reduce the stock in debt of the Western stores. Based on these 2010 initiatives, we continue to expect to only increase our year-over-year investments slightly despite opening 150 new stores and three new DCs.
Our reserve for LIFO at the end of the quarter was $23 million, which was an increase of $10 million from the previous quarter. This change in our last vital [ph] LIFO reserve did not have a material impact on gross margin for the quarter. 
Accounts payable of $855 million was 44.2% of inventory as compared to 47.2% in the prior year. In 2010, we expect our AP-to-inventory ratio will continue to be under pressure until year end as we work excess inventory through and out of the system. 
Now for capital expenditures. They were $92 million for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date CapEx up to $182 million. For all of 2010, we are reducing our expected capital expenditures from $400 million to $440 million down to $370 million to $410 million. This reduction in CapEx spend relates to the adjustment in timing of a portion of the front-end conversions at the CSK stores, which Ted discussed earlier. We now expect this CapEx spend to occur in the first half of 2011.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $40 million. For 2010, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be $156 million to $160 million. Total borrowings at the end of the quarter were $584 million compared to $797 million at the end of Q2 2009. At the end of the quarter, we also had $647 million of availability under our existing ABL Facility [ABL Credit Facility]. For 2010, we expect to reduce our total outstanding borrowings by $200 million to $215 million. As noted in our press release on July 1, the legacy CSK convertible notes became exchangeable and will remain so until the end of the third quarter.
Based on our stock price at the end of the third quarter, the notes could potentially be exchanged for the fourth quarter also. To date, no notes have been surrendered for exchange. To the extent the notes remain outstanding, we continue to intend to call the notes in December. Our plan is to fund this with our existing ABL, which will still allow us significant financial flexibility.
Now for some other financial information. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was $185 million, an increase of $119 million over the second quarter of 2009. For the year, cash flow from
operating activities has increased 133% to $356 million. The improvement was driven by a significant decrease in net inventory investment, higher net income and timing of payments of other liabilities.
For the quarter, free cash flow was $94 million versus a use of $14 million in the second quarter of 2009. Year-to-date free cash flow was $173 million versus a use of $78 million in the first half of 2009. The improvement was driven by the previously mentioned increase in cash flow from operations and a $50 million decrease in capital expenditures. We now expect free cash flow to be $150 million to $200 million in 2010, and we'll use these funds to reduce our outstanding debt.
Stock option expense for the quarter was $3.8 million compared to $3.6 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the year-over-year increase in our stock price. For 2010, we continue to expect stock option expense to be approximately $15 million versus $13 million in 2009.
To recap our overall guidance, for the second quarter, our comparable store sales guidance is 4% to 6%. For the year, we are raising our comparable store sales guidance from an increase of 4% to 6% to an increase of 5% to 7%. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance for the third quarter is from $0.69 to $0.73 on 142.3 million shares. For the year, our EPS guidance is $2.64 to $2.74 per share on 141.1 million shares. On an adjusted basis, excluding the DOJ matter, our guidance for the full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is a range of $2.75 to $2.85.

Our effort once we convert is to go out and convince those customers that we can do a better job, and you don't get that opportunity, first try. And sometimes that opportunity happens incrementally and over time, and that's probably the case most of the time. And in this case, we're working varying stores to new systems, new product lines, new methods of inventory availability, the need to look up parts and paper catalogs for heavy-duty applications and a variety of things that have been the nature of the more traditional aftermarket for years. My comment would be that this is a multi-year process. But we immediately get pretty good results following the conversion once everyone gets used to the systems and so forth. It's just by virtue of the inventory availability. But for us to fully maximize this opportunity, it's a multi-year process."

If you look at the stores that are in the metro areas, in Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth and some other big metro areas, our average is much higher than that.

And really, that's what we're targeting with an average on these stores is about $1.8 million over time. So yes, we think that over some period of time, we can get them to $1.8 million.

Around the 1st of February or middle of February, business picked up and based on our experience, it is sustained that better pace to this point. In our first quarter comments, we reflected on the potential for pent-up demand because of the softer fourth quarter and what generally happens in a period of recession with consumer spending around Christmas and trying to defer things that they can defer in order to have money to spend on the holidays. It appears as though we weathered that, and the trend that we're on is the result of some of the very clear dynamics that we can see in the vehicle population with regard to the vehicles getting older, the new vehicle sales continuing to be at levels less than they had been in prior years. And then, of course, gas prices seeming to stabilize and miles driven increasing, all those things add up to a pretty -- and based on our results, add up to solid demand for the aftermarket."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ted Wise, our Chief Operating Officer.I'd like to start of",1604,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ted Wise, our Chief Operating Officer.
I'd like to start off by congratulating Team O’Reilly on the outstanding second quarter results. Our solid performance and continued success across the 38 states in which we do business is the result of the commitment each of you has made to our culture values. Embracing these values has been the bedrock of our company's phenomenal growth over the years, and it's so encouraging to see that the way we do business continues to be so successfully ingrained in our stores and distribution centers across all markets. I strongly believe that we offer the very best service levels in our business and want to thank all of you for your hard work and dedication to the company's continued success. 
Before moving on to the discussion of our operational performance during the quarter, I want to comment on the $15 million reserve we accrued in the second quarter to potentially fund settlement and related costs of the investigation of CSK Auto being performed by the United States Department of Justice. This investigation is related to the alleged wrongdoings at CSK Auto in 2006 and prior. As most of you know, we didn't purchase the company until July of 2008. Part of our due diligence process prior to this purchase was, of course, evaluating the exposure the company could have related to the alleged issues.
After extensive work, we reached the conclusion that the actions of the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission would most likely stop short of penalizing or charging CSK based on the level of cooperation with the SEC and the DOJ, the merits of our acquisition, prior actions by the SEC and DOJ, our track record of solid management, Sarbanes-Oxley [Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002] compliance, along with many other factors. 
As expected, in March 2009, the SEC determined to close the matter with respect to CSK without fine or penalties. In recent discussions with the DOJ, it's become clear that they feel a penalty against CSK is in order, and we've been working with them to reach an agreement as to the amount of that penalty.
I know all of our shareholders, many of which were previously CSK shareholders, will have difficulty understanding how penalizing our company at this point could be fair and justified. All I can tell you is that I completely understand your sentiments. We're doing our best to communicate our position to the DOJ as we continue to cooperate with their investigation of these legacy issues related to the individuals that were involved. We hope our good-faith efforts will bring closure to these matters in the near future.
Now on to our quarterly performance. I think it probably goes without saying that we're very pleased with our second quarter results. The strong business trend that began for us during the middle of the first quarter continued to the second quarter, and we continue to see solid sales results to this point in the current quarter.
These solid trends exist pretty much in all markets across the U.S. and yielded a very solid comparable store sales increase of 7.9% for the quarter on top of the 4.8% increase we had last year. We attribute the continued strong comp performance to a combination of solid execution in both the core O'Reilly stores and the CSK stores, along with the help from the tailwinds that are present for the automotive aftermarket as we benefit from the reduction in new vehicle sales in the U.S. 
This reduction in sales has contributed to increasing the average age of vehicles on the road in the U.S. to 10.2 years, up from 8.8 years just 10 years ago. This average age increase, along with the stabilization of fuel costs and increases in miles driven, has been helpful to our business as motorists focus on better maintaining these older vehicles in order to keep them on the road.
These factors are, of course, mitigated to some degree by the overhang of high unemployment, but the net effect seems to bode well for the automotive aftermarket. Comparable store sales are always difficult to forecast, and we clearly exceeded our second quarter estimate of 4% to 6%. As I've already mentioned, sales to this point in the third quarter have continued on a solid trend, but we feel like it would be imprudent on our part to forecast same-store sales beyond the 4% to 6% range for the third quarter on top of the 5.3% comps we generated last year. So our comp store sales estimate for the third quarter is to generate comparable store sales in the range of 4% to 6%. And considering our performance in the first half of the year, we are increasing our full year 2010 guidance to 5% to 7%.
Adjusting for the non-recurring $15 million expense item I mentioned, we generated a 14.2% operating margin for the quarter. This is a quarterly record for our company, and it's the result of our continued efforts on all fronts to drive the profitability of the company through diligent management of our gross margin and relentless expense control, while continuing to robustly grow sales. We're very pleased with our efforts on all fronts to grow our profits as we incrementally work to complete the integration of the CSK stores.
This month marks the second anniversary of the acquisition of CSK. While there's been a lot of effort put into this integration to get us to this point, I think I speak for all of Team O’Reilly when I say it's been very satisfying work. It's been a pleasure for all of us to see these stores pull out of the negative comparable store sales trend that had been present at CSK for several consecutive quarters prior to the acquisition to generating positive comps for the first full quarter we owned them and every subsequent quarter. 
It's been very satisfying to see our newest team members tell our customers that we have the part they need in stock or that we can get a hard-to-find fine part out of one of our hub stores or local distribution centers that same day. It's also been pleasing to see the stores gain momentum as they gain confidence and realize that they have all the tools they need to go out and develop strong relationships with the best commercial customers in their markets.
There's no question that this integration has been a lot of work and that it's tested the strength of many areas of our company. We've come a long way in two short years we've owned CSK and are proud of success we've had to date and feel we're laying the groundwork for a very successful future as we complete the integration work and our dual-market strategy gains traction in these expansion markets.
We continue to be pleased with the performance results of all the CSK converted stores. The Checker stores in the center portion of the country that are completely converted are performing extremely well, and the Murray [Murray's] conversions have clearly turned the corner and continue to make great progress.
In the Western U.S., the converted stores are incrementally benefiting from the new distribution of service and inventory availability they have, and we're clearly establishing our company as a very capable supplier and partner to the commercial customers in each market. As we discussed previously, we see a lot of opportunity in the Western half of the country. We feel we're just scratching the surface on the amount of business we can incrementally do as a commercial supplier in many major markets in the West.
We're on track with our integration plan and are looking forward to completing our distribution and computer system conversions before the end of this year, as previously announced. We also continue to make good progress with our store layout resets and sign changes. We still have a lot of work ahead of us in this area, and permitting in some of the Western states can be challenging, but we're making good progress.
We're nearing the completion of the product changes we'll be making in the CSK stores. We completed the back-room merchandise changes quite some time ago, and we've now completed a good majority of the display area changes. The remaining display area product changes are still on track to be finished this fall, as previously announced.
Ted will be reviewing more details of our integration progress and timing in a moment. Generally speaking, we remain very enthused about the future prospects of our business. We feel our dual-market strategy has proven over time to be the most effective business model in aftermarket retail. That said, we continue to work to refine and improve our operational execution and our ability to manage our inventory coverage, pricing, operating expenses and all other key aspects of our business.
We also continue to feel that many of the changes we've seen in the vehicle population and consumer behavior with regard to better maintaining their vehicles will be long-lasting. White cars and trucks are being driven to mileages beyond what these vehicles have been driven in the past, and we feel consumers will, over time, gain confidence in the reliability and safety of well-maintained vehicles being driven at even higher mileages.
Again, congratulations to all of Team O’Reilly on the outstanding second quarter results. I'll now turn the call over to Ted Wise."

Let me also start by saying thanks to our team for the sales and profit growth that O'Reilly accomplished in the second quarter. While much of our attention in the corporate office has and continues to be on the C",1842,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Let me also start by saying thanks to our team for the sales and profit growth that O'Reilly accomplished in the second quarter. While much of our attention in the corporate office has and continues to be on the CSK to O’Reilly transition, the core O'Reilly's store operations, sales teams and distribution group are totally focused on our customers and managing our profitability. The results are very evident in last quarter's 7.9% comp sales growth and the increase in our operating margin to 14.2%.
During the last couple of years leading up to the purchase of CSK, several new tools and systems had been implemented in the stores and DCs. Our new store-scheduling system, our store-based computer training, electronic sales call tracking, regional installer pricing and voice pick in the DCs are some of the key initiatives that have enabled our stores and DCs to better and more efficiently service the customer. Of course, we know that key to our growth and success is the culture and the dedication of our team members.
It's important that we also acknowledge all the team members from the core O'Reilly's stores who have been involved in the training for the CSK to O'Reilly store computer conversions and store resets. We have had thousands of team members volunteer and spend weeks at a time away from their family to help in these conversions. Needless to say, we couldn't have physically done it without them, and it has been an important part of replicating the O'Reilly culture out West to our new team members.
Prior to discussing the CSK conversions, I would like to quickly update everyone on our second quarter expansion results. Our total store count increased to 3,492 with the addition of 24 new store locations. We closed two stores, one originally identified as a closure in our initial CSK review and the second that we chose not to renew our lease. This gives us a net 71 new stores for the year, which puts us on track to reach our goal of 150 net new stores for the year.
Due to a late spring and late construction start dates on stores in the Northern states, about 10 stores that was originally scheduled in the second quarter was moved to the third quarter, which will result in approximately 50 stores in the third quarter. This will put us well ahead of our schedule going into the fourth quarter. 
Our 24 new stores were spread out in seven states. The top expansion areas were: North Carolina with seven stores; Texas with six stores; and Georgia with five stores. We continue to concentrate much of our growth in the South and the Southeast states around and out of our new Greensboro, North Carolina distribution center, as well as the Atlanta, Georgia distribution center. We're seeing great improvement in store performance in both comp sales and new store sales as our store count increases and our O’Reilly Brand continues to grow in the Southeast.
Now in addition to the new stores, we relocated three stores to new prototype buildings and performed 14 renovations in the core markets. For the year, this puts us at seven relocations and 26 renovations for the total company. We continue to evaluate and make improvements as needed in our older core markets.
Now to move on to an update on our CSK conversion progress. As reported last quarter, our new Seattle, DC and computer and point-of-sale conversion of the 193 Schuck's stores started in December. The new distribution center in Moreno Valley and the surrounding 238 Kragen stores followed with their computer conversion in January. And in March, we opened a new distribution center in Denver, Colorado and converted the 85 area stores. 
We have concentrated on providing good training ahead of the actual computer conversions, as well as having experienced core O'Reilly's team members in all stores following the conversion. This helped provide a smooth transition, but still understanding that the learning and total transition in each store would take time to be fully comprehended and become efficient on the systems. 
The new O'Reilly system included point-of-sale and electronic cataloging, store operational procedures, inventory management and daily stock replenishment, which were all much different than what the stores have been accustomed to. We've been very pleased with the ability of the store teams to learn and adjust to the new systems and procedures. And most importantly, we were able to keep a high level of customer service. Our service levels will continue to improve with time and as our team members become better and more trained to do business the O'Reilly way.
Now that the conversions are finished in these markets, we are moving forward with the changing exterior signs and doing interior layout and remodels. In May, and on schedule, we opened our new Salt Lake City 209,000-square-foot distribution center to service the 85 surrounding stores. It was a smooth opening, and all stores are up and running on O'Reilly's systems. 
This September, we will be opening our 519,000-square-foot distribution center in Stockton, California. As you may recall, this is actually a relocation of the smaller CSK distribution center located 60 miles away in Dixon, California. This also involves the largest number of store conversions, 276 Kragen stores that are primarily located in Central and Northern California. We are currently installing store training systems, and the distribution center is on schedule to open.
Immediately following the opening of Stockton, the closing of Dixon and the sell-down of the inventory, we will distribute the leftover inventory to other DCs. The last of the conversions will take place in the first part of November and includes the existing CSK Phoenix distribution center and the last 151 Checker Stores. The remodel of the Phoenix DC is well underway, allowing us to reset and make it ready to stock more parts and convert to our nightly distribution model.
Store systems will soon be installed, and training started at the store level. This conversion will differ, somewhat, in that the stores will all convert on one night, and the distribution of these stores will change to a nightly replenishment over the following five weeks. This plan will allow us to finish all stores and all distribution-center conversions by the holidays, enable us to be off the CSK computer systems by year end. Based on our past experience and proper planning and preparation, we are very confident that this conversion will be successful.
Now to recap the store changeover progress. To start, in regard to the products, all of the hard parts lines that we saw as our biggest priority are now finished. We do continue to fine-tune the inventory coverage in the individual markets as we open new distribution centers and reconfigure our hub-and-spoke store models. Also, as the stores convert over to a nightly replenishment, store-stocking models are being adjusted down.
Now in regard to the out-front merchandise, as Greg mentioned, we are well past the halfway point of changing product lines and getting the new O'Reilly planograms out to the stores. We anticipate we will be finished in the first part of the fourth quarter. Our plan was to hold off on the out-front changeovers and balance the workload at both the distribution centers and at the stores. And again, knowing that our highest priority and biggest opportunity to grow the Installer business was in the hard parts line, our goal now is to have all stores changed to the new and updated O'Reilly merchandise mix and the new planograms set in the stores by this late fall. 
The planning and execution of the reset of the store interiors and image upgrade is well underway, and we're making good progress. To redesign the various store layouts, order fixtures, draw plans and obtain proper city permits and then coordinate the projects around the distribution center and store computer conversions is a large task. We also have to factor in the terms of the lease and the possible relocations of certain stores.
At this time, all store computer conversions -- at the time the store computer conversions are finished, we will set a final schedule that will finish the interior remodels during the first part of next year. This is a little behind our original schedule due to permitting issues that we have found to be so challenging and take longer in the California and West Coast markets. It is important, and I want to point out again, that all the CSK store planograms will be updated and refreshed by this late fall, which is definitely the most important part of the re-merchandising of the stores. 
Now in regard to the sign conversions, we have reached the point now with our co-branding, advertising that we are very comfortable with moving forward with re-branding the stores' exteriors and signage. We are on schedule and planning to have new O'Reilly signage on most stores by the end of this year. Based on timing of permitting and acquiring landlord approvals, there will be small group of stores who will fall into the first quarter of next year. 
Our advertising will transition from the co-branding format we are using now to the O'Reilly auto parts only during the first half of next year. We are using much more radio, as well as an aggressive print schedule to educate our customers on the brand transition.
Our advertising theme and messages are designed to reinforce a competitive out-front accessory and chemical selection, but most important, create a new image of having good hard parts inventory coverage at competitive prices. We see a lot of opportunity to grow our sales with the retail customer in hard parts going forward. But it will take time to reinforce and establish this new store image.
Now on the Installer side of the business. We continue to work at building customer relationships with very aggressive sales work in the field. We are using every tool we have in our First Call program to build these relation and most important, working very hard to improve the quality of service that we provide at the stores to our Installer customers. We experienced good results as our experience level grow within stores and our sales teams build stronger ties to the customer. 
While we have made great progress this year, we are definitely looking forward to the time when the stores are totally and fully converted, distribution is in place and our teams are trained and ready to do business the O'Reilly way. There's been a tremendous amount of work in changes put on our West Coast team members. And in such a short period of time, we appreciate their great attitude, long hours and hard work and most importantly, willingness to accept and execute the O'Reilly program. 
It is an exciting time for everyone involved to see and experience the success and most importantly, realize the future opportunities we have to look forward to. I will now turn this over to Tom McFall."

Now I'll move on to the numbers. For the quarter, sales increased to $130 million, 10% over the prior year to $1.38 billion. The increase was attributable to a $97 million increase in comp store sales, a $32 million increase in non-comp new",1487,"Thanks, Ted. Now I'll move on to the numbers. 
For the quarter, sales increased to $130 million, 10% over the prior year to $1.38 billion. The increase was attributable to a $97 million increase in comp store sales, a $32 million increase in non-comp new store sales and a $1 million increase in non-comp non-store sales. 
For the quarter, ticket average and ticket count contributed equally to our comparable store sales increase. The increase in the ticket average was driven mainly by mix. The sales of hard parts, which typically carry our higher ticket accounted for a larger portion of the overall sales volume. 
For 2010, our total revenue guidance remains at $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion. Gross profit was 48.7% of sales for the quarter versus 48.2% in the prior year. The 45 basis point improvement was driven by improved acquisition costs, more favorable product mix and decreasing at the stores converted to the O'Reilly POS system, which provides more robust tools for managers to control shrink. These improvements were in part offset by de-leverage on distribution costs, which is the result of the new distribution centers coming online and consistent with our expectations.
Year-to-date gross profit stands at 48.5% of sales. For the full fiscal year, we continue to estimate gross profit as percent of sales will be 48.1% to 48.4% of sales. While we've been very successful in growing the Commercial business, which typically carry a lower gross margin percent, the shift in mix of sales to more hard parts has helped us maintain our margins, and we now expect to be in the upper end of our guidance range.
SG&A for the quarter was 34.5% of sales versus 36.3% in the prior year. The leverage on SG&A was the result of strong comparable store sales. On a per-store basis, SG&A per store was up 1.4%, which allowed for strong leverage on the 7.9% increase in comparable store sales.
Year-to-date SG&A has improved to 177 basis points as a result of strong sales and expense control. For the full year, we expect SG&A dollars per store to be slightly up from 2009 as we continue to see opportunities to be more aggressive and investing in store SG&A to drive stronger sales results. We anticipate the SG&A for 2010, in total, will increase approximately 4.5% over the prior year.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter, which excludes the impact of the legacy CSK DOJ matter discussed by Greg earlier, was extremely strong at 14.2% of sales, an improvement of 224 basis points over the prior year. This large improvement was the result of strong comp sales and tight expense control that represent the highest quarterly operating margin in the company history. For the full year, we expect our adjusted operating margin to approach 13%, with variability being driven primarily by sales volumes.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $11 million, which was flat with the prior year. The reduced expense from less-outstanding debt during the quarter was offset by a reduction in capitalized interest based on fewer major capital projects under construction this year. For 2010, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $41 million.
The tax provision for the quarter and year-to-date was 41.9% and 40.3% of pretax income, respectively. The tax rate was negatively impacted by the charge related to the legacy CSK DOJ matter, which we currently do not anticipate to be tax-deductible. Excluding this onetime charge, the quarterly and year-to-date rate was 38.5% of pretax income, which was slightly lower than the prior year.
For 2010, we expect our tax rate as a percent of pretax income to be 39.1% to 39.4%. Included in this estimate is a 90 basis point onetime increase related to the reserve settle the DOJ matter. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.81 per share, which represents an increase of 31% over the second quarter of 2009. For the year, adjusted EPS of $1.51 increased 40% over the prior year.
Now we move on to the balance sheet. The average inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $553,000, which represents an 8% increase over the prior-year average of $513,000. This increase is a result of significantly increasing the hard parts SKUs stocked in the acquired stores and the addition of the Western DCs to our dual-market strategy. 
Since the beginning of the year, we've added 71 net new stores and three new DCs, and our total inventory has only increased $19 million. For the remainder of the year, we will remain focused on refining the inventory mix at the CSK stores and leveraging the new DCs to reduce the stock in debt of the Western stores. Based on these 2010 initiatives, we continue to expect to only increase our year-over-year investments slightly despite opening 150 new stores and three new DCs.
Our reserve for LIFO at the end of the quarter was $23 million, which was an increase of $10 million from the previous quarter. This change in our last vital [ph] LIFO reserve did not have a material impact on gross margin for the quarter. 
Accounts payable of $855 million was 44.2% of inventory as compared to 47.2% in the prior year. In 2010, we expect our AP-to-inventory ratio will continue to be under pressure until year end as we work excess inventory through and out of the system. 
Now for capital expenditures. They were $92 million for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date CapEx up to $182 million. For all of 2010, we are reducing our expected capital expenditures from $400 million to $440 million down to $370 million to $410 million. This reduction in CapEx spend relates to the adjustment in timing of a portion of the front-end conversions at the CSK stores, which Ted discussed earlier. We now expect this CapEx spend to occur in the first half of 2011.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $40 million. For 2010, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be $156 million to $160 million. Total borrowings at the end of the quarter were $584 million compared to $797 million at the end of Q2 2009. At the end of the quarter, we also had $647 million of availability under our existing ABL Facility [ABL Credit Facility]. For 2010, we expect to reduce our total outstanding borrowings by $200 million to $215 million. As noted in our press release on July 1, the legacy CSK convertible notes became exchangeable and will remain so until the end of the third quarter.
Based on our stock price at the end of the third quarter, the notes could potentially be exchanged for the fourth quarter also. To date, no notes have been surrendered for exchange. To the extent the notes remain outstanding, we continue to intend to call the notes in December. Our plan is to fund this with our existing ABL, which will still allow us significant financial flexibility.
Now for some other financial information. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was $185 million, an increase of $119 million over the second quarter of 2009. For the year, cash flow from
operating activities has increased 133% to $356 million. The improvement was driven by a significant decrease in net inventory investment, higher net income and timing of payments of other liabilities.
For the quarter, free cash flow was $94 million versus a use of $14 million in the second quarter of 2009. Year-to-date free cash flow was $173 million versus a use of $78 million in the first half of 2009. The improvement was driven by the previously mentioned increase in cash flow from operations and a $50 million decrease in capital expenditures. We now expect free cash flow to be $150 million to $200 million in 2010, and we'll use these funds to reduce our outstanding debt.
Stock option expense for the quarter was $3.8 million compared to $3.6 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the year-over-year increase in our stock price. For 2010, we continue to expect stock option expense to be approximately $15 million versus $13 million in 2009.
To recap our overall guidance, for the second quarter, our comparable store sales guidance is 4% to 6%. For the year, we are raising our comparable store sales guidance from an increase of 4% to 6% to an increase of 5% to 7%. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance for the third quarter is from $0.69 to $0.73 on 142.3 million shares. For the year, our EPS guidance is $2.64 to $2.74 per share on 141.1 million shares. On an adjusted basis, excluding the DOJ matter, our guidance for the full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is a range of $2.75 to $2.85.

The commercial customers in every market or at least we've not found any that were really underserved, most commercial customers have a supplier that's doing a reasonably good job. Our effort once we convert is to go out and convince those customers that we can do a better job, and you don't get that opportunity, first try. And sometimes that opportunity happens incrementally and over time, and that's probably the case most of the time. And in this case, we're working varying stores to new systems, new product lines, new methods of inventory availability, the need to look up parts and paper catalogs for heavy-duty applications and a variety of things that have been the nature of the more traditional aftermarket for years. My comment would be that this is a multi-year process. But we immediately get pretty good results following the conversion once everyone gets used to the systems and so forth. It's just by virtue of the inventory availability. But for us to fully maximize this opportunity, it's a multi-year process."

Many of those stores operate below our $1.5 million O'Reilly average. If you look at the stores that are in the metro areas, in Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth and some other big metro areas, our average is much higher than that. The way we view the CSK stores, which most of them are in more metro-type areas, is that those stores could eventually do the volume that we do in our metro stores, which is at minimum, $1.8 million. And really, that's what we're targeting with an average on these stores is about $1.8 million over time. So yes, we think that over some period of time, we can get them to $1.8 million. The business mix out West will be a little bit more slightly towards the DIY sites and some of the locations approximately, I'd say, 10%, 15% are in locations that are much more conducive to doing Retail business than they are doing a combination of business. Although we'll do some Commercial business out of pretty much all locations, there will be some that will be much more conducive to the Retail business. So I think the business mix will continue to be dominated out West by the Retail side. But we'll add -- most of the growth will come on the Wholesale side or the Commercial side."

We really haven't increased the sales force headcount that much out on the West Coast. I checked with the sales department the other day, and we're up probably about 10% on TSM, territory sales managers.

And like they had four sales manager covering those 200, and we've gone to like eight to nine. And their goal was to more closely manage the productivity of the type of customers they call on and more accountable sales call schedule, plus our TSM commission schedule is quite a bit different than what CSK had, which really makes them much more focused on growing the business. So from the manpower out in the field, I don't think we've increased the dollars of salary out there.

So that's an opportunity going into next year to recycle that payroll to other tasks, and ideally, it's to drive more sales volume, so that we get the bang for the buck. Otherwise, we'll take those hours out. I can't quantify for you specifically, but it's a reasonable number that we spent in both years through store payroll."

Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ted Wise, our Chief Operating Officer. David O'Reilly, our Ex",1767,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ted Wise, our Chief Operating Officer. David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman is also present. 
I'd like to start off by once again congratulating Tim O'Reilly on the outstanding results. Our performance across all markets in the third quarter was very strong, and we should all be proud of our performance so far this year. Especially impressive is the continued outstanding performance of the core O'Reilly stores. We've asked many of our more-tenured team members to take on the task of attending the CSK conversions and spend the first couple of weeks after conversion training the converted store team members. Even with these distractions, our core stores have continued to gain market share and post very impressive comparable store sales gains. 
At the same time, the work that we've put in to these conversions is clearly bearing fruit, as we continue to gain market share in the converted stores. The strong comparable store sales that we've been able to achieve in the converted stores have been a team effort, and every Team O'Reilly member should be very proud of the success we are having with these conversions. Our outstanding sales performance is the direct result of the incredible customer service levels we provide at each of our locations, and I want to thank you for your commitment to providing the best customer service in our industry and to the continued success of our company. 
Before moving onto the discussion of our operational performance during the quarter, I want to comment on the $5.9 million reserve we accrued in the third quarter to fund the settlement of the legacy CSK Department of Justice issue. As discussed during our second quarter earnings release, this investigation is related to the alleged wrongdoing at CSK Auto in 2006 and prior. As most of you know, we did not purchase the company until July of 2008. Part of our due diligence process prior to this purchase was, of course, evaluating the exposure the company could have related to the alleged issues. After extensive work, we reached the conclusion that the actions of the Department of Justice and the Securities Exchange Commission would most likely stop short of penalizing or charging CSK based on the level of cooperation with the SEC and the DOJ, the merits of our acquisition, prior actions by the SEC and DOJ, our track record of solid management, SOX compliance, along with many other factors. 
As expected, in March of 2009, the SEC determined to close the matter with respect to CSK without fine or penalty. With respect to the DOJ investigation, O'Reilly has continued to cooperate with and engage in discussions with the DOJ to resolve CSK's legacy accounting issues, and we have now reached an agreement in principal with the DOJ. Subject to final documentation, the DOJ, CSK and O'Reilly will enter into an Non-Prosecution Agreement and the company will pay a one-time monetary penalty in the amount of $20.9 million. As you may recall, we reserved $15 million for this matter during our second quarter this year and the additional $5.9 million reserve that we made this past quarter will resolve the matter. 
Now on to our quarterly performance. We're very pleased with our performance during the third quarter. Business remains strong coming out of the second quarter and was steady at a solid rate throughout the quarter. These solid trends exist in pretty much all our markets across the U.S. and yielded a strong comparable store sales increase of 11.1% for the quarter on top of the 5.3% increase we had last year. 
Our continued strong comp performance can be attributed to several factors, but the key contributor is very solid execution across all our markets. Our store operations and distribution teams are very simply doing an outstanding job providing incredibly high levels of customer service. This, coupled with the ongoing effort we make in all stores to carry the right product assortment at competitive prices, as well as the investments that we've made in our Western distribution capability, has put us in a good position. 
At the same time, our industry clearly continues to benefit from the tailwinds that have been present for some time now. The average age of vehicles driven in the U.S. continues to increase as new vehicle sales have stalled, fuel prices have been relatively steady for some time now and miles driven are back to solid incremental increases, and to a lesser degree, the dealership closures have redirected some of the service work that was being performed at the dealers to aftermarket shops. 
In the third quarter, all the factors I've mentioned, both internal and external, coupled with favorable summer weather conditions, culminated into a very good sales environment for our company. We're very pleased with our comparable store sales performance on both sides of our business, in DIY and Commercial. Yet, as has been the case for some time now, our commercial sales continue to grow faster than our DIY sales as we have enhanced our capabilities in the historic CSK markets. 
To this point in the fourth quarter, we're very pleased with our sales performance. However, fourth quarter is always a difficult quarter to forecast comparable store sales. As when it rolls in, sales can be lumpy from week to week and with unemployment still over 9%, I think it's reasonable to anticipate some slowdown in our business over the holiday season as consumers use their limited discretionary income for holiday activities. 
With this in mind, we're going to leave our comparable store sales forecast at 4% to 6% for the quarter, which would lead us to completing a full year with comps in the range of 7% to 8%. Adjusting for the nonrecurring $5.9 million expense item I mentioned, we generated a 14.4% operating margin for the quarter. This is an all-time high quarterly operating margin for our company since going public in 1993, beating the record we set in second quarter of this year by 20 basis points. 
The increased level of profitability is the direct result of the commitment all our team members have made to the profitability of our company through diligent management of our gross margin and relentless expense control while continuing to robustly grow market share. We're very pleased with our efforts on all fronts to grow our profits as we incrementally work to complete the integration of CSK. 
We're now on our 28th month of the CSK integration work that began with the acquisition in July of 2008, and I'm very pleased to announce that we're right on schedule with the plan we put in place directly following the acquisition. We've now completed the distribution expansion in the western half of the country with O'Reilly distribution centers now operating in Seattle, Marino Valley, California, Denver, Salt Lake City and Stockton, California. 
Stockton was our most recent opening, and our team has simply done an excellent job at moving our operations from Dixon, California to a larger facility in Stockton and in completing the system conversions of the 274 stores that are supplied by the new distribution center. We're now in the process of closing down the facility in Dixon but still has some duplicate inventory to work through, and we'll do so over the next few months. This duplicate inventory is one of the contributors to the inventory growth we had in the third quarter. 
The final leg of the distribution and system conversions will be completed on November 7 with the system conversion of the Phoenix distribution center and simultaneous conversion of the 151 stores that are supplied by that distribution center. On that date, all our stores and DCs will be operating on the same systems and will be able to retire the legacy CSK systems that are being used in the unconverted stores. 
We'll also be able to focus more of our efforts on execution of our business strategy in all of the converted stores, which will lead to continued success in gaining back the DIY auto parts market share these stores have sacrificed over the years and the growth of our commercial programs. 
With respect to the Phoenix DC conversion, I want to reassure everyone that we're very confident in our ability to perform a single weekend conversion of this size. We've done it before and have been doing conversions most weekends at a rate of 20 to 40 stores for some time now. In 1998, we converted all of the 180 high/low stores we purchased in Texas and Louisiana in one night. And in April 2009, we converted the CSK Detroit DC and 79 supported stores in one night. Both of these conversions were accomplished without service disruptions to the stores, as we have a lot of experience with these types of system conversions. 
Following completion of the system conversions, we'll finish the last leg of the integration by completing the remaining store resets, renovation work and rebranding. Ted will be reviewing this in detail in a moment, but I just want to re-emphasize that we're on schedule with our plan and are very satisfied with the performance of our converted stores and new distribution centers. 
A lot has changed in a relatively short period of time for our team members in the acquired stores, and we're very proud of the jobs our teams in both converted and unconverted stores have done adapting our cultural values and our dual-market strategy. Generally speaking, and as I've expressed through the integration, we're very enthused about what the future holds for our company. We very simply have a huge opportunity to expand our ability to execute our dual-market strategy in many new markets, and we now have ourselves in a position to do that. 
At the same time, we have several initiatives underway to improve our operations, profitability and market penetration in all markets. Things like the implementation of retail price optimization software, enhanced e-commerce capabilities, incremental improvements to our inventory management systems and enhancements to our point-of-sale system content, just to name a few of the initiatives that we currently have underway. 
We also feel that the industry tailwind we've had for some time now could be long-lasting as consumers permanently change their behavior and gain comfort with driving low maintained vehicles at higher mileages. Again, congratulations to all of Team O'Reilly on the outstanding third quarter results. I'll now turn the call over to Ted Wise."

To start, I would also like to thank our nearly 49,000 O'Reilly team members for the absolutely outstanding results in our third quarter. 
Without question, the general conditions for the auto parts business have been good. However, for our team to produce 11% comps defines the superior level of service we're giving our customers and the market share gains we're experiencing across the core O'Reilly stores, as well as our new conversions stores out west. Also, our 14.4% operating margin last quarter demonstrates our team's ability to effectively manage both our expenses and gross profit. 
Most amazing, these results paralleled the work of various projects involving the CSK O'Reilly store conversions and installations of our new distribution centers. We are proud of our teams above and beyond commitment to take care of our normal business while managing the integration of CSK into our company. We are anxiously looking forward to next year when we have the many tasks of the conversion behind us. All the support in place on the West Coast and our entire team can be 100% focused on growing our sales. 
Before commenting on our progress and the conversion work on the West Coast, I will quickly summarize our new store expansion for the third quarter. We ended the quarter with 3,511 stores, a net gain of 44 new stores. This brings us up to 115 stores year-to-date and on schedule to end the year at 150 new stores. Again, an incredible accomplishment for our store expansion and installation team members considering the additional workload involving the West Coast conversion and reset work that we'll outline in a minute. Also, we performed 11 major store renovations and relocated four stores into new locations. 
In regard to our area of expansion, the stores were in 15 different states. Wisconsin and Ohio had seven stores each. Texas and Indiana received six stores, and Michigan and North Carolina had four stores each. The remaining stores were spread out primarily in the South and Southeast states. 
As I mentioned, our installation schedule calls for another 35 stores in the fourth quarter for a net 150 new stores in 2010. Our new store expansion plan for 2011 will be 170 new stores. Considering the amount of conversion and reset work on the West Coast that will spill over into the first part of next year, we will have a very busy and productive year ahead of us. Our real estate team continues to evaluate the conversion store leases and develop the stay and relocation strategy for our store group out West. 
We'll also start a more aggressive new store growth plan in the west now that the new distribution centers are open and the stores are operating under the O'Reilly system and brand. Now to overview our conversion progress for last quarter. 
In the second week of September, we officially opened our new 520,000-square foot distribution center in Stockton, California. As Greg mentioned, it was actually a move from the smaller CSK distribution center in Dixon, California. This allowed us to start the computer conversions for the 274 Kragen stores, primarily in the surrounding markets at a rate of approximately 40 stores per week. 
In addition to receiving new store computers and POS systems, the stores began nightly stock replenishment and daily access to the additional DC inventory coverage. To date, this was not only the largest distribution center we opened but also the largest group of stores to convert. We are now finished with the project and in the process of shutting down the old Dixon DC and redistributing the inventory to our surrounding distribution centers. 
The last phase of the distribution and store conversions will take place on November 7, when we convert the existing CSK Phoenix DC over to O'Reilly warehouse system and convert the 151 surrounding stores to O'Reilly systems. Unlike the other conversions, as Greg mentioned, all 151 stores will convert over the same week and time. This allows us to be totally off with the CSK computer systems by end of the year and start all distribution centers and stores under one reporting system in 2011. 
The installation of five new distribution centers, conversion of two CSK distribution centers to O'Reilly systems, the conversions to nightly replenishment and installation of new store systems in all 1,299 CSK stores, will have been completed in approximately two and a half years. This is an outstanding accomplishment that has involved a great deal of planning and execution across all areas of our company. 
We're also making good progress on the store resets. And now that the stores are finished with computer conversions, more stores will be available to put it on the reset schedule. We have completed almost all of the individual store layout plans and have the new plans into the city for permits. We completed resets for over 130 stores last quarter, and we'll do an additional 190 stores in the fourth quarter. Our goal is to finish the store resets by the end of the first quarter next year, the exception being a small group of resolution stores and some that may still be pending permitting issues. 
Immediately following the story resets to the O'Reilly floor plans, the interior decor package and necessary remodel work follows. Our plan calls for all interior decor and related work to be finished following the resets in the first half of next year. 
In regards to the actual backroom merchandise changeovers and the new retail planograms, this work has been ongoing independently of the physical reset. The backroom hard parts changeovers were completed by midyear and we are 80% completed without front-line changeovers, with the balance to be scheduled in November, December and January. At that time, the stores will have the O'Reilly product mix, both hard parts and new retail planograms, even though a small group of stores will still have the old CSK store layout. 
Our co-branding advertising plan for CSK and O'Reilly Brand has been going on for almost two years and has paved the way for changing the exterior signs. This task is well underway and so far, we have completed signed conversions to O'Reilly Brand in approximately half of our stores. An additional 180 stores will be installed as soon as the signs are received by the installing sign company. And the balance of the sign, surveys for the stores will have been completed, bids sent out to sign companies and plans into the city, we expect to have the rebranding completed by the end of first quarter. 
Again, there may be a small number of resolution stores and perhaps a group of stores that still has permitting issues that will go into the second quarter. Following the sign conversions, we are evaluating the rest of our exterior store in regard to paint and other image upgrades that may be needed, and the appropriate work will be scheduled as soon as possible. 
To summarize the store conversion task and projected completion schedule, all computer systems and nightly replenishment will be finished by the end of this year. All inventory hard parts upgrades were finished this year. All out-front planograms finished by this coming January. Store resets finished in the first quarter. O'Reilly sign change-outs finished in the first quarter, and the interior decor and exterior work completed in the second quarter of next year. 
Our store operations and sales teams are developing well as they become more familiar with the O'Reilly product lines, computer system and all the aspects of our dual-marketing plan. Our team members have been very receptive to the conversion tasks, the introduction of the new POS system, the new store operational procedures and the physical resets going on in the stores. 
Most importantly, we are seeing a good sales improvement as we transition the stores traffic from a more pure oil and accessory sales mix to include more hard parts to both the retail and professional installer customer. Improved store inventories and the access to additional inventory coverage at the hub and distribution center has and is playing a key role in growing our retail and installer business. Market-driven pricing is also helping us gain new customers as the customers realize that we are more competitive now. 
An important goal of our print and radio advertising has been to build the O'Reilly image of having better parts coverage at everyday low prices. The better inventory and better pricing has gained momentum as the stores are reset to the O'Reilly format and O'Reilly exterior signs go up. 
On the professional sales side, we are very focused on building strong and experienced teams at the stores that will result in higher service levels. As stores convert to O'Reilly systems, we are opening up more stores to delivery and implementing First Call installer counters to better service the professional customer. We're expanding our territory sales management team, making more sales calls and developing stronger customer relationships with a wider group of both large and small customers. 
As we now transition from the CSK to O'Reilly Brand and along with the improved inventory market-driven pricing and higher service levels in the stores, we feel our relationship and business with the professional customer will continue to grow for years to come. 
The O'Reilly culture is growing stronger everyday in our new stores on the West Coast. Our team members are very happy to have the conversions and the inventory changes behind them and moving forward so rapidly with the interior resets and exterior sign changes. They are excited to be fully integrated in the O'Reilly systems and procedures and looking forward to continue building our business. The core O'Reilly managers and team members that have spent time helping with the conversions and training at these stores have done a great job in expanding our O'Reilly culture as well as training in the O'Reilly procedures. 
We are now operating as one team moving forward. With this, I'll turn the call back over to Tom."

Now we'll move on to the numbers. For the quarter, sales increased $168 million, 13% over the prior year, to $1.43 billion. The increase was attributable to $136 million increase in comp store sales, a $30 million increase in non-comp store s",1415,"Thanks, Ted. Now we'll move on to the numbers. For the quarter, sales increased $168 million, 13% over the prior year, to $1.43 billion. The increase was attributable to $136 million increase in comp store sales, a $30 million increase in non-comp store sales and a $2 million increase in non-comp non-store sales. 
For the quarter, ticket average and ticket count contributed equally to our comparable store sales increase. The increase in ticket average continues to be driven mainly by mix and sales of hard parts, which typically carry a higher ticket, accounted for a larger portion of the overall sales volume. For 2010, we're increasing our total revenue guidance to a range of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion. 
Gross profit was 48.6% of sales for the quarter versus 48.5% in the prior year. The 10 basis point improvement was driven by improved acquisition costs and improved shrink at the converted stores. These improvements were, in part, offset by deleverage on the distribution cost, which is a result of the new DCs coming online and consistent with our expectations. 
Year-to-date gross profit stands at 48.6% of sales. And for the full fiscal year, we expect gross profit to be approximately 48.5% of sales. SG&A for the quarter was 34.3% of sales versus 36.7% in the prior year. The leverage on SG&A was the direct result of strong comparable store sales. On a per-store basis, SG&A per store is up 2.6%, which allowed for strong leverage on 11.1% increase in comp store sales. Year-to-date, SG&A improved 200 basis points as a result of strong sales and expense control. For the full year, we expect SG&A dollars per store to be up slightly from 2009 as we continue to see opportunities to more aggressively invest and for SG&A to drive strong sales results. We anticipate that total SG&A for 2010 will increase approximately 5% to 5.5% over the prior year. 
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter, which excludes the impact of the legacy CSK DOJ matter discussed by Greg earlier, was extremely strong at 14.4% of sales, an improvement of 250 basis points over the prior year. This large improvement was the result of strong comp sales and tight expense control and represents a record quarterly operating margin. For the full year, we expect our adjusted operating margin to come in at 13% to 13.5% of sales. 
Net interest expense for the quarter was $10 million, which is better than prior year by $1 million due to lower borrowings, offset in part by higher rates as a result of our outstanding interest rate swaps. For 2010, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $40 million. 
The tax provision for the quarter and year-to-date was 38.7% and 39.7% of pretax income, respectively. The tax rate was negatively impacted by the charge related to the legacy CSK DOJ matter, which we currently do not anticipate to be tax-deductible. Excluding this one-time charge, the quarterly rate was 37.6%, and the year-to-date rate was 38.2% of pretax income, which were both flat to the prior year. 
For 2010, we expect our tax rate as a percent of pretax income to be approximately 39.5%. Included in this estimate is the 120 basis point one-time increase related to the non-tax-deductible reserve to settle the legacy CSK DOJ issue. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.86 per share, which represents an increase of 37% over the third quarter of 2009. For the year, adjusted EPS of $2.37 increased 39% over the prior year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. The average inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $565,000, which represents a 4% increase over the prior year average of $543,000. This increase is the result of our continuing effort to add hard parts coverage to the stores and duplicative inventory as new DCs come online. Since the beginning of the year, we've added 115 net new stores, four new DCs with one that closed when we relocated to the Stockton DC. As a result, our total inventories increased $85 million. We remain focused on refining the inventory mix at the CSK stores and leveraging the new DCs to reduce the stacking debt at the western stores. We expect our total inventory levels will not increase significantly through the end of the year despite adding approximately 35 new stores in the fourth quarter. 
Our reserve for LIFO at the end of the quarter was $24 million, which was an increase of $1 million over the previous quarter. This change in our last buy to LIFO reserve did not have a material impact on gross margin for the quarter. 
Accounts payable of $943 million was 47.2% of inventory as compared to 47.9% in the prior year. We continue to work hard at increasing our AP to inventory ratio by improving our inventory productivity and improving terms with vendors. 
The capital expenditures were $94 million for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date CapEx up to $276 million versus $317 million for the comparable period of 2009. For 2010, we expect our CapEx to range from $375 million to $400 million. As discussed in our last conference call, approximately $40 million of CapEx we planned to spend this year will be deferred into the first half of 2010 based on adjustments and timing to a portion of the front-end CSK conversions. 
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $41 million. For 2010, we expect depreciation and amortization to be $160 million to $165 million versus $148 million in 2009. Total borrowings at the end of the quarter were $431 million compared to $704 million at the end of Q3 2009. During the quarter, we elected to permanently retire the FILO tranche to our ABL facility, which lowered our maximum borrowings to $1.075 billion. The $125 million tranche carried an interest rate premium of 125 bps. Even with the elimination of the FILO tranche, we have $674 million of availability at the end of the quarter. 
For 2010, we expect to reduce our total outstanding borrowings by $325 million to $350 million. As noted in our press release on October 1, the legacy CSK convertible notes remain exchangeable and will remain so until the end of the fourth quarter. To date, $11 million of the notes have been surrendered for exchange. To the extent any notes remain outstanding, we continue to intend to call the notes in December. Our plan is to fund this with our existing ABL, which will still allow a significant financial flexibility. 
Now for some other financial information. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was $237 million, an increase of $101 million over the third quarter of 2009. For the year, cash flow from operating activities has increased 105% to $593 million. The improvement was driven by a significant decrease in net inventory investment, higher net income and the timing of payments of other liabilities. 
For the quarter, free cash flow was $143 million versus $50 million in the third quarter of 2009. Year-to-date free cash flow was $316 million versus the use of $28 million in the first nine months of 2009. The improvement was driven by the previously mentioned increase in cash flow from operations and the $41 million decrease in capital expenditures. We now expect free cash flow to be $250 million to $275 million in 2010, and will use any additional free cash flow to further reduce our outstanding debt. 
Stock option expense for the quarter was $3.8 million compared to $3.3 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by the year-over-year increase in our stock price. For 2010, we continue to expect stock option expense to be approximately $15 million versus $13 million in 2009. 
Now to recap our overall guidance. For the third quarter, our comparable store sales guidance is 4% to 6%. For the year, we are raising our comparable store sales guidance to an increase of 7% to 8%. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance for the fourth quarter is from $0.56 to $0.60 on 142.3 million shares. For the year, our EPS guidance is $2.79 to $2.83 per share on 141.4 million shares. On an adjusted basis, excluding the second and third quarter charges, our guidance for the full year EPS on a diluted basis is a range from $2.94 to $2.98. 
At this time, I'd like to ask Carlene, the operator, to come back and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

What we see that you don't see obviously is just the types of products that are being bought for the cars. We do really well on the repair parts, maintenance parts and in many cases, the kind of parts that higher-mileage vehicles take. My observation has been and I think it's the observation of several in our industry is that the cars that had been built over the last 10 or 15 years are generally higher-quality cars than what had been built in the years prior. And because of that, the enhancements that were made by the OEs during that time to make the interiors last longer, make the bodies last longer, just make them more comfortable and presentable to drive at higher mileages, I think that as people have spent some money on maintaining these cars, they'll continue to invest in maintaining them because they're not a car that they don't want to drive. These cars, many of them, can be driven at over 200,000 miles without having major drivetrain issues, engine transmission, differential or transaxle. And because of that, people are willing to maintain the brakes and suspensions and ignition and the drivability components. So I think that what we'll see is that the consumer behavior with regard to trading cars every three or four years or at less than 100,000 miles, that may be long-lasting."

Some of that is going to be a sliding scale on how high or low comps are. As we've talked about previously, especially on the acquired stores, which have a high occupancy cost which is fixed, we have a tremendous amount of opportunity to leverage those sales with existing expenses. When we started the year, we discussed that we thought that per store SG&A would be relatively flat, not down a little bit. Obviously, that was on a lower comp assumption. We have quite a few variable costs that drive our business as we see more customers. But we still have a tremendous amount of fixed costs to leverage. So for the remainder of this year, I would say, Michael, that, that statistic holds true.

And two, we don't feel as confident in the ability to have demand for those products without the support of ongoing large advertising spends and promotional support. So yes, our advertising efforts in the CSK markets are focused around exemplifying our ability to the be a great hard parts supplier at competitive prices, and we've seen much improvement in our hard parts sales in those markets. And we'll continue to do that. And then, of course, to add to that, typically what repair shops and commercial customers buy are these hard parts. So yes, we're doing very well there, but that's our focus. It's to continue taking these stores to a transition of this large portion of non-automotive products over to hard parts. And I feel like we've been successful to this point, but we'll continue to have more success with that as we continue to gain traction and the reputation for being a company that can supply auto parts and hard-to-find parts.

I mean, they had some larger stores that did installer business that had good hard parts inventory but over time, they had just swaps accessory and the oil business for their parts business. And then also the parts, the hard parts, they did have, they weren't competitive. And they didn't have a very good selection of house brand, entry-level product, good, better, best concept. So it all starts with educating the customer because for many, many years, their ads, all their print, everything that the retail customers saw would indicate that they were more of an accessory house, tool, promotional house. And now, we've got to more or less to rebrand the company in the eyes of the hard-core DIY customers, the ones that really buy the hard parts, that we're the place to go for parts now and that we're competitive. Because again, not only did they have very good inventories, what they had, their mindset was that they can be 10%, 15% higher than the competition. So it's all coming along well. Again, it won't happen overnight. They've taken years to build that reputation. It'll take us a while to rebuild the reputation to be a hard parts store."

But of the various steps in the conversion process between implementing the computer systems and putting the hard parts in the store and the planograms and the resets, all of which are at various states, of course, together with the exterior signage, what, in your opinion, drives the greatest incremental benefit once each of those conversion processes are added to the stores?"

That's the business that we're in. And while our systems facilitate making transactions the way we want to make them, making connections, electronic connections, with the commercial customers and sourcing parts, and we feel like our planograms are optimized to do business the way we want to do business retail, and the resets are just something that you have to do in retail to keep your store looking fresh because some of these stores were getting pretty weathered. Clearly, having the parts on the shelf is what makes the most difference. But to Ted's point earlier, from a retail perspective, once you have the reputation and customers form buying habits of going to one of your competitors to get hard parts, that's not an easy thing to break. And we've incrementally improved that as we've owned the company and had better inventories. And we'll continue to put our marketing advertising efforts into exposing that fact to consumers. And I think that's something that gains momentum as customers realize that we're in the hard parts business. But clearly, that's the most impacting factor."

We put inventory out in the stores initially to help the CSK stores that didn't have good access to distribution and that helped some. But now having overnight access and same-day access to many stores to larger inventories is a big help because the average stores has a little over 20,000 SKUs and our DCs would have more like 120,000. And that access makes a big difference in our ability to allow, one, to hire good people and get good people to positions that they can be successful but then also deliver to the commercial customers."

So we're doing everything that we can to make sure that our fourth quarter is strong and that the trend that we're on that we've had coming out of the third quarter continues. But as we've seen, we've been surprised before following Thanksgiving when heavy holiday shopping starts and the limited discretionary cash that the consumers have starts going elsewhere, so we'll just have to see. It's a lot easier for me as it is usual to look back in comps and make comments about how they went as opposed to look forward. But we're hoping for the best but we're trying to plan as reasonable as we can. And to your question about just our resources for the fourth quarter, from an inventory standpoint, we really don't make much of a change there. Our inventories are pretty well set to service the vehicle needs in the areas that they service, and we just don't have that many promotional products that we push out seasonally that make the material impact. Now labor or payroll, we certainly do make adjustments to that based on -- and those adjustments are made weekly based on our staffing system projections that we have out in the stores.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ted Wise, our Chief Operating Officer. David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman is also present. 
I'd like to start off by once again congratulating Tim O'Reilly on the outstanding results. Our performance across all markets in the third quarter was very strong, and we should all be proud of our performance so far this year. Especially impressive is the continued outstanding performance of the core O'Reilly stores. We've asked many of our more-tenured team members to take on the task of attending the CSK conversions and spend the first couple of weeks after conversion training the converted store team members. Even with these distractions, our core stores have continued to gain market share and post very impressive comparable store sales gains. 
At the same time, the work that we've put in to these conversions is clearly bearing fruit, as we continue to gain market share in the converted stores. The strong comparable store sales that we've been able to achieve in the converted stores have been a team effort, and every Team O'Reilly member should be very proud of the success we are having with these conversions. Our outstanding sales performance is the direct result of the incredible customer service levels we provide at each of our locations, and I want to thank you for your commitment to providing the best customer service in our industry and to the continued success of our company. 
Before moving onto the discussion of our operational performance during the quarter, I want to comment on the $5.9 million reserve we accrued in the third quarter to fund the settlement of the legacy CSK Department of Justice issue. As discussed during our second quarter earnings release, this investigation is related to the alleged wrongdoing at CSK Auto in 2006 and prior. As most of you know, we did not purchase the company until July of 2008. Part of our due diligence process prior to this purchase was, of course, evaluating the exposure the company could have related to the alleged issues. After extensive work, we reached the conclusion that the actions of the Department of Justice and the Securities Exchange Commission would most likely stop short of penalizing or charging CSK based on the level of cooperation with the SEC and the DOJ, the merits of our acquisition, prior actions by the SEC and DOJ, our track record of solid management, SOX compliance, along with many other factors. 
As expected, in March of 2009, the SEC determined to close the matter with respect to CSK without fine or penalty. With respect to the DOJ investigation, O'Reilly has continued to cooperate with and engage in discussions with the DOJ to resolve CSK's legacy accounting issues, and we have now reached an agreement in principal with the DOJ. Subject to final documentation, the DOJ, CSK and O'Reilly will enter into an Non-Prosecution Agreement and the company will pay a one-time monetary penalty in the amount of $20.9 million. As you may recall, we reserved $15 million for this matter during our second quarter this year and the additional $5.9 million reserve that we made this past quarter will resolve the matter. 
Now on to our quarterly performance. We're very pleased with our performance during the third quarter. Business remains strong coming out of the second quarter and was steady at a solid rate throughout the quarter. These solid trends exist in pretty much all our markets across the U.S. and yielded a strong comparable store sales increase of 11.1% for the quarter on top of the 5.3% increase we had last year. 
Our continued strong comp performance can be attributed to several factors, but the key contributor is very solid execution across all our markets. Our store operations and distribution teams are very simply doing an outstanding job providing incredibly high levels of customer service. This, coupled with the ongoing effort we make in all stores to carry the right product assortment at competitive prices, as well as the investments that we've made in our Western distribution capability, has put us in a good position. 
At the same time, our industry clearly continues to benefit from the tailwinds that have been present for some time now. The average age of vehicles driven in the U.S. continues to increase as new vehicle sales have stalled, fuel prices have been relatively steady for some time now and miles driven are back to solid incremental increases, and to a lesser degree, the dealership closures have redirected some of the service work that was being performed at the dealers to aftermarket shops. 
In the third quarter, all the factors I've mentioned, both internal and external, coupled with favorable summer weather conditions, culminated into a very good sales environment for our company. We're very pleased with our comparable store sales performance on both sides of our business, in DIY and Commercial. Yet, as has been the case for some time now, our commercial sales continue to grow faster than our DIY sales as we have enhanced our capabilities in the historic CSK markets. 
To this point in the fourth quarter, we're very pleased with our sales performance. However, fourth quarter is always a difficult quarter to forecast comparable store sales. As when it rolls in, sales can be lumpy from week to week and with unemployment still over 9%, I think it's reasonable to anticipate some slowdown in our business over the holiday season as consumers use their limited discretionary income for holiday activities. 
With this in mind, we're going to leave our comparable store sales forecast at 4% to 6% for the quarter, which would lead us to completing a full year with comps in the range of 7% to 8%. Adjusting for the nonrecurring $5.9 million expense item I mentioned, we generated a 14.4% operating margin for the quarter. This is an all-time high quarterly operating margin for our company since going public in 1993, beating the record we set in second quarter of this year by 20 basis points. 
The increased level of profitability is the direct result of the commitment all our team members have made to the profitability of our company through diligent management of our gross margin and relentless expense control while continuing to robustly grow market share. We're very pleased with our efforts on all fronts to grow our profits as we incrementally work to complete the integration of CSK. 
We're now on our 28th month of the CSK integration work that began with the acquisition in July of 2008, and I'm very pleased to announce that we're right on schedule with the plan we put in place directly following the acquisition. We've now completed the distribution expansion in the western half of the country with O'Reilly distribution centers now operating in Seattle, Marino Valley, California, Denver, Salt Lake City and Stockton, California. 
Stockton was our most recent opening, and our team has simply done an excellent job at moving our operations from Dixon, California to a larger facility in Stockton and in completing the system conversions of the 274 stores that are supplied by the new distribution center. We're now in the process of closing down the facility in Dixon but still has some duplicate inventory to work through, and we'll do so over the next few months. This duplicate inventory is one of the contributors to the inventory growth we had in the third quarter. 
The final leg of the distribution and system conversions will be completed on November 7 with the system conversion of the Phoenix distribution center and simultaneous conversion of the 151 stores that are supplied by that distribution center. On that date, all our stores and DCs will be operating on the same systems and will be able to retire the legacy CSK systems that are being used in the unconverted stores. 
We'll also be able to focus more of our efforts on execution of our business strategy in all of the converted stores, which will lead to continued success in gaining back the DIY auto parts market share these stores have sacrificed over the years and the growth of our commercial programs. 
With respect to the Phoenix DC conversion, I want to reassure everyone that we're very confident in our ability to perform a single weekend conversion of this size. We've done it before and have been doing conversions most weekends at a rate of 20 to 40 stores for some time now. In 1998, we converted all of the 180 high/low stores we purchased in Texas and Louisiana in one night. And in April 2009, we converted the CSK Detroit DC and 79 supported stores in one night. Both of these conversions were accomplished without service disruptions to the stores, as we have a lot of experience with these types of system conversions. 
Following completion of the system conversions, we'll finish the last leg of the integration by completing the remaining store resets, renovation work and rebranding. Ted will be reviewing this in detail in a moment, but I just want to re-emphasize that we're on schedule with our plan and are very satisfied with the performance of our converted stores and new distribution centers. 
A lot has changed in a relatively short period of time for our team members in the acquired stores, and we're very proud of the jobs our teams in both converted and unconverted stores have done adapting our cultural values and our dual-market strategy. Generally speaking, and as I've expressed through the integration, we're very enthused about what the future holds for our company. We very simply have a huge opportunity to expand our ability to execute our dual-market strategy in many new markets, and we now have ourselves in a position to do that. 
At the same time, we have several initiatives underway to improve our operations, profitability and market penetration in all markets. Things like the implementation of retail price optimization software, enhanced e-commerce capabilities, incremental improvements to our inventory management systems and enhancements to our point-of-sale system content, just to name a few of the initiatives that we currently have underway. 
We also feel that the industry tailwind we've had for some time now could be long-lasting as consumers permanently change their behavior and gain comfort with driving low maintained vehicles at higher mileages. Again, congratulations to all of Team O'Reilly on the outstanding third quarter results. I'll now turn the call over to Ted Wise."

To start, I would also like to thank our nearly 49,000 O'Reilly team members for the absolutely outstanding results in our third quarter. 
Without question, the general conditions for the auto parts business have been good. However, for our team to produce 11% comps defines the superior level of service we're giving our customers and the market share gains we're experiencing across the core O'Reilly stores, as well as our new conversions stores out west. Also, our 14.4% operating margin last quarter demonstrates our team's ability to effectively manage both our expenses and gross profit. 
Most amazing, these results paralleled the work of various projects involving the CSK O'Reilly store conversions and installations of our new distribution centers. We are proud of our teams above and beyond commitment to take care of our normal business while managing the integration of CSK into our company. We are anxiously looking forward to next year when we have the many tasks of the conversion behind us. All the support in place on the West Coast and our entire team can be 100% focused on growing our sales. 
Before commenting on our progress and the conversion work on the West Coast, I will quickly summarize our new store expansion for the third quarter. We ended the quarter with 3,511 stores, a net gain of 44 new stores. This brings us up to 115 stores year-to-date and on schedule to end the year at 150 new stores. Again, an incredible accomplishment for our store expansion and installation team members considering the additional workload involving the West Coast conversion and reset work that we'll outline in a minute. Also, we performed 11 major store renovations and relocated four stores into new locations. 
In regard to our area of expansion, the stores were in 15 different states. Wisconsin and Ohio had seven stores each. Texas and Indiana received six stores, and Michigan and North Carolina had four stores each. The remaining stores were spread out primarily in the South and Southeast states. 
As I mentioned, our installation schedule calls for another 35 stores in the fourth quarter for a net 150 new stores in 2010. Our new store expansion plan for 2011 will be 170 new stores. Considering the amount of conversion and reset work on the West Coast that will spill over into the first part of next year, we will have a very busy and productive year ahead of us. Our real estate team continues to evaluate the conversion store leases and develop the stay and relocation strategy for our store group out West. 
We'll also start a more aggressive new store growth plan in the west now that the new distribution centers are open and the stores are operating under the O'Reilly system and brand. Now to overview our conversion progress for last quarter. 
In the second week of September, we officially opened our new 520,000-square foot distribution center in Stockton, California. As Greg mentioned, it was actually a move from the smaller CSK distribution center in Dixon, California. This allowed us to start the computer conversions for the 274 Kragen stores, primarily in the surrounding markets at a rate of approximately 40 stores per week. 
In addition to receiving new store computers and POS systems, the stores began nightly stock replenishment and daily access to the additional DC inventory coverage. To date, this was not only the largest distribution center we opened but also the largest group of stores to convert. We are now finished with the project and in the process of shutting down the old Dixon DC and redistributing the inventory to our surrounding distribution centers. 
The last phase of the distribution and store conversions will take place on November 7, when we convert the existing CSK Phoenix DC over to O'Reilly warehouse system and convert the 151 surrounding stores to O'Reilly systems. Unlike the other conversions, as Greg mentioned, all 151 stores will convert over the same week and time. This allows us to be totally off with the CSK computer systems by end of the year and start all distribution centers and stores under one reporting system in 2011. 
The installation of five new distribution centers, conversion of two CSK distribution centers to O'Reilly systems, the conversions to nightly replenishment and installation of new store systems in all 1,299 CSK stores, will have been completed in approximately two and a half years. This is an outstanding accomplishment that has involved a great deal of planning and execution across all areas of our company. 
We're also making good progress on the store resets. And now that the stores are finished with computer conversions, more stores will be available to put it on the reset schedule. We have completed almost all of the individual store layout plans and have the new plans into the city for permits. We completed resets for over 130 stores last quarter, and we'll do an additional 190 stores in the fourth quarter. Our goal is to finish the store resets by the end of the first quarter next year, the exception being a small group of resolution stores and some that may still be pending permitting issues. 
Immediately following the story resets to the O'Reilly floor plans, the interior decor package and necessary remodel work follows. Our plan calls for all interior decor and related work to be finished following the resets in the first half of next year. 
In regards to the actual backroom merchandise changeovers and the new retail planograms, this work has been ongoing independently of the physical reset. The backroom hard parts changeovers were completed by midyear and we are 80% completed without front-line changeovers, with the balance to be scheduled in November, December and January. At that time, the stores will have the O'Reilly product mix, both hard parts and new retail planograms, even though a small group of stores will still have the old CSK store layout. 
Our co-branding advertising plan for CSK and O'Reilly Brand has been going on for almost two years and has paved the way for changing the exterior signs. This task is well underway and so far, we have completed signed conversions to O'Reilly Brand in approximately half of our stores. An additional 180 stores will be installed as soon as the signs are received by the installing sign company. And the balance of the sign, surveys for the stores will have been completed, bids sent out to sign companies and plans into the city, we expect to have the rebranding completed by the end of first quarter. 
Again, there may be a small number of resolution stores and perhaps a group of stores that still has permitting issues that will go into the second quarter. Following the sign conversions, we are evaluating the rest of our exterior store in regard to paint and other image upgrades that may be needed, and the appropriate work will be scheduled as soon as possible. 
To summarize the store conversion task and projected completion schedule, all computer systems and nightly replenishment will be finished by the end of this year. All inventory hard parts upgrades were finished this year. All out-front planograms finished by this coming January. Store resets finished in the first quarter. O'Reilly sign change-outs finished in the first quarter, and the interior decor and exterior work completed in the second quarter of next year. 
Our store operations and sales teams are developing well as they become more familiar with the O'Reilly product lines, computer system and all the aspects of our dual-marketing plan. Our team members have been very receptive to the conversion tasks, the introduction of the new POS system, the new store operational procedures and the physical resets going on in the stores. 
Most importantly, we are seeing a good sales improvement as we transition the stores traffic from a more pure oil and accessory sales mix to include more hard parts to both the retail and professional installer customer. Improved store inventories and the access to additional inventory coverage at the hub and distribution center has and is playing a key role in growing our retail and installer business. Market-driven pricing is also helping us gain new customers as the customers realize that we are more competitive now. 
An important goal of our print and radio advertising has been to build the O'Reilly image of having better parts coverage at everyday low prices. The better inventory and better pricing has gained momentum as the stores are reset to the O'Reilly format and O'Reilly exterior signs go up. 
On the professional sales side, we are very focused on building strong and experienced teams at the stores that will result in higher service levels. As stores convert to O'Reilly systems, we are opening up more stores to delivery and implementing First Call installer counters to better service the professional customer. We're expanding our territory sales management team, making more sales calls and developing stronger customer relationships with a wider group of both large and small customers. 
As we now transition from the CSK to O'Reilly Brand and along with the improved inventory market-driven pricing and higher service levels in the stores, we feel our relationship and business with the professional customer will continue to grow for years to come. 
The O'Reilly culture is growing stronger everyday in our new stores on the West Coast. Our team members are very happy to have the conversions and the inventory changes behind them and moving forward so rapidly with the interior resets and exterior sign changes. They are excited to be fully integrated in the O'Reilly systems and procedures and looking forward to continue building our business. The core O'Reilly managers and team members that have spent time helping with the conversions and training at these stores have done a great job in expanding our O'Reilly culture as well as training in the O'Reilly procedures. 
We are now operating as one team moving forward. With this, I'll turn the call back over to Tom."
324289,114043006,82883,"O'Reilly Automotive Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ted. Now we'll move on to the numbers. For the quarter, sales increased $168 million, 13% over the prior year, to $1.43 billion. The increase was attributable to $136 million increase in comp store sales, a $30 million increase in non-comp store s",1415,"Thanks, Ted. Now we'll move on to the numbers. For the quarter, sales increased $168 million, 13% over the prior year, to $1.43 billion. The increase was attributable to $136 million increase in comp store sales, a $30 million increase in non-comp store sales and a $2 million increase in non-comp non-store sales. 
For the quarter, ticket average and ticket count contributed equally to our comparable store sales increase. The increase in ticket average continues to be driven mainly by mix and sales of hard parts, which typically carry a higher ticket, accounted for a larger portion of the overall sales volume. For 2010, we're increasing our total revenue guidance to a range of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion. 
Gross profit was 48.6% of sales for the quarter versus 48.5% in the prior year. The 10 basis point improvement was driven by improved acquisition costs and improved shrink at the converted stores. These improvements were, in part, offset by deleverage on the distribution cost, which is a result of the new DCs coming online and consistent with our expectations. 
Year-to-date gross profit stands at 48.6% of sales. And for the full fiscal year, we expect gross profit to be approximately 48.5% of sales. SG&A for the quarter was 34.3% of sales versus 36.7% in the prior year. The leverage on SG&A was the direct result of strong comparable store sales. On a per-store basis, SG&A per store is up 2.6%, which allowed for strong leverage on 11.1% increase in comp store sales. Year-to-date, SG&A improved 200 basis points as a result of strong sales and expense control. For the full year, we expect SG&A dollars per store to be up slightly from 2009 as we continue to see opportunities to more aggressively invest and for SG&A to drive strong sales results. We anticipate that total SG&A for 2010 will increase approximately 5% to 5.5% over the prior year. 
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter, which excludes the impact of the legacy CSK DOJ matter discussed by Greg earlier, was extremely strong at 14.4% of sales, an improvement of 250 basis points over the prior year. This large improvement was the result of strong comp sales and tight expense control and represents a record quarterly operating margin. For the full year, we expect our adjusted operating margin to come in at 13% to 13.5% of sales. 
Net interest expense for the quarter was $10 million, which is better than prior year by $1 million due to lower borrowings, offset in part by higher rates as a result of our outstanding interest rate swaps. For 2010, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $40 million. 
The tax provision for the quarter and year-to-date was 38.7% and 39.7% of pretax income, respectively. The tax rate was negatively impacted by the charge related to the legacy CSK DOJ matter, which we currently do not anticipate to be tax-deductible. Excluding this one-time charge, the quarterly rate was 37.6%, and the year-to-date rate was 38.2% of pretax income, which were both flat to the prior year. 
For 2010, we expect our tax rate as a percent of pretax income to be approximately 39.5%. Included in this estimate is the 120 basis point one-time increase related to the non-tax-deductible reserve to settle the legacy CSK DOJ issue. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.86 per share, which represents an increase of 37% over the third quarter of 2009. For the year, adjusted EPS of $2.37 increased 39% over the prior year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. The average inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $565,000, which represents a 4% increase over the prior year average of $543,000. This increase is the result of our continuing effort to add hard parts coverage to the stores and duplicative inventory as new DCs come online. Since the beginning of the year, we've added 115 net new stores, four new DCs with one that closed when we relocated to the Stockton DC. As a result, our total inventories increased $85 million. We remain focused on refining the inventory mix at the CSK stores and leveraging the new DCs to reduce the stacking debt at the western stores. We expect our total inventory levels will not increase significantly through the end of the year despite adding approximately 35 new stores in the fourth quarter. 
Our reserve for LIFO at the end of the quarter was $24 million, which was an increase of $1 million over the previous quarter. This change in our last buy to LIFO reserve did not have a material impact on gross margin for the quarter. 
Accounts payable of $943 million was 47.2% of inventory as compared to 47.9% in the prior year. We continue to work hard at increasing our AP to inventory ratio by improving our inventory productivity and improving terms with vendors. 
The capital expenditures were $94 million for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date CapEx up to $276 million versus $317 million for the comparable period of 2009. For 2010, we expect our CapEx to range from $375 million to $400 million. As discussed in our last conference call, approximately $40 million of CapEx we planned to spend this year will be deferred into the first half of 2010 based on adjustments and timing to a portion of the front-end CSK conversions. 
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $41 million. For 2010, we expect depreciation and amortization to be $160 million to $165 million versus $148 million in 2009. Total borrowings at the end of the quarter were $431 million compared to $704 million at the end of Q3 2009. During the quarter, we elected to permanently retire the FILO tranche to our ABL facility, which lowered our maximum borrowings to $1.075 billion. The $125 million tranche carried an interest rate premium of 125 bps. Even with the elimination of the FILO tranche, we have $674 million of availability at the end of the quarter. 
For 2010, we expect to reduce our total outstanding borrowings by $325 million to $350 million. As noted in our press release on October 1, the legacy CSK convertible notes remain exchangeable and will remain so until the end of the fourth quarter. To date, $11 million of the notes have been surrendered for exchange. To the extent any notes remain outstanding, we continue to intend to call the notes in December. Our plan is to fund this with our existing ABL, which will still allow a significant financial flexibility. 
Now for some other financial information. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was $237 million, an increase of $101 million over the third quarter of 2009. For the year, cash flow from operating activities has increased 105% to $593 million. The improvement was driven by a significant decrease in net inventory investment, higher net income and the timing of payments of other liabilities. 
For the quarter, free cash flow was $143 million versus $50 million in the third quarter of 2009. Year-to-date free cash flow was $316 million versus the use of $28 million in the first nine months of 2009. The improvement was driven by the previously mentioned increase in cash flow from operations and the $41 million decrease in capital expenditures. We now expect free cash flow to be $250 million to $275 million in 2010, and will use any additional free cash flow to further reduce our outstanding debt. 
Stock option expense for the quarter was $3.8 million compared to $3.3 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by the year-over-year increase in our stock price. For 2010, we continue to expect stock option expense to be approximately $15 million versus $13 million in 2009. 
Now to recap our overall guidance. For the third quarter, our comparable store sales guidance is 4% to 6%. For the year, we are raising our comparable store sales guidance to an increase of 7% to 8%. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance for the fourth quarter is from $0.56 to $0.60 on 142.3 million shares. For the year, our EPS guidance is $2.79 to $2.83 per share on 141.4 million shares. On an adjusted basis, excluding the second and third quarter charges, our guidance for the full year EPS on a diluted basis is a range from $2.94 to $2.98.

What we see that you don't see obviously is just the types of products that are being bought for the cars. We do really well on the repair parts, maintenance parts and in many cases, the kind of parts that higher-mileage vehicles take. My observation has been and I think it's the observation of several in our industry is that the cars that had been built over the last 10 or 15 years are generally higher-quality cars than what had been built in the years prior. And because of that, the enhancements that were made by the OEs during that time to make the interiors last longer, make the bodies last longer, just make them more comfortable and presentable to drive at higher mileages, I think that as people have spent some money on maintaining these cars, they'll continue to invest in maintaining them because they're not a car that they don't want to drive. These cars, many of them, can be driven at over 200,000 miles without having major drivetrain issues, engine transmission, differential or transaxle. And because of that, people are willing to maintain the brakes and suspensions and ignition and the drivability components. So I think that what we'll see is that the consumer behavior with regard to trading cars every three or four years or at less than 100,000 miles, that may be long-lasting."

We've been managing transactions with our installer customers for years. Before the Internet was prevalent and mainstream, we did transactions with our installers via green screen terminals that we would set up. And over time, we've enhanced that to Internet-based and now we have systems integrated into the systems that they use that allow Internet-based transactions. Our efforts, both on that front and on retail front, are to improve the content that's available to customers so they can see more about our products, see more about the availability of products, maybe schedule better the amount of time it's going to take for them to get our products on the commercial side. And really just the things that you see some of the best e-commerce retailer's doing. Like I said earlier, some of the work that we've been doing on CSK has probably had us a little bit distracted from focusing on some of those things over the past two and a half, three years, and we've kind of gotten back to focusing on some of these fundamental things that we feel are opportunities for us. But most of them revolve around content and integration into systems that we want to improve."

One of the things we talked about early on when we acquired CSK is that it appeared to us that they have given up some of the core auto parts, hard parts business, that had been, it's kind of the foundation for all of our operations. And they've given that up and kind of exchanged it for some of the import, non-automotive accessory-type products that we've really not dabbled in, one, because we just have always done well in auto parts and put our focus on auto parts. And two, we don't feel as confident in the ability to have demand for those products without the support of ongoing large advertising spends and promotional support. So yes, our advertising efforts in the CSK markets are focused around exemplifying our ability to the be a great hard parts supplier at competitive prices, and we've seen much improvement in our hard parts sales in those markets. And we'll continue to do that. And then, of course, to add to that, typically what repair shops and commercial customers buy are these hard parts. So yes, we're doing very well there, but that's our focus. It's to continue taking these stores to a transition of this large portion of non-automotive products over to hard parts. And I feel like we've been successful to this point, but we'll continue to have more success with that as we continue to gain traction and the reputation for being a company that can supply auto parts and hard-to-find parts.

Generally speaking, their backroom inventory was very, very poor on the majority of the stores. I mean, they had some larger stores that did installer business that had good hard parts inventory but over time, they had just swaps accessory and the oil business for their parts business. And then also the parts, the hard parts, they did have, they weren't competitive. And they didn't have a very good selection of house brand, entry-level product, good, better, best concept. So it all starts with educating the customer because for many, many years, their ads, all their print, everything that the retail customers saw would indicate that they were more of an accessory house, tool, promotional house. And now, we've got to more or less to rebrand the company in the eyes of the hard-core DIY customers, the ones that really buy the hard parts, that we're the place to go for parts now and that we're competitive. Because again, not only did they have very good inventories, what they had, their mindset was that they can be 10%, 15% higher than the competition. So it's all coming along well. Again, it won't happen overnight. They've taken years to build that reputation. It'll take us a while to rebuild the reputation to be a hard parts store."

Clearly, having the parts on the shelf is what makes the most difference. But to Ted's point earlier, from a retail perspective, once you have the reputation and customers form buying habits of going to one of your competitors to get hard parts, that's not an easy thing to break. And we've incrementally improved that as we've owned the company and had better inventories. And we'll continue to put our marketing advertising efforts into exposing that fact to consumers. And I think that's something that gains momentum as customers realize that we're in the hard parts business. But clearly, that's the most impacting factor."

So we're doing everything that we can to make sure that our fourth quarter is strong and that the trend that we're on that we've had coming out of the third quarter continues. But as we've seen, we've been surprised before following Thanksgiving when heavy holiday shopping starts and the limited discretionary cash that the consumers have starts going elsewhere, so we'll just have to see. It's a lot easier for me as it is usual to look back in comps and make comments about how they went as opposed to look forward. But we're hoping for the best but we're trying to plan as reasonable as we can. And to your question about just our resources for the fourth quarter, from an inventory standpoint, we really don't make much of a change there. Our inventories are pretty well set to service the vehicle needs in the areas that they service, and we just don't have that many promotional products that we push out seasonally that make the material impact. Now labor or payroll, we certainly do make adjustments to that based on -- and those adjustments are made weekly based on our staffing system projections that we have out in the stores.

Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ted Wise, our Chief Operating Officer. David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman is also present. 
I'd like to start off by once again congratulating team O'Reilly on the outstanding results. Our performance across all markets in the third quarter was very strong, and we should all be proud of our performance so far this year. Especially impressive is the continued outstanding performance of the core O'Reilly stores. We've asked many of our more tenured team members to take on the task of attending the CSK conversions and spend the first couple of weeks after conversion training the converted store team members. Even with these distractions, our core stores have continued to gain market share and post very impressive comparable store sales gains. 
At the same time, the work that we've put in to these conversions is clearly bearing fruit, as we continue to gain market share in the converted stores. The strong comparable store sales that we've been able to achieve in the converted stores have been a team effort, and every Team O'Reilly member should be very proud of the success we are having with these conversions. Our outstanding sales performance is the direct result of the incredible customer service levels we provide at each of our locations, and I want to thank you for your commitment to providing the best customer service in our industry and to the continued success of our company. 
Before moving onto the discussion of our operational performance during the quarter, I want to comment on the $5.9 million reserve we accrued in the third quarter to fund settlement of the legacy CSK Department of Justice issue. As discussed during our second quarter earnings release, this investigation is related to the alleged wrongdoing at CSK Auto in 2006 and prior. As most of you know, we did not purchase the company until July of 2008. Part of our due diligence process prior to this purchase was of course evaluating the exposure the company could have related to the alleged issues. After extensive work, we reached the conclusion that the actions of the Department of Justice and the Securities Exchange Commission would most likely stop short of penalizing or charging CSK based on the level of cooperation with the SEC and the DOJ, the merits of our acquisition, prior actions by the SEC and DOJ, our track record of solid management, SOX compliance, along with many other factors. 
As expected, in March of 2009, the SEC determined to close the matter with respect to CSK without fine or penalty. With respect to the DOJ investigation, O'Reilly has continued to cooperate with and engage in discussions with the DOJ to resolve CSK's legacy accounting issues, and we have now reached an agreement in principal with the DOJ. Subject to final documentation, the DOJ, CSK and O'Reilly will enter into a Non-Prosecution Agreement and the company will pay a one-time monetary penalty in the amount of $20.9 million. As you may recall, we reserved $15 million for this matter during our second quarter this year and the additional $5.9 million reserve that we made this past quarter will resolve the matter. 
Now onto our quarterly performance. We're very pleased with our performance during the third quarter. Business remains strong coming out of the second quarter and was steady at a solid rate throughout the quarter. These solid trends exist in pretty much all our markets across the U.S. and yielded a strong comparable store sales increase of 11.1% for the quarter on top of the 5.3% increase we had last year. 
Our continued strong comp performance can be attributed to several factors, but the key contributor is very solid execution across all our markets. Our store operations and distribution teams are very simply doing an outstanding job providing incredibly high levels of customer service. This, coupled with the ongoing effort we make in all stores to carry the right product assortment at competitive prices, as well as the investments that we've made in our Western distribution capability, has put us in a good position. 
At the same time, our industry clearly continues to benefit from the tailwinds that have been present for some time now. The average age of vehicles driven in the U.S. continues to increase as new vehicle sales have stalled, fuel prices have been relatively steady for some time now and miles driven are back to solid incremental increases, and to a lesser degree, the dealership closures have redirected some of the service work that was being performed at the dealers to aftermarket shops. 
In the third quarter, all the factors I've mentioned, both internal and external, coupled with favorable summer weather conditions, culminated into a very good sales environment for our company. We're very pleased with our comparable store sales performance on both sides of our business, in DIY and Commercial. Yet, as has been the case for some time now, our commercial sales continue to grow faster than our DIY sales as we have enhanced our capabilities in the historic CSK markets. 
To this point in the fourth quarter, we're very pleased with our sales performance. However, fourth quarter is always a difficult quarter to forecast comparable store sales. As winter rolls in, sales can be lumpy from week to week and with unemployment still over 9%, I think it's reasonable to anticipate some slowdown in our business over the holiday season as consumers use their limited discretionary income for holiday activities. 
With this in mind, we're going to leave our comparable store sales forecast at 4% to 6% for the quarter, which would lead us to completing the full year with comps in the range of 7% to 8%. Adjusting for the nonrecurring $5.9 million expense item I mentioned, we generated a 14.4% operating margin for the quarter. This is an all-time high quarterly operating margin for our company since going public in 1993, beating the record we set in second quarter of this year by 20 basis points. 
The increased level of profitability is the direct result of the commitment all our team members have made to the profitability of our company through diligent management of our gross margin and relentless expense control while continuing to robustly grow market share. We're very pleased with our efforts on all fronts to grow our profits as we incrementally work to complete the integration of CSK. 
We're now on our 28th month of the CSK integration work that began with the acquisition in July of 2008, and I'm very pleased to announce that we're right on schedule with the plan we put in place directly following the acquisition. We've now completed the distribution expansion in the western half of the country with O'Reilly distribution centers now operating in Seattle, Marino Valley, California, Denver, Salt Lake City and Stockton, California. 
Stockton was our most recent opening, and our team has simply done an excellent job at moving our operations from Dixon, California to a larger facility in Stockton and in completing the system conversions of the 274 stores that are supplied by the new distribution center. We're now in the process of closing down the facility in Dixon but still have some duplicate inventory to work through, and we'll do so over the next few months. This duplicate inventory is one of the contributors to the inventory growth we had in the third quarter. 
The final leg of the distribution and system conversions will be completed on November 7 with the system conversion of the Phoenix distribution center and simultaneous conversion of the 151 stores that are supplied by that distribution center. On that date, all our stores and DCs will be operating on the same systems and will be able to retire the legacy CSK systems that are being used in the unconverted stores. 
We'll also be able to focus more of our efforts on execution of our business strategy in all the converted stores, which will lead to continued success in gaining back the DIY auto parts market share these stores have sacrificed over the years and the growth of our commercial programs. 
With respect to the Phoenix DC conversion, I want to reassure everyone that we're very confident in our ability to perform a single weekend conversion of this size. We've done it before and have been doing conversions most weekends at a rate of 20 to 40 stores for some time now. In 1998, we converted all of the 180 Hi-Lo stores we purchased in Texas and Louisiana in one night. And in April 2009, we converted the CSK Detroit DC and 79 supported stores in one night. Both of these conversions were accomplished without service disruptions to the stores, as we have a lot of experience with these types of system conversions. 
Following completion of the system conversions, we'll finish the last leg of the integration by completing the remaining store resets, renovation work and rebranding. Ted will be reviewing this in detail in a moment, but I just want to re-emphasize that we're on schedule with our plan and are very satisfied with the performance of our converted stores and new distribution centers. 
A lot has changed in a relatively short period of time for our team members in the acquired stores, and we're very proud of the jobs our teams in both converted and unconverted stores have done adapting our cultural values and our dual-market strategy. Generally speaking, and as I've expressed through the integration, we're very enthused about what the future holds for our company. We very simply have a huge opportunity to expand our ability to execute our dual-market strategy in many new markets, and we now have ourselves in a position to do that. 
At the same time, we have several initiatives underway to improve our operations, profitability and market penetration in all markets. Things like the implementation of retail price optimization software, enhanced e-commerce capabilities, incremental improvements to our inventory management systems and enhancements to our point-of-sale system content, just to name a few of the initiatives that we currently have underway. 
We also feel that the industry tailwind we've had for some time now could be long-lasting as consumers permanently change their behavior and gain comfort with driving low maintained vehicles at higher mileages. Again, congratulations to all of Team O'Reilly on the outstanding third quarter results. I'll now turn the call over to Ted Wise."

To start, I would also like to thank our nearly 49,000 O'Reilly team members for the absolutely outstanding results in our third quarter. 
Without question, the general conditions for the auto parts business have been good. However, for our team to produce 11% comps defines the superior level of service we're giving our customers and the market share gain we're experiencing across the core O'Reilly stores, as well as our new conversions stores out west. Also, our 14.4% operating margin last quarter demonstrates our team's ability to effectively manage both our expenses and gross profit. 
Most amazing, these results parallel the work of various projects involving the CSK O'Reilly store conversions and installations of our new distribution centers. We are proud of our teams above and beyond commitment to take care of our normal business while managing the integration of CSK into our company. We are anxiously looking forward to next year when we have the many tasks of the conversion behind us, all the support in place on the West Coast and our entire team can be 100% focused on growing our sales. 
Before commenting on our progress and the conversion work on the West Coast, I will quickly summarize our new store expansion for the third quarter. We ended the quarter with 3,511 stores, a net gain of 44 new stores. This brings us up to 115 stores year-to-date and on schedule to end the year at 150 new stores. Again, an incredible accomplishment for our store expansion and installation team members considering the additional workload involving the West Coast conversion and reset work that we'll outline in a minute. Also, we performed 11 major store renovations and relocated four stores into new locations. 
In regard to our area of expansion, the stores were in 15 different states. Wisconsin and Ohio had seven stores each. Texas and Indiana received six stores, and Michigan and North Carolina had four stores each. The remaining stores were spread out primarily in the South and Southeast states. 
As I mentioned, our installation schedule calls for another 35 stores in the fourth quarter for a net 150 new stores in 2010. Our new store expansion plan for 2011 will be 170 new stores. Considering the amount of conversion and reset work on the West Coast that will spill over into the first part of next year, we will have a very busy and productive year ahead of us. Our real estate team continues to evaluate the conversion store leases and develop the stay and relocation strategy for our store group out West. 
We'll also start a more aggressive new store growth plan in the west now that the new distribution centers are open and the stores are operating under the O'Reilly system and brand. Now to overview our conversion progress for last quarter. 
In the second week of September, we officially opened our new 520,000-square foot distribution center in Stockton, California. As Greg mentioned, it was actually a move from the smaller CSK distribution center in Dixon, California. This allowed us to start the computer conversions for the 274 Kragen stores, primarily in the surrounding markets at a rate of approximately 40 stores per week. 
In addition to receiving new store computers and POS systems, the stores began nightly stock replenishment and daily access to the additional DC inventory coverage. To date, this was not only the largest distribution center we opened but also the largest group of stores to convert. We are now finished with the project and in the process of shutting down the old Dixon DC and redistributing the inventory to our surrounding distribution centers. 
The last phase of the distribution and store conversions will take place on November 7, when we convert the existing CSK Phoenix DC over to O'Reilly warehouse system and convert the 151 surrounding stores to O'Reilly systems. Unlike the other conversions, as Greg mentioned, all 151 stores will convert over the same week and time. This allows us to be totally off of the CSK computer systems by end of the year and start all distribution centers and stores under one reporting system in 2011. 
The installation of five new distribution centers, conversion of two CSK distribution centers to O'Reilly systems, the conversions to nightly replenishment and installation of new store systems in all 1,299 CSK stores, will have been completed in approximately 2.5 years. This is an outstanding accomplishment that has involved a great deal of planning and execution across all areas of our company. 
We're also making good progress on the store resets. And now that the stores are finished with computer conversions, more stores will be available to put on the reset schedule. We have completed almost all of the individual store layout plans and have the new plans into the city for permits. We completed resets for over 130 stores last quarter, and we'll do an additional 190 stores in the fourth quarter. Our goal is to finish the store resets by the end of the first quarter next year, the exception being a small group of resolution stores and some that may still be pending permitting issues. 
Immediately following the store resets to the O'Reilly floor plans, the interior decor package and necessary remodel work follows. Our plan calls for all interior decor and related work to be finished following the resets in the first half of next year. 
In regards to the actual backroom merchandise changeovers and the new retail planograms, this work has been ongoing independently of the physical reset. The backroom hard parts changeovers were completed by midyear and we are 80% completed without front-line changeovers, with the balance to be scheduled in November, December and January. At that time, the stores will have the O'Reilly product mix, both hard parts and new retail planograms, even though a small group of stores will still have the old CSK store layout. 
Our co-branding advertising plan for CSK and O'Reilly Brand has been going on for almost two years and has paved the way for changing the exterior signs. This task is well underway and so far, we have completed signed conversions to the O'Reilly Brand in approximately half of our stores. An additional 180 stores will be installed as soon as the signs are received by the installing sign company. And the balance of the sign, surveys for the stores will have been completed, bids sent out to sign companies and plans into the city, we expect to have the rebranding completed by the end of first quarter. 
Again, there may be a small number of resolution stores and perhaps a group of stores that still has permitting issues that will go into the second quarter. Following the sign conversions, we are evaluating the rest of our exterior store in regard to paint and other image upgrades that may be needed, and the appropriate work will be scheduled as soon as possible. 
To summarize the store conversion task and projected completion schedule, all computer systems and nightly replenishment will be finished by the end of this year. All inventory hard parts upgrades were finished this year. All out-front planograms finished by this coming January. Store resets finished in the first quarter. O'Reilly sign change-outs finished in the first quarter, and the interior decor and exterior work completed in the second quarter of next year. 
Our store operations and sales teams are developing well as they become more familiar with the O'Reilly product lines, computer system and all the aspects of our dual-marketing plan. Our team members have been very receptive to the conversion tasks, the introduction of the new POS system, the new store operational procedures and the physical resets going on in the stores. 
Most importantly, we are seeing a good sales improvement as we transition the store’s traffic from a more pure oil and accessory sales mix to include more hard parts to both the retail and professional installer customer. Improved store inventories and the access to additional inventory coverage at the hub and distribution center has and is playing a key role in growing our retail and installer business. Market-driven pricing is also helping us gain new customers as the customers realize that we are competitive now. 
An important goal of our print and radio advertising has been to build the O'Reilly image of having better parts coverage at everyday low prices. The better inventory and better pricing has gained momentum as the stores are reset to the O'Reilly format and O'Reilly exterior signs go up. 
On the professional sales side, we are very focused on building strong and experienced teams at the stores that will result in higher service levels. As stores convert to O'Reilly systems, we are opening up more stores to delivery and implementing First Call installer service counters to better service the professional customer. We're expanding our territory sales management team, making more sales calls and developing stronger customer relationships with a wider group of both large and small customers. 
As we now transition from the CSK to O'Reilly Brand and along with the improved inventory market-driven pricing and higher service levels in the stores, we feel our relationship and business with the professional customer will continue to grow for years to come. 
The O'Reilly culture is growing stronger every day in our new stores on the West Coast. Our team members are very happy to have the conversions and the inventory changes behind them and moving forward so rapidly with the interior resets and exterior sign changes. They are excited to be fully integrated in the O'Reilly systems and procedures and looking forward to continue building our business. The core O'Reilly managers and team members that have spent time helping with the conversions and training at these stores have done a great job in expanding our O'Reilly culture as well as training in the O'Reilly procedures. 
We are now operating as one team moving forward. With this, I'll turn the call back over to Tom."
324289,114043006,82931,"O'Reilly Automotive Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ted. Now we'll move on to the numbers. For the quarter, sales increased $168 million, 13% over the prior year, to $1.43 billion. The increase was attributable to $136 million increase in comp store sales, a $30 million increase in non-comp store s",1415,"Thanks, Ted. Now we'll move on to the numbers. For the quarter, sales increased $168 million, 13% over the prior year, to $1.43 billion. The increase was attributable to $136 million increase in comp store sales, a $30 million increase in non-comp store sales and a $2 million increase in non-comp non-store sales. 
For the quarter, ticket average and ticket count contributed equally to our comparable store sales increase. The increase in ticket average continues to be driven mainly by mix and sales of hard parts, which typically carry a higher ticket, accounted for a larger portion of the overall sales volume. For 2010, we're increasing our total revenue guidance to a range of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion. 
Gross profit was 48.6% of sales for the quarter versus 48.5% in the prior year. The 10 basis point improvement was driven by improved acquisition costs and improved shrink at the converted stores. These improvements were in part offset by deleverage on the distribution cost, which is a result of the new DCs coming online and consistent with our expectations. 
Year-to-date gross profit stands at 48.6% of sales. And for the full fiscal year, we expect gross profit to be approximately 48.5% of sales. SG&A for the quarter was 34.3% of sales versus 36.7% in the prior year. The leverage on SG&A was the direct result of strong comparable store sales. On a per-store basis, SG&A per store is up 2.6%, which allowed for strong leverage on 11.1% increase in comp store sales. Year-to-date, SG&A improved 200 basis points as a result of strong sales and expense control. For the full year, we expect SG&A dollars per store to be up slightly from 2009 as we continue to see opportunities to more aggressively invest and for SG&A to drive strong sales results. We anticipate that total SG&A for 2010 will increase approximately 5% to 5.5% over the prior year. 
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter, which excludes the impact of the legacy CSK DOJ matter discussed by Greg earlier, was extremely strong at 14.4% of sales, an improvement of 250 basis points over the prior year. This large improvement was the result of strong comp sales and tight expense control and represents a record quarterly operating margin. For the full year, we expect our adjusted operating margin to come in at 13% to 13.5% of sales. 
Net interest expense for the quarter was $10 million, which is better than prior year by $1 million due to lower borrowings, offset in part by higher rates as a result of our outstanding interest rate swaps. For 2010, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $40 million. 
The tax provision for the quarter and year-to-date was 38.7% and 39.7% of pretax income, respectively. The tax rate was negatively impacted by the charge related to the legacy CSK DOJ matter, which we currently do not anticipate to be tax-deductible. Excluding this one-time charge, the quarterly rate was 37.6%, and the year-to-date rate was 38.2% of pretax income, which were both flat to the prior year. 
For 2010, we expect our tax rate as a percent of pretax income to be approximately 39.5%. Included in this estimate is the 120 basis point one-time increase related to the non-tax-deductible reserve to settle the legacy CSK DOJ issue. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.86 per share, which represents an increase of 37% over the third quarter of 2009. For the year, adjusted EPS of $2.37 increased 39% over the prior year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. The average inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $565,000, which represents a 4% increase over the prior year average of $543,000. This increase is the result of our continuing effort to add hard parts coverage to the stores and duplicative inventory as new DCs come online. Since the beginning of the year, we've added 100 net new stores, four new DCs with one to close when we relocate to the Stockton DC. As a result, our total inventories increased $85 million. We remain focused on refining the inventory mix at the CSK stores and leveraging the new DCs to reduce the stacking debt at the western stores. We expect our total inventory levels will not increase significantly through the end of the year despite adding approximately 35 new stores in the fourth quarter. 
Our reserve for LIFO at the end of the quarter was $24 million, which was an increase of $1 million over the previous quarter. This change in our last buy to LIFO reserve did not have a material impact on gross margin for the quarter. 
Accounts payable of $943 million was 47.2% of inventory as compared to 47.9% in the prior year. We continue to work hard at increasing our AP to inventory ratio by improving our inventory productivity and improving terms with vendors. 
The capital expenditures were $94 million for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date CapEx up to $276 million versus $317 million for the comparable period of 2009. For 2010, we expect our CapEx to range from $375 million to $400 million. As discussed in our last conference call, approximately $40 million of CapEx we planned to spend this year will be deferred into the first half of 2010 based on adjustments and timing to a portion of the front-end CSK conversions. 
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $41 million. For 2010, we expect depreciation and amortization to be $160 million to $165 million versus $148 million in 2009. Total borrowings at the end of the quarter were $431 million compared to $704 million at the end of Q3 2009. During the quarter, we elected to permanently retire the FILO tranche of our ABL facility, which lowered our maximum borrowings to $1.075 billion. The $125 million tranche carried an interest rate premium of 125 bps. Even with the elimination of the FILO tranche, we have $674 million of availability at the end of the quarter. 
For 2010, we expect to reduce our total outstanding borrowings by $325 million to $350 million. As noted in our press release on October 1, the legacy CSK convertible notes remain exchangeable and will remain so until the end of the fourth quarter. To date, $11 million of the notes have been surrendered for exchange. To the extent any notes remain outstanding, we continue to intend to call the notes in December. Our plan is to fund this with our existing ABL, which will still allow a significant financial flexibility. 
Now for some other financial information. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was $237 million, an increase of $101 million over the third quarter of 2009. For the year, cash flow from operating activities has increased 105% to $593 million. The improvement was driven by a significant decrease in net inventory investment, higher net income and the timing of payments of other liabilities. 
For the quarter, free cash flow was $143 million versus $50 million in the third quarter of 2009. Year-to-date free cash flow was $316 million versus the use of $28 million in the first nine months of 2009. The improvement was driven by the previously mentioned increase in cash flow from operations and the $41 million decrease in capital expenditures. We now expect free cash flow to be $250 million to $275 million in 2010, and will use any additional free cash flow to further reduce our outstanding debt. 
Stock option expense for the quarter was $3.8 million compared to $3.3 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by the year-over-year increase in our stock price. For 2010, we continue to expect stock option expense to be approximately $15 million versus $13 million in 2009. 
Now to recap our overall guidance. For the third quarter, our comparable store sales guidance is 4% to 6%. For the year, we are raising our comparable store sales guidance to an increase of 7% to 8%. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance for the fourth quarter is from $0.56 to $0.60 on 142.3 million shares. For the year, our EPS guidance is $2.79 to $2.83 per share on 141.4 million shares. On an adjusted basis, excluding the second and third quarter charges, our guidance for the full year EPS on a diluted basis is a range from $2.94 to $2.98. 
At this time, I'd like to ask Carlene, the operator, to come back and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

I don't think we have any data that wouldn't be available to you, just from a pure macro level. What we see that you don't see obviously is just the types of products that are being bought for the cars. We do really well on the repair parts, maintenance parts and in many cases, the kind of parts that higher-mileage vehicles take. My observation has been and I think it's the observation of several in our industry is that the cars that had been built over the last 10 or 15 years are generally higher quality cars than what had been built in the years prior. And because of that, the enhancements that were made by the OEs during that time to make the interiors last longer, make the bodies last longer, just make them more comfortable and presentable to drive at higher mileages, I think that as people have spent some money on maintaining these cars, they'll continue to invest in maintaining them because they're not a car that they don't want to drive. These cars, many of them, can be driven at over 200,000 miles without having major drivetrain issues, engine transmission, differential or transaxle. And because of that, people are willing to maintain the brakes and suspensions and ignition and the drivability components. So I think that what we'll see is that the consumer behavior with regard to trading cars every three or four years or at less than 100,000 miles, that may be long-lasting."

Some of that is going to be a sliding scale on how high or low comps are. As we've talked about previously, especially on the acquired stores, which have a high occupancy cost which is fixed, we have a tremendous amount of opportunity to leverage those sales with existing expenses. When we started the year, we discussed that we thought that per store SG&A would be relatively flat, not down a little bit. Obviously, that was on a lower comp assumption. We have quite a few variable costs that drive our business as we see more customers. But we still have a tremendous amount of fixed costs to leverage. So for the remainder of this year, I would say, Michael, that that statistic holds true.

One of the things we talked about early on when we acquired CSK is that it appeared to us that they had given up some of the core auto parts, hard parts business, that had been -- it's kind of the foundation for all of our operations. And they'd given that up and kind of exchanged it for some of the import, non-automotive accessory-type products that we've really not dabbled in, one, because we just have always done well in auto parts and put our focus on auto parts. And two, we don't feel as confident in the ability to have demand for those products without the support of ongoing large advertising spends and promotional support. So yes, our advertising efforts in the CSK markets are focused around exemplifying our ability to be a great hard parts supplier at competitive prices, and we've seen much improvement in our hard parts sales in those markets. And we'll continue to do that. And then, of course, to add to that, typically what repair shops and commercial customers buy are these hard parts. So yes, we're doing very well there, but that's our focus, is to continue taking these stores through a transition of this – a large portion of non-automotive products over to hard parts. And I feel like we've been successful to this point, but we'll continue to have more success with that as we continue to gain traction and the reputation for being a company that can supply auto parts and hard-to-find parts.

Generally speaking, their backroom inventory was very, very poor on the majority of the stores. I mean, they had some larger stores that did installer business that had good hard parts inventory but over time, they had just swaps accessory and the oil business for their parts business. And then also the parts, the hard parts they did have, they weren't competitive. And they didn't have a very good selection of house brand, entry-level product, good, better, best concept. So it all starts with educating the customer because for many, many years, their ads, all their print, everything that the retail customers saw would indicate that they were more of an accessory house, tool, promotional house. And now, we've got to more or less rebrand the company in the eyes of the hard-core DIY customers, the ones that really buy the hard parts, that we're the place to go for parts now and that we're competitive. Because again, not only did they have very good inventories, what they had, their mindset was that they could be 10%, 15% higher than the competition. So it's all coming along well. Again, it won't happen overnight. They've taken years to build that reputation. It'll take us a while to rebuild the reputation to be a hard parts store."

First, when we look at the amount of deleverage, it was less than what we would have expected or planned based on the DCs coming online. When we look at where the maximum is, really, the issue for us at this time is team member training and efficiency of team members. We're confident in our ability to get back to where we've been historically on a percent of sales standpoint. We just have a lot of new team members out there, and as we ramp up these converted stores, our emphasis is on making sure that, if anything, we're over-servicing the stores and over time, we'll be able to reduce that. I would say this quarter was probably our maximum deleverage as the DCs that converted become more and more efficient."

I guess some strange things happened the past two years in terms of your sales in Q4 relative to Q3. As you think about the reality that we're in a somewhat more stable economic environment, do you feel like what transpired last year and the year before was symptomatic of kind of the economic chaos that we had more or less? And do you feel like, in a more stable environment, you can return to more typical seasonality? And I guess, are you making any special plans with regards to cost structure inventory as you think about your financial planning for Q4?"

We've experienced erratic sales in the fourth quarter for a longer period of time than just the recession due to the holiday spending and the effect that the onset of winter can have and so forth. So we're doing everything that we can to make sure that our fourth quarter is strong and that the trend that we're on and we've had coming out of the third quarter continues. But as we've seen, we've been surprised before following Thanksgiving when heavy holiday shopping starts and the limited discretionary cash that the consumers have starts going elsewhere, so we'll just have to see. It's always easier for me as it is you to look back in comps and make comments about how they went as opposed to look forward. But we're hoping for the best but we're trying to plan as reasonable as we can. And to your question about just our resources for the fourth quarter, from an inventory standpoint, we really don't make much of a change there. Our inventories are pretty well set to service the vehicle needs in the areas that they service, and we just don't have that many promotional products that we push out seasonally that make a material impact. Now labor or payroll, we certainly do make adjustments to that based on -- and those adjustments are made weekly, based on our staffing system projections that we have out in the stores. And they adjust for the business cycles that we have season after season, so we're in good shape there."

It's hard to measure the total market to know how much share we gained but I think we gained share on both sides. Both were good contributors to our growth. The do-it-for-me side, we've clearly taken a lot more share there than we have on the retail side just because we put so much effort and capital into getting ourselves in the commercial business out in the west stores and the converted Checker stores here in the center part of the country and the Murray stores, so that's growing. So yes, we're taking a lot of market share on the commercial side. And I'd say some market share retail; both are performing well but I don't have a specific market share number for you."
