Even with the continued challenging economic environment, which is solid financial and operating results for the quarter. Diluted earnings per share excluding nonrecurring items of $0.95 for the quarter and $0.07 ahead of the $0.88 per share upper end of our previous guidance in the first call of consensus.
Operating revenues for the quarter were $1.839 billion or slightly above the midpoint of our previous revenue guidance of $1.81 to $1.85 billion.
We experienced strong demand for broadband service during the quarter and we had nearly 47,000 high-speed internet customers, this represents an 8% improvement over third quarter 2009, customer additions of approximately 43,500 and a significant improvement over performance of second quarter of 2009, additions were about 29,000.
This strong HSI growth since the July 1st closing of the Embarq acquisition has been driven primarily by our aggressive broadband strategy and our launch of Pure Broadband across the Embarq markets.
We ended the quarter with more than 2,236 million high speed internet customers or over 37.4% penetration of our broadband enabled access lines and approximately 33.3% of total addressable access lines.
We also experienced significant access lines loss improvement as our fourth quarter line loss of approximately 146,000 access lines, represents a 14% improvement over the 170,000 loss in the third quarter and a significant 24% improvement over the fourth quarter 2008 pro forma line loss of 193,000.
Our annualized access line loss for the fourth quarter was 8.1%, which compares to 9.2% in the third quarter of 2009 and 9.8% in pro forma fourth quarter 2008. We experienced a nice improvement and announced or disconnect orders in both the consumer and business segments which was the primary driver of our access line improvement.
Also, demand for our satellite video bundles remain strong, as we added approximately 32,500 DISH customers during the fourth quarter, ended the quarter with more than 535,000 DISH video subscribers.
At year-end 2009, total video subscribers represented 11.7% penetration on primary residential lines. We continue to develop our IPTV capabilities in Columbia and Jefferson City, Missouri and in LA Crosse, Wisconsin. We’re pleased with the results. And these markets thus far are planning to launch of IPTV service in additional markets in 2010 and 2011.
Now turning our attention to the Embarq transaction, integration and processes on schedule and going very well with the financial and HR systems, conversions and initial billing conversion in Ohio behind us. Our next billing conversion is scheduled for North Carolina and will result in approximately 25% of the total legacy Embarq customers to be converted to our integrated customer care billing and provisioning systems.
The implementation of our regional operating model has gone very well and we are confident it is already making a difference in the legacy Embarq markets through an increased local market focus. This local market approach along with our launch of enhanced product offering such as Pure Broadband and our targeted marketing strategy are proven to be successful and positively impacting operating results, as we saw a significant impact in both line loss and high speed sales.
From a synergy perspective, we continue to anticipate achieving approximately $375 million of cost savings within the first three years after the transaction. We exceeded our synergy estimate for fourth quarter to achieve approximately $40 million in operating expense synergies for the quarter.
We expect to achieve an additional $10 million in incremental operating synergies during the first quarter 2010 and approximately $200 million in incremental synergies for the full year 2010.
So, overall, we are off to a great start with the Embarq integration. We generated strong second half financial and operational results and I am very pleased with the accomplishments of our entire CenturyLink team.
Due to the significant billing and customer care conversions scheduled for 2010, we do not anticipate significant reductions in business as usual operating expenses, during the year. We do expect to be far enough along with conversions by year-end 2010 to resume addressing the business as usual type expenses in 2011 and beyond.
Finally, as outlined in our press release issued earlier this morning, for 2010, we anticipate operating revenues excluding one-time unusual items will be approximately 5.5% to 6.5% lower than 2009, pro forma operating revenues, assuming the Embarq acquisition had closed effective January 1st, 2009.
This anticipated revenue decline is driven by access line declines, lower access revenues, and reduced universal service funding that more than offset revenue growth associated with the anticipated high speed internet customer growth during 2010.
Additionally, there’s approximately $135 million to $145 million of extraordinary items. They’re expected to negatively impact 2010 operating revenues, of which, $75 million to $80 million has direct, offsetting expense reductions, and therefore, is not expected to impact 2010 operating cash flow. We expect additional revenue decline in 2011 associated with these unusual items to be approximately $30 million.
We currently expect to generate 2010 free cash flow of $1.475 billion to $1.525 billion. So even with the top line revenue decline, our expected synergies from the Embarq acquisition, anticipated $825 million to $875 million, 2010 capital expenditure plan position us to continue to generate strong free cash flow during the year.
With that I’ll turn the call over to Stewart to provide additional details on our results for the fourth quarter.

During the next few minutes, I will review some highlights of our fourth quarter 2009 operating results and briefly discuss additional financial matters. I will conclude my comments this morning with a discussion of first quarter and full year 2010 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.
Since we reported significant nonrecurring or one-time items during the fourth quarter, I want to make a few remarks regarding those items before I discuss the fourth quarter normalized results with you.
First, we recognized approximately 37.8 million in after-tax costs or about $0.13 per share associated with the debt extinguishments completed in October 2009, which allowed us to successfully lower our 2013 debt maturity tower.
Second, we incurred approximately 19.8 million in after-tax costs or about $0.07 per share related to integration expenses and other costs associated with our acquisition of Embarq.
Next, we incurred approximately 9.8 million after-tax or about $0.03 per share related to litigation reserve adjustments, severance related costs and the accelerated recognition of share-based compensation and pension expense.
These items more than offset a $10.7 million net tax benefit or about $0.04 per share related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and an adjustment to deferred tax liabilities, related to the Embarq acquisition.
In the aggregate, these items have negatively impacted GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter by about $0.19. Additionally, due to the size of the Embarq acquisition, relation to legacy CenturyTel, I will not discuss percentage increases between fourth quarter 2009 and fourth quarter 2008.
However, if you will focus on the table in our press release you will note that we were able to translate the increased revenues from Embarq into larger percentage increases in operating cash flow and net income. In addition, we have provided an updated schedule reflecting pro forma results for fourth quarter 2008 and full year 2009
Now, turning our attention to the results for fourth quarter 2009 compared to fourth quarter 2008 results, excluding nonrecurring items for both periods, as outlined in our financial schedules.
For fourth quarter 2009, operating revenues increased $1.197 billion to $1.839 billion from $642.6 million in fourth quarter, a year ago. The Embarq acquisition contributed operating revenues of $1.266 billion during the quarter.
Additionally, it is important to remember that effective July 1, 2009, CenturyLink began eliminated revenues and corresponding expenses each quarter, associated with the discontinuance of regulatory accounting for certain regulated operating entities, as we got off of FAS 71.
The amount of revenues and corresponding expenses eliminated in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $54.5 million. Operating expenses increased 792.7 million from 459.5 million in fourth quarter 2008 to 1.252 billion in fourth quarter 2009, primarily due to operating expenses, associated with the Embarq properties, which more than offset lower operating costs of $54.5 million due to the discontinuance of regulatory accounting for certain regulatory operating entities, I mentioned earlier.
For fourth quarter 2009, we generated an operating cash flow margin of 51.3%. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 356.4 million in fourth quarter 2009 from 128.8 million in fourth quarter 2008, primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization associated with the Embarq acquisition, which more than offset depreciation expense declines associated with assets becoming fully depreciated and the discontinuance of regulatory accounting for certain regulated operating entities and adjustments to reflect the assignment of fair value and appreciable life to Embarq’s property and intangible assets.
Operating income for the fourth quarter was 587.2 million compared to 183.1 million in fourth quarter 2008. Net income attributable to CenturyLink for the quarter was 286.7 million, compared to 87 million in the fourth quarter, a year ago.
We also generated solid free cash flow of 305.7 million during the fourth quarter. If you exclude the $28.1 million of integration related capital expenditures oru free cash flow was nearly $334 million.
From a capital structure standpoint, Century is very well positioned, as of the end of the year, CenturyLink’s debt to equity ratio was 0.82 to 1 and net debt to full year 2009 pro forma operating cash flow was 2.1 times. Our debt maturities are very manageable with maturities of approximately 500 million, 20 million and 330 million in 2010, '11 and '12 respectively.
Our next significant debt maturity tower approximately $2 billion occurs in 2016. So CenturyLink continues to generate strong cash flows, maintains a solid balance sheet and is in great shape financially to take advantage of opportunities and meet challenges as they arise.
Finally, I’d like to discuss the first quarter and full year 2010 guidance provided in our press release this morning. First, cost incurred by CenturyLink during 2010 related to the Embarq integration will be treated as nonrecurring items. These costs along with any other nonrecurring items that may occur during 2010 are excluded from the diluted earnings per share guidance provided in our press release and in my comments regarding the first quarter and full year 2010 diluted earnings per share guidance.
With those points in mind, for first quarter 2010, we anticipate total revenues to be in the range of 1.77 billion to 1.8 billion and we expect diluted earnings per share for first quarter 2010 to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.88.
As Glen mentioned in his opening remarks, based on current economic and business conditions, we expect full year 2010 operating revenues to be 5.5% to 6.5% lower than 2009 pro forma operating revenues, excluding the unusual items that Glen discussed.
Additionally, for full year 2010, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.20. The following items are expected to negatively impact 2010 diluted earnings per share.
(inaudible) related revenues decline driven primarily by anticipated 7.5% to 8.5% access line losses, $0.54 to $0.58, lower access revenues driven primarily by access line losses and continued pressure on access minutes of use $0.37 to $0.41, reduced universal service funding $0.08 to $0.10 per share and expected migration of network traffic from the wireless carrier $0.06 to $0.08 per share. These items more than offset the following items that are expected to positively impact 2010 diluted earnings per share.
First, expected synergies associated with the Embarq acquisition of $0.39 to $0.43, increased revenues associated with expected growth in high-speed internet customers, $0.09 to $0.11 and anticipated lower depreciation and interest expense $0.10 to $0.12 per share.
We expect capital expenditures for full year 2010 to be in the range of $825 million to $875 million or approximately 15% lower than 2009 pro forma capital expenditures of a billion dollars. We expect free cash flow for 2010 to be in the range of $1.475 billion to $1.525 billion.
Finally, we elected to make a $300 million contribution to one of our pension plans during first quarter of 2010. The contribution is tax deductible and therefore will utilize approximately $185 million of cash. We expect to fund this as well as repayment of our 2010 debt maturities from cash flow, cash on hand, and a minimal amount from our credit facility.
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. At this time I will ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call.

My second question is that the gross margins for the fourth quarter were a bit higher than we had modeled. I’m just trying to figure out how much of the quarter-to-quarter improvement was attributable to the synergies from the Embarq merger? And then how much of the 200 million of expected cost synergies in 2010 would be allocated between cost of service in SG&A? Thanks.

The last quarter, the items that we identified, impacting 2010 revenues, specifically, universal service and network grooming by the wireless carrier that does fully bake into 2010, the declines associated with those items.
The declines that we would expect from those items in 2011 would be approximately another $30 million or so. There was about $80 million of items baked into the 2010 guidance now that do not affect cash flow. Because basically, one of them relates to a purchase accounting adjustment and the other relates to the way that we’re going to book revenues and expenses associated with the promotional costs.

Our 2010 capital budget reflects those investments which are not really that significant as we’ve already invested in our high-speed internet in lot of these areas, the incremental costs to for IPTV is not that great, actually, so, it’s all baked into our capital budget plans.
We expect really a little incremental expense costs of about $30 million this year operating expense as we roll on IPTVs, so we’re little over that and we’re finding that a very strong pull-through effect in terms of high-speed internet and about 85% of our IPTV customers also are taking the high-speed internet product. It significantly impacts churn. So we think its going be a really good product in these more of markets.

Your second question regarding the additional M&A considerations, we need to get past this North Carolina conversion, which in the second quarter, we will have as I pointed earlier that we represent 25% of the conversion of the Embarq market. Once that’s done I feel we will be in a position to consider other opportunities for consolidation or acquisition. Our primary focus right now is getting this Embarq conversion is done right.

And secondly, I was just trying to understand the earnings guidance a little bit because your run rate on this quarter, you’re up around 380 and your guidance kind of down around 315.
The reasons you’re giving some of where you before but you talk about here lower access, lower USF and line losses and that these are kind of unusual items, but it’s a fairly based on the 20% step down versus the fourth quarter run rate. And those items for me just seem to be kind of normal course of business frankly over the last five years to six years or more. So I’m a little confused on the earnings guidance and is this kind of the new starting point for earnings going forward '011 or '012, do you think or will these kinds of trends continue into '011 and '012?

We have five regions now, we got general managers out into the market, so, we have about 20 general managers and they’re held accountable on a day-to-day basis for serving the customer, and adding new ones, and so, I think that just they’re focused day-to-day on where they’re at and their unit makes a significant difference.
Secondly, I would say, from a marketing standpoint, we are pleased with go-to-market changes we’ve made, one, we started doing more direct mail targeted direct mail and we started going after non-customers. And so that’s been a great uplift. In fact, our inwards have improved in these markets pretty significantly.
And the third thing I would say is it’s not just on the consumer side. It’s also on the enterprise side. We’re seeing the same focus there and the same results in terms of new customers, our core network has been a significant facilitator in adding some of these customers that have facility in market and out of market to put our core network.

Additionally, I guess, IPTV ramps up during the year as well.

Basically, the unusual items that we’re calling out, in 2010, unusual revenue items, they are included in the guidance that we gave for EPS. So that’s not in addition or outside of the guidance that we gave. Those items totaled about $140 million. If you exclude them you get to about a 6% r revenue decline from 2009 to 2010.
Those $140 million of items, we are moving our long distance traffic in the past. Embarq received originating access from a carrier that carry their long distance traffic that amounts to about $47 million. That revenue goes away, but that revenue was also an expense that Embarq had on their financial statements too, as they paid that carrier transport terminated access and an administrative fee. So, basically, that’s about $47 million and we will save money when we transfer that long distance traffic over to our internal network. So that’s 47 million, that basically comes out of revenue, it’s going to come out of expense as well.
The another $33 million basically is a wireless carrier, where we’ve been taking their 800 number traffic and basically routing it to where it needs to go. So that’s $33 million. We would expect $11 million of that to carry over and be an incremental decline again in 2011. Embarq was basically reselling or MVNO from a wireless standpoint, so they were selling cellular service. Basically they terminated that arrangement. That represents $20 million decline in revenue between 2009 and 2010 and basically doesn’t carry forward into 2011 or no incremental decline in 2011.
CenturyLink had about $10 million or legacy CenturyTel had about $10 million of legacy access revenue true-ups that occurred in 2009 actually that will not reoccur in 2010. So, that’s a decline that we wouldn’t expect to go, to decline again in 2011. And then the revenue recognition impacts, we had about $15 million of revenue, historically, CenturyTel, our promotions for services that we provide our customers we book the revenue and the expense associated with those promotion on a gross basis, so we book revenue gross and we book the promotion expense, as an expense item.
Embarq reflected their promotion expense as a contra revenue, so we changed our accounting practices and are following what Embarq did and are now accounting for promotion expense as a contra revenue, so that impact is about $15 million decline in revenue in 2010 again, with no incremental decline in 2011.
The other $15 million of the revenue recognition impacts relates to purchase price accounting or purchase accounting rather, Embarq had about, in this period, had about $15 million of revenue that they had, that previously was deferred, that really relates to installation revenue associated with initially connecting customers, that revenue basically, they didn’t recognize the time they collected the cash, they deferred it and they recognized it over the life of the customer. Purchase accounting, SAB 104, its what they were following basically, purchase accounting require us to eliminate that deferred revenue as of the acquisition date, so, again, that’s about a $15 million decline in 2010 versus 2009. And again, that would not reoccur in 2011.

We're pleased with our results for the quarter as we exceeded our expectations for both revenues and earnings. We also achieved very strong high-speed Internet additions and saw significant improvement in access lines losses, especially in the urban Embarq markets. 
We continue to be excited about the transaction between CenturyLink and Qwest. The transaction is truly transformative in that it creates a national industry-leading communications company with significant scale and scope. The combined company will be even more competitive with an operating presence in 37 states, with approximately 5 million broadband customers and 17 million access lines. 
I'm confident the transaction will provide significant benefits for all of our shareholders, our customers and the communities that we serve. We'll have the scale and national scope to provide a compelling array of broadband product and services to our entire customer base. We expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to free cash flow per share, excluding integration costs, while strengthening the sustainability of CenturyLink's dividend by lowering the company's payout ratio. We have begun the integration process and expect to have the vast majority of all required regulatory filings completed before the end of this month. And I look forward to updating you in the months ahead, as we bring these two great companies together.
Moving to Slide 7 in the deck. We're pleased to report solid financial and operating results for the first quarter. First, operating revenues exceeded increased $1.8 billion for the quarter, which is at the top end of our previous guidance. There were several factors contributed to our strong operating revenues for the quarter. First, we experienced a significant sequential and year-over-year improvement in the rate of access line loss. We also achieved stronger-than-anticipated high-speed Internet customer additions during the quarter. Additionally, we saw an improvement in our access minutes of use trends compared to our original estimates for the quarter. And finally, we experienced a higher-than-anticipated data circuit demand from wireless providers adding capacity to their networks to handle increasing wireless data traffic.
Diluted earnings per share excluding nonrecurring items was $0.93 per share for the quarter or $0.05 per share above the top end of our previous guidance of $0.88 per share and $0.07 ahead of the August census [ph] estimates of $0.86 per share. 
Now several factors contributed to this outperformance during the first quarter:  First, the revenue performance outlined a moment ago was a contributing factor; additionally, we have been able to achieve synergies from the Embarq acquisition earlier than we originally anticipated; and finally, our employees continue to do an excellent job in containing operating cost across our business. 
We also generated strong free cash flow of $465 million excluding nonrecurring items during the first quarter, which represents the highest quarterly free cash flow generation in the history of our company. When we announced the Embarq transaction in October 2008, we had originally anticipated approximately $300 million of full run rate operating expense synergies. After further diligence and deeper insight into the benefits of the merger in 2009, we updated the anticipated operating expense synergies to $375 million. We achieved approximately $20 million of incremental synergies during the first quarter, which brings annualized operating expense synergy run rate to approximately $270 million. We currently expect to exit 2010 at approximately $300 million annualized operating expense synergy run rate.
Turning to Slide 8 in the deck. We had high-speed Internet customer additions of approximately 70,000, which represents a 50% sequential improvement over fourth quarter 2009 high-speed Internet additions, and a 10% improvement over pro forma in first quarter 2009 adds. We ended the quarter with 2,306,000 HSI customers or 38.9% penetration of our broadband-enabled access lines and about 35% of total addressable access lines. Our first quarter line loss of approximately 125,700 represents a 14% sequential improvement over fourth quarter 2009 access line losses and a 26.5% improvement over pro forma first quarter 2009 access line losses  
In the Embarq markets, we have seen significant improvements in key customer service metrics. Commitments met, appointments met and out of service cleared in 24 hours over the past nine months: We've seen improvement in all of those areas. We also continue to experience strong demand for our video bundles, that we added more than 33,000 satellite videos customers during the quarter. We continue to develop our IPTV capabilities in Columbia and Jefferson City, Missouri and La Crosse, Wisconsin and we are pleased with the results in these markets. Now we're in the preliminary stages of launching IPTV service in two additional markets, and we expect to roll out IPTV service in a total of five new markets by early 2011.
Slide 9 shows the time line illustrating the steady progress we've made towards fully integrating the Embarq operations. In the months between our announcement of the Embarq acquisition and the close of the transaction, we worked diligently to put our region operating model in place in all our markets in day one, and also, we're ready to go with new broadband product offers. This readiness from day one contributed to the strong performance we reported for the third quarter of 2009, our first quarter as CenturyLink.
Within four months after close, we have converted 100% of our financial and HR systems. We've lost our new brand and completed a first legacy Embarq customer conversion for our billing and customer care system. With the recent completion of the billing and customer care conversion of the North Carolina market, and 25% of the Embarq customer base converted to CenturyLink's billing system and customer care platform, we have a clear path to completing 100% of the Embarq customers to CenturyLink's systems by the third quarter of 2011, so we're very pleased with where we are with the conversion process.
We currently expect to have fully completed the migration of the Embarq long-distance traffic to our network but midyear 2011, as well. We have an additional large customer conversion scheduled for later this year and expect to have about 50% of the legacy Embarq customers converted by year end 2010. As we have announced, we expect to complete the Qwest transaction in the first half of 2011, and we believe beginning the Qwest integration will dovetail nicely with our expected completion of the Embarq integration in late 2011. As we stated during our call announcing the Qwest transaction, we expect the Qwest integration and synergy realization to occur over a three- to five-year period.
As we see on Slide 10, we have experienced a significant improvement in the level of access line losses both year-over-year and sequentially over the three quarters that we reported since the close of the Embarq transaction. Our first quarter 2010 line loss of 125,700 access lines represents a 14% improvement over the 146,000 loss in the third quarter, a 26.5% improvement over pro forma first quarter 2009. This rate of improvement is particularly dramatic if you look at our pro forma 193,000 access line losses in the fourth quarter of 2008. 
We have seen a significant decrease in announced or disconnect orders in both the consumer and business segments, which we believe is due to the success of our bundled offerings, our value-based marketing strategy and the modestly improving economy, at least in some areas. We've also increased our focus on non-customers, a couple cord cutters and strengthening our distribution channels really across-the-board.
Turning to Slide 11. We also have seen a strong improvement in the rate of growth in broadband subscribers, as demand for broadband remained strong and customers responded well to our pure broadband offers and our local operating model. Our first quarter 2010 net adds of 70,000 represents a sequential improvement of 50% and a 10% year-over-year improvement. The growth we've seen since closing the Embarq acquisition continues to be driven, primarily, by aggressive broadband strategy, our launch of pure broadband and our targeted marketing strategy. We're pleased with the strong high-speed Internet growth over the last several quarters. However, it is important to note that with the much higher penetration rate today versus a year ago, we expect it to be more difficult to maintain this rate of growth going forward.
Also, in line with past second quarter trends, normally seen across our industry, we expect second quarter high-speed Internet net additions to be in the range of 32,000 to 36,000. However, keep in mind that this will still represent a 20% to 25% improvement over the second quarter of 2009. For CenturyLink, the normal second quarter seasonality is impacted, in particular, by the migration of Florida wintertime residents returning home to the northern states.
Going to Slide 12. Access line performance and high-speed Internet customer growth trends in our top urban markets have been strong since July 1, 2009 closing, as we experienced a significant decline in the rate of access line loss and have turnaround in high-speed Internet customer growth in those markets. Now we believe this limitation of CenturyLink's regional operating model with local market accountability, our targeted sales and marketing approach, along with a modestly improving economy have been key drivers of this turnaround. The 20 general managers responsible for local market operations across our five regions are responsible on a day-to-day basis for serving our existing customers and driving new customer additions.
From a go-to-market standpoint, we've made significant changes in the marketing approach utilized in these markets, introduced a new product and service offerings offering to stimulate customer demand. It's important to note that the changes in market strategy have not been just consumer focused but is also focused on the enterprise side of our business. For instance, our core network provides a national IP overlay that's been valuable in attracting new business customers with locations both in market and out of market.
I'll now turn the call over to Stewart for additional financial highlights and the review of our second quarter and full year 2010 guidance. Stewart?"

During the next few minutes, I will review highlights of our first quarter 2010 operating results and make a few brief remarks regarding our capital structure, and I will conclude my comments this morning with a discu",1338,"Turning to Slide 13. Thank you, Glen. During the next few minutes, I will review highlights of our first quarter 2010 operating results and make a few brief remarks regarding our capital structure, and I will conclude my comments this morning with a discussion of second quarter and full year 2010 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.
Turning to Slide 14. Since we reported significant nonrecurring or one-time items during the first quarter, I want to make a few remarks regarding those items before I discuss the first quarter normalized results with you. First, we incurred approximately $21.5 million of pretax expenses or about $0.045 per share related to integrationed expenses associated with the Embarq integration. Second, we incurred approximately $15 million pretax or about $0.03 per share of Embarq transaction severance-related costs during the quarter. And last, we recognized $4 million in the income tax charge of about one penny a share due to a change in the tax treatment of the Medicare Part D reimbursement.
In the aggregate, these items represent the $0.09 difference in normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.93 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.84. Also this quarter, we changed the revenue line item reporting of subscriber line charges from where it was previously reported as network access revenue to where it is now reported as voice revenue. Additionally, we included fiber and CLEC revenue in other revenue. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect these reclassifications.
Now moving on to Slide 15. Due to the size of the impact of the Embarq acquisition on first quarter 2010 results as compared to first quarter 2009 results, I'll not discuss the percentage increases between first quarter a year ago and first quarter this year. However, I do want to point out that if you look at the percentage change column on this slide, the good news is that we were able to translate the increased revenues from Embarq into larger percentage increases and operating cash flow and net income. Also, please note that the last page of the financial schedules accompanying our earnings release this morning reflects CenturyLink's first quarter 2010 results excluding nonrecurring items compared to pro forma results for first quarter 2009, assuming the Embarq acquisition had been completed then.
Now turning our attention to the results for first quarter 2010 compared to first quarter 2009 results, excluding nonrecurring items from both periods, as outlined in our financial schedules. For first quarter 2010, the operating revenues increased $1.165 billion to $1.8 billion from $635.4 million in first quarter of 2009. The Embarq acquisition contributed operating revenues of $1,255,000,000 during the quarter. Additionally, it is important to remember that effective July 1, 2009, CenturyLink began eliminating revenues and corresponding expenses each quarter associated with the discontinuance of regulatory accounting for certain regulated operating entities. The amount of revenues and corresponding expenses eliminated in first quarter 2010 was $51.8 million. First quarter 2009 results do not reflect these same eliminations, due to the July 1, 2009 effective date of the discontinuance.
Cash operating expenses increased $535.7 million from $329.8 million in first quarter 2009 to $865.5 million in first quarter this year. Due to $593 million of cash operating cost associated with the Embarq acquisitions, which more than offset the reduction in operating cost associated with the discontinuance of regulatory accounting for certain regulated operating entities that I mentioned earlier. 
For first quarter 2010, we generated an operating cash flow margin of 51.9% compared to 48.1% in first quarter 2009. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $353.2 million in first quarter 2010 from $127.6 million in first quarter 2009, primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization associated with the Embarq acquisition, which more than offset depreciation expense declines associated with assets becoming fully depreciated. 
Net income attributable to CenturyLink for the quarter was $279.2 million compared to $81.9 million in first quarter 2009. Diluted EPS for the quarter increased 13.4% to $0.93 from $0.82 in first quarter a year ago. As Glen mentioned earlier, we generated strong free cash flow of more than $465 million during the quarter compared to approximately $164 million in first quarter 2009.
Now turning to Slide 16. From a capital structure standpoint, CenturyLink remains very well positioned. As we stated in our fourth quarter 2009 earnings call in late February, we elected to make a $300 million contribution to one of our pension plans during the first quarter of this year. 
As of March 31, 2010, and after having made that pension contribution, CenturyLink's debt-to-equity ratio was 0.81:1 and net debt to first quarter 2010 annualized operating cash flow was 2.0x. As we mentioned last quarter, our debt maturities are very manageable, with maturities of approximately $500 million, $20 million and $330 million in 2010, '11, and '12, respectively, excluding the pending Qwest merger.
As we also previously stated, we intend to pay off the $500 million of senior notes that mature in October of this year. Our next significant debt maturity tower, excluding the pending Qwest transaction, is approximately $2 billion in 2016. So we continue to generate strong cash flows, maintain a solid balance sheet and have very manageable maturities over the next several years. We are confident that our financial strength and liquidity provide us the financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities and meet challenges as they arrive. 
Finally, on Slide 17, I would like to discuss the second quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance provided in our press release this morning. As a reminder, costs incurred by CenturyLink during 2010 related to the Embarq integration are considered nonrecurring items. These costs, along with any other nonrecurring items that may occur during 2010, are excluded from the diluted earnings per share guidance provided in our press release and in my comments regarding second quarter and full year 2010 diluted earnings per share guidance. Additionally, our second quarter and full year guidance also excludes any transaction or integration costs that may be incurred related to the pending Qwest transaction. 
With those points in mind, we are updating our 2010 guidance to reflect our first quarter results and our expectations for the remainder of the year. We expect operating revenues for the year to be 6.5% to 7.5% lower than 2009 pro forma operating revenues. Our previous guidance was a decline of 7.5% to 8.5%. The improvement is a result of better-than-originally anticipated access line and broadband customer results, data and business revenue opportunities, slower migration of a wireless carrier's traffic off of our network and improved access minutes of use trends. 
If you remember last quarter, we indicated that excluding the unusual items, 2010 revenue would have declined 5.5% to 6.5%. Now basically excluding those items, revenue would have declined 4.5% to 5.5% on a pro forma basis, again, assuming the Embarq transaction had closed January 1, 2009.
Our first quarter performance and the expected improvement in revenue during the remainder of the year results in a $50 million increase in the range of our free cash flow guidance, which is now $1.525 billion to $1.575 billion, and an increase in our range of diluted earnings per share guidance of $0.10, which now moves to $3.20 to $3.30 per share. We continue to expect 2010 capital expenditures to be in the range of $825 million to $875 million. 
For the second quarter, we expect operating revenues to be in the range of $1.745 billion to $1.775 billion. We expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.86. The sequential decline in diluted EPS from first quarter to second quarter is due to the expected access line and access minutes decline, partially offset by growth in revenue from high-speed Internet customers. Additionally, as you'll recall, we typically have a seasonal increase in maintenance expense and related outside plant activities in the second quarter.
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. At this time, I'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call."

And then the second question, if I could, Glen, when you see a result out from Qwest today, presumably it's not a surprise to you, but 37.9% EBITDA margins and rising, is there any part of you that gets nervous that the integration synergies that you are trying to get three to five years from now are something that the Qwest management team will start to carve out sooner rather than later in order to get the guidance that they've put out there?

Overall, we support the direction that the FCC is taking, reforming some of the key policies, such as universal service, intercarrier comp and compensation for VoIP traffic, Voice over IP traffic. Also, I think the recent comments from Chairman Genachowski are encouraging and he has pointed out the need for steady and measured reform [ph] over a reasonable transition period. Also talked about the need to avoid a flash cut approach with the process, and we agree with this. We will [indiscernible] participate in this process and industry needs reform here that provides more clarity, more stability and greater predictability in terms of making network infrastructure investments. So we look forward to this process. And as far as impact on ARPU and revenue, we don't have any use of that [ph] today. We think it will be a process over time. I think there'll be a, specifically, a more focus on support of broadband, the universal service versus voice. So we think that change will occur and could be positive for us in bringing higher speed to specialty to a lot of these real markets that we serve. Concerning the IPTV, especially in the five markets, as far as the incremental capital costs, it won't impact our capital budgets, as far as increasing it. It's going to be within the levels we've talked already. We're encouraged with what we're seeing with the economics improvement and economics of IPTV, as costs come down, set-top box prices come down. We feel like it's going the right direction. The technology is working well. And we are looking forward to expanding that. I think we anticipate about $30 million of additional costs this year, operating cost that's in our outlook. So we believe IPTV is an important part of our future, and we'll be looking for ways to continue to expand our investment and the rollout of this product in the months ahead."

The transaction is truly transformative in that it creates a national industry-leading communications company with significant scale and scope. The combined company will be even more competitive with an operating presence in 37 states, with approximately 5 million broadband customers and 17 million access lines. 
I'm confident the transaction will provide significant benefits for all of our shareholders, our customers and the communities that we serve. We'll have the scale and national scope to provide a compelling array of broadband product and services to our entire customer base. We expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to free cash flow per share, excluding integration costs, while strengthening the sustainability of CenturyLink's dividend by lowering the company's payout ratio. We have begun the integration process and expect to have the vast majority of all required regulatory filings completed before the end of this month. And I look forward to updating you in the months ahead, as we bring these two great companies together.
Moving to Slide 7 in the deck. We're pleased to report solid financial and operating results for the first quarter. First, operating revenues exceeded increased $1.8 billion for the quarter, which is at the top end of our previous guidance. There were several factors contributed to our strong operating revenues for the quarter. First, we experienced a significant sequential and year-over-year improvement in the rate of access line loss. We also achieved stronger-than-anticipated high-speed Internet customer additions during the quarter. Additionally, we saw an improvement in our access minutes of use trends compared to our original estimates for the quarter. And finally, we experienced a higher-than-anticipated data circuit demand from wireless providers adding capacity to their networks to handle increasing wireless data traffic.
Diluted earnings per share excluding nonrecurring items was $0.93 per share for the quarter or $0.05 per share above the top end of our previous guidance of $0.88 per share and $0.07 ahead of the August census [ph] estimates of $0.86 per share. 
Now several factors contributed to this outperformance during the first quarter:  First, the revenue performance outlined a moment ago was a contributing factor; additionally, we have been able to achieve synergies from the Embarq acquisition earlier than we originally anticipated; and finally, our employees continue to do an excellent job in containing operating cost across our business. 
We also generated strong free cash flow of $465 million excluding nonrecurring items during the first quarter, which represents the highest quarterly free cash flow generation in the history of our company. When we announced the Embarq transaction in October 2008, we had originally anticipated approximately $300 million of full run rate operating expense synergies. After further diligence and deeper insight into the benefits of the merger in 2009, we updated the anticipated operating expense synergies to $375 million. We achieved approximately $20 million of incremental synergies during the first quarter, which brings annualized operating expense synergy run rate to approximately $270 million. We currently expect to exit 2010 at approximately $300 million annualized operating expense synergy run rate.
Turning to Slide 8 in the deck. We had high-speed Internet customer additions of approximately 70,000, which represents a 50% sequential improvement over fourth quarter 2009 high-speed Internet additions, and a 10% improvement over pro forma in first quarter 2009 adds. We ended the quarter with 2,306,000 HSI customers or 38.9% penetration of our broadband-enabled access lines and about 35% of total addressable access lines. Our first quarter line loss of approximately 125,700 represents a 14% sequential improvement over fourth quarter 2009 access line losses and a 26.5% improvement over pro forma first quarter 2009 access line losses  
In the Embarq markets, we have seen significant improvements in key customer service metrics. Commitments met, appointments met and out of service cleared in 24 hours over the past nine months: We've seen improvement in all of those areas. We also continue to experience strong demand for our video bundles, that we added more than 33,000 satellite videos customers during the quarter. We continue to develop our IPTV capabilities in Columbia and Jefferson City, Missouri and La Crosse, Wisconsin and we are pleased with the results in these markets. Now we're in the preliminary stages of launching IPTV service in two additional markets, and we expect to roll out IPTV service in a total of five new markets by early 2011.
Slide 9 shows the time line illustrating the steady progress we've made towards fully integrating the Embarq operations. In the months between our announcement of the Embarq acquisition and the close of the transaction, we worked diligently to put our region operating model in place in all our markets in day one, and also, we're ready to go with new broadband product offers. This readiness from day one contributed to the strong performance we reported for the third quarter of 2009, our first quarter as CenturyLink.
Within four months after close, we have converted 100% of our financial and HR systems. We've lost our new brand and completed a first legacy Embarq customer conversion for our billing and customer care system. With the recent completion of the billing and customer care conversion of the North Carolina market, and 25% of the Embarq customer base converted to CenturyLink's billing system and customer care platform, we have a clear path to completing 100% of the Embarq customers to CenturyLink's systems by the third quarter of 2011, so we're very pleased with where we are with the conversion process.
We currently expect to have fully completed the migration of the Embarq long-distance traffic to our network but midyear 2011, as well. We have an additional large customer conversion scheduled for later this year and expect to have about 50% of the legacy Embarq customers converted by year end 2010. As we have announced, we expect to complete the Qwest transaction in the first half of 2011, and we believe beginning the Qwest integration will dovetail nicely with our expected completion of the Embarq integration in late 2011. As we stated during our call announcing the Qwest transaction, we expect the Qwest integration and synergy realization to occur over a three- to five-year period.
As we see on Slide 10, we have experienced a significant improvement in the level of access line losses both year-over-year and sequentially over the three quarters that we reported since the close of the Embarq transaction. Our first quarter 2010 line loss of 125,700 access lines represents a 14% improvement over the 146,000 loss in the third quarter, a 26.5% improvement over pro forma first quarter 2009. This rate of improvement is particularly dramatic if you look at our pro forma 193,000 access line losses in the fourth quarter of 2008. 
We have seen a significant decrease in announced or disconnect orders in both the consumer and business segments, which we believe is due to the success of our bundled offerings, our value-based marketing strategy and the modestly improving economy, at least in some areas. We've also increased our focus on non-customers, a couple cord cutters and strengthening our distribution channels really across-the-board.
Turning to Slide 11. We also have seen a strong improvement in the rate of growth in broadband subscribers, as demand for broadband remained strong and customers responded well to our pure broadband offers and our local operating model. Our first quarter 2010 net adds of 70,000 represents a sequential improvement of 50% and a 10% year-over-year improvement. The growth we've seen since closing the Embarq acquisition continues to be driven, primarily, by aggressive broadband strategy, our launch of pure broadband and our targeted marketing strategy. We're pleased with the strong high-speed Internet growth over the last several quarters. However, it is important to note that with the much higher penetration rate today versus a year ago, we expect it to be more difficult to maintain this rate of growth going forward.
Also, in line with past second quarter trends, normally seen across our industry, we expect second quarter high-speed Internet net additions to be in the range of 32,000 to 36,000. However, keep in mind that this will still represent a 20% to 25% improvement over the second quarter of 2009. For CenturyLink, the normal second quarter seasonality is impacted, in particular, by the migration of Florida wintertime residents returning home to the northern states.
Going to Slide 12. Access line performance and high-speed Internet customer growth trends in our top urban markets have been strong since July 1, 2009 closing, as we experienced a significant decline in the rate of access line loss and have turnaround in high-speed Internet customer growth in those markets. Now we believe this limitation of CenturyLink's regional operating model with local market accountability, our targeted sales and marketing approach, along with a modestly improving economy have been key drivers of this turnaround. The 20 general managers responsible for local market operations across our five regions are responsible on a day-to-day basis for serving our existing customers and driving new customer additions.
From a go-to-market standpoint, we've made significant changes in the marketing approach utilized in these markets, introduced a new product and service offerings offering to stimulate customer demand. It's important to note that the changes in market strategy have not been just consumer focused but is also focused on the enterprise side of our business. For instance, our core network provides a national IP overlay that's been valuable in attracting new business customers with locations both in market and out of market.
I'll now turn the call over to Stewart for additional financial highlights and the review of our second quarter and full year 2010 guidance. Stewart?

During the next few minutes, I will review highlights of our first quarter 2010 operating results and make a few brief remarks regarding our capital structure, and I will conclude my comments this morning with a discu",1338,"Turning to Slide 13. Thank you, Glen. During the next few minutes, I will review highlights of our first quarter 2010 operating results and make a few brief remarks regarding our capital structure, and I will conclude my comments this morning with a discussion of second quarter and full year 2010 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.
Turning to Slide 14. Since we reported significant nonrecurring or one-time items during the first quarter, I want to make a few remarks regarding those items before I discuss the first quarter normalized results with you. First, we incurred approximately $21.5 million of pretax expenses or about $0.045 per share related to integrationed expenses associated with the Embarq integration. Second, we incurred approximately $15 million pretax or about $0.03 per share of Embarq transaction severance-related costs during the quarter. And last, we recognized $4 million in the income tax charge of about one penny a share due to a change in the tax treatment of the Medicare Part D reimbursement.
In the aggregate, these items represent the $0.09 difference in normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.93 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.84. Also this quarter, we changed the revenue line item reporting of subscriber line charges from where it was previously reported as network access revenue to where it is now reported as voice revenue. Additionally, we included fiber and CLEC revenue in other revenue. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect these reclassifications.
Now moving on to Slide 15. Due to the size of the impact of the Embarq acquisition on first quarter 2010 results as compared to first quarter 2009 results, I'll not discuss the percentage increases between first quarter a year ago and first quarter this year. However, I do want to point out that if you look at the percentage change column on this slide, the good news is that we were able to translate the increased revenues from Embarq into larger percentage increases and operating cash flow and net income. Also, please note that the last page of the financial schedules accompanying our earnings release this morning reflects CenturyLink's first quarter 2010 results excluding nonrecurring items compared to pro forma results for first quarter 2009, assuming the Embarq acquisition had been completed then.
Now turning our attention to the results for first quarter 2010 compared to first quarter 2009 results, excluding nonrecurring items from both periods, as outlined in our financial schedules. For first quarter 2010, the operating revenues increased $1.165 billion to $1.8 billion from $635.4 million in first quarter of 2009. The Embarq acquisition contributed operating revenues of $1,255,000,000 during the quarter. Additionally, it is important to remember that effective July 1, 2009, CenturyLink began eliminating revenues and corresponding expenses each quarter associated with the discontinuance of regulatory accounting for certain regulated operating entities. The amount of revenues and corresponding expenses eliminated in first quarter 2010 was $51.8 million. First quarter 2009 results do not reflect these same eliminations, due to the July 1, 2009 effective date of the discontinuance.
Cash operating expenses increased $535.7 million from $329.8 million in first quarter 2009 to $865.5 million in first quarter this year. Due to $593 million of cash operating cost associated with the Embarq acquisitions, which more than offset the reduction in operating cost associated with the discontinuance of regulatory accounting for certain regulated operating entities that I mentioned earlier. 
For first quarter 2010, we generated an operating cash flow margin of 51.9% compared to 48.1% in first quarter 2009. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $353.2 million in first quarter 2010 from $127.6 million in first quarter 2009, primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization associated with the Embarq acquisition, which more than offset depreciation expense declines associated with assets becoming fully depreciated. 
Net income attributable to CenturyLink for the quarter was $279.2 million compared to $81.9 million in first quarter 2009. Diluted EPS for the quarter increased 13.4% to $0.93 from $0.82 in first quarter a year ago. As Glen mentioned earlier, we generated strong free cash flow of more than $465 million during the quarter compared to approximately $164 million in first quarter 2009.
Now turning to Slide 16. From a capital structure standpoint, CenturyLink remains very well positioned. As we stated in our fourth quarter 2009 earnings call in late February, we elected to make a $300 million contribution to one of our pension plans during the first quarter of this year. 
As of March 31, 2010, and after having made that pension contribution, CenturyLink's debt-to-equity ratio was 0.81:1 and net debt to first quarter 2010 annualized operating cash flow was 2.0x. As we mentioned last quarter, our debt maturities are very manageable, with maturities of approximately $500 million, $20 million and $330 million in 2010, '11, and '12, respectively, excluding the pending Qwest merger.
As we also previously stated, we intend to pay off the $500 million of senior notes that mature in October of this year. Our next significant debt maturity tower, excluding the pending Qwest transaction, is approximately $2 billion in 2016. So we continue to generate strong cash flows, maintain a solid balance sheet and have very manageable maturities over the next several years. We are confident that our financial strength and liquidity provide us the financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities and meet challenges as they arrive. 
Finally, on Slide 17, I would like to discuss the second quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance provided in our press release this morning. As a reminder, costs incurred by CenturyLink during 2010 related to the Embarq integration are considered nonrecurring items. These costs, along with any other nonrecurring items that may occur during 2010, are excluded from the diluted earnings per share guidance provided in our press release and in my comments regarding second quarter and full year 2010 diluted earnings per share guidance. Additionally, our second quarter and full year guidance also excludes any transaction or integration costs that may be incurred related to the pending Qwest transaction. 
With those points in mind, we are updating our 2010 guidance to reflect our first quarter results and our expectations for the remainder of the year. We expect operating revenues for the year to be 6.5% to 7.5% lower than 2009 pro forma operating revenues. Our previous guidance was a decline of 7.5% to 8.5%. The improvement is a result of better-than-originally anticipated access line and broadband customer results, data and business revenue opportunities, slower migration of a wireless carrier's traffic off of our network and improved access minutes of use trends. 
If you remember last quarter, we indicated that excluding the unusual items, 2010 revenue would have declined 5.5% to 6.5%. Now basically excluding those items, revenue would have declined 4.5% to 5.5% on a pro forma basis, again, assuming the Embarq transaction had closed January 1, 2009.
Our first quarter performance and the expected improvement in revenue during the remainder of the year results in a $50 million increase in the range of our free cash flow guidance, which is now $1.525 billion to $1.575 billion, and an increase in our range of diluted earnings per share guidance of $0.10, which now moves to $3.20 to $3.30 per share. We continue to expect 2010 capital expenditures to be in the range of $825 million to $875 million. 
For the second quarter, we expect operating revenues to be in the range of $1.745 billion to $1.775 billion. We expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.86. The sequential decline in diluted EPS from first quarter to second quarter is due to the expected access line and access minutes decline, partially offset by growth in revenue from high-speed Internet customers. Additionally, as you'll recall, we typically have a seasonal increase in maintenance expense and related outside plant activities in the second quarter.
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. At this time, I'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call.

But I was wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about that balance of integration and cost cutting. And then the second question, if I could, Glen, when you see a result out from Qwest today, presumably it's not a surprise to you, but 37.9% EBITDA margins and rising, is there any part of you that gets nervous that the integration synergies that you are trying to get three to five years from now are something that the Qwest management team will start to carve out sooner rather than later in order to get the guidance that they've put out there? I guess what's your comfort level with that kind of dynamic, as we look into the close next year?

Overall, we support the direction that the FCC is taking, reforming some of the key policies, such as universal service, intercarrier comp and compensation for VoIP traffic, Voice over IP traffic. Also, I think the recent comments from Chairman Genachowski are encouraging and he has pointed out the need for steady and measured reform [ph] over a reasonable transition period. Also talked about the need to avoid a flash cut approach with the process, and we agree with this. We will [indiscernible] participate in this process and industry needs reform here that provides more clarity, more stability and greater predictability in terms of making network infrastructure investments. So we look forward to this process. And as far as impact on ARPU and revenue, we don't have any use of that [ph] today. We think it will be a process over time. I think there'll be a, specifically, a more focus on support of broadband, the universal service versus voice. So we think that change will occur and could be positive for us in bringing higher speed to specialty to a lot of these real markets that we serve. Concerning the IPTV, especially in the five markets, as far as the incremental capital costs, it won't impact our capital budgets, as far as increasing it. It's going to be within the levels we've talked already. We're encouraged with what we're seeing with the economics improvement and economics of IPTV, as costs come down, set-top box prices come down. We feel like it's going the right direction. The technology is working well. And we are looking forward to expanding that. I think we anticipate about $30 million of additional costs this year, operating cost that's in our outlook. So we believe IPTV is an important part of our future, and we'll be looking for ways to continue to expand our investment and the rollout of this product in the months ahead.

We're pleased with our results for the quarter as we exceeded our expectations for both revenues and earnings. We also achieved very strong high-speed Internet additions and saw significant improvement in access lines losses, especially in the urban Embarq markets. 
We continue to be excited about the transaction between CenturyLink and Qwest. The transaction is truly transformative in that it creates a national industry-leading communications company with significant scale and scope. The combined company will be even more competitive with an operating presence in 37 states, with approximately 5 million broadband customers and 17 million access lines. 
I'm confident the transaction will provide significant benefits for all of our shareholders, our customers and the communities that we serve. We'll have the scale and national scope to provide a compelling array of broadband product and services to our entire customer base. We expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to free cash flow per share, excluding integration costs, while strengthening the sustainability of CenturyLink's dividend by lowering the company's payout ratio. We have begun the integration process and expect to have the vast majority of all required regulatory filings completed before the end of this month. And I look forward to updating you in the months ahead, as we bring these two great companies together.
Moving to Slide 7 in the deck. We're pleased to report solid financial and operating results for the first quarter. First, operating revenues exceeded increased $1.8 billion for the quarter, which is at the top end of our previous guidance. There were several factors contributed to our strong operating revenues for the quarter. First, we experienced a significant sequential and year-over-year improvement in the rate of access line loss. We also achieved stronger-than-anticipated high-speed Internet customer additions during the quarter. Additionally, we saw an improvement in our access minutes of use trends compared to our original estimates for the quarter. And finally, we experienced a higher-than-anticipated data circuit demand from wireless providers adding capacity to their networks to handle increasing wireless data traffic.
Diluted earnings per share excluding nonrecurring items was $0.93 per share for the quarter or $0.05 per share above the top end of our previous guidance of $0.88 per share and $0.07 ahead of the August census [ph] estimates of $0.86 per share. 
Now several factors contributed to this outperformance during the first quarter:  First, the revenue performance outlined a moment ago was a contributing factor; additionally, we have been able to achieve synergies from the Embarq acquisition earlier than we originally anticipated; and finally, our employees continue to do an excellent job in containing operating cost across our business. 
We also generated strong free cash flow of $465 million excluding nonrecurring items during the first quarter, which represents the highest quarterly free cash flow generation in the history of our company. When we announced the Embarq transaction in October 2008, we had originally anticipated approximately $300 million of full run rate operating expense synergies. After further diligence and deeper insight into the benefits of the merger in 2009, we updated the anticipated operating expense synergies to $375 million. We achieved approximately $20 million of incremental synergies during the first quarter, which brings annualized operating expense synergy run rate to approximately $270 million. We currently expect to exit 2010 at approximately $300 million annualized operating expense synergy run rate.
Turning to Slide 8 in the deck. We had high-speed Internet customer additions of approximately 70,000, which represents a 50% sequential improvement over fourth quarter 2009 high-speed Internet additions, and a 10% improvement over pro forma in first quarter 2009 adds. We ended the quarter with 2,306,000 HSI customers or 38.9% penetration of our broadband-enabled access lines and about 35% of total addressable access lines. Our first quarter line loss of approximately 125,700 represents a 14% sequential improvement over fourth quarter 2009 access line losses and a 26.5% improvement over pro forma first quarter 2009 access line losses  
In the Embarq markets, we have seen significant improvements in key customer service metrics. Commitments met, appointments met and out of service cleared in 24 hours over the past nine months: We've seen improvement in all of those areas. We also continue to experience strong demand for our video bundles, that we added more than 33,000 satellite videos customers during the quarter. We continue to develop our IPTV capabilities in Columbia and Jefferson City, Missouri and La Crosse, Wisconsin and we are pleased with the results in these markets. Now we're in the preliminary stages of launching IPTV service in two additional markets, and we expect to roll out IPTV service in a total of five new markets by early 2011.
Slide 9 shows the time line illustrating the steady progress we've made towards fully integrating the Embarq operations. In the months between our announcement of the Embarq acquisition and the close of the transaction, we worked diligently to put our region operating model in place in all our markets in day one, and also, we're ready to go with new broadband product offers. This readiness from day one contributed to the strong performance we reported for the third quarter of 2009, our first quarter as CenturyLink.
Within four months after close, we have converted 100% of our financial and HR systems. We've lost our new brand and completed a first legacy Embarq customer conversion for our billing and customer care system. With the recent completion of the billing and customer care conversion of the North Carolina market, and 25% of the Embarq customer base converted to CenturyLink's billing system and customer care platform, we have a clear path to completing 100% of the Embarq customers to CenturyLink's systems by the third quarter of 2011, so we're very pleased with where we are with the conversion process.
We currently expect to have fully completed the migration of the Embarq long-distance traffic to our network but midyear 2011, as well. We have an additional large customer conversion scheduled for later this year and expect to have about 50% of the legacy Embarq customers converted by year end 2010. As we have announced, we expect to complete the Qwest transaction in the first half of 2011, and we believe beginning the Qwest integration will dovetail nicely with our expected completion of the Embarq integration in late 2011. As we stated during our call announcing the Qwest transaction, we expect the Qwest integration and synergy realization to occur over a three- to five-year period.
As we see on Slide 10, we have experienced a significant improvement in the level of access line losses both year-over-year and sequentially over the three quarters that we reported since the close of the Embarq transaction. Our first quarter 2010 line loss of 125,700 access lines represents a 14% improvement over the 146,000 loss in the third quarter, a 26.5% improvement over pro forma first quarter 2009. This rate of improvement is particularly dramatic if you look at our pro forma 193,000 access line losses in the fourth quarter of 2008. 
We have seen a significant decrease in announced or disconnect orders in both the consumer and business segments, which we believe is due to the success of our bundled offerings, our value-based marketing strategy and the modestly improving economy, at least in some areas. We've also increased our focus on non-customers, a couple cord cutters and strengthening our distribution channels really across-the-board.
Turning to Slide 11. We also have seen a strong improvement in the rate of growth in broadband subscribers, as demand for broadband remained strong and customers responded well to our pure broadband offers and our local operating model. Our first quarter 2010 net adds of 70,000 represents a sequential improvement of 50% and a 10% year-over-year improvement. The growth we've seen since closing the Embarq acquisition continues to be driven, primarily, by aggressive broadband strategy, our launch of pure broadband and our targeted marketing strategy. We're pleased with the strong high-speed Internet growth over the last several quarters. However, it is important to note that with the much higher penetration rate today versus a year ago, we expect it to be more difficult to maintain this rate of growth going forward.
Also, in line with past second quarter trends, normally seen across our industry, we expect second quarter high-speed Internet net additions to be in the range of 32,000 to 36,000. However, keep in mind that this will still represent a 20% to 25% improvement over the second quarter of 2009. For CenturyLink, the normal second quarter seasonality is impacted, in particular, by the migration of Florida wintertime residents returning home to the northern states.
Going to Slide 12. Access line performance and high-speed Internet customer growth trend in our top urban markets have been strong since July 1, 2009 closing, as we experienced a significant decline in the rate of access line loss and a turnaround in high-speed Internet customer growth in those markets. Now we believe the implementation of CenturyLink's regional operating model with local market accountability and our targeted sales and marketing approach, along with a modestly improving economy have been key drivers of this turnaround. The 20 general managers responsible for local market operations across our five regions are responsible on a day-to-day basis for serving our existing customers and driving new customer additions.
From a go-to-market standpoint, we've made significant changes in the marketing approach utilized in these markets, introduced a new product and service offering to stimulate customer demand. It's important to note that the changes in market strategy have not been just consumer focused but have also focused on the enterprise side of our business. For instance, our core network provides a national IP overlay that's been valuable in attracting new business customers with locations both in market and out of market.
I'll now turn the call over to Stewart for additional financial highlights and the review of our second quarter and full year 2010 guidance. Stewart?"

Thank you, Glen. During the next few minutes, I will review highlights of our first quarter 2010 operating results and make a few brief remarks regarding our capital structure, and I will conclude my comments this morning with a discussion of second quarter and full year 2010 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.
Turning to Slide 14. Since we reported significant nonrecurring or one-time items during the first quarter, I want to make a few remarks regarding those items before I discuss the first quarter normalized results with you. First, we incurred approximately $21.5 million of pretax expenses or about $0.045 per share related to integration expenses associated with the Embarq integration. Second, we incurred approximately $15 million pretax or about $0.03 per share of Embarq transaction severance-related costs during the quarter. And last, we recognized $4 million in the income tax charge or about one penny a share due to a change in the tax treatment of Medicare Part D reimbursement.
In the aggregate, these items represent the $0.09 difference in normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.93 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.84. Also this quarter, we changed the revenue line item reporting of subscriber line charges from where it was previously reported as network access revenue to where it is now reported as voice revenue. Additionally, we included fiber and CLEC revenue in other revenue. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect these reclassifications.
Now moving on to Slide 15. Due to the size of the impact of the Embarq acquisition on first quarter 2010 results as compared to first quarter 2009 results, I'll not discuss the percentage increases between first quarter a year ago and first quarter this year. However, I do want to point out that if you look at the percentage change column on this slide, the good news is that we were able to translate the increased revenues from Embarq into larger percentage increases in operating cash flow and net income. Also, please note that the last page of the financial schedules accompanying our earnings release this morning reflects CenturyLink's first quarter 2010 results excluding nonrecurring items compared to pro forma results for first quarter 2009, assuming the Embarq acquisition had been completed then.
Now turning our attention to results for first quarter 2010 compared to first quarter 2009 results, excluding nonrecurring items from both periods, as outlined in our financial schedules. For first quarter 2010, operating revenues increased $1.165 billion to $1.8 billion from $635.4 million in first quarter 2009. The Embarq acquisition contributed operating revenues of $1,255,000,000 during the quarter. Additionally, it is important to remember that effective July 1, 2009, CenturyLink began eliminating revenues and corresponding expenses each quarter associated with the discontinuance of regulatory accounting for certain regulated operating entities. The amount of revenues and corresponding expenses eliminated in first quarter 2010 was $51.8 million. First quarter 2009 results do not reflect these same eliminations, due to the July 1, 2009 effective date of the discontinuance.
Cash operating expenses increased $535.7 million from $329.8 million in first quarter 2009 to $865.5 million in first quarter this year. Due to $593 million of cash operating cost associated with the Embarq acquisitions, which more than offset the reduction in operating cost associated with the discontinuance of regulatory accounting for certain regulated operating entities that I mentioned earlier. 
For first quarter 2010, we generated an operating cash flow margin of 51.9% compared to 48.1% in first quarter 2009. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $353.2 million in first quarter 2010 from $127.6 million in first quarter 2009, primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization associated with the Embarq acquisition, which more than offset depreciation expense declines associated with assets becoming fully depreciated. 
Net income attributable to CenturyLink for the quarter was $279.2 million compared to $81.9 million in first quarter 2009. Diluted EPS for the quarter increased 13.4% to $0.93 from $0.82 in first quarter a year ago. As Glen mentioned earlier, we generated strong free cash flow of more than $465 million during the quarter compared to approximately $164 million in first quarter 2009.
Now turning to Slide 16. From a capital structure standpoint, CenturyLink remains very well positioned. As we stated in our fourth quarter 2009 earnings call in late February, we elected to make a $300 million contribution to one of our pension plans during the first quarter of this year. 
As of March 31, 2010, and after having made that pension contribution, CenturyLink's debt-to-equity ratio was 0.81:1 and net debt to first quarter 2010 annualized operating cash flow was 2.0x. As we mentioned last quarter, our debt maturities are very manageable, with maturities of approximately $500 million, $20 million and $330 million in 2010, '11, and '12, respectively, excluding the pending Qwest merger.
As we also previously stated, we intend to pay off the $500 million of senior notes that mature in October of this year. Our next significant debt maturity tower, excluding the pending Qwest transaction, is approximately $2 billion in 2016. So we continue to generate strong cash flows, maintain a solid balance sheet and have very manageable maturities over the next several years. We are confident that our financial strength and liquidity provide us the financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities and meet challenges as they arrive. 
Finally, on Slide 17, I would like to discuss the second quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance provided in our press release this morning. As a reminder, costs incurred by CenturyLink during 2010 related to the Embarq integration are considered nonrecurring items. These costs, along with any other nonrecurring items that may occur during 2010, are excluded from the diluted earnings per share guidance provided in our press release and in my comments regarding second quarter and full year 2010 diluted earnings per share guidance. Additionally, our second quarter and full year guidance also excludes any transaction or integration costs that may be incurred related to the pending Qwest transaction. 
With those points in mind, we are updating our 2010 guidance to reflect our first quarter results and our expectations for the remainder of the year. We expect operating revenues for the year to be 6.5% to 7.5% lower than 2009 pro forma operating revenues. Our previous guidance was a decline of 7.5% to 8.5%. The improvement is a result of better-than-originally anticipated access line and broadband customer results, data and business revenue opportunities, slower migration of a wireless carrier's traffic off of our network and improved access minutes of use trends. 
If you remember last quarter, we indicated that excluding the unusual items, 2010 revenue would have declined 5.5% to 6.5%. Now basically excluding those items, revenue would have declined 4.5% to 5.5% on a pro forma basis, again, assuming the Embarq transaction had closed January 1, 2009.
Our first quarter performance and the expected improvement in revenue during the remainder of the year results in a $50 million increase in the range of our free cash flow guidance, which is now $1.525 billion to $1.575 billion, and an increase in our range of diluted earnings per share guidance of $0.10, which now moves to $3.20 to $3.30 per share. We continue to expect 2010 capital expenditures to be in the range of $825 million to $875 million. 
For the second quarter, we expect operating revenues to be in the range of $1.745 billion to $1.775 billion. We expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.86. The sequential decline in diluted EPS from first quarter to second quarter is due to the expected access line and access minutes decline, partially offset by growth in revenue from high-speed Internet customers. Additionally, as you'll recall, we typically have a seasonal increase in maintenance expense and related outside plant activities in the second quarter.
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. At this time, I'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call."

But I was wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about that balance of integration and cost cutting. And then the second question, if I could, Glen, when you see a result out from Qwest today, presumably it's not a surprise to you, but 37.9% EBITDA margins and rising, is there any part of you that gets nervous that the integration synergies that you are trying to get three to five years from now are something that the Qwest management team will start to carve out sooner rather than later in order to get the guidance that they've put out there?

Overall, we support the direction that the FCC is taking, reforming some of the key policies, such as universal service, intercarrier comp and compensation for VoIP traffic, Voice over IP traffic. Also, I think the recent comments from Chairman Genachowski are encouraging and he has pointed out the need for steady and measured reform [ph] over a reasonable transition period. Also talked about the need to avoid a flash cut approach with the process, and we agree with this. We will [indiscernible] participate in this process and industry needs reform here that provides more clarity, more stability and greater predictability in terms of making network infrastructure investments. So we look forward to this process. And as far as impact on ARPU and revenue, we don't have any use of that [ph] today. We think it will be a process over time. I think there'll be a, specifically, a more focus on support of broadband, the universal service versus voice. So we think that change will occur and could be positive for us in bringing higher speed especially to a lot of these rural markets that we serve. Concerning the IPTV, especially in the five markets, as far as the incremental capital costs, it won't impact our capital budget, as far as increasing it. It will be within the levels we've talked about already. We're encouraged what we're seeing with the economics improvement and economics of IPTV, as costs come down, set-top box prices come down. We feel like it's going the right direction. The technology is working well. And we are looking forward to expanding. I think we anticipate about $30 million of additional costs this year, operating cost that's in our outlook. So we believe IPTV is an important part of our future, and we'll be looking for ways to continue to expand our investment and the rollout of this product in the months ahead."

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's second quarter 2010 operating results and selected operational updates, as well as our guidance for the remainder of 2010. We achieved solid results for the quarter as we re",1770,"Thank you, Tony. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's second quarter 2010 operating results and selected operational updates, as well as our guidance for the remainder of 2010. 
We achieved solid results for the quarter as we realized operating revenues near the upper end of previous guidance and diluted earnings per share that exceeded previous guidance and first call consensus for the quarter. We also achieved solid high-speed Internet additions and continue to see significant improvement in year-over-year access line losses, primarily driven by improved line loss results in the legacy Embarq markets. The Integration of Embarq continues to proceed well, and we continue to make good progress obtaining the approvals necessary to complete the pending Qwest transaction, another transformative acquisition for CenturyLink.
Moving to Slide 7 in the deck. We are pleased to report solid financial and operating results for the second quarter. Operating revenues of $1.77 billion for the quarter, near the top end of our previous guidance range for the second quarter. There were several factors that contributed to this revenue performance for the quarter. First, we experienced lower access line loss during the quarter that we had previously anticipated. We also continue to see revenue growth from high-speed Internet customer additions, and we experienced higher-than-anticipated data circuit demand from wireless providers, adding capacity to their networks to handle increasing wireless data traffic.
Diluted earnings per share excluding nonrecurring items is $0.88 per share for the quarter, an increase of 6% over the second quarter 2009. This is a $0.03 per share above the top end of our previous guidance and first call consensus of $0.85 per share. Several factors contributed to this outperformance during the second quarter. First, the revenue performance that I outlined a moment ago. Second, we continue to achieve synergies from the Embarq acquisition earlier than we originally anticipated. And finally, our employees continue to do an excellent job in containing operating costs across our business. 
Our cash flows remain strong as we generated free cash flow of more than $428 million excluding nonrecurring items during the second quarter. 
Additionally, we achieved approximately $75 million of total operating expense synergies associated with the Embarq integration during the second quarter. We attributed about $10 million in incremental synergies when compared to the first quarter of 2010. As of June 30, we had achieved an annualized operating expense synergy run rate of approximately $315 million. We currently expect to exit 2010 at approximately $330 million annualized operating expense synergy run rate. You recall that we originally anticipated approximately $300 million of full run rate operating expense synergies when we announced the Embarq transaction in October 2008, and that in August 2009, we updated that synergy target to $375 million as a further diligence and deeper insight in the benefits of this merger.
Turning to Slide 8 in the deck. The Embarq acquisition, along with our specific marketing strategies, improved CenturyLink's year-over-year revenue mix by decreasing our reliance on access revenues. Additionally, revenues from data services accounted for 26.7% of second quarter 2010 total operating revenues compared to 22.5% in second quarter of 2009. Also, access revenues represented only 15.5% of total operating revenues in the second quarter of 2010 and reflects the company's lower reliance on network access-related revenues.
We continue to experience growth in data revenue, driven primarily by the year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet customers and increased demand by business and wholesale customers for high bandwidth services. And we remain focused to positioning CenturyLink as the broadband provider of choice in our markets by enhancing our broadband product portfolio through deploying higher speeds in key markets and expanding availability of ethernet and IP-based product offerings.
Now turning to Slide 9, I'll cover a few additional highlights for the quarter. First, we added more than 29,000 high-speed Internet customers during the quarter as demand for broadband remains solid and customers continue to respond well through our broadband offers. Our targeted marketing strategy and our regional operating model that place the sales and service are closer to our customers. 
Our high-speed Internet additions were a little below our guidance of 32,000 to 36,000, primarily due to continued economic issues and seasonality impacts due to our success with Snowbird and students in prior quarters. Our performance in the second quarter still represents an improvement over pro forma high-speed Internet additions in the second quarter a year ago. 
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,336,000 high-speed Internet subscribers or 39.9% penetration of our broadband-enabled access lines and approximately 36.3% penetration of total addressable access lines. We are pleased that we had been able to add more than 190,000 high-speed Internet customers since closing the Embarq acquisition, representing approximately 9% year-over-year growth in total high-speed Internet customers.
Our second quarter line loss of approximately 146,300 was better than we had anticipated going into the quarter, and it represents a 22% improvement over pro forma second quarter 2009 access line losses. We continue to see a decline in outs or disconnect orders in both the Consumer and Business segments, which we believe is attributable to a more stable economy, resulting in a fewer moves, less business-line downsizing and fewer competitive ports. 
We have also increased our focus on non-customer/cord cutters and strengthened our distribution channels. We are pleased that we have been successful in reducing our rate of line loss for the trailing 12 months in the June 30, 2010, to 8%, a significant improvement from the 9.3% pro forma trailing 12 months line loss just a year ago.
We also continue to experience strong demand for our video bundles as we added more than 26,000 satellite video customers, ending the quarter with more than 594,000 satellite video customers. Our satellite video agreement with EchoStar/Dish expired July 31, 2010, and effective August 1, CenturyLink will begin offering DirecTV satellites television services to customers across our 33-state offering footprint. DirecTV has a record of quality customer service and additional features, such as NFL Sunday Ticket and Whole-Home DVR capabilities that will offer additional benefits to our customers. CenturyLink's Dish customers will continue to receive the Dish services they have today for as long as those customers choose to maintain that relationship. 
We also continue to develop our IPTV capabilities in Columbia and Jefferson City, Missouri and La Crosse, Wisconsin. We're utilizing a multiple pair and pair bonding over ADSL2+ and VDSL2 on longer loop links in La Crosse and Jefferson City, enabling us to expand our addressable households in these markets.
All these markets received a national content from our Columbia, Missouri video impact for head in over our national fiber network, and we remain pleased with the results in all of these markets and are in the preliminary stages of launching IPTV service in Las Vegas. Additionally, we continue to expect to rollout IPTV service in four additional markets by midyear 2011, bringing CenturyLink's total IPTV markets and service to eight at that time.
Moving to Slide 10. Access line performance and the high-speed Internet customer growth trend in our top urban markets improved significantly in second quarter 2010 compared to pro forma second quarter 2009. 
In these markets, we experienced a 26% improvement in average access line loss year-over-year and approximately 108% improvement in average high-speed Internet growth year-over-year. We believe the implementation of CenturyLink's regional offering model with local market accountability and our targeted sales and marketing approach, along with a more stable economy, have been key drivers of this turnaround. From a go-to-market standpoint, we've made significant changes in the marketing approach, utilizing these markets and also introduced new products and service offerings to stimulate customer demands.
Now turning to Slide 11. Our employees continue to do an excellent job of containing costs, which contributed to the generation of strong cash flows during the quarter in spite of a very competitive marketplace and economic conditions that remained challenging. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, are more than $922 million, represents an operating cash flow margin of 52% versus 47.8% in the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, we returned nearly $219 million of the $428 million of free cash flow generated during the quarter to shareholders in the form of cash dividends, representing a 51% payout ratio.
Turning to Slide 12. The integration of Embarq continues to progress well. We are pleased that we have been able to achieve operating expense synergies in the Embarq merger faster than we originally anticipated, as well as the improvements we've realized in line loss and high-speed Internet additions. We continue to expect to complete the building convergence of Embarq customers by the end of the third quarter of 2011, and we remain confident that we will also achieve our $375 million operating expense synergy target by late 2011.
Now moving to Slide 13. Planning for acquisition of Qwest Communications is underway, now that we completed the naming of our full senior leadership team, which can be found in our recently filed S-4. We file the required hot Hart-Scott-Rodino Notification and Report forms with the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission in June and received clearance on July 15, 2010, to proceed with the transaction. We have filed for merger approval with the Regulatory Commissions of 21 states and the District of Columbia, and to date, we received approval in six of those states. 
Application for Federal Communication Commission approval was filed in May and the formal reply comment periods have expired. Additionally, we filed our final joint proxy statement prospectus on July 19 at CenturyLink. CenturyLink and Qwest special shareholder meetings to vote on the merger is scheduled for August 24. We will continue to diligently work to obtain the remaining state and federal regulatory approvals, and we continue to anticipate a first half 2011 transaction close. 
As a reminder, the combination with Qwest would have resulted in pro forma 2009 revenues of $19.8 billion and expected to be immediately accretive to free cash flow per share, excluding integration costs, as the transaction should restrengthen the sustainability of CenturyLink's dividend, while materially lowering the company's payout ratio. The combination also creates a robust national 180,000-route mile fiber network. 
We expect to generate annual operating costs and the capital expenditures synergies of approximately $625 million, which we expect to be fully realized three to five years following closing. The combination of Qwest and CenturyLink will create that strong highly skilled employee base and will establish a national industry-leading communications company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Stewart for additional financial highlights and a review of our third quarter and full year 2010 guidance. Stew?"

During the next few minutes, I will review some highlights of our second quarter 2010 operating results and make a few brief remarks regarding our capital structure. I will conclude the comments this morning with a discussion of third quarter and full year 2010 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.
Now turning to Slide 15. Since we reported significant nonrecurring or onetime items during the second quarter, I want to briefly recap those items for you before I discuss the second quarter normalized results with you. First, we incurred approximately $18 million of pretax expenses or about $0.04 per share related to integration costs associated with the Embarq integration. Secondly, we incurred approximately $13.2 million or about $0.03 per share of severance costs during the quarter related to the Embarq transaction. And finally, we incurred approximately $10 million of pretax expenses or about $0.02 per share of costs related to the Qwest acquisition. In the aggregate, these items represent the $0.09 difference in normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.88 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.79.
Now moving to Slide 16. Due to the size of the Embarq acquisition on second quarter 2010 results compared to second quarter 2009 results, I will not discuss the percentage increases between the second quarter a year ago and second quarter this year. However, I do want to point out that if you look at the percentage change column of this slide, the good news is that we were able to translate the increased revenues from Embarq into even larger percentage increases in operating cash flow, net income and free cash flow. Also, please note that the last page of the financial schedules accompanying the earnings release this morning reflects CenturyLink's second quarter 2010 results excluding nonrecurring items compared to pro forma results for second quarter 2009, assuming the Embarq acquisition has been completed at the beginning of that quarter.
Now turning our attention to results for second quarter of 2010 compared to second quarter a year ago, excluding nonrecurring items for both periods as outlined in our financial schedules. For second quarter 2010, operating revenues increased nearly $1.14 billion to $1.77 billion from $634.5 million in second quarter 2009. The Embarq acquisition contributed operating revenues of $1.23 billion during the quarter. 
Additionally, it's important to remember that effective July 1, 2009, CenturyLink began eliminating revenues and corresponded the expenses each quarter associated with the discontinuance of regulatory accounting for certain regulated operating entities. The amount of revenues and corresponding expenses eliminated in second quarter of 2010 was $54 million. Second quarter 2009 results do not reflect the same eliminations due to the July 1, 2009, effective date of discontinuance.
Cash operating expenses increased from $330.9 million in second quarter 2009 to $850 million from second quarter this year, primarily due to $580 million of cash operating expenses associated with the Embarq acquisition, which more than offset the reduction in operating costs associated with the discontinuance of regulatory accounting, that I mentioned earlier, and synergies achieved from the Embarq integration. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to nearly $358 million in second quarter 2010 from $128.6 million in second quarter 2009, primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization associated with the Embarq acquisition, which more than offset depreciation expense declines associated with assets becoming fully depreciated.
Net income attributable to CenturyLink for the quarter was $265.7 million compared to $83.3 million in second quarter a year ago. Diluted EPS for the quarter increased 6% to $0.88 from $0.83 in second quarter 2009, and free cash flow increased from $126.5 million in second quarter 2009 to $428.6 million in the second quarter of 2010.
Turning to Slide 17. We have been successful in generating stronger year-over-year operating cash flow and operating income margins compared to pro forma 2009 results. Our operating cash flow margin improved to 52% in second quarter of 2010 from 50.7% on a pro forma basis for second quarter 2009. While reported pro forma operating cash flow margin was 48.7%, the pro forma 50.7% includes an adjustment to eliminate revenues and expenses related to the discontinuance of the regulatory accounting. Our operating income margin improved to 31.8% in second quarter 2010 from 31.2% on a pro forma basis for second quarter a year ago. 
From a capital structure standpoint, CenturyLink remains very well-positioned financially with a strong balance sheet. CenturyLink's debt to equity ratio at the end of June was 0.8:1, and net debt to second quarter 2010 annualized operating cash flow was 2.0x. We remain confident that our financial strength and liquidity provide us the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities and to meet challenges as they arise.
Finally on Slide 18. I would like to discuss the third quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance provided in our press release this morning. As a reminder, costs incurred by CenturyLink during 2010 related to the Embarq integration and any transaction or integration costs related to the pending Qwest transaction are considered nonrecurring items. These costs, along with any other nonrecurring items that may occur during 2010, are excluded from the diluted earnings per share guidance provided in our press release and in my comments regarding third quarter and full year 2010 diluted EPS guidance. 
With those points in mind, we are updating our 2010 guidance to reflect our second quarter results and our expectations for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect operating revenues for the year to be 6.5% to 7.5% lower than 2009 pro forma operating revenues. As you will recall, there are several onetime items that negatively impact the comparison of 2010 revenue with pro forma 2009 revenue. Accordingly, normalized revenue decline is still expected to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%.
Our favorable second quarter results and lower-than-previously-anticipated operating expenses result in an increase in the range of our free cash flow guidance for the full year of 2010 to $1.56 billion to $1.6 billion from $1.525 billion to $1.75 billion (sic) [$1.575 billion]. Based on this same favorable factors, we are also increasing the range for our diluted earnings per share for full year 2010 from $3.20 to $3.30 to a range of $3.30 to $3.40, an increase of $0.10 per share. We also continue to expect 2010 capital expenditures to be in the range of $825 million to $875 million. 
For the third quarter 2010, we expect operating revenues to be in the range of $1.72 million to $1.745 billion, and we expect diluted earnings per share for third quarter 2010 to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.81. The sequential decline in diluted EPS from second quarter to third quarter is due to anticipated declines in access lines and access minutes of use, along with higher operating expenses, primarily due to seasonality and outside plant maintenance and increased advertising expense.
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. At this time, we'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

With our transaction, with the strong financial results and the cash flows and the balance sheet that we have, we don't expect the type of scrutiny that some transactions have been through, but we will have it. They're going to push for -- they were willing to understand the benefits of the transaction due to the consumers, businesses and we think those are clear in this transaction.  We could in the states over the last -- all we can talk about is the last states last time, I think Washington and Oregon were two latter states to approve with Embarq transaction. They may or may not be this time, but it's difficult to predict. But for the last time, those were two of the latter states that we've received approval. And we don't anticipate significant problems, but there will be a lot of questions, a lot of issues before we get this done. David, regarding the timetable of Embarq integration and Qwest integration, I'm not sure if you're asking if there are issues with the overlap. Anything to do with overlap is certainly -- it's a lot of pressure on employees, but we are anticipating that and we realized we've said in the beginning, we will not be making the transition, the conversions to billing systems and all the systems that's quickly, with Qwest and we have with Embarq due to the continued work for the Embarq integration, but we will hit those conversions done over time. There are -- as far as the market is concerned, they have the larger markets. Qwest even have a larger market than Embarq, but we do believe that our local operating model are a little bit different than go-to-market strategies can be impactful here in these markets and as they have been in Las Vegas and Orlando and Tallahassee. We think we can see some results here with that different approach and more of a local market flavor. Qwest is doing a good job. We just think that -- a little different approach could have as it has with Embarq. So we believe -- we're confident we will see some improvements there. We expect also to have a lot of benefits in the Enterprise business.

Of course, the National Broadband Plan was released in March and they did organize the commissions work around broadband. It really touched nearly every subject on the FCC's jurisdiction. It's established a timetable for the FCC's consideration of the issues over the next two years, possible steps in more than 60 or so items over the next year. The Broadband Plan addresses broadband deployment and adoption initiatives as well as uniform service, intercarrier compensation, such as force net neutrality and a good compensation reform, special access, all those things are in there. Obviously, it's hard to predict the ultimate outcome on these issues. We do believe the FCC is likely to take a pro-consumer, pro-competition approach, particularly with respect to policies that affect Consumer Internet experience and the access to content where this online applications or access to programming. We also expect USF support to shift to broadband deployment, which we believe is the right direction overall. We think that moves on the right direction. We're concerned about the Title II efforts, of course, as everyone in our industry is. It was really a matter of how that's implemented though, and we believe that there will caution taken here and definitely that will be. I just believe the commission and the Chairman will be careful about implementing that. But we are very concerned that, that negative ruling there -- we have a totally open Internet, could impact or would impact investment, Internet and we'd -- all I care is we consider their commitment, investing in the network, if some of the proposed plan for adopted. But I think it won't be plans cut there, I think we'll have reasonable come out of the commission.

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's second quarter 2010 operating results and selected operational updates, as well as our guidance for the remainder of 2010. We achieved solid results for the quarter as we re",1770,"Thank you, Tony. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's second quarter 2010 operating results and selected operational updates, as well as our guidance for the remainder of 2010. 
We achieved solid results for the quarter as we realized operating revenues near the upper end of previous guidance and diluted earnings per share that exceeded previous guidance and first call consensus for the quarter. We also achieved solid high-speed Internet additions and continue to see significant improvement in year-over-year access line losses, primarily driven by improved line loss results in the legacy Embarq markets. The Integration of Embarq continues to proceed well, and we continue to make good progress obtaining the approvals necessary to complete the pending Qwest transaction, another transformative acquisition for CenturyLink.
Moving to Slide 7 in the deck. We are pleased to report solid financial and operating results for the second quarter. Operating revenues of $1.77 billion for the quarter, near the top end of our previous guidance range for the second quarter. There were several factors that contributed to this revenue performance for the quarter. First, we experienced lower access line loss during the quarter that we had previously anticipated. We also continue to see revenue growth from high-speed Internet customer additions, and we experienced higher-than-anticipated data circuit demand from wireless providers, adding capacity to their networks to handle increasing wireless data traffic.
Diluted earnings per share excluding nonrecurring items is $0.88 per share for the quarter, an increase of 6% over the second quarter 2009. This is a $0.03 per share above the top end of our previous guidance and first call consensus of $0.85 per share. Several factors contributed to this outperformance during the second quarter. First, the revenue performance that I outlined a moment ago. Second, we continue to achieve synergies from the Embarq acquisition earlier than we originally anticipated. And finally, our employees continue to do an excellent job in containing operating costs across our business. 
Our cash flows remain strong as we generated free cash flow of more than $428 million excluding nonrecurring items during the second quarter. 
Additionally, we achieved approximately $75 million of total operating expense synergies associated with the Embarq integration during the second quarter. We attributed about $10 million in incremental synergies when compared to the first quarter of 2010. As of June 30, we had achieved an annualized operating expense synergy run rate of approximately $315 million. We currently expect to exit 2010 at approximately $330 million annualized operating expense synergy run rate. You recall that we originally anticipated approximately $300 million of full run rate operating expense synergies when we announced the Embarq transaction in October 2008, and that in August 2009, we updated that synergy target to $375 million as a further diligence and deeper insight in the benefits of this merger.
Turning to Slide 8 in the deck. The Embarq acquisition, along with our specific marketing strategies, improved CenturyLink's year-over-year revenue mix by decreasing our reliance on access revenues. Additionally, revenues from data services accounted for 26.7% of second quarter 2010 total operating revenues compared to 22.5% in second quarter of 2009. Also, access revenues represented only 15.5% of total operating revenues in the second quarter of 2010 and reflects the company's lower reliance on network access-related revenues.
We continue to experience growth in data revenue, driven primarily by the year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet customers and increased demand by business and wholesale customers for high bandwidth services. And we remain focused to positioning CenturyLink as the broadband provider of choice in our markets by enhancing our broadband product portfolio through deploying higher speeds in key markets and expanding availability of ethernet and IP-based product offerings.
Now turning to Slide 9, I'll cover a few additional highlights for the quarter. First, we added more than 29,000 high-speed Internet customers during the quarter as demand for broadband remains solid and customers continue to respond well through our broadband offers. Our targeted marketing strategy and our regional operating model that place the sales and service are closer to our customers. 
Our high-speed Internet additions were a little below our guidance of 32,000 to 36,000, primarily due to continued economic issues and seasonality impacts due to our success with Snowbird and students in prior quarters. Our performance in the second quarter still represents an improvement over pro forma high-speed Internet additions in the second quarter a year ago. 
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,336,000 high-speed Internet subscribers or 39.9% penetration of our broadband-enabled access lines and approximately 36.3% penetration of total addressable access lines. We are pleased that we had been able to add more than 190,000 high-speed Internet customers since closing the Embarq acquisition, representing approximately 9% year-over-year growth in total high-speed Internet customers.
Our second quarter line loss of approximately 146,300 was better than we had anticipated going into the quarter, and it represents a 22% improvement over pro forma second quarter 2009 access line losses. We continue to see a decline in outs or disconnect orders in both the Consumer and Business segments, which we believe is attributable to a more stable economy, resulting in a fewer moves, less business-line downsizing and fewer competitive ports. 
We have also increased our focus on non-customer/cord cutters and strengthened our distribution channels. We are pleased that we have been successful in reducing our rate of line loss for the trailing 12 months in the June 30, 2010, to 8%, a significant improvement from the 9.3% pro forma trailing 12 months line loss just a year ago.
We also continue to experience strong demand for our video bundles as we added more than 26,000 satellite video customers, ending the quarter with more than 594,000 satellite video customers. Our satellite video agreement with EchoStar/Dish expired July 31, 2010, and effective August 1, CenturyLink will begin offering DirecTV satellites television services to customers across our 33-state offering footprint. DirecTV has a record of quality customer service and additional features, such as NFL Sunday Ticket and Whole-Home DVR capabilities that will offer additional benefits to our customers. CenturyLink's Dish customers will continue to receive the Dish services they have today for as long as those customers choose to maintain that relationship. 
We also continue to develop our IPTV capabilities in Columbia and Jefferson City, Missouri and La Crosse, Wisconsin. We're utilizing a multiple pair and pair bonding over ADSL2+ and VDSL2 on longer loop links in La Crosse and Jefferson City, enabling us to expand our addressable households in these markets.
All these markets received a national content from our Columbia, Missouri video impact for head in over our national fiber network, and we remain pleased with the results in all of these markets and are in the preliminary stages of launching IPTV service in Las Vegas. Additionally, we continue to expect to rollout IPTV service in four additional markets by midyear 2011, bringing CenturyLink's total IPTV markets and service to eight at that time.
Moving to Slide 10. Access line performance and the high-speed Internet customer growth trend in our top urban markets improved significantly in second quarter 2010 compared to pro forma second quarter 2009. 
In these markets, we experienced a 26% improvement in average access line loss year-over-year and approximately 108% improvement in average high-speed Internet growth year-over-year. We believe the implementation of CenturyLink's regional offering model with local market accountability and our targeted sales and marketing approach, along with a more stable economy, have been key drivers of this turnaround. From a go-to-market standpoint, we've made significant changes in the marketing approach, utilizing these markets and also introduced new products and service offerings to stimulate customer demands.
Now turning to Slide 11. Our employees continue to do an excellent job of containing costs, which contributed to the generation of strong cash flows during the quarter in spite of a very competitive marketplace and economic conditions that remained challenging. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, are more than $922 million, represents an operating cash flow margin of 52% versus 47.8% in the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, we returned nearly $219 million of the $428 million of free cash flow generated during the quarter to shareholders in the form of cash dividends, representing a 51% payout ratio.
Turning to Slide 12. The integration of Embarq continues to progress well. We are pleased that we have been able to achieve operating expense synergies in the Embarq merger faster than we originally anticipated, as well as the improvements we've realized in line loss and high-speed Internet additions. We continue to expect to complete the building convergence of Embarq customers by the end of the third quarter of 2011, and we remain confident that we will also achieve our $375 million operating expense synergy target by late 2011.
Now moving to Slide 13. Planning for acquisition of Qwest Communications is underway, now that we completed the naming of our full senior leadership team, which can be found in our recently filed S-4. We file the required hot Hart-Scott-Rodino Notification and Report forms with the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission in June and received clearance on July 15, 2010, to proceed with the transaction. We have filed for merger approval with the Regulatory Commissions of 21 states and the District of Columbia, and to date, we received approval in six of those states. 
Application for Federal Communication Commission approval was filed in May and the formal reply comment periods have expired. Additionally, we filed our final joint proxy statement prospectus on July 19 at CenturyLink. CenturyLink and Qwest special shareholder meetings to vote on the merger is scheduled for August 24. We will continue to diligently work to obtain the remaining state and federal regulatory approvals, and we continue to anticipate a first half 2011 transaction close. 
As a reminder, the combination with Qwest would have resulted in pro forma 2009 revenues of $19.8 billion and expected to be immediately accretive to free cash flow per share, excluding integration costs, as the transaction should restrengthen the sustainability of CenturyLink's dividend, while materially lowering the company's payout ratio. The combination also creates a robust national 180,000-route mile fiber network. 
We expect to generate annual operating costs and the capital expenditures synergies of approximately $625 million, which we expect to be fully realized three to five years following closing. The combination of Qwest and CenturyLink will create that strong highly skilled employee base and will establish a national industry-leading communications company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Stewart for additional financial highlights and a review of our third quarter and full year 2010 guidance. Stew?

During the next few minutes, I will review some highlights of our second quarter 2010 operating results and make a few brief remarks regarding our capital structure. I will conclude the comments this morning with a discussion of third quarter and full year 2010 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.
Now turning to Slide 15. Since we reported significant nonrecurring or onetime items during the second quarter, I want to briefly recap those items for you before I discuss the second quarter normalized results with you. First, we incurred approximately $18 million of pretax expenses or about $0.04 per share related to integration costs associated with the Embarq integration. Secondly, we incurred approximately $13.2 million or about $0.03 per share of severance costs during the quarter related to the Embarq transaction. And finally, we incurred approximately $10 million of pretax expenses or about $0.02 per share of costs related to the Qwest acquisition. In the aggregate, these items represent the $0.09 difference in normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.88 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.79.
Now moving to Slide 16. Due to the size of the Embarq acquisition on second quarter 2010 results compared to second quarter 2009 results, I will not discuss the percentage increases between the second quarter a year ago and second quarter this year. However, I do want to point out that if you look at the percentage change column of this slide, the good news is that we were able to translate the increased revenues from Embarq into even larger percentage increases in operating cash flow, net income and free cash flow. Also, please note that the last page of the financial schedules accompanying the earnings release this morning reflects CenturyLink's second quarter 2010 results excluding nonrecurring items compared to pro forma results for second quarter 2009, assuming the Embarq acquisition has been completed at the beginning of that quarter.
Now turning our attention to results for second quarter of 2010 compared to second quarter a year ago, excluding nonrecurring items for both periods as outlined in our financial schedules. For second quarter 2010, operating revenues increased nearly $1.14 billion to $1.77 billion from $634.5 million in second quarter 2009. The Embarq acquisition contributed operating revenues of $1.23 billion during the quarter. 
Additionally, it's important to remember that effective July 1, 2009, CenturyLink began eliminating revenues and corresponded the expenses each quarter associated with the discontinuance of regulatory accounting for certain regulated operating entities. The amount of revenues and corresponding expenses eliminated in second quarter of 2010 was $54 million. Second quarter 2009 results do not reflect the same eliminations due to the July 1, 2009, effective date of discontinuance.
Cash operating expenses increased from $330.9 million in second quarter 2009 to $850 million from second quarter this year, primarily due to $580 million of cash operating expenses associated with the Embarq acquisition, which more than offset the reduction in operating costs associated with the discontinuance of regulatory accounting, that I mentioned earlier, and synergies achieved from the Embarq integration. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to nearly $358 million in second quarter 2010 from $128.6 million in second quarter 2009, primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization associated with the Embarq acquisition, which more than offset depreciation expense declines associated with assets becoming fully depreciated.
Net income attributable to CenturyLink for the quarter was $265.7 million compared to $83.3 million in second quarter a year ago. Diluted EPS for the quarter increased 6% to $0.88 from $0.83 in second quarter 2009, and free cash flow increased from $126.5 million in second quarter 2009 to $428.6 million in the second quarter of 2010.
Turning to Slide 17. We have been successful in generating stronger year-over-year operating cash flow and operating income margins compared to pro forma 2009 results. Our operating cash flow margin improved to 52% in second quarter of 2010 from 50.7% on a pro forma basis for second quarter 2009. While reported pro forma operating cash flow margin was 48.7%, the pro forma 50.7% includes an adjustment to eliminate revenues and expenses related to the discontinuance of the regulatory accounting. Our operating income margin improved to 31.8% in second quarter 2010 from 31.2% on a pro forma basis for second quarter a year ago. 
From a capital structure standpoint, CenturyLink remains very well-positioned financially with a strong balance sheet. CenturyLink's debt to equity ratio at the end of June was 0.8:1, and net debt to second quarter 2010 annualized operating cash flow was 2.0x. We remain confident that our financial strength and liquidity provide us the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities and to meet challenges as they arise.
Finally on Slide 18. I would like to discuss the third quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance provided in our press release this morning. As a reminder, costs incurred by CenturyLink during 2010 related to the Embarq integration and any transaction or integration costs related to the pending Qwest transaction are considered nonrecurring items. These costs, along with any other nonrecurring items that may occur during 2010, are excluded from the diluted earnings per share guidance provided in our press release and in my comments regarding third quarter and full year 2010 diluted EPS guidance. 
With those points in mind, we are updating our 2010 guidance to reflect our second quarter results and our expectations for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect operating revenues for the year to be 6.5% to 7.5% lower than 2009 pro forma operating revenues. As you will recall, there are several onetime items that negatively impact the comparison of 2010 revenue with pro forma 2009 revenue. Accordingly, normalized revenue decline is still expected to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%.
Our favorable second quarter results and lower-than-previously-anticipated operating expenses result in an increase in the range of our free cash flow guidance for the full year of 2010 to $1.56 billion to $1.6 billion from $1.525 billion to $1.75 billion (sic) [$1.575 billion]. Based on this same favorable factors, we are also increasing the range for our diluted earnings per share for full year 2010 from $3.20 to $3.30 to a range of $3.30 to $3.40, an increase of $0.10 per share. We also continue to expect 2010 capital expenditures to be in the range of $825 million to $875 million. 
For the third quarter 2010, we expect operating revenues to be in the range of $1.72 million to $1.745 billion, and we expect diluted earnings per share for third quarter 2010 to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.81. The sequential decline in diluted EPS from second quarter to third quarter is due to anticipated declines in access lines and access minutes of use, along with higher operating expenses, primarily due to seasonality and outside plant maintenance and increased advertising expense.
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. At this time, we'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of the call.

With our transaction, with the strong financial results and the cash flows and the balance sheet that we have, we don't expect the type of scrutiny that some transactions have been through, but we will have it. They're going to push for -- they were willing to understand the benefits of the transaction due to the consumers, businesses and we think those are clear in this transaction.  We could in the states over the last -- all we can talk about is the last states last time, I think Washington and Oregon were two latter states to approve with Embarq transaction. They may or may not be this time, but it's difficult to predict. But for the last time, those were two of the latter states that we've received approval. And we don't anticipate significant problems, but there will be a lot of questions, a lot of issues before we get this done. David, regarding the timetable of Embarq integration and Qwest integration, I'm not sure if you're asking if there are issues with the overlap. Anything to do with overlap is certainly -- it's a lot of pressure on employees, but we are anticipating that and we realized we've said in the beginning, we will not be making the transition, the conversions to billing systems and all the systems that's quickly, with Qwest and we have with Embarq due to the continued work for the Embarq integration, but we will hit those conversions done over time. There are -- as far as the market is concerned, they have the larger markets. Qwest even have a larger market than Embarq, but we do believe that our local operating model are a little bit different than go-to-market strategies can be impactful here in these markets and as they have been in Las Vegas and Orlando and Tallahassee. We think we can see some results here with that different approach and more of a local market flavor. Qwest is doing a good job. We just think that -- a little different approach could have as it has with Embarq. So we believe -- we're confident we will see some improvements there. We expect also to have a lot of benefits in the Enterprise business. Their business markets group has -- we think has growth potential and looking forward to working with them once we get this combination complete.

Of course, the National Broadband Plan was released in March and they did organize the commissions work around broadband. It really touched nearly every subject on the FCC's jurisdiction. It's established a timetable for the FCC's consideration of the issues over the next two years, possible steps in more than 60 or so items over the next year. The Broadband Plan addresses broadband deployment and adoption initiatives as well as uniform service, intercarrier compensation, such as force net neutrality and a good compensation reform, special access, all those things are in there. Obviously, it's hard to predict the ultimate outcome on these issues. We do believe the FCC is likely to take a pro-consumer, pro-competition approach, particularly with respect to policies that affect Consumer Internet experience and the access to content where this online applications or access to programming. We also expect USF support to shift to broadband deployment, which we believe is the right direction overall. We think that moves on the right direction. We're concerned about the Title II efforts, of course, as everyone in our industry is. It was really a matter of how that's implemented though, and we believe that there will caution taken here and definitely that will be.

With respect to where we'll be by the end of 2010, with the next conversion, we'll have about 50% or so of the customer base converted from the legacy Embarq billing and customer care platform over to the legacy CenturyTel billing and customer care platform.

Obviously, the bonding I've just talked about is significant and helps a lot. Where we can get 25 megabits. For instance, we can have free three HDTV channels, plus a switch digital channel and three to five, six megabits of high-speed Internet. That's a favorite thing in use at once. So at that level, we feel that we're pretty competitively for some time. We realize that demand for bandwidth is going to continue, but we think we can be competitive. We bring new products at our local market approach and also in the business customers, we're bringing fiber more of our major business customers. So we're going to be very competitive in the business side of things. So it's a matter of what the consumer really wants and the relationship we can build there. Our goal is only -- broadband access to homes and businesses in all of our areas and we're working hard to do that and investing every month in deeper fiber access and also electronics to help us build those speeds and products.

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's second quarter 2010 operating results and selected operational updates, as well as our guidance for the remainder of 2010.

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's second quarter 2010 operating results and selected operational updates, as well as our guidance for the remainder of 2010. 
We achieved solid results for the quarter as we realized operating revenues near the upper end of previous guidance and diluted earnings per share that exceeded previous guidance and first call consensus for the quarter. We also achieved solid high-speed Internet additions and continue to see significant improvement in year-over-year access line losses, primarily driven by improved line loss results in the legacy Embarq markets. The Integration of Embarq continues to proceed well, and we continue to make good progress obtaining the approvals necessary to complete the pending Qwest transaction, another transformative acquisition for CenturyLink.
Moving to Slide 7 in the deck. We are pleased to report solid financial and operating results for the second quarter. Operating revenues of $1.77 billion for the quarter, near the top end of our previous guidance range for the second quarter. There were several factors that contributed to this revenue performance for the quarter. First, we experienced lower access line loss during the quarter that we had previously anticipated. We also continue to see revenue growth from high-speed Internet customer additions, and we experienced higher-than-anticipated data circuit demand from wireless providers, adding capacity to their networks to handle increasing wireless data traffic.
Diluted earnings per share excluding nonrecurring items is $0.88 per share for the quarter, an increase of 6% over the second quarter 2009. This is a $0.03 per share above the top end of our previous guidance and first call consensus of $0.85 per share. Several factors contributed to this outperformance during the second quarter. First, the revenue performance that I outlined a moment ago. Second, we continue to achieve synergies from the Embarq acquisition earlier than we originally anticipated. And finally, our employees continue to do an excellent job in containing operating costs across our business. 
Our cash flows remain strong as we generated free cash flow of more than $428 million excluding nonrecurring items during the second quarter. 
Additionally, we achieved approximately $75 million of total operating expense synergies associated with the Embarq integration during the second quarter. We attributed about $10 million in incremental synergies when compared to the first quarter of 2010. As of June 30, we had achieved an annualized operating expense synergy run rate of approximately $315 million. We currently expect to exit 2010 at approximately $330 million annualized operating expense synergy run rate. 
You recall that we originally anticipated approximately $300 million of full run rate operating expense synergies when we announced the Embarq transaction in October 2008, and that in August 2009, we updated that synergy target to $375 million as a further diligence and deeper insight in the benefits of this merger.
Turning to Slide 8 in the deck. The Embarq acquisition, along with our specific marketing strategies, improved CenturyLink's year-over-year revenue mix by decreasing our reliance on access revenues. Additionally, revenues from data services accounted for 26.7% of second quarter 2010 total operating revenues compared to 22.5% in second quarter of 2009. Also, access revenues represented only 15.5% of total operating revenues in the second quarter of 2010 and reflects the company's lower reliance on network access-related revenues.
We continue to experience growth in data revenue, driven primarily by the year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet customers and increased demand by business and wholesale customers for high bandwidth services. And we remain focused to positioning CenturyLink as the broadband provider of choice in our markets by enhancing our broadband product portfolio through deploying higher speeds in key markets and expanding availability of ethernet and IP-based product offerings.
Now turning to Slide 9, I'll cover a few additional highlights for the quarter. First, we added more than 29,000 high-speed Internet customers during the quarter as demand for broadband remains solid and customers continue to respond well through our broadband offers. Our targeted marketing strategy and our regional operating model that place the sales and service are closer to our customers. 
Our high-speed Internet additions were a little below our guidance of 32,000 to 36,000, primarily due to continued economic issues and seasonality impacts due to our success with Snowbird and students in prior quarters. Our performance in the second quarter still represents an improvement over pro forma high-speed Internet additions in the second quarter a year ago. 
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,336,000 high-speed Internet subscribers or 39.9% penetration of our broadband-enabled access lines and approximately 36.3% penetration of total addressable access lines. We are pleased that we had been able to add more than 190,000 high-speed Internet customers since closing the Embarq acquisition, representing approximately 9% year-over-year growth in total high-speed Internet customers.
Our second quarter line loss of approximately 146,300 was better than we had anticipated going into the quarter, and it represents a 22% improvement over pro forma second quarter 2009 access line losses. We continue to see a decline in outs or disconnect orders in both the Consumer and Business segments, which we believe is attributable to a more stable economy, resulting in a fewer moves, less business-line downsizing and fewer competitive ports. 
We have also increased our focus on non-customer/cord cutters and strengthened our distribution channels. We are pleased that we have been successful in reducing our rate of line loss for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2010, to 8%, a significant improvement from the 9.3% pro forma trailing 12 months line loss just a year ago.
We also continue to experience strong demand for our video bundles as we added more than 26,000 satellite video customers, ending the quarter with more than 594,000 satellite video customers. Our satellite video agreement with EchoStar/Dish expired July 31, 2010, and effective August 1, CenturyLink will begin offering DIRECTV satellites, television services to customers across our 33-state offering footprint. DIRECTV has a record of quality customer service and additional features, such as NFL Sunday Ticket and Whole-Home DVR capabilities that will offer additional benefits to our customers. CenturyLink's Dish customers will continue to receive the Dish services they have today for as long as those customers choose to maintain that relationship. 
We also continue to develop our IPTV capabilities in Columbia and Jefferson City, Missouri and La Crosse, Wisconsin. We're utilizing a multiple pair and pair bonding over ADSL2+ and VDSL2 on longer loop links in La Crosse and Jefferson City, enabling us to expand our addressable households in these markets.
All these markets received a national content from our Columbia, Missouri video MPEG-4 headend over our national fiber network, and we remain pleased with the results in all of these markets that are in the preliminary stages of launching IPTV service in Las Vegas. Additionally, we continue to expect to rollout IPTV service in four additional markets by midyear 2011, bringing CenturyLink's total IPTV markets and service to eight at that time.
Moving to Slide 10. Access line performance and the high-speed Internet customer growth trend in our top urban markets improved significantly in second quarter 2010 compared to pro forma second quarter 2009. 
In these markets, we experienced a 26% improvement in average access line loss year-over-year and approximately 108% improvement in average high-speed Internet growth year-over-year. We believe the implementation of CenturyLink's regional operating model with local market accountability and our targeted sales and marketing approach, along with a more stable economy, have been key drivers of this turnaround. From a go-to-market standpoint, we've made significant changes in the marketing approach, utilizing these markets and also introduced new products and service offerings to stimulate customer demands.
Now turning to Slide 11. Our employees continue to do an excellent job of containing costs, which contributed to the generation of strong cash flows during the quarter in spite of a very competitive marketplace and economic conditions that remained challenging. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, of more than $922 million, represents an operating cash flow margin of 52% versus 47.8% in the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, we returned nearly $219 million of the $428 million of free cash flow generated during the quarter to shareholders in the form of cash dividends, representing a 51% payout ratio.
Turning to Slide 12. The integration of Embarq continues to progress well. We are pleased that we have been able to achieve operating expense synergies in the Embarq merger faster than we originally anticipated, as well as the improvements we've realized in line loss and high-speed Internet additions. We continue to expect to complete the building convergence of Embarq customers by the end of the third quarter of 2011, and we remain confident that we will also achieve our $375 million operating expense synergy target by late 2011.
Now moving to Slide 13. Planning for acquisition of Qwest Communications is underway, now that we completed the naming of our full senior leadership team, which can be found in our recently filed S-4. We filed the required hot Hart-Scott-Rodino Notification and Report forms with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission in June and received clearance on July 15, 2010, to proceed with the transaction. We have filed for merger approval with the Regulatory Commissions of 21 states and the District of Columbia, and to date, we received approval in six of those states. 
Application for Federal Communication Commission approval was filed in May and the formal reply comment periods have expired. Additionally, we filed our final joint proxy statement prospectus on July 19 at CenturyLink. CenturyLink and Qwest special shareholder meetings to vote on the merger is scheduled for August 24. We will continue to diligently work to obtain the remaining state and federal regulatory approvals, and we continue to anticipate a first half 2011 transaction close. 
As a reminder, the combination with Qwest would have resulted in pro forma 2009 revenues of $19.8 billion and expected to be immediately accretive to free cash flow per share, excluding integration cost, as the transaction should restrengthen the sustainability of CenturyLink's dividend, while materially lowering the company's payout ratio. The combination also creates a robust national 180,000-route mile fiber network. 
We expect to generate annual operating costs and the capital expenditures synergies of approximately $625 million, which we expect to be fully realized three to five years following closing. The combination of Qwest and CenturyLink will create a strong, highly skilled employee base and will establish a national industry-leading communications company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Stewart for additional financial highlights and a review of our third quarter and full year 2010 guidance. Stew?"

During the next few minutes, I will review some highlights of our second quarter 2010 operating results and make a few brief remarks regarding our capital structure. I will conclude the comments this morning with a discussion of third quarter and full year 2010 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.
Now turning to Slide 15. Since we reported significant nonrecurring or onetime items during the second quarter, I want to briefly recap those items for you before I discuss the second quarter normalized results with you. First, we incurred approximately $18 million of pretax expenses or about $0.04 per share related to integration costs associated with the Embarq integration. Secondly, we incurred approximately $13.2 million or about $0.03 per share of severance costs during the quarter related to the Embarq transaction. And finally, we incurred approximately $10 million of pretax expenses or about $0.02 per share of costs related to the Qwest acquisition. In the aggregate, these items represent the $0.09 difference in normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.88 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.79.
Now moving to Slide 16. Due to the size of the Embarq acquisition on second quarter 2010 results compared to second quarter 2009 results, I will not discuss the percentage increases between the second quarter a year ago and second quarter this year. However, I do want to point out that if you look at the percentage change column on this slide, the good news is that we were able to translate the increased revenues from Embarq into even larger percentage increases in operating cash flow, net income and free cash flow. Also, please note that the last page of the financial schedules accompanying the earnings release this morning reflects CenturyLink's second quarter 2010 results excluding nonrecurring items compared to pro forma results for second quarter 2009, assuming the Embarq acquisition has been completed at the beginning of that quarter.
Now turning our attention to results for second quarter of 2010 compared to second quarter a year ago, excluding nonrecurring items for both periods as outlined in our financial schedules. For second quarter 2010, operating revenues increased nearly $1.14 billion to $1.77 billion from $634.5 million in second quarter 2009. The Embarq acquisition contributed operating revenues of $1.23 billion during the quarter. 
Additionally, it's important to remember that effective July 1, 2009, CenturyLink began eliminating revenues and corresponded the expenses each quarter associated with the discontinuance of regulatory accounting for certain regulated operating entities. The amount of revenues and corresponding expenses eliminated in second quarter of 2010 was $54 million. Second quarter 2009 results do not reflect the same eliminations due to the July 1, 2009, effective date of discontinuance.
Cash operating expenses increased from $330.9 million in second quarter 2009 to $850 million from second quarter this year, primarily due to $580 million of cash operating expenses associated with the Embarq acquisition, which more than offset the reduction in operating costs associated with the discontinuance of regulatory accounting, that I mentioned earlier, and synergies achieved from the Embarq integration. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to nearly $358 million in second quarter 2010 from $128.6 million in second quarter 2009, primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization associated with the Embarq acquisition, which more than offset depreciation expense declines associated with assets becoming fully depreciated.
Net income attributable to CenturyLink for the quarter was $265.7 million compared to $83.3 million in second quarter a year ago. Diluted EPS for the quarter increased 6% to $0.88 from $0.83 in second quarter 2009, and free cash flow increased from $126.5 million in second quarter 2009 to $428.6 million in the second quarter of 2010.
Turning to Slide 17. We have been successful in generating stronger year-over-year operating cash flow and operating income margins compared to pro forma 2009 results. Our operating cash flow margin improved to 52% in second quarter of 2010 from 50.7% on a pro forma basis for second quarter 2009. While reported pro forma operating cash flow margin was 48.7%, the pro forma 50.7% includes an adjustment to eliminate revenues and expenses related to the discontinuance of the regulatory accounting. Our operating income margin improved to 31.8% in second quarter 2010 from 31.2% on a pro forma basis for second quarter a year ago. 
From a capital structure standpoint, CenturyLink remains very well-positioned financially with a strong balance sheet. CenturyLink's debt to equity ratio at the end of June was 0.8:1, and net debt to second quarter 2010 annualized operating cash flow was 2.0x. We remain confident that our financial strength and liquidity provide us the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities and to meet challenges as they arise.
Finally on Slide 18. I would like to discuss the third quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance provided in our press release this morning. As a reminder, costs incurred by CenturyLink during 2010 related to the Embarq integration and any transaction or integration costs related to the pending Qwest transaction are considered nonrecurring items. These costs, along with any other nonrecurring items that may occur during 2010, are excluded from the diluted earnings per share guidance provided in our press release and in my comments regarding third quarter and full year 2010 diluted EPS guidance. 
With those points in mind, we are updating our 2010 guidance to reflect our second quarter results and our expectations for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect operating revenues for the year to be 6.5% to 7.5% lower than 2009 pro forma operating revenues. As you will recall, there are several onetime items that negatively impact the comparison of 2010 revenue with pro forma 2009 revenue. Accordingly, normalized revenue decline is still expected to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%.
Our favorable second quarter results and lower-than-previously-anticipated operating expenses result in an increase in the range of our free cash flow guidance for the full year of 2010 to $1.56 billion to $1.6 billion from $1.525 billion to $1.75 billion (sic) [$1.575 billion]. Based on this same favorable factors, we are also increasing the range for our diluted earnings per share for full year 2010 from $3.20 to $3.30 to a range of $3.30 to $3.40, an increase of $0.10 per share. We also continue to expect 2010 capital expenditures to be in the range of $825 million to $875 million. 
For the third quarter 2010, we expect operating revenues to be in the range of $1.72 million to $1.745 billion, and we expect diluted earnings per share for third quarter 2010 to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.81. The sequential decline in diluted EPS from second quarter to third quarter is due to anticipated declines in access lines and access minutes of use, along with higher operating expenses, primarily due to seasonality and outside plant maintenance and increased advertising expense.
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. At this time, we'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

With our transaction, with the strong financial results and the cash flows and the balance sheet that we have, we don't expect the type of scrutiny that some transactions have been through, but we will have it. They're going to push for -- they were willing to understand the benefits of the transaction due to the consumers, businesses and we think those are clear in this transaction.  We could in the states over the last -- all we can talk about is the last states last time, I think Washington and Oregon were two latter states to approve with Embarq transaction. They may or may not be this time, but it's difficult to predict. But for the last time, those were two of the latter states that we've received approval. And we don't anticipate significant problems, but there will be a lot of questions, a lot of issues before we get this done. David, regarding the timetable of Embarq integration and Qwest integration, I'm not sure if you're asking if there are issues with the overlap. Anything to do with overlap is certainly -- it's a lot of pressure on employees, but we are anticipating that and we realized we've said in the beginning, we will not be making the transition, the conversions to billing systems and all the systems that's quickly, with Qwest and we have with Embarq due to the continued work for the Embarq integration, but we will hit those conversions done over time. There are -- as far as the market is concerned, they have the larger markets. Qwest even have a larger market than Embarq, but we do believe that our local operating model are a little bit different than go-to-market strategies can be impactful here in these markets and as they have been in Las Vegas and Orlando and Tallahassee. We think we can see some results here with that different approach and more of a local market flavor. Qwest is doing a good job. We just think that -- a little different approach could have as it has with Embarq. So we believe -- we're confident we will see some improvements there. We expect also to have a lot of benefits in the Enterprise business. Their business markets group has -- we think has growth potential and looking forward to working with them once we get this combination complete."

We think the opportunity has been. The broadband guidance -- the reason we put guidance, a very narrow guidance the last time was basically because we had an outstanding, unusual quarter in the first quarter. We added 70,000 broadband customers in the first quarter and we wanted to make sure the market didn't think that was the pace going forward. That's why we gave that narrow guidance.

Of course, the National Broadband Plan was released in March and they did organize the commissions work around broadband. It really touched nearly every subject on the FCC's jurisdiction. It's established a timetable for the FCC's consideration of the issues over the next two years, possible steps in more than 60 or so items over the next year. The Broadband Plan addresses broadband deployment and adoption initiatives as well as uniform service, intercarrier compensation, such as force net neutrality, integrated compensation reform, special access, all those things are in there. Obviously, it's hard to predict the ultimate outcome on these issues. We do believe the FCC is likely to take a pro-consumer, pro-competition approach, particularly with respect to policies that affect Consumer Internet experience and the access to content, whether it's online applications or access to programming. We also expect USF's support to shift to broadband deployment, which we believe is the right direction overall. We think that moves on the right direction. We're concerned about the Title II efforts, of course, as everyone in our industry is. It was really a matter of how that's implemented though, and we believe that there will caution taken here and definitely that will be. I just believe the commission and the Chairman will be careful about implementing that. But we are very concerned that, that negative ruling there -- we have a totally open Internet, could impact or would impact investment in Internet and we'd -- all I care is we consider their commitment, investing in the network, if some of the proposed plans were adopted. But I think it won't be plans cut there, I think we'll have reasonable come out of the commission. So we'll continue our focus in discussing regarding the issues with the FCC and industry players in the weeks and months ahead and look for some progress getting by this year.

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's second quarter 2010 operating results and selected operational updates, as well as our guidance for the remainder of 2010.

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's second quarter 2010 operating results and selected operational updates, as well as our guidance for the remainder of 2010. 
We achieved solid results for the quarter as we realized operating revenues near the upper end of previous guidance and diluted earnings per share that exceeded previous guidance and first call consensus for the quarter. We also achieved solid high-speed Internet additions and continue to see significant improvement in year-over-year access line losses, primarily driven by improved line loss results in the legacy Embarq markets. The Integration of Embarq continues to proceed well, and we continue to make good progress obtaining the approvals necessary to complete the pending Qwest transaction, another transformative acquisition for CenturyLink.
Moving to Slide 7 in the deck. We are pleased to report solid financial and operating results for the second quarter. Operating revenues of $1.77 billion for the quarter, near the top end of our previous guidance range for the second quarter. There were several factors that contributed to this revenue performance for the quarter. First, we experienced lower access line loss during the quarter that we had previously anticipated. We also continue to see revenue growth from high-speed Internet customer additions, and we experienced higher-than-anticipated data circuit demand from wireless providers, adding capacity to their networks to handle increasing wireless data traffic.
Diluted earnings per share excluding nonrecurring items is $0.88 per share for the quarter, an increase of 6% over the second quarter 2009. This is a $0.03 per share above the top end of our previous guidance and first call consensus of $0.85 per share. Several factors contributed to this outperformance during the second quarter. First, the revenue performance that I outlined a moment ago. Second, we continue to achieve synergies from the Embarq acquisition earlier than we originally anticipated. And finally, our employees continue to do an excellent job in containing operating costs across our business. 
Our cash flows remain strong as we generated free cash flow of more than $428 million excluding nonrecurring items during the second quarter. 
Additionally, we achieved approximately $75 million of total operating expense synergies associated with the Embarq integration during the second quarter. We attributed about $10 million in incremental synergies when compared to the first quarter of 2010. As of June 30, we had achieved an annualized operating expense synergy run rate of approximately $315 million. We currently expect to exit 2010 at approximately $330 million annualized operating expense synergy run rate. 
You recall that we originally anticipated approximately $300 million of full run rate operating expense synergies when we announced the Embarq transaction in October 2008, and that in August 2009, we updated that synergy target to $375 million as a further diligence and deeper insight in the benefits of this merger.
Turning to Slide 8 in the deck. The Embarq acquisition, along with our specific marketing strategies, improved CenturyLink's year-over-year revenue mix by decreasing our reliance on access revenues. Additionally, revenues from data services accounted for 26.7% of second quarter 2010 total operating revenues compared to 22.5% in second quarter of 2009. Also, access revenues represented only 15.5% of total operating revenues in the second quarter of 2010 and reflects the company's lower reliance on network access-related revenues.
We continue to experience growth in data revenue, driven primarily by the year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet customers and increased demand by business and wholesale customers for high bandwidth services. And we remain focused to positioning CenturyLink as the broadband provider of choice in our markets by enhancing our broadband product portfolio through deploying higher speeds in key markets and expanding availability of ethernet and IP-based product offerings.
Now turning to Slide 9, I'll cover a few additional highlights for the quarter. First, we added more than 29,000 high-speed Internet customers during the quarter as demand for broadband remains solid and customers continue to respond well through our broadband offers. Our targeted marketing strategy and our regional operating model that place the sales and service are closer to our customers. 
Our high-speed Internet additions were a little below our guidance of 32,000 to 36,000, primarily due to continued economic issues and seasonality impacts due to our success with Snowbird and students in prior quarters. Our performance in the second quarter still represents an improvement over pro forma high-speed Internet additions in the second quarter a year ago. 
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,336,000 high-speed Internet subscribers or 39.9% penetration of our broadband-enabled access lines and approximately 36.3% penetration of total addressable access lines. We are pleased that we had been able to add more than 190,000 high-speed Internet customers since closing the Embarq acquisition, representing approximately 9% year-over-year growth in total high-speed Internet customers.
Our second quarter line loss of approximately 146,300 was better than we had anticipated going into the quarter, and it represents a 22% improvement over pro forma second quarter 2009 access line losses. We continue to see a decline in outs or disconnect orders in both the Consumer and Business segments, which we believe is attributable to a more stable economy, resulting in a fewer moves, less business-line downsizing and fewer competitive ports. 
We have also increased our focus on non-customer/cord cutters and strengthened our distribution channels. We are pleased that we have been successful in reducing our rate of line loss for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2010, to 8%, a significant improvement from the 9.3% pro forma trailing 12 months line loss just a year ago.
We also continue to experience strong demand for our video bundles as we added more than 26,000 satellite video customers, ending the quarter with more than 594,000 satellite video customers. Our satellite video agreement with EchoStar/Dish expired July 31, 2010, and effective August 1, CenturyLink will begin offering DIRECTV satellites, television services to customers across our 33-state offering footprint. DIRECTV has a record of quality customer service and additional features, such as NFL Sunday Ticket and Whole-Home DVR capabilities that will offer additional benefits to our customers. CenturyLink's Dish customers will continue to receive the Dish services they have today for as long as those customers choose to maintain that relationship. 
We also continue to develop our IPTV capabilities in Columbia and Jefferson City, Missouri and La Crosse, Wisconsin. We're utilizing a multiple pair and pair bonding over ADSL2+ and VDSL2 on longer loop links in La Crosse and Jefferson City, enabling us to expand our addressable households in these markets.
All these markets received a national content from our Columbia, Missouri video MPEG-4 headend over our national fiber network, and we remain pleased with the results in all of these markets that are in the preliminary stages of launching IPTV service in Las Vegas. Additionally, we continue to expect to rollout IPTV service in four additional markets by midyear 2011, bringing CenturyLink's total IPTV markets and service to eight at that time.
Moving to Slide 10. Access line performance and the high-speed Internet customer growth trend in our top urban markets improved significantly in second quarter 2010 compared to pro forma second quarter 2009. 
In these markets, we experienced a 26% improvement in average access line loss year-over-year and approximately 108% improvement in average high-speed Internet growth year-over-year. We believe the implementation of CenturyLink's regional operating model with local market accountability and our targeted sales and marketing approach, along with a more stable economy, have been key drivers of this turnaround. From a go-to-market standpoint, we've made significant changes in the marketing approach, utilizing these markets and also introduced new products and service offerings to stimulate customer demands.
Now turning to Slide 11. Our employees continue to do an excellent job of containing costs, which contributed to the generation of strong cash flows during the quarter in spite of a very competitive marketplace and economic conditions that remained challenging. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, of more than $922 million, represents an operating cash flow margin of 52% versus 47.8% in the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, we returned nearly $219 million of the $428 million of free cash flow generated during the quarter to shareholders in the form of cash dividends, representing a 51% payout ratio.
Turning to Slide 12. The integration of Embarq continues to progress well. We are pleased that we have been able to achieve operating expense synergies in the Embarq merger faster than we originally anticipated, as well as the improvements we've realized in line loss and high-speed Internet additions. We continue to expect to complete the building convergence of Embarq customers by the end of the third quarter of 2011, and we remain confident that we will also achieve our $375 million operating expense synergy target by late 2011.
Now moving to Slide 13. Planning for acquisition of Qwest Communications is underway, now that we completed the naming of our full senior leadership team, which can be found in our recently filed S-4. We filed the required hot Hart-Scott-Rodino Notification and Report forms with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission in June and received clearance on July 15, 2010, to proceed with the transaction. We have filed for merger approval with the Regulatory Commissions of 21 states and the District of Columbia, and to date, we received approval in six of those states. 
Application for Federal Communication Commission approval was filed in May and the formal reply comment periods have expired. Additionally, we filed our final joint proxy statement prospectus on July 19 at CenturyLink. CenturyLink and Qwest special shareholder meetings to vote on the merger is scheduled for August 24. We will continue to diligently work to obtain the remaining state and federal regulatory approvals, and we continue to anticipate a first half 2011 transaction close. 
As a reminder, the combination with Qwest would have resulted in pro forma 2009 revenues of $19.8 billion and expected to be immediately accretive to free cash flow per share, excluding integration cost, as the transaction should restrengthen the sustainability of CenturyLink's dividend, while materially lowering the company's payout ratio. The combination also creates a robust national 180,000-route mile fiber network. 
We expect to generate annual operating costs and the capital expenditures synergies of approximately $625 million, which we expect to be fully realized three to five years following closing. The combination of Qwest and CenturyLink will create a strong, highly skilled employee base and will establish a national industry-leading communications company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Stewart for additional financial highlights and a review of our third quarter and full year 2010 guidance. Stew?"

I will conclude the comments this morning with a discussion of third quarter and full year 2010 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.
Now turning to Slide 15. Since we reported significant nonrecurring or onetime items during the second quarter, I want to briefly recap those items for you before I discuss the second quarter normalized results with you. First, we incurred approximately $18 million of pretax expenses or about $0.04 per share related to integration costs associated with the Embarq integration. Secondly, we incurred approximately $13.2 million or about $0.03 per share of severance costs during the quarter related to the Embarq transaction. And finally, we incurred approximately $10 million of pretax expenses or about $0.02 per share of costs related to the Qwest acquisition. In the aggregate, these items represent the $0.09 difference in normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.88 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.79.
Now moving to Slide 16. Due to the size of the Embarq acquisition on second quarter 2010 results compared to second quarter 2009 results, I will not discuss the percentage increases between the second quarter a year ago and second quarter this year. However, I do want to point out that if you look at the percentage change column on this slide, the good news is that we were able to translate the increased revenues from Embarq into even larger percentage increases in operating cash flow, net income and free cash flow. Also, please note that the last page of the financial schedules accompanying the earnings release this morning reflects CenturyLink's second quarter 2010 results excluding nonrecurring items compared to pro forma results for second quarter 2009, assuming the Embarq acquisition has been completed at the beginning of that quarter.
Now turning our attention to results for second quarter of 2010 compared to second quarter a year ago, excluding nonrecurring items for both periods as outlined in our financial schedules. For second quarter 2010, operating revenues increased nearly $1.14 billion to $1.77 billion from $634.5 million in second quarter 2009. The Embarq acquisition contributed operating revenues of $1.23 billion during the quarter. 
Additionally, it's important to remember that effective July 1, 2009, CenturyLink began eliminating revenues and corresponded the expenses each quarter associated with the discontinuance of regulatory accounting for certain regulated operating entities. The amount of revenues and corresponding expenses eliminated in second quarter of 2010 was $54 million. Second quarter 2009 results do not reflect the same eliminations due to the July 1, 2009, effective date of discontinuance.
Cash operating expenses increased from $330.9 million in second quarter 2009 to $850 million from second quarter this year, primarily due to $580 million of cash operating expenses associated with the Embarq acquisition, which more than offset the reduction in operating costs associated with the discontinuance of regulatory accounting, that I mentioned earlier, and synergies achieved from the Embarq integration. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to nearly $358 million in second quarter 2010 from $128.6 million in second quarter 2009, primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization associated with the Embarq acquisition, which more than offset depreciation expense declines associated with assets becoming fully depreciated.
Net income attributable to CenturyLink for the quarter was $265.7 million compared to $83.3 million in second quarter a year ago. Diluted EPS for the quarter increased 6% to $0.88 from $0.83 in second quarter 2009, and free cash flow increased from $126.5 million in second quarter 2009 to $428.6 million in the second quarter of 2010.
Turning to Slide 17. We have been successful in generating stronger year-over-year operating cash flow and operating income margins compared to pro forma 2009 results. Our operating cash flow margin improved to 52% in second quarter of 2010 from 50.7% on a pro forma basis for second quarter 2009. While reported pro forma operating cash flow margin was 48.7%, the pro forma 50.7% includes an adjustment to eliminate revenues and expenses related to the discontinuance of the regulatory accounting. Our operating income margin improved to 31.8% in second quarter 2010 from 31.2% on a pro forma basis for second quarter a year ago. 
From a capital structure standpoint, CenturyLink remains very well-positioned financially with a strong balance sheet. CenturyLink's debt to equity ratio at the end of June was 0.8:1, and net debt to second quarter 2010 annualized operating cash flow was 2.0x. We remain confident that our financial strength and liquidity provide us the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities and to meet challenges as they arise.
Finally on Slide 18. I would like to discuss the third quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance provided in our press release this morning. As a reminder, costs incurred by CenturyLink during 2010 related to the Embarq integration and any transaction or integration costs related to the pending Qwest transaction are considered nonrecurring items. These costs, along with any other nonrecurring items that may occur during 2010, are excluded from the diluted earnings per share guidance provided in our press release and in my comments regarding third quarter and full year 2010 diluted EPS guidance. 
With those points in mind, we are updating our 2010 guidance to reflect our second quarter results and our expectations for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect operating revenues for the year to be 6.5% to 7.5% lower than 2009 pro forma operating revenues. As you will recall, there are several onetime items that negatively impact the comparison of 2010 revenue with pro forma 2009 revenue. Accordingly, normalized revenue decline is still expected to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%.
Our favorable second quarter results and lower-than-previously-anticipated operating expenses result in an increase in the range of our free cash flow guidance for the full year of 2010 to $1.56 billion to $1.6 billion from $1.525 billion to $1.75 billion (sic) [$1.575 billion]. Based on this same favorable factors, we are also increasing the range for our diluted earnings per share for full year 2010 from $3.20 to $3.30 to a range of $3.30 to $3.40, an increase of $0.10 per share. We also continue to expect 2010 capital expenditures to be in the range of $825 million to $875 million. 
For the third quarter 2010, we expect operating revenues to be in the range of $1.72 million to $1.745 billion, and we expect diluted earnings per share for third quarter 2010 to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.81. The sequential decline in diluted EPS from second quarter to third quarter is due to anticipated declines in access lines and access minutes of use, along with higher operating expenses, primarily due to seasonality and outside plant maintenance and increased advertising expense.
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. At this time, we'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

With our transaction, with the strong financial results and the cash flows and the balance sheet that we have, we don't expect the type of scrutiny that some transactions have been through, but we will have it. They're going to push for -- they were willing to understand the benefits of the transaction due to the consumers, businesses and we think those are clear in this transaction.  We could in the states over the last -- all we can talk about is the last states last time, I think Washington and Oregon were two latter states to approve with Embarq transaction. They may or may not be this time, but it's difficult to predict. But for the last time, those were two of the latter states that we've received approval. And we don't anticipate significant problems, but there will be a lot of questions, a lot of issues before we get this done. David, regarding the timetable of Embarq integration and Qwest integration, I'm not sure if you're asking if there are issues with the overlap. Anything to do with overlap is certainly -- it's a lot of pressure on employees, but we are anticipating that and we realized we've said in the beginning, we will not be making the transition, the conversions to billing systems and all the systems that's quickly, with Qwest and we have with Embarq due to the continued work for the Embarq integration, but we will hit those conversions done over time. There are -- as far as the market is concerned, they have the larger markets. Qwest even have a larger market than Embarq, but we do believe that our local operating model are a little bit different than go-to-market strategies can be impactful here in these markets and as they have been in Las Vegas and Orlando and Tallahassee. We think we can see some results here with that different approach and more of a local market flavor. Qwest is doing a good job. We just think that -- a little different approach could have as it has with Embarq. So we believe -- we're confident we will see some improvements there. We expect also to have a lot of benefits in the Enterprise business. Their business markets group has -- we think has growth potential and looking forward to working with them once we get this combination complete."

Of course, the National Broadband Plan was released in March and they did organize the commissions work around broadband. It really touched nearly every subject on the FCC's jurisdiction. It's established a timetable for the FCC's consideration of the issues over the next two years, possible steps in more than 60 or so items over the next year. The Broadband Plan addresses broadband deployment and adoption initiatives as well as uniform service, intercarrier compensation, such as force net neutrality, integrated compensation reform, special access, all those things are in there. Obviously, it's hard to predict the ultimate outcome on these issues. We do believe the FCC is likely to take a pro-consumer, pro-competition approach, particularly with respect to policies that affect Consumer Internet experience and the access to content, whether it's online applications or access to programming. We also expect USF's support to shift to broadband deployment, which we believe is the right direction overall. We think that moves on the right direction. We're concerned about the Title II efforts, of course, as everyone in our industry is. It was really a matter of how that's implemented though, and we believe that there will caution taken here and definitely that will be. I just believe the commission and the Chairman will be careful about implementing that. But we are very concerned that, that negative ruling there -- we have a totally open Internet, could impact or would impact investment in Internet and we'd -- all I care is we consider their commitment, investing in the network, if some of the proposed plans were adopted.

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's third quarter 2010 operating results and selected operational updates, as well as guidance for the remainder of 2010. Reported solid results for the quarter achieved operati",1674,"Thank you, Tony. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's third quarter 2010 operating results and selected operational updates, as well as guidance for the remainder of 2010. 
Reported solid results for the quarter achieved operating revenues above the top end of guidance range and diluted earnings per share that exceeded previous guidance and first call consensus for the quarter. We also achieved solid high-speed Internet additions and continue to see significant improvement in year-over-year access line losses, primarily driven by improved line loss results in the legacy Embarq markets. 
The integration of Embarq continues to proceed well, and we continue to make good progress in obtaining approvals necessary to complete the pending Qwest transaction, another transformative acquisition for CenturyLink.
Moving to Slide 6 from the deck. We are pleased to report solid financial and operating results for the third quarter. Operating revenues were $1.75 billion for the quarter, and diluted earnings per share excluding nonrecurring items is $0.83 per share for the quarter. A primary contribution to our solid results during the quarter was our employees' ongoing efforts to contain operating costs across our business while at the same time, working on the Embarq integration preparing for the Qwest transaction.
Our cash flows remained strong as we generated free cash flow of more than $380 million, excluding nonrecurring items during the quarter. Additionally, we achieved over $80 million of total operating expense synergies associated with the Embarq integration during the third quarter, and we continue to expect to exit 2010 at our current $330 million annualized operating expense synergy run rate.
Turning to Slide 7 in the deck. We continue to see an improvement in our year-over-year revenue mix as the Embarq acquisition and our market specific marketing strategies are decreasing our reliance on access revenues. Revenues from data services accounted for 27.5% of the third quarter 2010 total operating revenues compared to 24.6% in the third quarter of 2009. 
Access service revenues represented only 15.1% of total operating revenues in the third quarter 2010, reflecting the company's lowering by on network access related revenues during the quarter.
We'll continue to experience growth and data revenues, driven primarily by the year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet customers increased demand by business and wholesale customers for high-speed for high-bandwidth services. We remained focused on positioning CenturyLink as the broadband provider of choice in our markets. We continue to enhance our broadband product portfolio to deploying higher speeds and key markets, as well as offering incremental value to broadband features such as computer support and online backup.
In the business market, we're providing advanced data networks and value-added services to support the needs of our small and midsized businesses and our enterprise customers.
We continue to position ourselves around our unique capabilities and offer both national reach and intense local focus in leveraging our local operating model.
Now turning to Slide 8. I'll cover a few additional operating highlights for the quarter. First, we added more than 29,000 high-speed Internet customers during the quarter as demand for broadband remains solid, and customers continue to respond well to our broadband offers. Our targeting marketing strategy in our local operating model displays the sale and serving of closure to our customers. We ended the quarter with approximately 2,365,000 high-speed Internet customers or approximately 35.7% penetration of total addressable access lines.
We are pleased that we have been able to add more than 175,000 high-speed Internet customers during the last 12 months, representing approximately 8% year-over-year growth in total high-speed Internet subscribers.
In the third quarter, we maintained the overall go-to-market approach that we used in second quarter where we also launched several new products and promotions to further drive value customer growth and increase share spend with our customer base. This included our new computer support packs which are packages that provide up to four additional services into our new[ph] customers. This include PC security and antivirus, data storage and overall computer hardware, software and peripheral device support through our 24/7 call centers.
We're also seeing success with our five-year offer that we boast in some of our most competitive markets. Our third quarter line loss is approximately 140,000, it's better than we anticipated going into the quarter and represents a 17.5% improvement for the third quarter of 2009 access line loss.
In our top five markets, access line performance and high-speed Internet customer growth has improved significantly since we closed the Embarq transactions. In these markets, we've experienced approximately a 33% improvement in access line performance and approximately a 52% improvement in average high-speed Internet growth during the 15-month period post-closing compared to the 15-month period prior to closing. And we believe implementation of CenturyLink's regional operating model with local market accountability and our targeted sales and marketing approach, along with a more stable economy have been key drivers of this turnaround.
We are pleased that we have been successful in reducing our rate of line loss for the trailing 12-months ended September 30, 2010, to 7.8% compared with a 9.1% trailing 12-month line loss a year ago.
As we discussed with you in August, CenturyLink's switch satellite providers to DIRECTV in third quarter 2010, and residential service was lost in August 1. We're excited to partner with DIRECTV because of their leadership in HD, sports programming and technology such as whole house DVR.
The transfer program for combined billing did not start until mid-October. And we also expect a slower sales ramp up with the new provider. These two factors negatively impacted our results for the third quarter as we experienced a decline in satellite video subscribers of approximately 7,400. However, we are not able to utilize the transfer program, but we are seeing sales beginning to ramp up again. We currently offer our CenturyLink Prism IPTV service in five markets, La Crosse, Wisconsin, Columbia and Jefferson City, Missouri and our newest market, Las Vegas, Nevada and Fort Myers, plus Naples, Florida. We are in the process of scaling our newly developed markets of Las Vegas and Fort Myers, both of which are scheduled for full commercial rollout in the first quarter of 2011.
By the end of next year, we expect to a pass close to 1 million households as we expand service to additional markets. We launched our Prism service in Jefferson City, Missouri in January and exceeded 10% penetration of eligible living units in the market in less than -- in one year's time.
Over the past year, we have made incremental investments in addition to our Prism IPTV video architecture to specifically target mostly drilling units, and we are beginning now to see success in cash and some of the MBU markets recapturing some of the MBU market share in our service areas.
Now turning to Slide 9. Our employees continue to do an excellent job of containing costs which contributed to the generation of strong cash flows during the quarter in spite of a very competitive marketplace and economic conditions that remained challenging. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, is more than $895 million from the quarter and more than $2.7 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow is more than $380 million for the quarter, nearly $1.3 billion year-to-date. Our strong cash flow supported the return of nearly $220 million of free cash flow to shareholders during the quarter and nearly $657 million year-to-date through cash dividends.
Our payout ratio was 57% as capital expenditures increased as expected during the third quarter. The year-to-date payout ratio is 51%.
Turning to Slide 10. The integration of Embarq continues to progress well. We have successfully completed our third conversion of Embarq customers to CenturyLink billing and operational systems. And we now have approximately 50% of Embarq customers on all these systems. We expect to complete the fourth conversion in the first half of 2011, and we remain on track to complete the fifth and final Embarq conversion by the end of the third quarter 2011.
We expect to complete the migration of Embarq long-distance customers to the CenturyLink network later this month, eliminating the third-party care[ph] calls for this traffic.
Now moving to Slide 11. We continue to move steadily ahead with the approval process and integration work for the acquisition of Qwest. The approval process is completed 12 of the 22 state regulatory jurisdictions. We have received clearance to proceed with the transaction of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act from the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. Shareholders of both companies overwhelming their transaction on August 24. On October 22, we announced we have reached an agreement with both the CWA and IBEW that emerges in the public interest and the unions that we agreed to withdraw the acquisition in any remaining state and federal regulatory proceedings.
We have also outlined the organizational structure and named our top 2 tiers of leaders. And integration teams where employees are working to affect a smooth transition for the combined company.
Now going to Slide 12. While we are making great progress, there's still important work ahead of us. We remain actively engaged with the 10 remaining commissions that require approval, along with the SEC. We continue to expect to close the transaction in the first half of 2011. As a reminder, the combination with Qwest  would have resulted in pro forma 2009 revenues of $19.8 billion, and it's expected immediately accretive to free cash flow per share, excluding integration costs.
The transactional strength and sustainability of CenturyLink's dividend while materially lowering the company's payout ratio.
The combination creates a robust maximum 180,000 model fiber network. We expect to generate annual operating costs and capital expenditures synergies of approximately $625 million, which are expected to be fully realized three to five years following closing.
The combination of Qwest and CenturyLink will create a strong highly skilled employee base and will establish a national industry leading communications company.

During the next few minutes, I'll review some highlights of our third quarter 2010 operating results and will conclude my comments this morning with a discussion of fourth quarter and full year 2010 guidance provided in our earnings relea",686,"Thank you, Glen. During the next few minutes, I'll review some highlights of our third quarter 2010 operating results and will conclude my comments this morning with a discussion of fourth quarter and full year 2010 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.
Now turning to Slide 14. Since we reported significant nonrecurring one-time items during the third quarter, I want to briefly recap those items for you before I discuss the third quarter normalized results. 
First, we incurred approximately $27 million of pretax expenses or $0.06 per share related to integration and severance costs associated with the Embarq integration. Second, we incurred about $5 million in pretax expenses or about $0.01 per share related to the Qwest acquisition. In the aggregate, these item represent the $0.07 per share difference in normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.83 in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.76.
Now turning to Slide 15. In our results for third quarter 2010 compared to third quarter 2009, excluding nonrecurring items for both periods as outlined in our financial schedules. For third quarter 2010, operating revenues decreased $127 million to $1.75 billion from $1.87 billion in third quarter a year ago. Cash operating expenses decreased from $944.5 million in third quarter 2009 to $851.8 million in third quarter this year, primarily due to synergies achieved from the Embarq integration.
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased from $362 million in third quarter 2009 to $358 million in the third quarter of 2010, primarily due to a reduction in the amortization expense associated with the customer life intangible asset established in connection with our Embarq acquisition.
Net income attributable to CenturyLink for the quarter was $251.1 million compared to $269.1 million in third quarter 2009, and diluted earnings per share for the quarter decreased 7.8% to $0.83 from $0.90 in the third quarter a year ago. And free cash flow did increase 3% from $372.1 million in third quarter 2009 to $383.3 million in the third quarter of 2010.
Finally, on Slide 16. I would like to discuss the fourth quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance provided in our press release this morning. 
As a reminder, costs incurred by CenturyLink during 2010 related to the Embarq integration and any transaction or integration costs related to the pending Qwest transaction are considered nonrecurring items. These costs, along with any other nonrecurring items that may occur during 2010, are excluded from the diluted earnings per share guidance provided in our press release and in my comments regarding third quarter and full year 2010 diluted earnings per share guidance.
For the fourth quarter 2010, we expect operating revenues to be in the range of $1.69 billion to $1.71 billion. This decline partially results from approximately $5 million of one-time items in the third quarter. We expect diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter 2010 to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.77. The sequential decline in the earnings per share from third quarter to fourth quarter is due to anticipate the decline in access lines and access minutes of use along with a one-time revenue item mentioned earlier and the increased costs associated with the rollout of IPTV that Glen mentioned, partially offset by lower operating expenses, primarily due to seasonality and outside plant maintenance.
With those points in mind, we are updating our 2010 guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter. We're also narrowing the range of our diluted earnings per share guidance for full year 2010 from $3.30 to $3.40 to now a range of $3.36 to $3.40. We also continue to expect 2010 capital expenditures to be between $825 million and $875 million.
In earnings release, we also outlined a few items that we expect to negatively impact 2011 results when compared to 2010. We plan to discuss these items further in connection with our fourth quarter 2010 earnings release when we expect to provide additional guidance for 2011. 
This concludes our prepared remarks for today. At this time, I'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call."

So from an internal standpoint, we hit our objectives, and we see that continue to be pretty flat if you look at it just quarter-over-quarter. In terms of competition and speed, we're really seeing not a lot of new incremental competition from cable. There's pockets of more aggressive competition but have not seen any increased competition early in the third quarter, going into fourth quarter.

It seems to imply a step up in the rate of both annual and sequential declines. You just mentioned in your prepared remarks that a $5 million one-time impact in the fourth quarter, but I'm not sure that would necessarily account for the entire change there. So, I wonder if you can just talk a little bit about the key drivers of that guidance. The items such as the wireless traffic migration delays or anything else we should be thinking about in terms of the 4Q revenue? And then secondly just on the synergies, also you exited third quarter where you plan to exit for the full year. You have about $45 million of incremental synergies still to get your annualized target. So should we expect the bulk of that to come from the system conversions that take place by the third quarter of next year, or are there other areas that we can expect some meaningful synergies over the next few quarters?"

So with respect to the fourth quarter revenue guidance, about $5 million is due to the one-time favorable items that we had in the third quarter. Probably about $7 million to $8 million is due to the continued access re-home and long-distance migration that we're seeing that's been delayed. Somewhat, we thought it would happen a little earlier this year, but it's been delayed some, but it will continue to occur. So we're expecting that. And then the majority of -- the rest of the client is really related to expected access line declines and expected continued declines in access minutes of use. With respect to the synergies, yes, we did exit third quarter at about where we expect to exit the year. And you're correct in your rationale there. Basically, we completed one of the other conversions, the third conversion of our customer care billing to the CenturyLink system from Embarq. We have two of those remaining. They will be completed hopefully by the end of the third quarter of 2011. So the majority of the remaining synergies related to Embarq are related to IT and the decommissioning of those systems are after the -- when full transition takes place, as well as some in the county area related to some folks that we have now. They're doing billing managing, billing system and billing process."

Probably, secondhand head-in, back-up head-in with Qwest. I have video capabilities in Denver and in Phoenix. So we'll inherit another head in there. That's almost ready to go. So that's not the big step. We always -- in every market, we'll have several local heading broadcast channel, local channels. That's part of the incremental cost. But it's really a matter of plant condition and really the majority of the costs and the sort of plant is concerned is going to be needed eventually in the next three to five years anyway, to bring plant the standards that we wand and also to bring the higher speed of Internet and other services that we expect to provide. So the incremental plant cause for just the video services, IPTV services, not that large of percentage of the total. But bottom line is, we think the returns remain strong with this product. We're seeing attached rates of about 90% of high-speed Internet attachment rates. We're seeing at least 400 basis points improvement in churn rate with our Prism product, and it's really an outstanding product. It's in many ways better than the cable company has, and our pricing is comparable to cable. So we feel really good about the rollout of Prism. And we're in the process of evaluating the Qwest markets. We don't know yet if the plant condition really makes a big difference and in the timing of the rollout. So we'll be looking at their markets the further we get into this process, the integration of the companies and the weeks and months ahead."

Some of the IT-related costs and the synergies of combining billing systems and operational systems, those certainly will not be impacted. But there maybe other synergies, in general, overhead that they are taking out that could impact the total amount of synergy that we really accomplish after the close. But either way, the costs are coming out. And it should impact favorable overall margins of the combined company. Regarding the impact from line loss that we've seen in other metrics at Embarq, we think the larger market responded well with our local market focus, our really immediate response type advertising, the moving, the decision-making closer to the market. In some ways, there were more feed on the street in some of these markets. We think that it has been impactful. And we think it's made a difference, I guess where the greatest opportunity for us in these larger markets as well. So that's obviously a greater impact there.

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's third quarter 2010 operating results and selected operational updates, as well as guidance for the remainder of 2010.

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's third quarter 2010 operating results and selected operational updates, as well as guidance for the remainder of 2010. 
Reported solid results for the quarter achieved operating revenues above the top end of guidance range and diluted earnings per share that exceeded previous guidance and first call consensus for the quarter. We also achieved solid high-speed Internet additions and continue to see significant improvement in year-over-year access line losses, primarily driven by improved line loss results in the legacy Embarq markets. 
The integration of Embarq continues to proceed well, and we continue to make good progress in obtaining approvals necessary to complete the pending Qwest transaction, another transformative acquisition for CenturyLink.
Moving to Slide 6 from the deck. We are pleased to report solid financial and operating results for the third quarter. Operating revenues were $1.75 billion for the quarter, and diluted earnings per share excluding nonrecurring items is $0.83 per share for the quarter. A primary contribution to our solid results during the quarter was our employees' ongoing efforts to contain operating costs across our business while at the same time, working on the Embarq integration preparing for the Qwest transaction.
Our cash flows remained strong as we generated free cash flow of more than $380 million, excluding nonrecurring items during the quarter. Additionally, we achieved over $80 million of total operating expense synergies associated with the Embarq integration during the third quarter, and we continue to expect to exit 2010 at our current $330 million annualized operating expense synergy run rate.
Turning to Slide 7 in the deck. We continue to see an improvement in our year-over-year revenue mix as the Embarq acquisition and our market specific marketing strategies are decreasing our reliance on access revenues. Revenues from data services accounted for 27.5% of the third quarter 2010 total operating revenues compared to 24.6% in the third quarter of 2009. 
Access service revenues represented only 15.1% of total operating revenues in the third quarter 2010, reflecting the company's lowering by on network access related revenues during the quarter.
We'll continue to experience growth and data revenues, driven primarily by the year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet customers increased demand by business and wholesale customers for high-speed for high-bandwidth services. We remained focused on positioning CenturyLink as the broadband provider of choice in our markets. We continue to enhance our broadband product portfolio to deploying higher speeds and key markets, as well as offering incremental value to broadband features such as computer support and online backup.
In the business market, we're providing advanced data networks and value-added services to support the needs of our small and midsized businesses and our enterprise customers.
We continue to position ourselves around our unique capabilities and offer both national reach and intense local focus in leveraging our local operating model.
Now turning to Slide 8. I'll cover a few additional operating highlights for the quarter. First, we added more than 29,000 high-speed Internet customers during the quarter as demand for broadband remains solid, and customers continue to respond well to our broadband offers. Our targeting marketing strategy in our local operating model displays the sale and serving of closure to our customers. We ended the quarter with approximately 2,365,000 high-speed Internet customers or approximately 35.7% penetration of total addressable access lines.
We are pleased that we have been able to add more than 175,000 high-speed Internet customers during the last 12 months, representing approximately 8% year-over-year growth in total high-speed Internet subscribers.
In the third quarter, we maintained the overall go-to-market approach that we used in second quarter where we also launched several new products and promotions to further drive value customer growth and increase share spend with our customer base. This included our new computer support packs which are packages that provide up to four additional services into our new[ph] customers. This include PC security and antivirus, data storage and overall computer hardware, software and peripheral device support through our 24/7 call centers.
We're also seeing success with our five-year offer that we boast in some of our most competitive markets. Our third quarter line loss is approximately 140,000, it's better than we anticipated going into the quarter and represents a 17.5% improvement for the third quarter of 2009 access line loss.
In our top five markets, access line performance and high-speed Internet customer growth has improved significantly since we closed the Embarq transactions. In these markets, we've experienced approximately a 33% improvement in access line performance and approximately a 52% improvement in average high-speed Internet growth during the 15-month period post-closing compared to the 15-month period prior to closing. And we believe implementation of CenturyLink's regional operating model with local market accountability and our targeted sales and marketing approach, along with a more stable economy have been key drivers of this turnaround.
We are pleased that we have been successful in reducing our rate of line loss for the trailing 12-months ended September 30, 2010, to 7.8% compared with a 9.1% trailing 12-month line loss a year ago.
As we discussed with you in August, CenturyLink's switch satellite providers to DIRECTV in third quarter 2010, and residential service was lost in August 1. We're excited to partner with DIRECTV because of their leadership in HD, sports programming and technology such as whole house DVR.
The transfer program for combined billing did not start until mid-October. And we also expect a slower sales ramp up with the new provider. These two factors negatively impacted our results for the third quarter as we experienced a decline in satellite video subscribers of approximately 7,400. However, we are not able to utilize the transfer program, but we are seeing sales beginning to ramp up again. We currently offer our CenturyLink Prism IPTV service in five markets, La Crosse, Wisconsin, Columbia and Jefferson City, Missouri and our newest market, Las Vegas, Nevada and Fort Myers, plus Naples, Florida. We are in the process of scaling our newly developed markets of Las Vegas and Fort Myers, both of which are scheduled for full commercial rollout in the first quarter of 2011.
By the end of next year, we expect to a pass close to 1 million households as we expand service to additional markets. We launched our Prism service in Jefferson City, Missouri in January and exceeded 10% penetration of eligible living units in the market in less than -- in one year's time.
Over the past year, we have made incremental investments in addition to our Prism IPTV video architecture to specifically target mostly drilling units, and we are beginning now to see success in cash and some of the MBU markets recapturing some of the MBU market share in our service areas.
Now turning to Slide 9. Our employees continue to do an excellent job of containing costs which contributed to the generation of strong cash flows during the quarter in spite of a very competitive marketplace and economic conditions that remained challenging. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, is more than $895 million from the quarter and more than $2.7 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow is more than $380 million for the quarter, nearly $1.3 billion year-to-date. Our strong cash flow supported the return of nearly $220 million of free cash flow to shareholders during the quarter and nearly $657 million year-to-date through cash dividends.
Our payout ratio was 57% as capital expenditures increased as expected during the third quarter. The year-to-date payout ratio is 51%.
Turning to Slide 10. The integration of Embarq continues to progress well. We have successfully completed our third conversion of Embarq customers to CenturyLink billing and operational systems. And we now have approximately 50% of Embarq customers on all these systems. We expect to complete the fourth conversion in the first half of 2011, and we remain on track to complete the fifth and final Embarq conversion by the end of the third quarter 2011.
We expect to complete the migration of Embarq long-distance customers to the CenturyLink network later this month, eliminating the third-party care[ph] calls for this traffic.
Now moving to Slide 11. We continue to move steadily ahead with the approval process and integration work for the acquisition of Qwest. The approval process is completed 12 of the 22 state regulatory jurisdictions. We have received clearance to proceed with the transaction of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act from the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. Shareholders of both companies overwhelming their transaction on August 24. On October 22, we announced we have reached an agreement with both the CWA and IBEW that emerges in the public interest and the unions that we agreed to withdraw the acquisition in any remaining state and federal regulatory proceedings.
We have also outlined the organizational structure and named our top 2 tiers of leaders. And integration teams where employees are working to affect a smooth transition for the combined company.
Now going to Slide 12. While we are making great progress, there's still important work ahead of us. We remain actively engaged with the 10 remaining commissions that require approval, along with the SEC. We continue to expect to close the transaction in the first half of 2011. As a reminder, the combination with Qwest  would have resulted in pro forma 2009 revenues of $19.8 billion, and it's expected immediately accretive to free cash flow per share, excluding integration costs.
The transactional strength and sustainability of CenturyLink's dividend while materially lowering the company's payout ratio.
The combination creates a robust maximum 180,000 model fiber network. We expect to generate annual operating costs and capital expenditures synergies of approximately $625 million, which are expected to be fully realized three to five years following closing.
The combination of Qwest and CenturyLink will create a strong highly skilled employee base and will establish a national industry leading communications company. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Stewart for additional financial highlights in review of our fourth quarter and full year 2010 guidance. Stewart?

During the next few minutes, I'll review some highlights of our third quarter 2010 operating results and will conclude my comments this morning with a discussion of fourth quarter and full year 2010 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.
Now turning to Slide 14. Since we reported significant nonrecurring one-time items during the third quarter, I want to briefly recap those items for you before I discuss the third quarter normalized results. 
First, we incurred approximately $27 million of pretax expenses or $0.06 per share related to integration and severance costs associated with the Embarq integration. Second, we incurred about $5 million in pretax expenses or about $0.01 per share related to the Qwest acquisition. In the aggregate, these item represent the $0.07 per share difference in normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.83 in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.76.
Now turning to Slide 15. In our results for third quarter 2010 compared to third quarter 2009, excluding nonrecurring items for both periods as outlined in our financial schedules. For third quarter 2010, operating revenues decreased $127 million to $1.75 billion from $1.87 billion in third quarter a year ago. Cash operating expenses decreased from $944.5 million in third quarter 2009 to $851.8 million in third quarter this year, primarily due to synergies achieved from the Embarq integration.
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased from $362 million in third quarter 2009 to $358 million in the third quarter of 2010, primarily due to a reduction in the amortization expense associated with the customer life intangible asset established in connection with our Embarq acquisition.
Net income attributable to CenturyLink for the quarter was $251.1 million compared to $269.1 million in third quarter 2009, and diluted earnings per share for the quarter decreased 7.8% to $0.83 from $0.90 in the third quarter a year ago. And free cash flow did increase 3% from $372.1 million in third quarter 2009 to $383.3 million in the third quarter of 2010.
Finally, on Slide 16. I would like to discuss the fourth quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance provided in our press release this morning. 
As a reminder, costs incurred by CenturyLink during 2010 related to the Embarq integration and any transaction or integration costs related to the pending Qwest transaction are considered nonrecurring items. These costs, along with any other nonrecurring items that may occur during 2010, are excluded from the diluted earnings per share guidance provided in our press release and in my comments regarding third quarter and full year 2010 diluted earnings per share guidance.
For the fourth quarter 2010, we expect operating revenues to be in the range of $1.69 billion to $1.71 billion. This decline partially results from approximately $5 million of one-time items in the third quarter. We expect diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter 2010 to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.77. The sequential decline in the earnings per share from third quarter to fourth quarter is due to anticipate the decline in access lines and access minutes of use along with a one-time revenue item mentioned earlier and the increased costs associated with the rollout of IPTV that Glen mentioned, partially offset by lower operating expenses, primarily due to seasonality and outside plant maintenance.
With those points in mind, we are updating our 2010 guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter. We're also narrowing the range of our diluted earnings per share guidance for full year 2010 from $3.30 to $3.40 to now a range of $3.36 to $3.40. We also continue to expect 2010 capital expenditures to be between $825 million and $875 million.
In earnings release, we also outlined a few items that we expect to negatively impact 2011 results when compared to 2010. We plan to discuss these items further in connection with our fourth quarter 2010 earnings release when we expect to provide additional guidance for 2011. 
This concludes our prepared remarks for today. At this time, I'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call.

So from an internal standpoint, we hit our objectives, and we see that continue to be pretty flat if you look at it just quarter-over-quarter. In terms of competition and speed, we're really seeing not a lot of new incremental competition from cable. There's pockets of more aggressive competition but have not seen any increased competition early in the third quarter, going into fourth quarter.

The items such as the wireless traffic migration delays or anything else we should be thinking about in terms of the 4Q revenue? And then secondly just on the synergies, also you exited third quarter where you plan to exit for the full year. You have about $45 million of incremental synergies still to get your annualized target. So should we expect the bulk of that to come from the system conversions that take place by the third quarter of next year, or are there other areas that we can expect some meaningful synergies over the next few quarters?

Probably about $7 million to $8 million is due to the continued access re-home and long-distance migration that we're seeing that's been delayed. Somewhat, we thought it would happen a little earlier this year, but it's been delayed some, but it will continue to occur. So we're expecting that. And then the majority of -- the rest of the client is really related to expected access line declines and expected continued declines in access minutes of use. With respect to the synergies, yes, we did exit third quarter at about where we expect to exit the year. And you're correct in your rationale there. Basically, we completed one of the other conversions, the third conversion of our customer care billing to the CenturyLink system from Embarq. We have two of those remaining. They will be completed hopefully by the end of the third quarter of 2011. So the majority of the remaining synergies related to Embarq are related to IT and the decommissioning of those systems are after the -- when full transition takes place, as well as some in the county area related to some folks that we have now.

Can you talk about what it requires to roll that out in terms of upgrading the network, installing other equipment. I'm particularly thinking of how these maybe to bring this to the 4.5 million lines that Qwest has now agreed to high-speed, perhaps you can go through the sort of technical timing requirements there. And given that you're expanding it more broadly, have your views on profitability or the ability to kind of get better results on bundling and ARPU and so forth, started to turn more positive? Because up to now, you've been sort of fairly measuring your expansion, but it feels like you have some things change there. And then secondly, if you can just provide any more color on specific states and specific timelines around the merger approval process where we currently stand?

Probably, secondhand head-in, back-up head-in with Qwest. I have video capabilities in Denver and in Phoenix. So we'll inherit another head in there. That's almost ready to go. So that's not the big step. We always -- in every market, we'll have several local heading broadcast channel, local channels. That's part of the incremental cost. But it's really a matter of plant condition and really the majority of the costs and the sort of plant is concerned is going to be needed eventually in the next three to five years anyway, to bring plant the standards that we wand and also to bring the higher speed of Internet and other services that we expect to provide. So the incremental plant cause for just the video services, IPTV services, not that large of percentage of the total. But bottom line is, we think the returns remain strong with this product. We're seeing attached rates of about 90% of high-speed Internet attachment rates. We're seeing at least 400 basis points improvement in churn rate with our Prism product, and it's really an outstanding product. It's in many ways better than the cable company has, and our pricing is comparable to cable. So we feel really good about the rollout of Prism. And we're in the process of evaluating the Qwest markets. We don't know yet if the plant condition really makes a big difference and in the timing of the rollout. So we'll be looking at their markets the further we get into this process, the integration of the companies and the weeks and months ahead.

I was wondering if you could kind of share your view of their performance as relative to the plan that you expected to see. And then second, I think you have shared in the past that the impact online loss and other metrics that you've had has been better in big markets like Las Vegas, for instance, with the Embarq merger then maybe even the averages that you report, and that's obviously going to be highly relevant to the Qwest transaction.

Some of the IT-related costs and the synergies of combining billing systems and operational systems, those certainly will not be impacted. But there maybe other synergies, in general, overhead that they are taking out that could impact the total amount of synergy that we really accomplish after the close. But either way, the costs are coming out. And it should impact favorable overall margins of the combined company. Regarding the impact from line loss that we've seen in other metrics at Embarq, we think the larger market responded well with our local market focus, our really immediate response type advertising, the moving, the decision-making closer to the market. In some ways, there were more feed on the street in some of these markets. We think that it has been impactful. And we think it's made a difference, I guess where the greatest opportunity for us in these larger markets as well. So that's obviously a greater impact there. But we feel good about where we are with the Embarq markets, and we believe we can bring somewhere impacts to the Qwest market. You'll never know until you're there.

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's third quarter 2010 operating results and selected operational updates, as well as guidance for the remainder of 2010. 
Reported solid results for the quarter achieved operating revenues above the top end of guidance range and diluted earnings per share that exceeded previous guidance and first call consensus for the quarter. We also achieved solid high-speed Internet additions and continue to see significant improvement in year-over-year access line losses, primarily driven by improved line loss results in the legacy Embarq markets. 
The integration of Embarq continues to proceed well, and we continue to make good progress in obtaining approvals necessary to complete the pending Qwest transaction, another transformative acquisition for CenturyLink.
Moving to Slide 6 from the deck. We are pleased to report solid financial and operating results for the third quarter. Operating revenues were $1.75 billion for the quarter, and diluted earnings per share excluding nonrecurring items is $0.83 per share for the quarter. A primary contribution to our solid results during the quarter was our employees' ongoing efforts to contain operating costs across our business while at the same time, working on the Embarq integration preparing for the Qwest transaction.
Our cash flows remained strong as we generated free cash flow of more than $380 million, excluding nonrecurring items during the quarter. Additionally, we achieved over $80 million of total operating expense synergies associated with the Embarq integration during the third quarter, and we continue to expect to exit 2010 at our current $330 million annualized operating expense synergy run rate.
Turning to Slide 7 in the deck. We continue to see an improvement in our year-over-year revenue mix as the Embarq acquisition and our market specific marketing strategies are decreasing our reliance on access revenues. Revenues from data services accounted for 27.5% of the third quarter 2010 total operating revenues compared to 24.6% in the third quarter of 2009. 
Access service revenues represented only 15.1% of total operating revenues in the third quarter 2010, reflect the company's lowering by on network access related revenues during the quarter.
We'll continue to experience growth and data revenues, driven primarily by the year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet customers increased demand by business and wholesale customers for high-speed for high-bandwidth services. We remained focused on positioning CenturyLink as the broadband provider of choice in our markets. We continue to enhance our broadband product portfolio to deploying higher speeds and key markets, as well as offering incremental value to broadband features such as computer support and online backup.
In the business market, we're providing advanced data and IP networks and value-added services to support the needs of our small and midsized businesses and our enterprise customers.
We continue to position ourselves around our unique capabilities and offer both national reach and intense local focus in leveraging our local operating model.
Now turning to Slide 8. I'll cover a few additional operating highlights for the quarter. First, we added more than 29,000 high-speed Internet customers during the quarter as demand for broadband remains solid, and customers continue to respond well to our broadband offers. Our targeting marketing strategy in our local operating model displays the sale and service closer to our customers. We ended the quarter with approximately 2,365,000 high-speed Internet customers or approximately 35.7% penetration of total addressable access lines.
We are pleased that we have been able to add more than 175,000 high-speed Internet customers during the last 12 months, representing approximately 8% year-over-year growth in total high-speed Internet subscribers.
In the third quarter, we maintained the overall go-to-market approach that we used in second quarter where we also launched several new products and promotions to further drive value customer growth and increase share spend with our customer base. This included our new computer support packs which are packages that provide up to four additional services to our broadband customers. This include PC security and antivirus, data storage and overall computer hardware, software and peripheral device support through our 24/7 call centers.
We're also seeing success with our five-year price long confident we launched in some of our most competitive markets. Our third quarter line loss is approximately 140,000, it's better than we anticipated going into the quarter and represents a 17.5% improvement for the third quarter of 2009 access line loss.
In our top five markets, access line performance and high-speed Internet customer growth has improved significantly since we closed the Embarq transactions. In these markets, we've experienced approximately a 33% improvement in access line performance and approximately a 52% improvement in average high-speed Internet growth during the 15-month period post-closing compared to the 15-month period prior to closing. And we believe implementation of CenturyLink's regional operating model with local market accountability and our targeted sales and marketing approach, along with a more stable economy have been key drivers of this turnaround.
We are pleased that we have been successful in reducing our rate of line loss for the trailing 12-months ended September 30, 2010, to 7.8% compared with a 9.1% trailing 12-month line loss a year ago.
As we discussed with you in August, CenturyLink's switch satellite providers to DIRECTV in third quarter 2010, and residential service was lost in August 1. We're excited to partner with DIRECTV because of their leadership in HD, sports programming and technology such as whole house DVR.
The transfer program for combined billing did not start until mid-October. And we also expect a slower sales ramp up with the new provider. These two factors negatively impacted our results for the third quarter as we experienced a decline in satellite video subscribers of approximately 7,400. However, we are not able to utilize the transfer program, but we are seeing sales beginning to ramp up again. We currently offer our CenturyLink Prism IPTV service in five markets, La Crosse, Wisconsin, Columbia and Jefferson City, Missouri and our newest market, Las Vegas, Nevada and Fort Myers, plus Naples, Florida. We are in the process of scaling our newly developed markets of Las Vegas and Fort Myers, both of which are scheduled for full commercial rollout in the first quarter of 2011.
By the end of next year, we expect to a pass close to 1 million households as we expand service to additional markets. We launched our Prism service in Jefferson City, Missouri in January and exceeded 10% penetration of eligible living units in the market in less than -- in one year's time.
Over the past year, we have made incremental investments in addition to our Prism IPTV video architecture to specifically target mostly drilling units, and we are beginning now to see success in cash and some of the MBU markets recapturing some of the MBU market share in our service areas.
Now turning to Slide 9. Our employees continue to do an excellent job of containing costs which contributed to the generation of strong cash flows during the quarter in spite of a very competitive marketplace and economic conditions that remained challenging. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, is more than $895 million from the quarter and more than $2.7 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow is more than $380 million for the quarter, nearly $1.3 billion year-to-date. Our strong cash flow supported the return of nearly $220 million of free cash flow to shareholders during the quarter and nearly $657 million year-to-date through cash dividends.
Our payout ratio was 57% as capital expenditures increased as expected during the third quarter. The year-to-date payout ratio is 51%.
Turning to Slide 10. The integration of Embarq continues to progress well. We have successfully completed our third conversion of Embarq customers to CenturyLink billing and operational systems. And we now have approximately 50% of Embarq customers on all these systems. We expect to complete the fourth conversion in the first half of 2011, and we remain on track to complete the fifth and final Embarq conversion by the end of the third quarter 2011.
We expect to complete the migration of Embarq long-distance customers to the CenturyLink network later this month, eliminating third-party caring calls, recorded traffic.
Now moving to Slide 11. We continue to move steadily ahead with the approval process and integration work for the acquisition of Qwest. The approval process is completed 12 of the 22 state regulatory jurisdictions. We have received clearance to proceed with the transaction of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act from the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. Shareholders of both companies overwhelming approve the transaction on August 24. On October 22, we announced we have reached an agreement with both the CWA and IBEW that the mergers is in the public interest and the unions have agreed to withdraw the opposition in any remaining state and federal regulatory proceedings.
We have also outlined the organizational structure and named our top 2 tiers of leaders. And integration teams are in place and working to affect a smooth transition for the combined company.
Now going to Slide 12. While we are making great progress, there's still important work ahead of us. We remain actively engaged with the 10 remaining commissions that require approval, along with the FCC. We continue to expect to close the transaction in the first half of 2011. As a reminder, the combination with Qwest would have resulted in pro forma 2009 revenues of $19.8 billion, and is expected to immediately accretive to free cash flow per share, excluding integration costs.
The transactional strengthen sustainability of CenturyLink's dividend while materially lowering the company's payout ratio.
The combination creates a robust maximum 180,000 route model fiber network. We expect to generate annual operating costs and capital expenditures synergies of approximately $625 million, which are expected to be fully realized three to five years following closing.
The combination of Qwest and CenturyLink will create a strong highly skilled employee base and will establish a national industry leading communications company. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Stewart for additional financial highlights in review of our fourth quarter and full year 2010 guidance. Stewart?"

During the next few minutes, I'll review some highlights of our third quarter 2010 operating results and will conclude my comments this morning with a discussion of fourth quarter and full year 2010 guidance provided in our earnings relea",686,"Thank you, Glen. During the next few minutes, I'll review some highlights of our third quarter 2010 operating results and will conclude my comments this morning with a discussion of fourth quarter and full year 2010 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.
Now turning to Slide 14. Since we reported significant nonrecurring one-time items during the third quarter, I want to briefly recap those items for you before I discuss the third quarter normalized results. 
First, we incurred approximately $27 million of pretax expenses or $0.06 per share related to integration and severance costs associated with the Embarq integration. Second, we incurred about $5 million in pretax expenses or about $0.01 per share related to the Qwest acquisition. In the aggregate, these items represent the $0.07 per share difference in normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.83 in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.76.
Now turning to Slide 15. In our results for third quarter 2010 compared to third quarter 2009, excluding nonrecurring items for both periods as outlined in our financial schedules. For third quarter 2010, operating revenues decreased $127 million to $1.75 billion from $1.87 billion in third quarter a year ago. Cash operating expenses decreased from $944.5 million in third quarter 2009 to $851.8 million in third quarter this year, primarily due to synergies achieved from the Embarq integration.
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased from $362 million in third quarter 2009 to $358 million in the third quarter of 2010, primarily due to a reduction in the amortization expense associated with the customer life intangible asset established in connection with our Embarq acquisition.
Net income attributable to CenturyLink for the quarter was $251.1 million compared to $269.1 million in third quarter 2009, and diluted earnings per share for the quarter decreased 7.8% to $0.83 from $0.90 in the third quarter a year ago. And free cash flow did increase 3% from $372.1 million in third quarter 2009 to $383.3 million in the third quarter of 2010.
Finally, on Slide 16. I would like to discuss the fourth quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance provided in our press release this morning. 
As a reminder, costs incurred by CenturyLink during 2010 related to the Embarq integration and any transaction or integration costs related to the pending Qwest transaction are considered nonrecurring items. These costs, along with any other nonrecurring items that may occur during 2010, are excluded from the diluted earnings per share guidance provided in our press release and in my comments regarding third quarter and full year 2010 diluted earnings per share guidance.
For the fourth quarter 2010, we expect operating revenues to be in the range of $1.69 billion to $1.71 billion. This decline partially results from approximately $5 million of one-time items in the third quarter. We expect diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter 2010 to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.77. The sequential decline in the earnings per share from third quarter to fourth quarter is due to anticipated the decline in access lines and access minutes of use along with a one-time revenue item mentioned earlier and the increased costs associated with the rollout of IPTV that Glen mentioned, partially offset by lower operating expenses, primarily due to seasonality and outside plant maintenance.
With those points in mind, we are updating our 2010 guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter. We're also narrowing the range of our diluted earnings per share guidance for full year 2010 from $3.30 to $3.40 to now a range of $3.36 to $3.40. We also continue to expect 2010 capital expenditures to be between $825 million and $875 million.
In earnings release, we also outlined a few items that we expect to negatively impact 2011 results when compared to 2010. We plan to discuss these items further in connection with our fourth quarter 2010 earnings release when we expect to provide additional guidance for 2011. 
This concludes our prepared remarks for today. At this time, I'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call."

So from an internal standpoint, we hit our objectives, and we see that continue to be pretty flat if you look at it just quarter-over-quarter. In terms of competition and speed, we're really seeing not a lot of new incremental competition from cable. There's pockets of more aggressive competition but have not seen any increased competition early in the third quarter, going into fourth quarter.

It seems to imply a step up in the rate of both annual and sequential declines. You just mentioned in your prepared remarks that a $5 million one-time impact in the fourth quarter, but I'm not sure that would necessarily account for the entire change there. So, I wonder if you can just talk a little bit about the key drivers of that guidance. Are there items such as the wireless traffic migration delays or anything else we should be thinking about in terms of the 4Q revenue? And then secondly just on the synergies, it looks as though you exited third quarter where you plan to exit for the full year. You have about $45 million of incremental synergies still to get your annualized target. So should we expect the bulk of that to come from the system conversions that take place by the third quarter of next year, or are there other areas that we can expect some meaningful synergies over the next few quarters?"

So with respect to the fourth quarter revenue guidance, about $5 million is due to the one-time favorable items that we had in the third quarter. Probably about $7 million to $8 million is due to the continued access re-home and long-distance migration that we're seeing that's been delayed somewhat. We thought it would happen a little earlier this year, but it's been delayed some, but it will continue to occur. So we're expecting that. And then the majority of -- the rest of the decline is really related to expected access line declines and expected continued declines in access minutes of use. With respect to the synergies, yes, we did exit third quarter at about where we expect to exit the year. And you're correct in your rationale there. Basically, we completed one of the other conversions, the third conversion of our customer care billing to the CenturyLink system from Embarq. We have two of those remaining. They will be completed hopefully by the end of the third quarter of 2011. So the majority of the remaining synergies related to Embarq are related to IT and the decommissioning of those systems are after the -- when full transition takes place, as well as some in the accounting area related to some folks that we have now that are doing billing, managing the billing system and billing process."

First of all, we have our head-in Columbia, Missouri today. Probably end up with a second head-in, back-up head-in with Qwest, they have video capabilities in Denver and in Phoenix. So we'll inherit another head in there. That's almost ready to go. So that's not the big step. We always -- in every market, we'll have to have a local head-in for the broadcast channel, local channels. That's part of the incremental cost. But it's really a matter of plant condition and really the majority of the costs as far as plant is concerned is going to be needed eventually in the next three to five years anyway, to bring plant to standards that we want and also to bring the higher speed of Internet and other services that we expect to provide. So the incremental plant costs for just the video services, IPTV services, not that large of percentage of the total. But bottom line is, we think the returns remain strong with this product. We're seeing attached rates of about 90% of high-speed Internet attachment rates. We're seeing at least 400 basis points improvement in churn rate with our Prism product, and it's really an outstanding product. It's in many ways better than the cable company has, and our pricing is comparable to cable. So we feel really good about the rollout of Prism. And we're in the process of evaluating the Qwest markets. We don't know yet if the plant condition really makes a big difference and in the timing of the rollout.

But there may be other synergies, in general, overhead that they are taking out that could impact the total amount of synergy that we really accomplish after the close. But either way, the costs are coming out. And it should impact favorable overall margins of the combined company. Regarding the impact from line loss that we've seen in other metrics at Embarq, we think the larger market responded well with our local market focus, are really immediate response type advertising, the moving, the decision-making closer to the market. In some ways, there were more feet on the street in some of these markets. We think that it has been impactful. And we think it's made a difference, of course that’s where the greatest opportunity was in these larger markets as well. So that's why we’re seeing a greater impact there.

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's third quarter 2010 operating results and selected operational updates, as well as guidance for the remainder of 2010.

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's third quarter 2010 operating results and selected operational updates, as well as guidance for the remainder of 2010.
 Reported solid results for the quarter achieved operating revenues above the top end of guidance range and diluted earnings per share that exceeded previous guidance and first call consensus for the quarter. We also achieved solid high-speed Internet additions and continue to see significant improvement in year-over-year access line losses, primarily driven by improved line loss results in the legacy Embarq markets.
 The integration of Embarq continues to proceed well, and we continue to make good progress in obtaining approvals necessary to complete the pending Qwest transaction, another transformative acquisition for CenturyLink.
 Moving to Slide 6 from the deck. We are pleased to report solid financial and operating results for the third quarter. Operating revenues were $1.75 billion for the quarter, and diluted earnings per share excluding nonrecurring items is $0.83 per share for the quarter. A primary contribution to our solid results during the quarter was our employees' ongoing efforts to contain operating costs across our business while at the same time, working on the Embarq integration preparing for the Qwest transaction.
 Our cash flows remained strong as we generated free cash flow of more than $380 million, excluding nonrecurring items during the quarter. Additionally, we achieved over $80 million of total operating expense synergies associated with the Embarq integration during the third quarter, and we continue to expect to exit 2010 at our current $330 million annualized operating expense synergy run rate.
 Turning to Slide 7 in the deck. We continue to see an improvement in our year-over-year revenue mix as the Embarq acquisition and our market specific marketing strategies are decreasing our reliance on access revenues. Revenues from data services accounted for 27.5% of the third quarter 2010 total operating revenues compared to 24.6% in the third quarter of 2009.
 Access service revenues represented only 15.1% of total operating revenues in the third quarter 2010, reflecting the company's lowering by on network access related revenues during the quarter.
 We'll continue to experience growth and data revenues, driven primarily by the year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet customers increased demand by business and wholesale customers for high-speed for high-bandwidth services. We remained focused on positioning CenturyLink as the broadband provider of choice in our markets. We continue to enhance our broadband product portfolio to deploying higher speeds and key markets, as well as offering incremental value to broadband features such as computer support and online backup.
 In the business market, we're providing advanced data networks and value-added services to support the needs of our small and midsized businesses and our enterprise customers.
 We continue to position ourselves around our unique capabilities and offer both national reach and intense local focus in leveraging our local operating model.
 Now turning to Slide 8. I'll cover a few additional operating highlights for the quarter. First, we added more than 29,000 high-speed Internet customers during the quarter as demand for broadband remains solid, and customers continue to respond well to our broadband offers. Our targeting marketing strategy in our local operating model displays the sale and serving of closure to our customers. We ended the quarter with approximately 2,365,000 high-speed Internet customers or approximately 35.7% penetration of total addressable access lines.
 We are pleased that we have been able to add more than 175,000 high-speed Internet customers during the last 12 months, representing approximately 8% year-over-year growth in total high-speed Internet subscribers.
 In the third quarter, we maintained the overall go-to-market approach that we used in second quarter where we also launched several new products and promotions to further drive value customer growth and increase share spend with our customer base. This included our new computer support packs which are packages that provide up to four additional services into our new[ph] customers. This include PC security and antivirus, data storage and overall computer hardware, software and peripheral device support through our 24/7 call centers.
 We're also seeing success with our five-year offer that we boast in some of our most competitive markets. Our third quarter line loss is approximately 140,000, it's better than we anticipated going into the quarter and represents a 17.5% improvement for the third quarter of 2009 access line loss.
 In our top five markets, access line performance and high-speed Internet customer growth has improved significantly since we closed the Embarq transactions. In these markets, we've experienced approximately a 33% improvement in access line performance and approximately a 52% improvement in average high-speed Internet growth during the 15-month period post-closing compared to the 15-month period prior to closing. And we believe implementation of CenturyLink's regional operating model with local market accountability and our targeted sales and marketing approach, along with a more stable economy have been key drivers of this turnaround.
 We are pleased that we have been successful in reducing our rate of line loss for the trailing 12-months ended September 30, 2010, to 7.8% compared with a 9.1% trailing 12-month line loss a year ago.
 As we discussed with you in August, CenturyLink's switch satellite providers to DIRECTV in third quarter 2010, and residential service was lost in August 1. We're excited to partner with DIRECTV because of their leadership in HD, sports programming and technology such as whole house DVR.
 The transfer program for combined billing did not start until mid-October. And we also expect a slower sales ramp up with the new provider. These two factors negatively impacted our results for the third quarter as we experienced a decline in satellite video subscribers of approximately 7,400. However, we are not able to utilize the transfer program, but we are seeing sales beginning to ramp up again. We currently offer our CenturyLink Prism IPTV service in five markets, La Crosse, Wisconsin, Columbia and Jefferson City, Missouri and our newest market, Las Vegas, Nevada and Fort Myers, plus Naples, Florida. We are in the process of scaling our newly developed markets of Las Vegas and Fort Myers, both of which are scheduled for full commercial rollout in the first quarter of 2011.
 By the end of next year, we expect to a pass close to 1 million households as we expand service to additional markets. We launched our Prism service in Jefferson City, Missouri in January and exceeded 10% penetration of eligible living units in the market in less than -- in one year's time.
 Over the past year, we have made incremental investments in addition to our Prism IPTV video architecture to specifically target mostly drilling units, and we are beginning now to see success in cash and some of the MBU markets recapturing some of the MBU market share in our service areas.
 Now turning to Slide 9. Our employees continue to do an excellent job of containing costs which contributed to the generation of strong cash flows during the quarter in spite of a very competitive marketplace and economic conditions that remained challenging. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, is more than $895 million from the quarter and more than $2.7 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow is more than $380 million for the quarter, nearly $1.3 billion year-to-date. Our strong cash flow supported the return of nearly $220 million of free cash flow to shareholders during the quarter and nearly $657 million year-to-date through cash dividends.
 Our payout ratio was 57% as capital expenditures increased as expected during the third quarter. The year-to-date payout ratio is 51%.
 Turning to Slide 10. The integration of Embarq continues to progress well. We have successfully completed our third conversion of Embarq customers to CenturyLink billing and operational systems. And we now have approximately 50% of Embarq customers on all these systems. We expect to complete the fourth conversion in the first half of 2011, and we remain on track to complete the fifth and final Embarq conversion by the end of the third quarter 2011.
 We expect to complete the migration of Embarq long-distance customers to the CenturyLink network later this month, eliminating the third-party care[ph] calls for this traffic.
 Now moving to Slide 11. We continue to move steadily ahead with the approval process and integration work for the acquisition of Qwest. The approval process is completed 12 of the 22 state regulatory jurisdictions. We have received clearance to proceed with the transaction of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act from the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. Shareholders of both companies overwhelming their transaction on August 24. On October 22, we announced we have reached an agreement with both the CWA and IBEW that emerges in the public interest and the unions that we agreed to withdraw the acquisition in any remaining state and federal regulatory proceedings.
 We have also outlined the organizational structure and named our top 2 tiers of leaders. And integration teams where employees are working to affect a smooth transition for the combined company.
 Now going to Slide 12. While we are making great progress, there's still important work ahead of us. We remain actively engaged with the 10 remaining commissions that require approval, along with the SEC. We continue to expect to close the transaction in the first half of 2011. As a reminder, the combination with Qwest  would have resulted in pro forma 2009 revenues of $19.8 billion, and it's expected immediately accretive to free cash flow per share, excluding integration costs.
 The transactional strength and sustainability of CenturyLink's dividend while materially lowering the company's payout ratio.
 The combination creates a robust maximum 180,000 model fiber network. We expect to generate annual operating costs and capital expenditures synergies of approximately $625 million, which are expected to be fully realized three to five years following closing.
 The combination of Qwest and CenturyLink will create a strong highly skilled employee base and will establish a national industry leading communications company.
 With that, I'll now turn the call over to Stewart for additional financial highlights in review of our fourth quarter and full year 2010 guidance. Stewart?

During the next few minutes, I'll review some highlights of our third quarter 2010 operating results and will conclude my comments this morning with a discussion of fourth quarter and full year 2010 guidance provided in our earnings release issued earlier today.
 Now turning to Slide 14. Since we reported significant nonrecurring one-time items during the third quarter, I want to briefly recap those items for you before I discuss the third quarter normalized results.
 First, we incurred approximately $27 million of pretax expenses or $0.06 per share related to integration and severance costs associated with the Embarq integration. Second, we incurred about $5 million in pretax expenses or about $0.01 per share related to the Qwest acquisition. In the aggregate, these item represent the $0.07 per share difference in normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.83 in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.76.
 Now turning to Slide 15. In our results for third quarter 2010 compared to third quarter 2009, excluding nonrecurring items for both periods as outlined in our financial schedules. For third quarter 2010, operating revenues decreased $127 million to $1.75 billion from $1.87 billion in third quarter a year ago. Cash operating expenses decreased from $944.5 million in third quarter 2009 to $851.8 million in third quarter this year, primarily due to synergies achieved from the Embarq integration.
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased from $362 million in third quarter 2009 to $358 million in the third quarter of 2010, primarily due to a reduction in the amortization expense associated with the customer life intangible asset established in connection with our Embarq acquisition.
 Net income attributable to CenturyLink for the quarter was $251.1 million compared to $269.1 million in third quarter 2009, and diluted earnings per share for the quarter decreased 7.8% to $0.83 from $0.90 in the third quarter a year ago. And free cash flow did increase 3% from $372.1 million in third quarter 2009 to $383.3 million in the third quarter of 2010.
 Finally, on Slide 16. I would like to discuss the fourth quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance provided in our press release this morning.
 As a reminder, costs incurred by CenturyLink during 2010 related to the Embarq integration and any transaction or integration costs related to the pending Qwest transaction are considered nonrecurring items. These costs, along with any other nonrecurring items that may occur during 2010, are excluded from the diluted earnings per share guidance provided in our press release and in my comments regarding third quarter and full year 2010 diluted earnings per share guidance.
 For the fourth quarter 2010, we expect operating revenues to be in the range of $1.69 billion to $1.71 billion. This decline partially results from approximately $5 million of one-time items in the third quarter. We expect diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter 2010 to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.77. The sequential decline in the earnings per share from third quarter to fourth quarter is due to anticipate the decline in access lines and access minutes of use along with a one-time revenue item mentioned earlier and the increased costs associated with the rollout of IPTV that Glen mentioned, partially offset by lower operating expenses, primarily due to seasonality and outside plant maintenance.
 With those points in mind, we are updating our 2010 guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter. We're also narrowing the range of our diluted earnings per share guidance for full year 2010 from $3.30 to $3.40 to now a range of $3.36 to $3.40. We also continue to expect 2010 capital expenditures to be between $825 million and $875 million.
 In earnings release, we also outlined a few items that we expect to negatively impact 2011 results when compared to 2010. We plan to discuss these items further in connection with our fourth quarter 2010 earnings release when we expect to provide additional guidance for 2011.
 This concludes our prepared remarks for today. At this time, I'll ask the operator to provide further instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call.

We add a new operating model in go-to-market. And we think it's success with that. We're starting to have consistent results but ramping down on all those high-point opportunities that we had. If you look at -- still in the industry in terms of close share, and compared to peers, we're still top of the industry in terms of our performance. So from an internal standpoint, we hit our objectives, and we see that continue to be pretty flat if you look at it just quarter-over-quarter. In terms of competition and speed, we're really seeing not a lot of new incremental competition from cable. There's pockets of more aggressive competition but have not seen any increased competition early in the third quarter, going into fourth quarter. So we feel pretty good about where we are on our high-speed penetration.

It seems to imply a step up in the rate of both annual and sequential declines. You just mentioned in your prepared remarks that a $5 million one-time impact in the fourth quarter, but I'm not sure that would necessarily account for the entire change there. So, I wonder if you can just talk a little bit about the key drivers of that guidance. The items such as the wireless traffic migration delays or anything else we should be thinking about in terms of the 4Q revenue? And then secondly just on the synergies, also you exited third quarter where you plan to exit for the full year. You have about $45 million of incremental synergies still to get your annualized target. So should we expect the bulk of that to come from the system conversions that take place by the third quarter of next year, or are there other areas that we can expect some meaningful synergies over the next few quarters?

So with respect to the fourth quarter revenue guidance, about $5 million is due to the one-time favorable items that we had in the third quarter. Probably about $7 million to $8 million is due to the continued access re-home and long-distance migration that we're seeing that's been delayed. Somewhat, we thought it would happen a little earlier this year, but it's been delayed some, but it will continue to occur. So we're expecting that. And then the majority of -- the rest of the client is really related to expected access line declines and expected continued declines in access minutes of use. With respect to the synergies, yes, we did exit third quarter at about where we expect to exit the year. And you're correct in your rationale there. Basically, we completed one of the other conversions, the third conversion of our customer care billing to the CenturyLink system from Embarq. We have two of those remaining. They will be completed hopefully by the end of the third quarter of 2011. So the majority of the remaining synergies related to Embarq are related to IT and the decommissioning of those systems are after the -- when full transition takes place, as well as some in the county area related to some folks that we have now. They're doing billing managing, billing system and billing process.

Probably, secondhand head-in, back-up head-in with Qwest. I have video capabilities in Denver and in Phoenix. So we'll inherit another head in there. That's almost ready to go. So that's not the big step. We always -- in every market, we'll have several local heading broadcast channel, local channels. That's part of the incremental cost. But it's really a matter of plant condition and really the majority of the costs and the sort of plant is concerned is going to be needed eventually in the next three to five years anyway, to bring plant the standards that we wand and also to bring the higher speed of Internet and other services that we expect to provide. So the incremental plant cause for just the video services, IPTV services, not that large of percentage of the total. But bottom line is, we think the returns remain strong with this product. We're seeing attached rates of about 90% of high-speed Internet attachment rates. We're seeing at least 400 basis points improvement in churn rate with our Prism product, and it's really an outstanding product. It's in many ways better than the cable company has, and our pricing is comparable to cable. So we feel really good about the rollout of Prism. And we're in the process of evaluating the Qwest markets. We don't know yet if the plant condition really makes a big difference and in the timing of the rollout. So we'll be looking at their markets the further we get into this process, the integration of the companies and the weeks and months ahead.

And then second, I think you have shared in the past that the impact online loss and other metrics that you've had has been better in big markets like Las Vegas, for instance, with the Embarq merger then maybe even the averages that you report, and that's obviously going to be highly relevant to the Qwest transaction.

So if you'll take in, there are announced synergy number, we're going to have to see to what extent their reduction in costs are hitting the areas, where we considered we have a synergy. Some of the IT-related costs and the synergies of combining billing systems and operational systems, those certainly will not be impacted. But there maybe other synergies, in general, overhead that they are taking out that could impact the total amount of synergy that we really accomplish after the close. But either way, the costs are coming out. And it should impact favorable overall margins of the combined company. Regarding the impact from line loss that we've seen in other metrics at Embarq, we think the larger market responded well with our local market focus, our really immediate response type advertising, the moving, the decision-making closer to the market. In some ways, there were more feed on the street in some of these markets. We think that it has been impactful. And we think it's made a difference, I guess where the greatest opportunity for us in these larger markets as well. So that's obviously a greater impact there. But we feel good about where we are with the Embarq markets, and we believe we can bring somewhere impacts to the Qwest market. You'll never know until you're there. But right now, in the last Vegas, Orlando, Fort Myers of the world, we are seeing our go-to-market strategies, our local market position or approach working in these larger markets.
