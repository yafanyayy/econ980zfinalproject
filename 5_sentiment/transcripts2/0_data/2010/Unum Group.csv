I'll start my comments this morning with just a few observations on the fourth quarter and then Tom White will then review our operating results for the quarter and Rick McKenney will follow up with some of his comments on the quarter including a review of our capital management and investment portfolio results.
In the fourth quarter, we saw a continuation of many of the positive operates and financial trends of the past several quarters and frankly was a very solid year for this company, especially given the difficult economic and business environment. And let me touch on a few highlights I'd like bring your attention.
First, excluding the net realized after-tax investment gains and losses, we reported $0.66 per share in operating income for the fourth quarter, ahead of last year's fourth quarter of $0.63 per share. The operating earnings of our core operations increased 10%, driven in large part by an 11% increase in operating results in Unum U.S., but also with solid performance in Unum U.K. and Colonial Life. The soft economy and ongoing high levels of unemployment continue to put pressure on our ability to grow the top line, but our risk experience across all of our businesses has remained general stable.
Second, while our overall sales results for the quarter were below our long-term expectations, we did see some positive trends this quarter. For Unum U.S., fourth quarter 2009 core market sales were down 1%, but for the full year actually grew 8%, a strong achievement driven by increased sales to new customers which offset weaker sales results to our existing customer base.
Additionally in Unum U.S., we saw a strong pickup in voluntary benefit sales which increased 13% in the fourth quarter. Sales in Unum U.K. remain strong as we continued to benefit from the exit of a competitor in that market and sales at Colonial grew at 4% in the fourth quarter and 1% for the full year, a solid result in Colonial's marketplace.
Generally speaking, many of the same trends we saw in the first three quarters of 2009 continued in the fourth quarter. The premium income under pressure across all of our businesses as employers are reluctant to add new benefits in this environment and in many cases are reducing employment levels. While we have within very successful in adding new customers, it's only partially offset the pressure felt by the lack of growth within our existing customers.
Third, the investment portfolio continues to perform well and whereas in the investment quality continues to remain very high. Our net realized investment losses are manageable and Rick McKenney will cover this in more detail in a moment.
And finally, we continue to build significant financial strength and flexibility. Again, Rick will provide greater detail on our capital position, but we are comfortable -- but we comfortably exceeded our 2009 targets for holding company capital and risk based capital and we are well on our way to meeting our 2010 targets.
In summary, I feel very good about our fourth quarter results and our position as we move into 2010. Our core operating segments continue to perform well and are generally meeting our expectations. The strong risk results and the margins we are producing reflect our emphasis on disciplined pricing underwriting a risk selection and position us well for profitable growth as the overall economy improves.
Sales momentum in our targeted markets remains generally positive. Our strong value proposition and broader way of product reported by our commitment to service is serving us well in the marketplace. While the economic and competitive conditions may continue to adversely impact premium growth, we will remain disciplined and will not stretch for growth.
Our investment portfolio continues to remain in excellent shape. And finally, with our strong balance sheet and excess capital position, we have significant financial flexibility which we continue to believe is a valuable asset, especially in today's economic environment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom White who will provide an overview of our operating results for the quarter. Tom?

Net income for the fourth quarter was $199.4 million or $0.60 per diluted common share compared to net income of 41.8 million or $0.13 per diluted common share last year.
Included in the results for the fourth quarter of '09 are net realized after-tax investment losses of $18.9 million or $0.06 per diluted common share compared to losses of $167.6 million or $0.50 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter 2008. These amounts include the change in fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified co-insurance arrangement which resulted in a fourth quarter 2009 realized after-tax investment gain of compared to a $120.1 million after-tax loss in the year-ago quarter.
Net realized after-tax investment losses related to sales and write-offs of investments were $41.6 million in the fourth quarter of '09 compared to $47.5 million in the year-ago quarter. So excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $218.3 million for the quarter or $0.66 per diluted common share compared to 209.4 million or $0.63 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter.
Now moving to the operating results. In total, the Unum U.S. operating income increased 11.2% to $203 million in the fourth quarter. Within Unum U.S., the group disability line reported another strong quarter with income up 22% to $72.6 million.
We continued to see improvement in the benefit ratio which declined to 84.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 88.7% in the year-ago quarter and 85.3% in the third quarter this year. A number of factors continue to drive this improvement including favorable business mix shift, net favorable claims experience and ongoing adherence to pricing discipline.
Premium income declined 6% in the quarter reflecting in large part the impact of today's high level of unemployment on the natural growth of our business. The Unum U.S. Group Life and AD&D line operating income in this line declined to $47.7 million in the fourth quarter compared to $50.3 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by lower premium income which declined by 2.6% and a slightly higher expense ratio. This quarter's been fit ratio of 69.9% was stable compared to the 70% benefit ratio in year-ago quarter.
The Unum U.S. supplemental and voluntary business lines fourth quarter income was strong growing 14% to $82.7 million, all three primary business lines, that is the individual disability recently issued, the long-term Caroline and the voluntary benefits line had year-over-year improvement in operating income.
Reported sales on a fully insured basis for Unum U.S. declined by 2.8% in aggregate. As Tom highlighted, core market sales for our group lines, which are LTD, STD, Group Life and AD&D combined, declined by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter, but for full year 2009 sales in the core market increased by 8%.
Sales in the large case market for these lines declined 7.7% in the fourth quarter, but grew by 1.2% for the full year. So, the mix of core market to large case sales in 2009 is 68% in the core market and 32% in the large case market.
The supplemental and voluntary lines reported a combined sales decline of 2.6%. The voluntary benefits line had improved sales this quarter, increasing 12.6% over a year ago, with particularly strong sales in the under 2000, life segment of the market where VB sales increased 20% in the fourth quarter.
Moving to Unum U.K, operating income in this segment increased 12.3%, to $61.3 million in the fourth quarter. The strengthening of the British pound provided a benefit to this quarter's result, as income in local currency increased by 8.7%. The underlying operating performance in the U.K. remains very healthy, with before tax operating margin of 34% in the fourth quarter and 36% for the full year.
The benefit ratio in Unum U.K. declined to 59.6% in the fourth quarter, from 63% a year ago. New claim incidents trends and claim recovery performance in the group long-term disability line were generally favorable relative to a year ago, while risk experienced in the Group Life line were slightly worse.
Fourth quarter sales remained very strong increasing 48% in local currency, as we benefit from the exit of a competitor in the U.K. group risk market. Looking into 2010, this benefit will not persist as the majority of that available business has been placed and we expect to see more challenging sales comparisons again next year in 2010.
Our Colonial Life, concluding our core operations, Colonial Life finished a strong year with growth in fourth quarter operating income of 3%, to $68.3 million. Premium income in Colonial Life grew 3.3%, while the benefit ratio of 48.5% this quarter was slightly elevated compared to the benefit ratio of 48.3% a year ago.
Sales at Colonial Life continued to be encouraging, despite the difficult economy and business environment, increasing 3.7% in the fourth quarter and 1.1% for full year 2009.
Many of the same trends we have discussed with you throughout 2009 continue this quarter, with strong new account growth of 17.9% in the fourth quarter, compared to a year ago.
We also saw favorable sales growth of 15% this quarter in the public sector, an important market for Colonial Life which contributes about a quarter of its sales. Recruiting continues to remain strong, with growth in new rep contracts, up 36% this quarter and 32% for full year 2009.
And finally, average weekly producers increased by 7.9% in the quarter, compared to a year ago. Moving to the individual disability close block segments, operating income here was $5.8 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $7.1 million a year ago.
The interest adjusted loss ratio was stable at 81.6% this quarter, compared to 82.6% a year ago and also 81.6% in the third quarter of '09. Premium income declined by 8.3% and net investment income declined by 3.4%.
Finally, the corporate and other segment reported an operating loss of $16.6 million, compared to a loss of $400,000 in the year-ago quarter.
Expenses are higher in this segment, reflecting approximately $10 million of incremental quarterly pension costs. Interest expense increased to $31.1 million in the fourth quarter of '09, compared to $26.9 million a year ago, reflecting the debt issue from late September.
So with that review of our operating results, I'll turn to Rick McKenney for a further analysis of this quarter's results, Rick.

166762,83890696,48161,"Unum Group, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-03-2010",2010-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Unum Group","Executives","Thank you, John. As you can see, consistency remains a key theme to our fourth quarter results.I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss key drivers of this quarter's results and also provide an update on our investment portfolio and capital position. F",1309,"Thank you, John. As you can see, consistency remains a key theme to our fourth quarter results.
I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss key drivers of this quarter's results and also provide an update on our investment portfolio and capital position. First, steady risk experience across our major lines of business continues to be the primary driver of our strong operating performance.
We commented in the third quarter that we saw a slightly higher level of volatility in claim incidents in our U.S. group disability line. Claim incidents continue to be slightly volatile in the fourth quarter but less so in this quarter relative to the third quarter.
We continued to experience favorable net claims recovery results which, along with the ongoing shift in the mix of business, resulted in further improvement in the benefit ratio this quarter. We anticipate that the benefit ratio in this line will begin to level out in 2010, with further long-term improvement, primarily coming from mix shift changes.
Over the past four years, since the implementation of many changes to our claims management processes, the benefit ratio has declined over 9 percentage points. While at the same time, our customer satisfaction ratings have also improved materially.
In the U.K, risk results were also generally in line with our expectations. Our fourth quarter claim experience for group long-term disability was in line with the incidents and recovery trends of the third quarter. However, Group Life experience was slightly worse than prior quarter results.
We believe this quarter's risk results are more indicative of the trends we'll see in 2010 than the extraordinary favorable results we experienced in the first half of 2009.
Colonial Life's risk results also remain in line with our projections with favorable results in the accident, sickness and disability lines, offset by slightly higher claim experience in the life and cancer and critical illness lines. The overall benefit ratio for the segment came in at 48.5%.
Turning to our top line performance, we described the challenges faced in today's environment of high unemployment and ongoing market competition to grow our top line. These trends remained evident in the fourth quarter and provided meaningful headwinds to each of our businesses. For example, we estimate that the natural growth of our Unum U.S. inforce business, that is the premium growth we normally generate from customer growth, salary increases and benefit plan enhancements, resulted in over a 3% decline in our block in 2009, compared to the expected growth of 2 to 3% we typically experience in a more normal economic environment.
The impacted premium income in our group lines by this actually impacted premium income in our group lines, by approximately $200 million in 2009. This will turn with the economy and improved employment levels. I'm encouraged as well by our new account growth and generally stable persistency trends which bode well for resumed top line growth as economic conditions turn more favorable.
I'm also encouraged by the improvement we saw in Unum U.K. with fourth quarter premium income rebounding from decline we experienced in the third quarter and this was the first sequential quarter improvement in premium income we've seen in the past six quarters. The recent increased sales activity and firming up persistency in 2009 has helped stabilize our in-force premium.
Thirdly, our investment portfolio remained strong again this quarter, reflecting the ongoing rally in the fixed income markets both in terms of spreads and improvement in default trends. For reference, the spread on Barclays U.S. investment grade credit index is tightened further to 157 basis points in December from 198 basis points at September 30th. This tightening was offset by widening of the U.S. ten year Treasury rate by 53 basis points.
The net unrealized gain position on our fixed maturities securities portfolio reflects these movements and with $2 billion at year end 2009 compared to $2.2 billion at September 30. With this stability in the investment portfolio, the company's book value per share was similarly stable.
Book value per share was $25.62 at December 30th 2009, a sequential increase of 3% from September 30th and 33% higher than a year ago. In the fourth quarter our reported net realized investment losses excluding the embedded derivative gain of $20.7 million after tax totaled $42 million after tax.
This after-tax realized loss this quarter compares to 19.4 million in the third quarter and 47.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The losses this quarter were primarily related to impairments on certain holdings of securities in the financial institution sector.
As we look forward, we expect a level of reported net realized investment losses to improve as unrealized losses on credits on our watch list has dropped by 85%. One area that continues to receive more attention in the world around us is exposure to commercial real estate and mortgage loans. First of all, we have no CMBS exposure and our commercial mortgage loans currently total $1.4 billion or around 3% of our investment portfolio.
At year end 2009 we had one delinquent loan with a book value of $2 million two foreclosed properties where we expect to fully recoup our principal. We only had nine loans maturing this year and in fact we only average $30 million of loan maturities per year for the next four years. Our current loan to value ratio is approximately 69% and our portfolio is well diversified with respect to geographic distribution and property type and our underwriting standards have remained conservative.
We're confident that our portfolio is well positioned and that any losses we may incur will be manageable. When turning to our capital position the solid investment performance and good risk results not only produced strong GAAP earnings this quarter, it also generates strong statutory earnings in our traditional U.S. life insurance companies.
Fourth quarter 2009 after-tax stat operating earnings were 246.6 million which brings our full year after-tax operating earnings to over 740 million. These strong results which also reflect some inter-company dividends are outlined in our statistical supplement and drive very positive momentum in our capital management metrics and overall financial strength and flexibility.
As a result of this strong earnings profile we estimate that our year end RBC for our traditional U.S. life companies, traditional life subsidiaries was 382%. Looking ahead, we continue to expect to manage our RBC ratio during 2010 within a range of 375 to 400%.
Holding company capital finished the year $915 million, ahead of our expectations and leverage at year end 2009 was 20.5%. We have no debt maturing in 2010 and with a small contribution our pension underfunding is down to $77 million.
You can see from these results that Unum's financial and cay capital positions remain very strong. As we discussed with you at our investor meeting back in November, we've had a conservative stance regarding deploying our excess capital specifically through share repurchases.
We do recognize the cost of maintaining this posture and continue to reflect on the environment and its contribution to making these decisions. To be more specific, the primary factors that will influence our thinking include macro level impacts such as our assessment of general economic and business conditions in the U.S. and the U.K. and the investment environment and potential impacts on our portfolio.
We'll also take into account the outlook for our businesses which include the level of our statutory earnings and free cash flow and finally, we will evaluate our ongoing capital levels including RBC and holding company capital.
We feel well situated beginning 2010 and we will monitor these factors as we move through the year. All in, it was another very good quarter for the company with solid operating performance and further strengthening of our financial platform and flexibility.
Now I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments.

I think as we all shared with you this morning we're certainly very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results and I'm especially, Rick - I’m extremely proud of the work our people have done to help us deliver these results.
Profitably growing our top line remains challenge for us in this environment, I am encouraged by the underlying trends we're seeing in new customer account growth and persistency both of which bode well for presumption of premium growth as better employment conditions emerge.
While top line growth is important, I can assure you that we will remain disciplined in our pricing and underwriting to protect the margins that we worked so hard to restore over the past year.
It is comments Rick outlined several factors that will drive our capital management strategy and the potential redeployment of our excess capital. While general economic and regulatory conditions remain uncertain, our fourth quarter results were certainly very strong relative to these factors.
Our risk experience and operating trends remain strong, our statutory earnings are historically high level. Our year end RBC of 382% and holding company capital position of $915 million are comfortably within our projected levels for yearend 2010 and our watch list of potential problem credits has declined significantly in 2009 which is again why we choose so good about the things that we can control.
A final comment before we go to your tune to your questions. With respect to our outlook, we continue to expect operating earnings growth for 2010 within our previous expectations of growth of 4 to 6%. I would direct you to our investor meeting presentation of November for additional detail on our business segment outlook.

Average price levels looked like they were going down in the market and I think that affected our core sales a lot during the fourth quarter.
Nevertheless, I think we had a pretty strong quarter. We had a strong full year. We're positioned very well I think for 2010. Our business mix is running well. Customer satisfaction ratings are high. And I would expect that as the economy recovers also upgrades in benefits or what we call MBOC, our new business on old accounts will also I think improve in the latter half of 2010 and that lagged significantly all during 2009 including during the fourth quarter. So for the most part, I think we're in a good place.

During the course of the year, we had good and steady progress in terms of growing account acquisitions through simply Unum. I think something like a quarter of our under 500 life business was put on that platform in the group business and more than a third of our core VB business was put on that platform. As we look at that business strategy with Simply Unum, a primary element of it is to provide increased purchasing -- pricing flexibility for employers by combining employer paid in a pre-pay coverages. And we saw a significant increase during the course of 2009 in package sales involving both group and voluntary benefits. And I think that strategy seems to be playing out well for us.
During the fourth quarter, we introduced an expansion of our offering there where we provide additional funding flexibility and group disability for the packages of employer and employee funding. We test marketed that in four offices and had outstanding results in those four offices. We'll be rolling that enhancement out during the first quarter of 2010. So good solid steady progress in the core market in terms of new account acquisition through our Simply Unum platform.

As I look back at 2009, I'm especially pleased to see that we've actually across all of our businesses had very good new account growth. So the good news is your value proposition, our product deliverables, our people, those sorts of things are leading us to build additional customer relationships across each of our businesses and certainly, we could use an uplift in the employment picture to help get some of that natural growth back into the system. But certainly from my point of view, I'm very, very encouraged by the ability to attract new business in this environment without compromising any of our risk or those sorts of disciplines. Kevin, you talked about Simply Unum. I think it's safe to say in Unum U.S., for example, there are other initiatives under way, some of which have a little bit of product extension point of perspective to it. But I think there's good growth in things we're doing just in the normal course.

During the course of the year, let me just reflect quickly on 2009. Our new group account growth, the premium growth was 20% for the year. Our new core VB growth in premium was 18% for the year.

Our new group account growth, the premium growth was 20% for the year. Our new core VB growth in premium was 18% for the year. So in our strategic growth areas, I think we're doing pretty well. Most of our lag in sales in total sales was reflected really more in two key areas. One as I mentioned earlier, so-called MBOC, upgrade in benefits which were down significantly for the year. In group they were down 19%. That can sometimes account for 25% to a third in our overall sales. And so that decline shows up in the overall sales picture. We would expect that to recover during 2010. And then our other declines in sales were more reflective of lines of business that we are being extremely cautious with, those lines being individual disability income, in this economy and also long-term care.
So in terms of growth, I think as we look forward, growth's going to come from our business strategy. It's going to come from core group. It's going to come from packages with voluntary benefits. It's going to come from a recovery in MBOC and then as the economy recovers on the top line earned premium, we also should start to see an elimination of the drag that we had from lack of normal growth in 2009.

Tom, we still feel very optimistic about our conventional value proposition, packaging our individual products with our enrollment and benefits communication capabilities, primary focus on growth.

Our new rep recruiting level was up over 30% again in 2009 and that's two back-to-back years growing our agency system at that level. We continue to see good strong production from those new reps.
As Tom pointed out, very strong new account growth. Average weekly producers is growing close to 8% in the fourth quarter of 2009. So, we're very encouraged about the opportunity and just think we need to stay focused on growing distribution, stay focused on our core commercial market and public sector whereas Tom said we've seen very, very good growth there.

And so we did to see good results and certainly to the key sales drivers showed improvements in terms of close rates, case counts and average premiums. And similar to Kevin's story where we didn't see sales growth come through with regards to upsell to our existing clients so due to economic reasons and we were sort of falling short on that.
In terms of growth for 2010 and beyond, we're really looking to deepen and widen the penetration and as our products across the market and also within employers, seven out of -- one in seven employees are covered by our products and so we still have to widen the penetration. We've got a great opportunity to do that. And the ways in which we'll do that, we're making changes to our existing offering and what we have to offer currently is really right at the forefront of the market. We want to make sure that we stay that way. So we're refreshing our group long-term disability offering during the first half of this year and we have, again, plans to revamp and refresh and relaunch our Group Life offering. We did that during the course of 2009 and that showed some nice, strong improvements this year as a result.
We also have some technology changes to support our small to medium case proposition which we think will provide us with further opportunity. We have a new focus segmentation model and there are some new segments that we're working on developing a new proposition for where we again have identified some good opportunities and we have a customer segmentation model to help us target new employers.
And in addition to that, you've raised a question about Simply Unum and as you know we've been working on a new proposition to launch to the U.K. market to really take advantage of that platform and roll that out so that we're able to target new segments and that's very much on track for launching during the course of this year. I think those, Tom, are the primary areas of the U.K.

There continue to be some uneconomic and regulatory uncertainties out there. So we're not going to be held to a time frame but I think we know there's a cost to continue to have excess capital like we do and hopefully, again, our behavior and our actions in the past show that we recognize that we've got to put capital back in the hands of our shareholders and we'll do it, when we feel we've got, the things are lined up properly.

I think we are not rushing to return our free capital to shareholders too quickly, it was the right answer when we talked to investors in November.
And it's still the right answer. I would say from a trend perspective, two things really have improved. The world around us does seem a little bit better, although far from healed and our capital does continue to build, so.
We will factor those trends in with our Board of Directors, when we discuss with them and continue to discuss with them when we will redeploy capital if we don't have other uses for it. Whether it's through dividend, as Tom talked about, M&A or through share repurchase.

We still believe it's an incredibly valuable asset to have excess capital these days and has we want to be different things when we will be considerations for. We want to be very thoughtful about that and some of those considerations are things that are outside the operating sort of purview if you look at company and thus the environment is something we have to factor in. Obviously the rating agencies, Tom Watjen are certainly going to be part of that too. I don't know if you want to touch on where we are with the rating agencies that’s only the consideration.

Yeah, this time of year, we tend to kind of fine-tune our business plan. We fine-tune our capital management plan and that's something that we'll be presenting to them. It's clearly a little frustrating from our perspective. We think we've posted some very strong results. The ratings at this point we don't think necessarily reflect that. There's not a whole lot we can do about it other than continue to operate the business the way we have and continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and a substantial amount of flexibility and ultimately that will come through in higher ratings. But I think you raise a great point in that we have operated very well with these ratings. If you think back over the last five years, I think we had only had one ratings upgrade which is S&P a couple years ago and it really -- it's not a significant headwind to sales or our perception in the marketplace right now.

Just a few numbers about where we are and the numbers I'll quote are for our Unum U.S. LTD business. Keep in mind, we look at this on every different line of business by company and by line of business so there are a lot of different portfolios that we manage because they're different cash flow characteristics and duration characteristics. But just focusing in on one for Unum U.S. LTD, we have a 92 -- we currently have a 92 bases sis point margin between the portfolio yield and the aggregate discount rate on the claims. And that's made up of a portfolio yield of 6.74% currently and the aggregate discount rate is a 5.82%.
Now, for new claims that come in, we use a much lower discount rate when we set up those reserves. Now, we don't disclose what that is, because it is part of our pricing formula and we don't like to talk about assumptions that go into our pricing formula. So that's where we stand today. I'll note that in the third quarter, that margin was 91 basis points. So we expanded by 1 basis point over that period of time.
Now, the way we manage it is to really look at it over a much longer period of time because that 92 basis points is good to know at this point but what's more interesting to us is what is it going to look like over the next handful of years, given a bunch of different interest rate scenarios and I went back and I looked three years ago, if you just took a snapshot of fourth quarter of '06, we had a 66 basis point margin. And what happened over those three years is that our portfolio yield expanded by 5 basis points, so we took advantage of a few opportunities in the market when rates were up and corporate spreads widened out, so we got a 5 basis point expansion in the portfolio yield but a 21 basis point expansion in that discount rate.
So I think -- so what happened is it went from a 6.03% down to a 5.82% and I think that gives you an indication that for new claims that came in over that period of time, we were using a much lower discount rate and so those things will move gradually over time. We feel very, very good about where we're positioned right now. Certainly, we would love to see a higher interest rate environment. That would be beneficial to us but given that margin that we have right now, it will take a very long time for it to eat into that margin in a substantial way and as it does, then, at that point when we look at making some -- small adjustments quarter-to-quarter, which really wouldn't have much impact in the market.

So that's one kind of behavior that you see. And I think a lot of times you see it on what I'll call quote important accounts, an account where either it has a name brand in the large case business or in the mid-sized business market you see it because acquiring that one mid-sized case can make up for missing on a lot of small cases. So you'll see that kind of behavior.
The other thing, I'd say is just the extended rate guarantees. In this economic environment, I'm sure I'm not the only one who would say that's not a great idea but nevertheless we see it, we've seen 4, 5 even 7 year rate guarantee open up because the 10 cases.

I said earlier that, I'm hopeful that NBOC and even normal growth will recover maybe in the latter half of 2010. Our customer satisfaction ratings are terrific. And I think across the board, all the metrics are sort of lining up positively for us going into 2011 and 2012. But 2010, I think we have to stick with flat sort of reasonable assumption.

That's because we're pretty disciplined about our pricing. And so we got our shots and sometimes we see pricing levels that we think we can sustain and manage risk at and sometimes we don't.
In that kind of behavior in the large case market I think reflects itself but it's muted of course when you look at sort of the total marketplace. But you always as I think Tom said get competitors looking at their overall sales results and sometimes being more aggressive for a short period of time and that kind of volatility has been in the business as long as I've been in it.

Despite the challenging business and economic environment, I’m generally pleased with our results for the second quarter; both our operating and investment performance, and the strength of our capital position.  And",626,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning.  Despite the challenging business and economic environment, I’m generally pleased with our results for the second quarter; both our operating and investment performance, and the strength of our capital position.  
And let me touch on four basic takeaways for the quarter.  
First, our business has continued to produce solid margins and profitability.  Excluding net realized after-tax investment gains and losses, we reported $0.69 per share in operating income for the second quarter, an increase of 6.2% compared to the year-ago quarter.  
Our Core Operations continue to produce generally solid results, especially Unum U.S., with operating earnings growth of 12.9% and Colonial with a growth rate of 3.6%.  
On a constant currency basis, operating earnings for our three core segments combined, which is Unum U.S., Unum U.K., Colonial Life was 4.4% higher than the second quarter of last year.  
Second, we’re generating these results in obviously what continues to be a challenging business and economic environment.  Unemployment in the U.S. and in the U.K. remains high and continues to pressure premium growth in both of these markets.
Additionally, we continue to see some very aggressive pricing and underwriting action by certain competitors, both in the U.S. and in the U.K.  While these pressures impact our overall sales results, I am encouraged by the trends we’re seeing in the market segments we have targeted for growth, specifically the core, or smaller-case marketplace and the voluntary benefit marketplace.
While we did not see growth across all of our targeted market, our Unum U.S. voluntary benefit sales grew 51%, our Unum U.K. core market sales grew 45% on a local currency basis, and Colonial Life core market sales were up 14%.  
We are continuing to take a disciplined targeted approach to growth, which is serving us well in this environment.
Third, our investment portfolio remains in very good shape.  With this quarter’s net-realized investment losses, excluding the accounting for the ModCo embedded derivative, again at very low levels.
The net unrealized gain in our fixed income portfolio grew to $3.7 billion this quarter, which much of which was obviously as a result of the climbing interest rate.
While today’s low level of interest rates can present challenges to some, as Rick will discuss in his comments, as a result of our disciplined approach to interest rate management, we are well positioned to effectively manage our exposure of today’s environment.
And lastly, given our solid operating results and strong investment performance, we continue to build on our already strong capital position.  
Our weighted-average risk-based capital ratio was approximately 400% at the end of the second quarter.  And our holding company cash and market security position remains above $770 million.  Both consistent with our March 31st levels. 
We maintained these levels while also repurchasing approximately $130 million of our shares in the marketplace this last quarter.
In summary, I feel very good about our results so far this year.  We continue to face premium growth challenges in certain lines of business, but our operating and investment results remains strong and we can continue to generate excess capital, which we are using to repurchase stock and support our previously announced dividend increase.
With the passage of both Healthcare Reform Legislation, and some of the changes involving the financial services sector, the insurance sector and the broader financial services industries are undergoing unparallel change.  
We continue to believe though that our basic business of providing benefits to employees at the work place remains a good business where we can both make a difference in the lives of our customers and create attractive returns for our shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom White, who will provide an overview of our operating results for this quarter.  Tom?

Thanks, Tom.  Net income for the second quarter was $209.7 million or $0.63 per diluted common share compared to net income of $267.2 million or $0.80 for diluted common share last year.
Included in the results for the second quarter of 2010, our net realized after-tax investment losses of $18.9 million or $0.06 per diluted common share compared to after-tax gains of 51.4 million or $0.15 per diluted common share last year.  
Net-realized after-tax investment losses for the second quarter 2010 include an after-tax loss of 15.3 million resulting from changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative and a modified co-insurance contract, compared to an after-tax gain of $91 million in the second quarter of 2009.  
Also included in net-realized after tax investment losses for the second quarter 2010 are net-realized after-tax investment losses of $3.6 million, related to sales and write downs of investments compared to net after-tax losses of 39.6 million in the second quarter of 2009.
So excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $228.6 million for this quarter or $0.69 per diluted common share compared to 215.8 million or $0.65 per diluted common share in the year ago quarter.
Turning to the operating segment, in total Unum U.S. operating income increased 12.9% to $216 million in the second quarter.  Within Unum U.S., the group disability line reported another strong quarter with income up 23.1% to 84.1 million.
The group disability benefit ratio fell to 84.6% in the second quarter from 87% in the year ago quarter.  This result is consistent with our expectations and reflects favorable business mix shifts in our ongoing adherence to pricing discipline.
Other factors driving the positive results in our group disability line, include operating expense, discipline, and strong premium and [inaudible] persistency for both group long-term and short-term disability.  
Premium income declined 3.8% in the quarter reflecting in large part the impact of today’s high level of unemployment on the natural growth of our business.  
Within the Group Life and AD&D line, operating income increased 5.7% to $51.5 million.  A slight improvement in premium income as well as stable risk experience helped to generate the improved earnings.
In the Supplemental and Voluntary line, second quarter income was up 8.2% to $80.4 million from 74.3 million a year ago.  The improvement was driven by higher earnings contributions from both the long-term care and voluntary benefits lines of business.  
Reported sales for Unum U.S. declined 16% in aggregate compared to the second quarter 2009, in what continues to be a highly-competitive pricing environment.  
Sales for our group line which are LTD, STD, and Group Life and AD&D combined, declined approximately 30% in the second quarter.  
Remember last year, second quarter results included unusually high large-case sales activity that was not duplicated this year, adding to the large-case market sales decline of 53.4% in the second quarter.  
Sales in the core market for these lines declined by 13.2% in the second quarter.  These trends were partially offset by stronger results from our supplemental and voluntary lines, especially the voluntary benefits line with sales growth of 50.8% this quarter.
Moving to Unum U.K.; Operating Income in this segment decreased 21.4% to $52.9 million.  Operating income declined 18.9% in local currency with reported income for the quarter negatively impacted by the slight weakening of the British pound.
Premium income in local currency decreased 8.2% in the second quarter due to lower premium growth from existing customers and a decline in the in-force block of group LTD business, partly offset by an increase in the in-force block of group life business.
The benefit ratio in Unum U.K. increased 66% in the second quarter from 54.4% a year ago, reflecting the impact of lower earned premiums, higher claims in the Group Life and the Group Disability blocks when compared to the very favorable experience of the second quarter of last year, and the impact of higher inflation in the U.K. on an inflation index-linked group policy.  
Second quarter sales increased 15.8% in local currency, driven by strong sales in the group life market and a more moderate increase in group disability.  
Concluding our core operations, Colonial Life had a strong quarter with premium growth of 6.7% and operating earnings growth of 3.6%.  The benefit ratio 48.3% this quarter was elevated compared to the year ago benefit ratio of 46.4% but still a very favorable result, which produced a very strong profit margin of 27.6% this quarter.  
Sales at Colonial Life continue to be encouraging, increasing 7.6% for the second quarter.  Underlining these results are several positive for trend, highlighted by new account growth of 13.6% compared to the second quarter of '09.  In addition, recruiting trends continue to remain strong with growth in new rep contracts of 20.3% this quarter.  
Finally, average weekly producers at Colonial Life increased 9.7% in the quarter compared to last year.
The Individual Disability Closed-Block operating income was $12.4 million compared to $10 million in the year ago quarter.  The interest-adjusted loss ratio was slightly higher at 85.4% this quarter compared to 82% a year ago.
Premium income declined 6.8% and net investment income was flat year over year.  Interest on debt and operating expenses were both lower this quarter compared to the second quarter of last year.  
And finally, the Corporate and Other segment reported an operating loss of 17.6 million compared to a loss of $16 million in the year ago quarter.  
Net Investment income was higher, reflecting higher levels of invested assets, while Interest Expense increased to 30.8 million this year compared to 25.6 million last year, reflecting the debt issuance from late September, 2009.  
Results also reflect the impact of higher litigation expenses, which we expect to be one time in nature.
So with that review of the operating results, I’ll turn the call over to Rick McKenney for further analysis of this quarter’s results.

As you can see, our operating trends this quarter remain solid, and generally consist in with our experience of the past few quarters.  I'd like to discuss with you the key drivers of this quarter’s results and provide some insight on our investment portfolio, interest rate management and our capital position.
First, looking at our profit margins, our overall risk experience is preforming well though with slightly more volitility than we saw in the first half of 2009.  In Unum U.S., risk experience remain generally stable across all lines and given the premium growth challenges we currently face, remains the primary driver of this quarter’s 12.9% increase in operating income.  
Our group disability results remains strong with an improvement in the benefit ratio of 2.4% on a year-over-year basis.  And while new claim incidence was slightly higher this quarter, we had very good long-term disability claim recovery experience relative to last year’s second quarter.  
Subsequently, from the first quarter we did see an uptick in the benefit ratio of 0.4% driven by the slight increase in claim incidences while claim recoveries remain inconsistent.  The volatility in new submitted claim incidences shows no real underline trends, and no signs of being economically or recession influenced.  
So while we have seen some quarter-to-quarter volatility in submitted claim incidence over the last year, we believe it is within a normal level of volatility.  
These results are also consistent with our view that the group disability benefit ratio will stabilize at roughly the level we experience in the last few quarters.  
Looking out further, as our overall business mix for Unum U.S. shifts with the growth of our voluntary benefits business, this diversification can further improve the overall margins for the segment.  
Looking to the U.K., risk results were slightly elevated from our expectations this quarter.  On a second quarter 2009 to second quarter 2010 comparison basis, the benefit ratio increased from 54.4% to 66%.  While this is a dramatic move there are multiple drivers to it.
First, this is largely the result of very favorable risk experience we enjoyed last year, which was well below our expectations and has returned to a more normal level in 2010.  
We are also impacted by a couple of points for reserve increases due to higher inflation in the U.K.  This doesn’t impact the bottom line due to the offset by a match of our inflation-linked bonds in the investment portfolio.  
In the Life Line, our group life risk experience improved from the high mortality we saw in first quarter.
Finally, Colonial Life’s risk results remain solidly in line with our expectations and the trends of the past several quarters.  The Colonial Life benefit ratio for the second quarter was 48.3%, higher than the year-ago level of 46.4% but in line with our view that the benefit ratio will trend up slightly over time.
So with our underlying profit margins holding generally stable, I’d like to turn to the ongoing challenges we see in growing our top line in this difficult environment of both from a business and economic perspective.
Focusing first on Unum U.S., we’ve referenced our measure of natural growth on recent conference calls.  Our sense is that natural growth still represent a headwind of approximately 1%, not as bad as the 3% impact we felt in 2009, but still a drag on our book of business and therefore our ability to grow the premium line.
The market here is still slower, which benefits us by continued high persistency, but elevates the competition for new cases.  
Tom outlined the challenges to grow Unum U.S. sales in the Group Disability and Group Life businesses reflecting the large case succuss we had this time last year.  We benefited that time from the upheaval in the market resulting from the financial crisis but now we’re seeing ongoing price competition.
A bright spot in the growth in our sales is in our voluntary business, in both large-case and core voluntary market segments and from new and existing cases.  
Within our Unum U.K. results, premium income remains under pressure with second quarter premium income down 8.2% in local currency.  
New sales this quarter did increase by 15.8% with better activity in the core market and persistency remained solid.  However, pressure continues on our in-force premium levels from reduction and covered lives and ongoing competitive pressures.  
Looking in to our Colonial Life results, our growth metrics are in good shape.  We continue to pose strong trends and new sales, recruiting trends, agent productivity, persistency, and ultimately premium growth.
Second quarter sales increased by 7.6% and have grown 5.5% over the past four quarters; very strong performance in a weak market.  This success is attributed to a number of factors, but particularly strong recruiting trends over a number of years have driven noticeable success in new account growth.  This was up 13.6% for the second quarter and 21.2% for the first half of the year.  
This success in new account growth combined with a stable persistency we’ve experienced will allow us to grow the Colonial Life segment more quickly as the economy improves.  
Rounding out my comments on profitably, I'd like to shift to the investment portfolio and trends we’re seeing.  Net investment income on the quarter grew 5.4% and partially benefited from a higher level of miscellaneous net investment income.  
We would expect some ongoing level of miscellaneous income from our bond portfolio, particularly from our private placement portfolio, but it’s difficult to predict.  
If you look at the investment portfolio in totality, we continue to see very strong performance, driven by the ongoing rally and treasury as well as fundamental improvement in the credit profile of our portfolio.  
With the rally and the treasury markets during the second quarter our net-unrealized gain position and our fixed-maturity securities portfolio improved further to a quarter-end level of $3.7 billion of unrealized gains, compared to a gain $2 billion at year-end 2009 and unrealized loss position of 2.5 billion at the worst point of the credit crisis.
Our net realized investment losses remained quite manageable at 5.9 million in second quarter, which compares to losses of 65.1 million in the year-ago quarter.  
Of course, the flip side of low interest rate and tight corporate bond spreads is the challenge it presents to new money investments, and the opportunity for investors to invest across the spectrum.  We would always rather be purchasing higher-yielding bonds for higher net investment income, but the key focus for our business in this environment is the interplay between our portfolio yields backing our various product lines and the aggregated discount rates imbedded in the reserves.
Looking at our results this quarter, our overall portfolio yield backing products remains stable at 6.76%.  And broke down to the product line level, our product lines specific portfolio showed the same level of consistency.  
Despite this low interest rate environment we believe that we are well positioned for several reasons.  One, we have maintained a consistent rate for new claim discount rates while our new money investment opportunities have outperformed over the last several years.  That is, we are putting money to work in what is a beneficiary of widening corporate bonds spreads during the credit crisis.  This kept our yields stable while discount rate declined.  
Since the crisis has abated, our investment team has done a good job of finding relative value across our asset classes.  Part of that is due to our low level of new money to invest, relative to the size of our existing portfolios.  
For example, over the next six quarters, or 18 months, we project approximately 75 million of new money to invest in our closed disability block on a portfolio of $11 billion.  
And then our Unum U.S., long-term disability block will have about 600 million to invest on a portfolio of approximately $9 billion.  Therefore, even at today’s new money rates, and a diminished impact in our closed block.  
Again, a stable long-term portfolio yield, even in today’s rate environment combined with our new claim discount rates provide us with longer term stability.  
So while low rates represented a challenge to us and all insurers, we remain well positioned and we believe we can tolerate for some time a prolonged low interest rate environment.
Accommodation of the strong financial and investment results are also reflected in the company’s book value per share, which was $27.12 at June 30.  A sequential increase of 2.8% from March, and an increase of 20.2% relative to a year-ago.  
Moving to our capital, our statutory earnings were very strong this quarter and our corresponding capital growth remains quite healthy.  Net income on a statutory basis for our traditional U.S. life insurance subsidiaries in the second quarter was $176 million compared to $108 million in the year ago quarter.  This continues strong performance as resulted in growth in our capital base at our insurance subsidiaries and improvement in our RBC ratio to an estimated 400%, which is at the upper end of our target of 375 to 400% range.  
We also finished the quarter with continued strength at our holding companies with cash and marketable securities ending the second quarter at $773 million, essentially flat with the March 31th level of 775 million.   
As announced in May, we began to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing our shares.  During the second quarter we repurchased 5.7 million shares or approximately $130 million of the $150 million authorized by our board.  
We were pleased to do that while keeping all our capital metrics at very solid levels as well as our leverage below 20%.  
Before I close and turn the call back to Tom, I'd like to highlight a couple of items we’re watching closely in the second half of the year, related to our growth rates.  
The first is premium growth, we’ve described the headwind we feel from today’s high levels of unemployment.  And while the trend is stabilized somewhat, it clearly impacts our sales and premium growth.  In this market we will remain disciplined.  
And second, we continue to watch for the trends and risk experience given the continued volatility of the world around us.  
So wrapping up, despite volatility we might see, our confidence remains high in our business and in our ability to generate strong overall margins and cash flow for our share holders.  This is best exemplified in our consistent return equity which is 14% for our core businesses and 11.5% on a consolidated basis built on top of a strong capital position.  
And now, I'd like to turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments.

I think last year the first half of the year, as you’ll recall, a number of our competitors were struggling with a number of issues and we had a pretty robust first half of the year.   
At that time we sort of anticipated that the second half of the year, and going into the beginning of this year, that the pricing environment would be softer.   I think that’s proven to be true.   Average prices seem to be sort of trailing down in the marketplace, and that’s resulted in us being sort of disciplined in our overall pricing and more focused on growth in our strategic businesses, our core businesses, our Simply Unum Platform, the voluntary business, all of which are up for the first half of this year.   
So I think for us, the stabilization maybe has more to do with our focus on our strategy as opposed to the market pricing has stabilized.   I think market prices are still soft.

But I think it’s consistent with what we’ve been talking about.   So we probably would have said earlier in the year in the low-60s and somewhere in between that and trending up slightly as the book matures.  
I think I would remind you very quickly though of even in those ranges, this is a very profitable book of business in generating ROEs in the 20s, which is the thing to focus on.   Even at that level we’re very happy; very happy with that business.

We’ve consistently been a market leader.   As Rick said, we’ve consistently continued to produce an extremely strong return.
I think one of the things we’ve done, certainly at investor day last year, which is - we’re not changing that outlook because we have to assume we’re going to continue to see those returns decline because certainly we’ve had some very unusual returns over the past several years.   
So none of that changes, I don’t think, as a result of what we’re seeing today, or any of the changes that we’ve made.   Frankly, like with all of our businesses, we’ve got sort of a challenging short term.   I’d say in the U.K.  we’re finding even a greater challenging short-term environment with the employment picture, the competitive dynamics, those sorts of things impacting the near term.  
Certainly in the U.K., we’ve - in the long-term, are very optimistic as we see hopefully broadening the market for the products and services that we think the market needs and we can provide.  
So I don’t think anything changes from any of those points of view at all.   
Certainly from the management-change point of view, you know, that was a decision that we made that we looked forward and looked at some of the demands on the business, looked at some of the needs that we have, looked at the recourses we have and we thought that a change was appropriate.  
So again, I wouldn’t read into it any further than that.

I think it’s been pretty clear that you feel that this level of earnings is sort of a reasonable expectation for where we might track in the near term.   You’ve talked about kind of a mid-60s loss ratio being reasonable.   
But then we look at the top line and constant currency, the premium’s down 8% this quarter.   And then you look at how we got there, I mean, life premiums up 19%, disability down 16%.   My understanding is that you’d like to balance that out, but you don’t necessarily want to be growing life 19%.   But if you throttle back in life, try to grow disability, but in a competitive environment, I guess it’s not clear that you can turn negative 8% premium growth into flat premium growth anytime soon.   
And if that’s the case, then how do we kind of hold margins and hold earnings at the same time?

So as we’ve gone through the renewal, the sensus data has been down, so we’ve actually seen premiums come down a little bit faster than we would have expected in the current quarter.   
So I think that that is the key.   We’ve got to keep the premium line growing.   What you talked about in the sales front is absolutely true.   I don’t think we’re throttling back too much on the life business, it’s more about throttling up on the disability side.   But it is about premium growth.  
I think we’re happy with the margins holding at very strong levels.   And so it is about that premium growth.   So we’ll continue to talk about a strategy there.

I mean, persistency has actually been very strong in the U.K.   It’s really been with existing cases as a reduction in employment.   As I mentioned before, much of our practice in the U.K. versus in the U.S. is really a more of a white-collar practice.   That’s just the nature of the marketplace in the U.K.   
So obviously, we’ve seen some shrinkage in the white-collar population be insured.   We’ve seen some wave pressures of those that we do insure.   And frankly, part of what we insure is an element of bonuses.   
So there’s an element of things here that are actually causing the premium pressure.   It doesn’t have to do with a loss of cases, it has to do with what’s happening within those particular cases actually, Jeff.   
So we have seen some leveling off, I’d say, in certain aspects of that.   But again, we’re remaining cautious, I think, in saying that frankly the greatest pressure probably there in that market is less around benefits than it is on premiums.   But we do see is that we’ve seen that kind of stabilizing at these levels.

I think maintain is probably the better answer there.   I think expenses are down for a couple of reasons.   One, we had a significant investment during the ’07-’09 period in building out our enrollment capacity, our Simply Unum Platform, growing our core distribution field force, and we’re largely - so the cap expenditures of having to make that invested in leveling it off.   
So not having to continue to make that investment, I think, is benefited us on the expense ratio.   I also think that the slower sales environment sort of basically depresses acquisition costs as well.   And so we sort of benefited on the expense ratio side from that.  
I think realistically, as the economy recovers, if and when the economy recovers, you know, I’d expect sort of a continued movement towards the smaller sides of the market place where acquisition costs, as you know, installation costs are higher.   I’d expect to continue growth in our voluntary business, where enrollment costs are higher.   
On the other hand, that benefits us directly in terms of what should be then a further downward movement in our overall employee benefit loss ratio and a growth in earnings as a result.   So I don’t think - I don’t expect the expense ratio to go down much further.   You know, I think it will bounce around that 20% kind of range.  
What I would point out is, you know, the key productivity measure for us is sort of earnings per employee within Unum U.S. and if I look back at the last several years, you know, 2007 earnings per employee was $82,000; $92,000 in ’08; $104,000 per employee in ’09; $120,000 per employee on an annualized basis in 2010.   
And so it’s not really about no loss ratio or the benefit ratio, it’s about overall earnings and how we invest our expenses and generate direct risk returns.

We had another solid quarter with operating income growth for the quarter and year-to-date remaining in line with our 2010 outlook of growth of between 4% and 6%.I would say too that we certainly benefited from our more",552,"Thank you, Tom and good morning. We had another solid quarter with operating income growth for the quarter and year-to-date remaining in line with our 2010 outlook of growth of between 4% and 6%.
I would say too that we certainly benefited from our more diverse business mix as the relatively strong performance of Unum U.S. and Colonial operations driven frankly generally by stable risk trends offset the relatively weaker performance of our Unum U.K. operation.
While the economic and competitive environment in both the U.S. and U.K. remain a challenge, by staying disciplined we have continued to generate solid profitability including strong statutory earnings, which has enabled us to continue repurchase stock while still maintaining a strong capital position.
Now, let me just touch on just a few highlights from the quarter. First, as I indicated, third quarter after-tax operating income grew 3.9%, earnings per share grew 6.5% which are both consistent with our 2010 outlook of growth between 4% and 6%.
Second, while we saw very little change in the business and economic environment this quarter and no substantive changes in the competitive environment, we are capitalizing on profitable growth opportunities as they arise.
I point especially to our voluntary benefits businesses in both Unum U.S. where their sales grew 27% in the third quarter and Colonial where our commercial sales grew 5.7% are good indications of how we’re actually capitalizing on today’s market conditions.
Don’t get me wrong. The combination of the economy and aggressive competitors make it challenging to profitably grow the business, but we feel very good about our market position.
Third, our investment portfolio remains in excellent shape with the net unrealized gain in our fixed maturities securities portfolio increasing as a result of the decline in interest rates and ongoing tightening of credits spreads to $5.7 billion this quarter. The flipside, however, is that today’s low level of interest rate and investment yield can create some challenges, but we have positioned the company to effectively manage through this environment.
Finally, with our solid financial results and strong investment performance, we continue to build on our very strong capital position. Our weighted average risk-based capital ratio is currently at 410% and holding company’s cash and marketable securities position is slightly above $1 billion, giving us continued financial flexibility in these uncertain times. We have built these strong capital levels while also purchasing $198 million of stock during the third quarter and $328 million of stock year-to-date.
In summary, I feel very good about our results so far this year. I think the diversity of our company is becoming more apparent. The relatively strong performance of Unum U.S. and Colonial Life operations offset the lower level of performance in the U.K.
As you know, we made a management change there. I’m confident that under Jack McGarry’s leadership we can more effectively operate in this difficult market environment and capitalize on the growth opportunities, which I believe exist in this market.
While we continue to face premium growth challenges in certain lines of business, we continue to benefit from our disciplined business approach which has allowed us to generate capital that can be used to repurchase stock at a very opportune time.
Now, I’ll ask Tom White to provide an overview on our operating results this quarter. Tom?

Net realized after-tax investment gains for the third quarter of 2010 include an after-tax gain of $1.1 million resulting from changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative and a modified coinsurance contract compared to an after-tax gain of $28.9 million in the third quarter of 2009.
Also included in net realized after-tax investment gains for the third quarter are net realized after-tax investment losses of $200,000 related to sales and write-downs of investments, compared to net after-tax losses of $19.4 million in the third quarter of 2009.
Excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $219.9 million for this quarter or $0.68 per diluted common share, compared to $211.6 million or $0.64 per diluted common share in the year ago quarter.
Turning to the operating segments, in total, Unum U.S. operating income increased 4% to $204.7 million in the third quarter. Within Unum U.S., the group disability line reported another solid quarter with income up 4% to $77.8 million, driven primarily by improved risk experienced on a year-over-year basis.
Within the group life and AD&D line, operating income increased 6% to $52.8 million in the third quarter, a slight improvement in premium income as well as stable risk experience helped to generate the improved earnings.
In the supplemental and voluntary line, third quarter income was up 2.8% to $74.1 million from $72.1 million a year ago. The improvement was driven by strong earnings growth from the voluntary benefits line of business.
Moving to Unum U.K., operating income in this segment decreased $19.6 million to $47.2 million. Operating income declined 15.1% in local currency. While, premium income in local currency was essentially flat in the third quarter. The benefit ratio of 66.9% was well above the unusually low benefit ratio of the year ago quarter.
You’ll recall that the third quarter of 2009 benefit ratio benefited from a reserve reduction associated with the significant reduction in the value of inflation index-linked policies.
This reduction in reserves was largely offset by a corresponding reduction in net investment income on index-linked securities. The year-over-year reduction in income reflects pressure from the economic environment on our ability to resolve claims and continued competitive pricing pressures, particularly in the group disability line.
Concluding our core operations Colonial Life had a strong quarter with premium growth of 6.2% and operating income growth of 5.8% compared to last year. The benefit ratio was 49.9% this quarter compared with the year ago benefit ratio of 48.2% been in line with our longer term expectations for this business segment.
The Individual Disability - Closed Block operating income was $9.8 million compared to $7.2 million in the year ago quarter. The interest adjusted loss ratio was higher at 85.5% this quarter compared to 81.6% in the year ago quarter, but was consistent with the second quarter of 2010. Premium income declined by 6% and net investment income was up 1% year-over-year.
Finally, the Corporate and Other segment reported an operating loss of $10.8 million compared to a loss of $13.7 million in the year ago quarter. Net investment income was higher reflecting higher levels of invested assets and higher miscellaneous net investment income while interest expense increased to $31.8 million this year compared to $24.1 million last year, reflecting the debt issuances from September of 2009 and September of 2010.
So with that review of our operating results, I’ll turn the call over to Rick McKenney for a deeper analysis of this quarter’s results.

In my comments I’d like to discuss this quarter’s key drivers which have remained relatively consistent and also cover our investment portfolio, interest rate management and our capital position.First, starting on how risk is perform",1781,"Thank you, Tom. In my comments I’d like to discuss this quarter’s key drivers which have remained relatively consistent and also cover our investment portfolio, interest rate management and our capital position.
First, starting on how risk is performing, across the company, it is generally stable with some pockets of elevated experience off of last year’s very favorable results. Focusing on Unum U.S., risk experience remained generally stable across all lines this quarter.
Our group disability results remained strong with the third quarter benefit ratio of 84.6%, lower than the year ago quarter experience of 85.3% due to more favorable claim recovery performance and flat with the benefit ratio in the second quarter.
New claim incidents for the quarter was consistent with the year ago experience, but slightly elevated relative to the second quarter. The claim incidents trends are not showing notable underlying trends or any signs of being economically influenced.
This quarter’s results also reflect our view that our group disability benefit ratio will level out this year and that longer-term opportunities for improvement can be achieved gradually as our core market exposure changes with our in-force mix of business.
I would note that given today’s challenging environment, I believe our current pre-tax margin of 15% and ROE of 12.6% for the third quarter for the group disability business line are quite strong.
Also, within Unum U.S., group life and AD&D experience remained very steady with the third quarter benefit ratio at 70.4% compared to 70.3% in the year ago quarter and second quarter as well.
Finally, the voluntary and supplemental lines showed favorable claims experience in the voluntary benefit line with third quarter benefit ratio declining to 54.6% from 59% a year ago, offset by a slightly higher benefit ratio in the individual disability recently issued lines due to higher average size of new claims.
The long-term care lines showed generally steady interest-adjusted loss ratios of 80.9% in the third quarter compared to 80.8% in the second quarter and up from 77.5% in the year ago quarter.
Moving to our Unum U.K. results, risk results were worse than last year and up slightly sequentially, with the third quarter 2010 benefits ratio at 66.9%. Weaker results have a number of drivers including lower net claim resolutions and continued competitive pricing pressures in the group disability line which is only partially offset by a slight improvement in group life experience.
The impact of inflation on the inflation index-linked group policies is generally a non-economic influence and was a significant contributor to the year ago year-over-year change in the benefit ratio, but had minimal impact on the sequential quarter results.
The competitive market conditions are negatively impacting our margins in the U.K. and we expect this drive to continue for the near term. I’ll remind you that the Unum U.K. pre-tax margin was 29% and ROE was nearly 21% this quarter, still a very healthy level of profitability.
Finally, Colonial Life risk result this quarter was somewhat unfavorable in the accident, sickness and disability line of business and drove the benefit ratio for the quarter to just under 50% compared to 48.2% in the year ago quarter. As we had mentioned before, we believe that the benefit ratio of around 50% is likely an ongoing expectation for Colonial Life, as a whole.
Turning to the premium line, the challenges continue in today’s economic and business environment. Looking at Unum U.S. first, we are not seeing any improvement in the natural growth that we have discussed with you over the past several quarters.
Our estimate is that natural growth still represents a stubborn headwind of approximately 1% today as the economy and specifically high unemployment and low wage inflation continue to pressure our top line.
The highlight we continue to see within Unum U.S. is our success in growing our voluntary benefits business. Sales in this line increased 27% to third quarter and are now up 17% year-to-date. Having a strong voluntary benefits presence is essential to our strategy as we believe our markets will move towards more employ participation and benefit plans and our team is executing very well in this area of growth.
Within Unum U.K. we are starting to see some stabilization of our premium income, however we continue to expect to see pressure over the near term as competitive market conditions persist and economic trends remain challenging in the U.K.
Our new sales were somewhat encouraging this quarter, and while they were down 3% in local currency this quarter, the comparison was very difficult given the success we had in the second half of 2009 gaining sale as competitor was exiting the market.
In addition we are continuing to see a greater portion of our sales mix from group disability relative to group life, which is more in line with the balance that we’re looking for.
Rounding now with Colonial Life result, our growth metrics remain in good shape. Third quarter sales increased by 2.3%, less than the rate of growth we experienced in the first half of the year as public sector sales were down on a year-over-year basis, but the commercial markets results remain good with third quarter sales growth of 5.7%.
Recruiting trends continue to be strong with new contracts up 14.2% this quarter and up 19.6% year-to-date. New account growth also remains encouraging up 10.2% this quarter and 17% for year-to-date.
Chattering these positive results, our average new case size is lower by 8.8% driven by the economy and the tendency for our newer agents to have their initial success in the smaller end of the market.
With positive sales and recruiting momentum along with stable persistency trends Colonial Life’s premium grew 6.2% for the third quarter. As we shifted the balance sheet our investment portfolio continues to be a highlight as we continue to see excellent results in the credit profile of our portfolio.
With the rally in the treasury markets during the third quarter, our net unrealized gain position for our fixed maturities securities portfolio improved further to a quarter-end level of $5.1 billion compared to a gain of $3.7 billion at June 30.
Net realized investment losses this quarter were insignificant. Importantly, our internal watchlist of potential credit problems in the investment portfolio continues to decline to deploy where in aggregate they sit in an unrealized loss position of less than $5 million.
As happy as we are about the strong credit profile the downside of low interest rates and tight corporate bond spreads is obviously the challenge it creates for new money investment opportunities.
As we have discussed it in the past the key focus for our business in this environment is relationship between the portfolio yields back in various product lines and the aggregate discount rates embedded in the reserves.
For the third quarter, our portfolio yields held up very well with our aggregate portfolio yield of 6.73%, down only 3 basis points from the second quarter of 2010 and down only 1 basis point from 12/31/2009 yields.
Our individual product line portfolio shows similar results. And although no insurer enjoyed this environment, we believe we are relatively well positioned for ongoing lower interest rates for a few key reasons.
Number one, we have a relatively small amount of new cash to invest in our product lines relative to the size of our existing investment portfolios, which allows our investment team to be very choosy in the assets we take from a relative value perspective.
Two, we have maintained the conservative discount rate assumptions while our new money investment opportunities benefited from the wide investment spreads of 2008 and early 2009.
Three, we’re still putting our new claim reserves each quarter at discount rates lower than the aggregate rate, which will continue to lower aggregate discount rate just as lower new money yields will lower the overall portfolio yield. And lastly, we have the ability to reprise many of our product lines which allows us to price for lower interest rates over time.
So to sum up, while today’s lower interest rates are a challenge, I believe we’re well positioned to tolerate this environment.
So with solid financial and investment results book value per share continues to grow. The company’s book value per share was $28.08 at September 30, 2010, an increase of 13% relative to a year ago. Looking at our capital, our statutory earnings continued to be quite healthy which drives a very sound capital position for the company.
Net income on a statutory basis for our traditional U.S. life insurance subsidiaries in the third quarter was $148 million, in line with a roughly $150 million we’ve been generating.
This healthy level of earnings resulting growth in our capital base at our insurance subsidiaries and improvement in our RBC ratio to approximately 410%, which is above the range we have set out for ourselves. Holding company cash and marketable securities remained at a very strong level totaling $1.03 billion at quarter end.
During the third quarter, we issued $400 million of 10-year senior notes, primarily to fund the payment of a debt maturity of $225 million in the first quarter of 2011.
In addition, we have recently used $100 million of the proceeds for an additional pension contribution which occurred in October after the close of the third quarter and this is an acceleration of the pension plan contribution we expected to make in 2011.
With the $400 million debt issuance, our leverage ratio is now 23.3%; however, this will decline by approximately 200 basis points as we pay up the debt maturing in the first quarter next year.
We also continue to return capital to shareholders by buying back our shares, repurchasing 9.5 million shares in the third quarter. We have been opportunistic in buying back shares when the price has been below, with this quarter’s repurchases done at an average share price of $20.91. We have approximately $173 million remaining of the $500 million authorized by our Board in May.
I’ll close with the comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2010. Our outlook a year ago coming into 2010 which for operating income growth within a range of 4% to 6%.
e believe that the lower end of this range is more likely for operating earnings growth for the full year 2010 with continued challenging results expected from our U.K. operations in the near term. However, given our share repurchases, we anticipate operating earnings per share towards the higher end of that target range. We will discuss this as well as our outlook for 2011 at our investor meeting on November 17.
Now, I will turn it back to Tom for his closing comments.

The other thing too as we certainly didn’t see any acquisitions that I think that continue to help support those higher levels of margin. What we certainly didn’t expect was the really venomous level of competitive dynamics that Jack can talk to in that market, nor we expect the economy obviously to soften to the extent it did. But I think just to set the stage, to why I thought a change was necessary. It certainly wasn’t about a quarter, it wasn’t about feeling concerned about our business and prices, and it was more about just concerned about the speed by which we are addressing the short-term issues which are really more competitive market conditions and economic issues.
But then the other part there is also the speed by which we’re positioning ourselves to benefit, when I think there is tremendous set of growth opportunities there. So, that’s really was behind the change. You are right, Jack has got a tremendous track record in things that he has done. We have a lot of confidence in that business. It’s still our highest ROE business, as Rick said in his comment. I think Jack has been there since was the middle of July, and I think Jack you’ve had a chance to get some pretty good observations on things, and they just turn to you just to share some of those insights.

Darin, I think the things we are focusing on really two fold. The first is improving our operations. The U.K. is now finding itself operating in a competitive environment that’s more similar to the environment that the U.S. is operated in over the last several years.
Fortunately, the margins are higher in the U.K., but a lot of the things that you need to do to succeed in the U.K. as similar to the things we did in the U.S. those would be focusing on pricing and underwriting discipline, make sure we’re controlling the rates we’re quoting, having milestone sign-offs, increasing the focus of underwriting and sales on profitability and implementing some of the comprehensive renewal programs that we had in the U.S., here within the U.K. in order to improve margins.
We’re also going to bring across a lot of the claims management processes that we’ve developed over the last couple of years within the U.S. and implement those in the U.K. I note that it’s a well worn path that we’re implementing; it’s something we’ve done before in the U.S.; it’s something that I personally was involved in both within underwriting and the claims process and we believe that by bringing those best practices over here we will be able to buck against the competitive headwinds we’re facing, continue to get strong margins and continue to improve results.
The second piece of that though beyond kind of shoring up the business with operational and financial controls relates to really tapping into the untapped market over here. In the U.K. only one out of 10 employees in the private sector are currently covered for a group income protection, that’s probably 70% to 80% in the U.S., Canada and several other developed countries. So we want to take a good run at expanding that coverage. We think that’s a huge growth opportunity within the U.K. The time is right both in terms of what’s happening in the government as well as in employee benefits and we hope to capitalize on that.

I think there is recognition in the U.K that’s it’s been a very soft market and that it’s not in the best interest of carriers, intermediaries or anyone to continue in that direction. So, we are the market leader in the U.K. If prices are going to happen in the U.K, we need to participate in that. So, that will be a part of pricing discipline with an attempt to make sure we shore up margin, make sure they don’t continue to erode and face pressure for the economy, but do it in a strategic and really targeted way so that we minimize the impact on our in-force block where we’re improving margins.
From a claims management perspective, there is a big difference between claims management practices within the U.K and what we had done within the U.S. My read on that one is kind of a why won’t you do it? We have solid practices; we know how to implement it. We are confident that it can improve results. It’s a better process both from everyone’s perspective, both internally with regulators and with claimants and employers. So, it just makes sense to implement that.
We do believe, our margin in claims management relative to competitors is not as wide as it’s been in the past by implementing these practices, we think we can begin to spread that out a little bit and give us more opportunity to grow the market and invest in it.

So, there is excess there. In this environment we probably would still look to around two times coverage, as a holding company, which is quite conservative but probably a good benchmark. One times coverage is roughly $250 million. So, there is excess there. But think it is very much as a capital run rate generation that we’ve seen over multiple quarters and returning that capital to shareholders.

I think the most important thing as we look at those opportunities, one we have the capital to transact that we just talked about, but they have to have the right fit. We have to be getting something more. We’ll do a financial transaction, but it will be with a very high hurdle, but we have to be getting something out of the deal as well.

As we track pricing levels using some outside research support, industry pricing levels continue to slide downward. They haven’t flattened and they certainly haven’t turned in the other direction. We are entering the 2011 renewal season. We would have expected maybe based on some comments we heard in the marketplace that renewals might be easy to place but we haven’t seen that so far. We see competition on business that we’re putting out to renew just as aggressive or maybe even more aggressive than it’s been in the past couple of years.

When you look to the U.K., I think those earnings there will come down a little bit commensurately with what you’re seeing there on the GAAP side, so they will be a little bit lower earnings run rate that we see in the U.K. but nothing that we are overly concerned about. So, if I take you back to slide we were showing at our Investor Day last year, the overall capital generation in the company still is very good and we expect that to continue.

We had another solid quarter, with operating income growth for the quarter and year-to-date remaining in line with our 2010 outlook of growth of between 4% and 6%. I would say too that we certainly benefited from our most",555,"Thank you, Tom and good morning. We had another solid quarter, with operating income growth for the quarter and year-to-date remaining in line with our 2010 outlook of growth of between 4% and 6%. I would say too that we certainly benefited from our most diverse mix, as the relatively strong performance of Unum U.S. and Colonial operations, driven frankly generally by stable risks trends offset the relatively weaker performance of our Unum U.K. operation. While the economic and competitive environment both in the U.S. and U.K. remain a challenge, by staying disciplined, we have continued to generate solid profitability, including strong statutory earnings, which has enabled us to continue to repurchase stock while still retaining strong capital position. 
Now, let me just touch on a few highlights in the quarter. First, as I indicated, third quarter aftertax operating income grew 3.9%, and earnings per share grew 6.5%, which are both consistent with our 2010 outlook of growth between 4% to 6%. Second, while we saw very little change in the business and economic environment this quarter, and no substantive change in the competitive environment, we are capitalizing on profitable growth opportunities as they arise. I pointed especially to our Voluntary Benefits businesses in both the Unum U.S., where sales grew 27% in the third quarter, and Colonial, where our commercial sales grew 5.7% as good indications of how we're actually capitalizing on today's market condition. Don't get me wrong. The combination of the economy and aggressive competitors make it challenging to profitably grow the business but we feel very good about our market position. 
Third, our investment portfolio remains in excellent shape, with a net unrealized gain in our fixed maturity securities portfolio increasing as a result of the decline in interest rates and ongoing tightening of credit spreads to $5.7 billion this quarter. The flip side however, is that today's low level of interest rates and investment yields can create some challenges but we have positioned the company to effectively manage through this environment. And finally, with our solid financial results and strong investment performance, we continue to build on our very strong capital position. Our weighted average risk-based capital ratio is currently at 410% and our holding company's cash and marketable securities position is slightly over $1 million, giving us continued financial flexibility in these uncertain times. We have built these strong capital levels while also purchasing $198 million of stock during the third quarter and $328 million of stock year-to-date. 
In summary, I feel very good about our results so far this year. I think the diversity of our company is becoming more apparent. The relatively strong performance of Unum U.S. and Colonial Life operations offset the lower level of performance in the U.K. As you know, we've made a management change there and I'm confident that under John McGarry's leadership, we can more effectively operate in this difficult market environment and capitalize on the growth opportunities which I believe exist in this market. While we continue to face premium growth challenges in certain lines of business, we continue to benefit from our disciplined business approach, which has allowed us to generate capital that can be used to repurchase stock at a very opportune time. Now, I'll ask Tom White to provide an overview on our operating results this quarter. Tom?"

Net realized after-tax investment gains for the third quarter of 2010 include an after-tax gain of $1.1 million resulting from changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative and a modified coinsurance contract compared to an after-tax gain of $28.9 million in the third quarter of 2009. Also included in net realized after-tax investment gains for the third quarter are net realized after-tax investment losses of $200,000 related to sales and write-downs of investments compared to net after-tax losses of $19.4 million in the third quarter of 2009. Excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $219.9 million for this quarter or $0.68 per diluted common share compared to $211.6 million or $0.64 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter. 
Turning to the operating segments, in total, Unum U.S. operating income increased 4% to $204.7 million in the third quarter. Within Unum U.S., the Group Disability line reported another solid quarter, with income of 4% to $77.8 million, driven primarily by improved risk experience on a year-over-year basis. Within the group lines and AD&D line, operating income increased 6% to $52.8 million in the third quarter. A slight improvement in premium income, as well as stable risk experience helped to generate improved earnings. 
In the Supplemental and Voluntary line, third quarter income was up 2.8% to $74.1 million from $72.1 million a year ago. The improvement was driven by strong earnings growth from the Voluntary Benefits line of business. 
Moving to Unum U.K., operating income in this segment decreased $19.6 million to $47.2 million. Operating income declined 15.1% in local currency. While premium income in local currency was essentially flat in the third quarter, the benefit ratio of 66.9% was well above the unusually low benefit ratio of the year-ago quarter. You'll recall that the third quarter of 2009 benefit ratio benefited from a reserve reduction associated with a significant reduction in the value of inflation index linked policies. This reduction in reserves was largely offset by a corresponding reduction in net investment income on index link securities. The year-over-year reduction in income reflects pressure from the economic environment on our ability to resolve claims and continued competitive pricing pressures, particularly in the Group Disability line. 
Concluding our core operations, Colonial Life had a strong quarter, with premium growth of 6.2% and operating income growth of 5.8% compared to last year. The benefit ratio was 49.9% this quarter compared with the year ago benefit ratio of 48.2%, still in line with our longer-term expectations for this business segment. 
The Individual Disability Closed Block operating income was $9.8 million compared to $7.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The interest adjusted loss ratio was higher at 85.5% this quarter compared to 81.6% in the year-ago quarter but was consistent with the second quarter of 2010. Premium income declined by 6% and net investment income was up 1% year-over-year. And finally, the corporate and other segment reported an operating loss of $10.8 million compared to a loss of $13.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Net investment income was higher, reflecting higher levels of invested assets and higher miscellaneous net investment income, while interest expense increased to $31.8 million this year compared to $24.1 million last year, reflecting the debt issuances from September of 2009 and September of 2010. So with that review of our operating results, I'll turn the call over to Rick McKenney for a deeper analysis of this quarter's results."

First, starting on how risk is performin",1779,"Thank you, Tom. In my comments, I'd like to discuss this quarter's key drivers, which have remained relatively consistent, and also cover our investment portfolio, interest rate management and our capital position. First, starting on how risk is performing, across the company, it is generally stable, with some pockets of elevated experience off of last year's very favorable results. Focusing on Unum U.S., risk experience remained generally stable across all lines this quarter. Our Group Disability results remain strong, with a third quarter benefit ratio of 84.6%, lower than the year-ago quarter experience of 85.3% due to more favorable claim recovery performance and flat with the benefit ratio in the second quarter. New claim incidents for the quarter was consistent with the year ago experience but slightly elevated relative to the second quarter. The claim incidents trends are not showing notable underlying trends or any signs of being economically influenced. This quarter's results also reflect our view that our Group Disability benefit ratio will level out this year and have longer-term opportunities for improvement can be achieved gradually as our core market exposure changes with our in force mix of business. I would note that given today's challenging environment, I believe our current pretax margin of 15% and ROE of 12.6% for the third quarter for the Group Disability business lines are quite strong. Also within Unum U.S., Group Life and AD&D experience remain very steady, with the third quarter benefit ratio at 70.4% compared to 70.3% in the year-ago quarter and second quarter as well. Finally, the voluntary and supplemental lines showed favorable claims experience in the Voluntary Benefits line, with third quarter benefit ratio declining to 54.6% from 59% a year ago, offset by a slightly higher benefit ratio in the Individual Disability recently issued line due to higher average size of new claims. The long-term care line showed generally steady interest adjusted loss ratios of 80.9% in the third quarter compared to 80.8% in the second quarter and up from 77.5% in the year-ago quarter. Moving to our Unum U.K. results, risk results are worse than last year and up slightly sequentially, with the third quarter 2010 benefit ratio at 66.9%. Weaker results have a number of drivers, including lower net claim resolutions and continued competitive pricing pressures in the Group Disability line, which is only partially offset by a slight improvement in Group Life experience. The impact of inflation on the inflation-index linked group policies is generally a non-economic influence and was a significant contributor to the year ago year-over-year change in the benefit ratio but had minimal impact of a sequential quarter results. The competitive market conditions are negatively impacting our margins in the U.K. and we expect this drag to continue for the near term. I'll remind you that the Unum U.K. pretax margin was 29% and ROE was nearly 21% this quarter, still a very healthy level of profitability. And finally, Colonial Life's risk results this quarter were somewhat unfavorable in the accidents, sickness and disability line of business, and drove the benefit ratio for the quarter to just under 50% compared to 48.2% in the year-ago quarter. As we had mentioned before, we believe that the benefit ratio of around 50% is likely an ongoing expectation for Colonial Life as a whole. 
Turning to the premium line, the challenges continue in today's economic and business environment. Looking at Unum U.S. first, we are not seeing any improvement in the natural growth that we have discussed with you over the past several quarters. Our estimate is that natural growth still represents a stubborn habit of approximately 1% today as the economy and specifically, high unemployement and low wage inflation continue to pressure our top line. The highlight we continue to see within Unum U.S. is our success in growing our voluntary benefits business. Sales in this line increased 27% in the third quarter and are now up 17% year-to-date. Having a strong Voluntary Benefits presence is essential to our strategy as we believe our markets will move towards more employee participation in benefit plans and our team is executing very well in this area of growth. 
Within Unum U.K., we are starting to see some stabilization of our premium income. However, we continue to expect to see pressure over the near-term as competitive market conditions persist and economic trends remain challenging in the U.K. Our new sales were somewhat encouraging this quarter. And while they were down 3% in local currency this quarter, the comparison was very difficult given the success we had in the second half of 2009, getting sales as competitive exiting the market. In addition, we are continuing to see a greater portion of sales mix from Group Disability relative to Group Life, which is more in line with the balance that we're looking for. And rounding it out with Colonial Life results, our growth metrics remain in good shape. Third quarter sales increased by 2.3%, less than the rate of growth we experienced in the first half of the year as public sector sales were down on a year-over-year basis, but the Commercial Markets results remained good, with third quarter sales growth of 5.7%. Recruiting trends continue to be strong, with new contracts up 14.2% this quarter and up 19.6% year-to-date. New account growth also remains encouraging, up 10.2% this quarter and 17% for year-to-date. Countering these positive results, our average new case size is lower by 8.8%, driven by the economy and a tendency for our newer agents to have their initial success in the smaller end of the market. With positive sales and recruiting momentum, along with stable persistency trends, Colonial Life's premiums grew 6.2% for the third quarter. 
As you shift to the balance sheet, our investment portfolio continues to be a highlight as we continue to see excellent results in the credit profile of our portfolio. With the rally in the treasury markets during the third quarter, our net unrealized gain position for our fixed maturity securities portfolio, improve further to a quarter end level of $5.1 billion compared to a gain of $3.7 billion at June 30. Net realized investment losses this quarter were insignificant. Importantly, our internal watch list of potential credit  problems in the investment portfolio continues to decline to the point where in aggregate, they sit in an unrealized loss position of less than $5 million. As happy as we are about the strong credit profile, the downside of low interest rates and tightening corporate bond spreads is obviously the challenge equates for new money investment opportunities. And as we had discussed with you in the past, the key focus for our business in this environment is relationship between the portfolio yields, various product lines and the aggregate discount rates embedded in the reserves. For the third quarter, our portfolio of yields held up very well, with our aggregate portfolio of 6.73%, down only 3 basis points from the second quarter of 2010 and down only one basis point from 12/31, 2009 yields. Our individual product line portfolio showed similar results. And although no one sure enjoys this environment, we believe we are relatively well positioned for ongoing low interest rates for a few key reasons. Number one, we have a relatively slow amount of cash to invest in our product lines relative to the size of our existing investment portfolios, which allows our investment team to be very choosy in the assets we take from a relative value perspective. Two, we have maintained a conservative discount rate assumptions while our new money investment opportunities benefited from the wide investment spreads of 2008 in early 2009. Three, we're still putting on nuclear claim reserves each quarter at discount rates lower than the aggregate rate, which will continually lower aggregate discount rate just as lower new money yields will lower the overall portfolio of yield. And lastly, we have the ability to reprice many of our product lines, which allowed us to price for lower interest rates overtime. 
So to sum up, while today's low interest rates are a challenge, I believe we're well-positioned to tolerate this environment. So with solid financial and investment results, book value per share continues to grow. The company's book value per share was $28.08 at September 30, 2010, an increase of 13% relative to a year ago. And looking at our capital, our statutory earnings continue to be quite healthy, which drives a very sound capital position for the company. Net income on a statutory basis for our traditional U.S. life insurance subsidiaries in the third quarter was $148 million, and then with the roughly $150 million we've been generating. This healthy level of earnings resulted in growth in our capital base and insurance subsidiaries and improvement in our RBC ratio to approximately 410%, which is above the range we had set out for ourselves. Holding company cash and marketable securities remains at a very strong level totaling $1.03 billion at quarter end. During the third quarter, we issued $400 million of 10-year senior notes, primarily to fund the payment of a debt maturity of $225 million in the third quarter of 2011. In addition, we have recently used $100 million of the proceeds for an additional pension contribution which occurred in October after the close of the third quarter, and as an acceleration of the pension plan contribution we expected to make in 2011. With the $400 million debt issuance, our leverage ratio is now 23.3%. However, this will decline by approximately 200 basis points as we pay off the debt maturing in the first quarter next year. We also continue to return capital to shareholders by buying back our shares, repurchasing 9.5 million shares in the third quarter. We have been opportunistic in buying back shares when price has been low but this quarter's repurchase was done at an average share price of $20.91. We have approximately $173 million remaining of the $500 million authorized by our board in May. And I'll close with a comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2010. Our outlook a year ago, coming into 2010, was for operating income growth within a range of 4% to 6%. We believe that the lower end of this range is more likely for operating earnings growth in full year 2010, with continued challenges result expected from our U.K. operation near term. However, given our share repurchases, we anticipate operating earnings per share towards the higher end of that target range. We will discuss these, as well as our outlook for 2011, at our investor meeting on November 17. I'll now turn it back to Tom for his closing comments."

But I think as you and others know, over the last couple of years talking U.K. business. We've talking about the fact that the generous margins that we've been fortunate to be able to experience are probably not sustainable just because they're going to invite competition and as competition comes in, we expect our margins to certainly come down.

And while we certainly didn't expect was the really venomous level of competitive dynamics that Jack can talk to in that market, nor did we expect the economy to the extent it did. But I think just to set the stage, I thought a change was necessary. It certainly wasn't about the quarter. it wasn't about concerned a business and prices. It was more about just concerned about the speed they which we are addressing the short term issues, which are really more competitive market conditions and economic issues. But then the other part is also the speed by which we are positioning ourselves to benefit from what I think is a tremendous other growth opportunities there.

Darren, I think the things we're focusing on are really 2-fold. The first is improving our operations. The U.K. is now finding itself operating in a competitive environment that's more similar to the environment that the U.S. is operating in over the last several years. Fortunately, the margins are higher in the U.K. But a lot of the things that you need to do to succeed in the U.K. are similar to the things we did in the U.S. Those would be focusing on pricing and underwriting discipline, make sure we're controlling the rates we're quoting, having milestone sign-offs, increasing the focus of underwriting in sales and profitability, and implementing some of the comprehensive renewal programs that we have in the U.S. here within the U.K. in order to improve margins. We're also  going to bring across a lot of the claims management processes that we've developed over the last couple of years within the U.S. and implement those in the U.K. I'd note that it's a well-worn path that we're implementing. It's something we've done before in the U.S. It's something that I personally was involved in both within underwriting in the claims process. And where we believe that by bringing those best practices over here, we will be able to buck against the competitive headwinds we're facing, continue to get strong margins and continue to improve results. The second piece of that is beyond kind of shoring up the business with operational and financial controls relates to really tapping into the untapped market over here. In the U.K., only one out of 10 employees in the private sector are currently covered for a group income protection. That's probably 70% to 80% in the U.S., Canada and several other developed countries. And so we want to take a good run at expanding that coverage.

I think there's recognition in the U.K. that it's been a very soft market and that it's not in the best interest of carriers, intermediaries or anyone to continue in that direction. And so we are the market leader in the U.K. If prices are going to harden in the U.K., we need to participate in that. And so that will be a part of pricing discipline with an attempt to make sure we shore up margins, make sure they don't continue to erode and face pressure from the economy. But doing it in a strategic and really targeted way so that we minimize the impact on our enforced block where we're improving margins. From a claims management perspective, there's a big difference between claims management practices within the U.K. and what we had done within the U.S. My read on that one is kind of why wouldn't you do it? I mean, we have solid practices, we know how to implement it, we're confident that it can improve results. It's a better process both from everyone's perspective, both internally with regulators and with claimants and employers. And so it just makes sense to implement that, and we do believe that our margin in Claims Management relative to competitors is not as wide as it's been in the past. By implementing these practices, we think we can begin to spread that out a little bit and give us more opportunity to grow the market and invest in it."

We had another solid quarter, with operating income growth for the quarter and year-to-date remaining in line with our 2010 outlook of growth of between 4% and 6%. I would say, too, that we certainly benefited from our most diverse business mix as the relatively strong performance of Unum US and Colonial operations, driven frankly generally by stable risks trends, offset the relatively weaker performance of our Unum UK operation. 
While the economic and competitive environment in both the U.S. and U.K. remain a challenge, by staying disciplined, we have continued to generate solid profitability, including strong statutory earnings, which has enabled us to continue to repurchase stock while still maintaining a strong capital position.
Now, let me just touch on just a few highlights in the quarter. First, as I indicated, third quarter after tax operating income grew 3.9%, and earnings per share grew 6.5%, which are both consistent with our 2010 outlook of growth between 4% to 6%. 
Second, while we saw very little change in the business and economic environment this quarter and no substantive changes in the competitive environment, we are capitalizing on profitable growth opportunities as they arise. I point especially to our voluntary benefits businesses in both the Unum US, where our sales grew 27% in the third quarter; and Colonial, where our commercial sales grew 5.7% as good indications of how we're actually capitalizing on today's market conditions. Don't get me wrong. The combination of the economy and aggressive competitors make it challenging to profitably grow the business, but we feel very good about our market position.
Third, our investment portfolio remains in excellent shape, with a net unrealized gain in our fixed maturity securities portfolio increasing as a result of the decline in interest rates and ongoing tightening of credit spreads to $5.7 billion this quarter. The flip side however, is that today's low level of interest rates and investment yields can create some challenges, but we have positioned the company to effectively manage through this environment. 
And finally, with our solid financial results and strong investment performance, we continue to build on our very strong capital position. Our weighted average risk-based capital ratio is currently at 410%, and our holding company's cash and marketable securities position is slightly above $1 billion, giving us continued financial flexibility in these uncertain times. We have built these strong capital levels while also purchasing $198 million of stock during the third quarter and $328 million of stock year-to-date.
In summary, I feel very good about our results so far this year. I think the diversity of our company is becoming more apparent. The relatively strong performance of Unum US and Colonial Life operations offset the lower level of performance in the UK. As you know, we've made a management change there, and I'm confident that under Jack McGarry's leadership, we can continue to -- we can more effectively operate in this difficult market environment and capitalize on the growth opportunities which I believe exists in this market. 
While we continue to face premium growth challenges in certain lines of business, we continue to benefit from our disciplined business approach, which has allowed us to generate capital that can be used to repurchase stock at a very opportune time. 
Now, I'll ask Tom White to provide an overview on our operating results this quarter. Tom?"

Net realized after-tax investment gains for the third quarter of 2010 include an after-tax gain of $1.1 million resulting from changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative and a modified coinsurance contract compared to an after-tax gain of $28.9 million in the third quarter of 2009. Also included in net realized after-tax investment gains for the third quarter are net realized after-tax investment losses of $200,000 related to sales and write-downs of investments compared to net after-tax losses of $19.4 million in the third quarter of 2009. Excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $219.9 million for this quarter, or $0.68 per diluted common share, compared to $211.6 million, or $0.64 per diluted common share, in the year-ago quarter.
Turning to the operating segments. In total, Unum US operating income increased 4% to $204.7 million in the third quarter. Within Unum US, the group disability line reported another solid quarter, with income of 4% to $77.8 million, driven primarily by improved risk experience on a year-over-year basis. Within the group lines and AD&D line, operating income increased 6% to $52.8 million in the third quarter. A slight improvement in premium income as well as stable risk experience helped to generate the improved earnings.
In the supplemental and voluntary line, third quarter income was up 2.8% to $74.1 million from $72.1 million a year ago. The improvement was driven by strong earnings growth from the voluntary benefits line of business. 
Moving to Unum UK, operating income in this segment decreased $19.6 million to $47.2 million. Operating income declined 15.1% in local currency. While premium income in local currency was essentially flat in the third quarter, the benefit ratio of 66.9% was well above the unusually low benefit ratio of the year-ago quarter. You'll recall that the third quarter of 2009 benefit ratio benefited from a reserve reduction associated with a significant reduction in the value of inflation index-linked policies. This reduction in reserves was largely offset by a corresponding reduction in net investment income on index-linked securities. The year-over-year reduction in income reflects pressure from the economic environment on our ability to resolve claims and continued competitive pricing pressures, particularly in the Group Disability lines.
Concluding our core operations, Colonial Life had a strong quarter, with premium growth of 6.2% and operating income growth of 5.8% compared to last year. The benefit ratio was 49.9% this quarter compared with the year-ago benefit ratio of 48.2%, but in line with our longer-term expectations for this business segment.
The Individual Disability — Closed Block operating income was $9.8 million compared to $7.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The interest adjusted loss ratio was higher at 85.5% this quarter compared to 81.6% in the year-ago quarter but was consistent with the second quarter of 2010.  Premium income declined by 6%, and net investment income was up 1% year-over-year. 
And finally, the Corporate and Other segment reported an operating loss of $10.8 million compared to a loss of $13.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Net investment income was higher, reflecting higher levels of invested assets and higher miscellaneous net investment income, while interest expense increased to $31.8 million this year compared to $24.1 million last year, reflecting the debt issuances from September of 2009 and September of 2010. So with that review of our operating results, I'll turn the call over to Rick McKenney for a deeper analysis of this quarter's results."

First, starting on how risk is performin",1791,"Thank you, Tom. In my comments, I'd like to discuss this quarter's key drivers, which have remained relatively consistent, and also cover our investment portfolio, interest rate management and our capital position. First, starting on how risk is performing, across the company, it is generally stable, with some pockets of elevated experience off of last year's very favorable results. 
Focusing on Unum US, risk experience remained generally stable across all lines this quarter. Our group disability results remain strong with a third quarter benefit ratio of 84.6%, lower than the year-ago quarter experience of 85.3%, due to a more favorable claim recovery performance and flat with the benefit ratio in the second quarter. New claim incidents for the quarter was consistent with the year-ago experience but slightly elevated relative to the second quarter. The claim incidents trends are not showing notable underlying trends or any signs of being economically influenced. 
This quarter's results also reflect our view that our group disability benefit ratio will level out this year and that longer-term opportunities for improvement can be achieved gradually as our core market exposure changes with our inforce mix of business. I would note that given today's challenging environment, I believe our current pretax margin of 15% and ROE of 12.6% for the third quarter for the group disability business line are quite strong. 
Also, within Unum US, group life and AD&D experience remained very steady, with the third quarter benefit ratio at 70.4% compared to 70.3% in the year-ago quarter and second quarter as well. Finally, the voluntary and supplemental lines showed favorable claims experience in the voluntary benefit line, with third quarter benefit ratio declining to 54.6% from 59% a year ago, offset by a slightly higher benefit ratio in the Individual Disability recently issued line due to higher average size of new claims. The long term care line showed generally steady interest adjusted loss ratios of 80.9% in the third quarter compared to 80.8% in the second quarter, and up from 77.5% in the year-ago quarter. 
Moving to our Unum UK results, risk results were worse than last year and up slightly sequentially, with the third quarter 2010 benefit ratio at 66.9%. Weaker results have a number of drivers, including lower net claim resolutions and continued competitive pricing pressures in the group disability line, which is only partially offset by a slight improvement in group life experience. The impact of inflation on the inflation index-linked group policies is generally a non-economic influence and was a significant contributor to the year-ago year-over-year change in the benefit ratio but had minimal impact on the sequential quarter results. 
The competitive market conditions are negatively impacting our margins in the U.K., and we expect this drag to continue for the near term. I'll remind you that the Unum UK pretax margin was 29%, and ROE was nearly 21% this quarter, still a very healthy level of profitability. 
And finally, Colonial Life's risk results this quarter was somewhat unfavorable in the accidents, sickness and disability line of business and drove the benefit ratio for the quarter to just under 50% compared to 48.2% in the year-ago quarter. As we have mentioned before, we believe that the benefit ratio of around 50% is likely an ongoing expectation for Colonial Life as a whole.
Turning to the premium line, the challenges continue in today's economic and business environment. Looking at Unum US first, we are not seeing any improvement in the natural growth that we have discussed with you over the past several quarters. Our estimate is that natural growth still represents a stubborn headwind of approximately 1% today, as the economy and, specifically, high unemployment and low wage inflation continue to pressure our top line. 
The highlight we continue to see within Unum US is our success in growing our voluntary benefits business. Sales in this line increased 27% in the third quarter and are now up 17% year-to-date. Having a strong voluntary benefits presence is essential to our strategy, as we believe our markets will move towards more employee participation in benefit plans, and our team is executing very well in this area of growth.
Within Unum UK, we are starting to see some stabilization of our premium income. However, we continue to expect to see pressure over the near-term as competitive market conditions persist and economic trends remain challenging in the U.K. Our new sales were somewhat encouraging this quarter. And while they were down 3% in local currency this quarter, the comparison was very difficult given the success we had in the second half of 2009, gaining sales as a competitor was exiting the market. In addition, we are continuing to see a greater portion of our sales mix from group disability relative to group life, which is more in line with the balance that we're looking for. 
And rounding it out with Colonial Life results, our growth metrics remain in good shape. Third quarter sales increased by 2.3%, less than the rate of growth we experienced in the first half of the year as public sector sales were down on a year-over-year basis, but the commercial markets' results remained good, with third quarter sales growth of 5.7%. Recruiting trends continue to be strong, with new contracts up 14.2% this quarter and up 19.6% year-to-date. 
New account growth also remains encouraging, up 10.2% this quarter and 17% for year-to-date. Countering these positive results, our average new case size is lower by 8.8%, driven by the economy and a tendency for our newer agents to have their initial success in the smaller end of the market. With positive sales and recruiting momentum, along with stable persistency trends, Colonial Life's premium grew 6.2% for the third quarter. 
As you shift to the balance sheet, our investment portfolio continues to be a highlight as we continue to see excellent results in the credit profile of our portfolio. With a rally in the treasury markets during the third quarter, our net unrealized gain position for our fixed maturity securities portfolio improved further to a quarter end level of $5.1 billion compared to a gain of $3.7 billion at June 30. Net realized investment losses this quarter were insignificant. Importantly, our internal watchlist of potential credit problems in the investment portfolio continues to decline to the point where, in aggregate, they sit in an unrealized loss position of less than $5 million. 
As happy as we are about the strong credit profile, the downside of low interest rates and tiny corporate bond spreads, is obviously the challenge it creates for new money investment opportunities. As we have discussed with you in the past, the key focus for our business in this environment is the relationship between the portfolio yields backing our various product lines and the aggregate discount rates embedded in the reserves. For the third quarter, our portfolio yields held up very well with our aggregate portfolio yield of 6.73%, down only 3 basis points from the second quarter of 2010 and down only 1 basis point from 12/31/2009 yields. Our individual product line portfolio showed similar results.
And although no insurer enjoys this environment, we believe we are relatively well positioned for ongoing low interest rates for a few key reasons. Number one, we have a relatively small amount of new cash to invest in our product lines relative to the size of our existing investment portfolios, which allows our investment team to be very choosy in the assets we take from a relative-value perspective. Two, we have maintained a conservative discount rate assumptions, while our new money investment opportunities benefited from the wide investment spreads of 2008 and early 2009. Three, we're still putting on new claim reserves each quarter at discount rates lower than the aggregate rate, which will continually lower our aggregate discount rate, just as lower new money yields will lower the overall portfolio yield. And lastly, we have the ability to reprice many of our product lines, which allows us to price for lower interest rates overtime.
So to sum up, while today's low interest rates are a challenge, I believe we are well positioned to tolerate this environment. So with solid financial and investment results, book value per share continues to grow. The company's book value per share was $28.08 at September 30, 2010, an increase of 13% relative to a year ago. And looking at our capital, our statutory earnings continue to be quite healthy, which drives a very sound capital position for the company. Net income on a statutory basis for our traditional U.S. life insurance subsidiaries in the third quarter was $148 million, in line with the roughly $150 million we've been generating. This healthy level of earnings resulted in growth in our capital base at our insurance subsidiaries and improvement in our RBC ratio to approximately 410%, which is above the range we have set out for ourselves. 
Holding company cash and marketable securities remains at a very strong level, totaling $1.03 billion at quarter end. During the third quarter, we issued $400 million of 10-year senior notes, primarily to fund the payment of a debt maturity of $225 million in the first quarter of 2011. In addition, we have recently used $100 million of the proceeds for an additional pension contribution, which occurred in October after the close of the third quarter, and it is an acceleration of the pension plan contribution we expected to make in 2011. 
With the $400 million debt issuance, our leverage ratio is now 23.3%. However, this will decline by approximately 200 basis points as we pay off the debt maturing in the first quarter next year. We also continue to return capital to shareholders by buying back our shares, repurchasing 9.5 million shares in the third quarter. We have been opportunistic in buying back shares when the price has been low, but this quarter's repurchase is done at an average share price of $20.91. We have approximately $173 million remaining of the $500 million authorized by our board in May. 
And I'll close with a comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2010. Our outlook a year ago, coming into 2010, was for operating income growth within a range of 4% to 6%. We believe that the lower end of this range is more likely for operating earnings growth for the full year 2010, with continued challenges result -- continued challenging results expected from our U.K. operation near term. However, given our share repurchase, we anticipate operating earnings per share towards the higher end of that target range. We will discuss this, as well as our outlook for 2011, at our investor meeting on November 17. I'll now turn it back to Tom for his closing comments."

And as competition comes in, we expected our margins to certainly come down. The other thing, too, is we certainly didn't see any acquisitions that I think that could continue to help support those higher levels of margins. And what we certainly didn't expect was the really venomous level of competitive dynamics that Jack can talk to in that market, nor did we expect the economy obviously to soften to the extent it did. But I think just to set the stage for why I thought a change was necessary, it certainly wasn't about a quarter, it wasn't about a feeling or concerned about our business and prices, it was more about just concerned about the speed by which we are addressing the short-term issues, which are really more competitive market conditions and economic issues. But then the other part is also the speed by which we are positioning ourselves to benefit from what I think is a tremendous set of growth opportunities there. So that's really what's behind the change. You're right, Jack's got a tremendous track record from the things that he's done. We have a lot of confidence in that business. It's still our highest ROE business as Rick said in his comments. And I think, as you know, Jack has been there since really the middle of July. And I think, Jack, you've had a chance to get some pretty good observations on things, and maybe I'll just turn it to you just to share some of those insights."

Darin, I think the things we're focusing on are really 2-fold. The first, is improving our operations. The U.K. is now finding itself operating in a competitive environment that's more similar to the environment that the U.S. has operated in over the last several years. Fortunately, the margins are higher in the U.K., but a lot of the things that you need to do to succeed in the U.K. are similar to the things we did in the U.S. Those would be focusing on pricing and underwriting discipline, make sure we're controlling the rates we're quoting, having milestone sign-offs, increasing the focus of underwriting in sales on profitability and implementing some of the comprehensive renewal programs that we had in the U.S., here within the U.K. in order to improve margins. We're also  going to bring across a lot of the claims management processes that we've developed over the last couple of years within the U.S. and implement those in the U.K. I'd note that it's a well-worn path that we're implementing. It's something we've done before in the U.S. It's something that I personally was involved in, both within underwriting and the claims process. And where we believe that by bringing those best practices over here, we will be able to buck against the competitive headwinds we're facing, continue to get strong margins and continue to improve results. The second piece of that though, beyond kind of shoring up the business with operational and financial controls, relates to really tapping into the untapped market over here. In the U.K., only 1 out of 10 employees in the private sector are currently covered for a group income protection. That's probably 70% to 80% in the U.S., Canada and several other developed countries. And so we want to take a good run at expanding that coverage. We think that's a huge growth opportunity within the U.K. The time is ripe, both in terms of what's happening in the government, as well as in employee benefits. And we hope to capitalize on that."

I do think prices have eroded in the marketplace over the past 2 years. I think there's recognition in the U.K. that it's been a very soft market and that it's not in the best interest of carriers, intermediaries or anyone to continue in that direction. And so we are the market leader in the U.K. If prices are going to harden in the U.K., we need to participate in that. And so that will be a part of pricing discipline with an attempt to make sure we shore up margins, make sure they don't continue to erode and face pressure from the economy but do it in a strategic and really targeted way so that we minimize the impact on our inforce block while we're improving margins. From a claims management perspective, there's a big difference between claims management practices within the U.K. and what we had done within the U.S. My read on that one is kind of a ""Why wouldn't you do it?"" I mean, we have solid practices, we know how to implement it. We're confident that it can improve results. It's a better process both from everyone's perspective, both internally with regulators and with claimants and employers. And so it just makes sense to implement that. And we do believe our margin in claims management relative to competitors is not as wide as it's been in the past. By implementing these practices, we think we can begin to spread that out a little bit and give us more opportunity to grow the market and invest in it."

We had another solid quarter, with operating income growth for the quarter and year-to-date remaining in line with our 2010 outlook of growth of between 4% and 6%.

We had another solid quarter, with operating income growth for the quarter and year-to-date remaining in line with our 2010 outlook of growth of between 4% and 6%. I would say, too, that we certainly benefited from our more diverse business mix as the relatively strong performance of Unum US and colonial operations, driven frankly generally by stable risk trends, offset the relatively weaker performance of our Unum UK operation. While the economic and competitive environment in both the U.S. and U.K. remain a challenge, by staying disciplined, we have continued to generate solid profitability, including strong statutory earnings, which has enabled us to continue to repurchase stock while still maintaining a strong capital position.
Now let me just touch on just a few highlights in the quarter. First, as I indicated, third quarter after tax operating income grew 3.9%, and earnings per share grew 6.5%, which are both consistent with our 2010 outlook of growth between 4% to 6%. 
Second, while we saw very little change in the business and economic environment this quarter and no substantive changes in the competitive environment, we are capitalizing on profitable growth opportunities as they arise. I point especially to our voluntary benefits businesses in both the Unum US, where our sales grow 27% in the third quarter; and colonial, where our commercial sales grew 5.7% as good indications of how we're actually capitalizing on today's market conditions. Don't get me wrong. The combination of the economy and aggressive competitors make it challenging to profitably grow the business, but we feel very good about our market position.
Third, our investment portfolio remains in excellent shape, with a net unrealized gain in our fixed maturity securities portfolio increasing as a result of the decline in interest rates and ongoing tightening of credit spreads to $5.7 billion this quarter. The flip side, however, is that today's low level of interest rates and investment yields can create some challenges, but we have positioned the company to effectively manage through this environment.
And finally, with our solid financial results and strong investment performance, we continue to build on our very strong capital position. Our weighted average risk-based capital ratio is currently at 410%, and our holding company's cash and marketable securities position is slightly above $1 billion, giving us continued financial flexibility in these uncertain times. We have built these strong capital levels while also purchasing $198 million of stock during the third quarter and $328 million of stock year-to-date.
In summary, I feel very good about our results so far this year. I think the diversity of our company is becoming more apparent. The relatively strong performance of Unum US and Colonial Life operations offset the lower level of performance in the UK. As you know, we've made a management change there, and I'm confident that under Jack McGarry's leadership, we can continue to -- we can more effectively operate in this difficult market environment and capitalize on the growth opportunities which I believe exist in this market. 
While we continue to face premium growth challenges in certain lines of business, we continue to benefit from our disciplined business approach, which has allowed us to generate capital that can be used to repurchase stock at a very opportune time. 
Now I'll ask Tom White to provide an overview on our operating results this quarter. Tom?"

Net realized after-tax investment gains for the third quarter of 2010 include an after-tax gain of $1.1 million resulting from changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative and a modified coinsurance contract, compared to an after-tax gain of $28.9 million in the third quarter of 2009. Also included in net realized after-tax investment gains for the third quarter are net realized after-tax investment losses of $200,000 related to sales and write-downs of investments, compared to net after-tax losses of $19.4 million in the third quarter of 2009. Excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $219.9 million for this quarter or $0.68 per diluted common share, compared to $211.6 million or $0.64 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter.
Turning to the operating segments. In total, Unum US operating income increased 4% to $204.7 million in the third quarter. Within Unum US, the group disability line reported another solid quarter, with income up 4% to $77.8 million, driven primarily by improved risk experience on a year-over-year basis. Within the group lines and AD&D line, operating income increased 6% to $52.8 million in the third quarter. A slight improvement in premium income as well as stable risk experience helped to generate the improved earnings.
In the supplemental and voluntary line, third quarter income was up 2.8% to $74.1 million from $72.1 million a year ago. The improvement was driven by strong earnings growth from the voluntary benefits line of business. 
Moving to Unum UK, operating income in this segment decreased $19.6 million to $47.2 million. Operating income declined 15.1% in local currency. While premium income in local currency was essentially flat in the third quarter, the benefit ratio of 66.9% was well above the unusually low benefit ratio of the year-ago quarter. You'll recall that the third quarter of 2009 benefit ratio benefited from a reserve reduction associated with a significant reduction in the value of inflation index-linked policies. This reduction in reserves was largely offset by a corresponding reduction in net investment income on index-linked securities. The year-over-year reduction in income reflects pressure from the economic environment on our ability to resolve claims and continued competitive pricing pressures, particularly in the group disability lines.
Concluding our core operations, Colonial Life had a strong quarter, with premium growth of 6.2% and operating income growth of 5.8% compared to last year. The benefit ratio was 49.9% this quarter compared with a year-ago benefit ratio of 48.2%, but in line with our longer-term expectations for this business segment.
The Individual Disability — Closed Block operating income was $9.8 million compared to $7.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The interest adjusted loss ratio was higher at 85.5% this quarter compared to 81.6% in the year-ago quarter, but was consistent with the second quarter of 2010.  Premium income declined by 6%, and net investment income was up 1% year-over-year. 
And finally, the Corporate and Other segment reported an operating loss of $10.8 million compared to a loss of $13.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Net investment income was higher, reflecting higher levels of invested assets and higher miscellaneous net investment income, while interest expense increased to $31.8 million this year compared to $24.1 million last year, reflecting the debt issuances from September of 2009 and September of 2010.
So with that review of our operating results, I'll turn the call over to Rick McKenney for a deeper analysis of this quarter's results."
166762,113823772,163923,"Unum Group, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Unum Group","Executives","Thank you, Tom. In my comments, I'd like to discuss this quarter's key drivers, which have remained relatively consistent, and also cover our investment portfolio, interest rate management and our capital position. First, starting on how risk is performin",1795,"Thank you, Tom. In my comments, I'd like to discuss this quarter's key drivers, which have remained relatively consistent, and also cover our investment portfolio, interest rate management and our capital position. First, starting on how risk is performing, across the company it is generally stable, with some pockets of elevated experience off of last year's very favorable results. 
Focusing on Unum US, risk experience remained generally stable across all lines this quarter. Our group disability results remained strong with a third quarter benefit ratio of 84.6%, lower than the year-ago quarter experience of 85.3% due to more favorable claim recovery performance and flat with the benefit ratio in the second quarter. New claim incidence for the quarter was consistent with the year-ago experience but slightly elevated relative to the second quarter. The claim incidence trends are not showing notable underlying trends or any signs of being economically influenced. 
This quarter's results also reflect our view that our group disability benefit ratio will level out this year and that longer-term opportunities for improvement can be achieved gradually as our core market exposure changes with our inforce mix of business. I would note that given today's challenging environment, I believe our current pretax margin of 15% and ROE of 12.6% for the third quarter for the group disability business line are quite strong.
Also within Unum US, group life and AD&D experience remained very steady, with the third quarter benefit ratio at 70.4% compared to 70.3% in the year-ago quarter and second quarter as well. Finally, the voluntary and supplemental lines showed favorable claims experience in the voluntary benefit line, with third quarter benefit ratio declining to 54.6% from 59% a year ago, offset by a slightly higher benefit ratio in the individual disability recently issued line due to higher average size of new claims. The long term care line showed generally steady interest adjusted loss ratios of 80.9% in the third quarter compared to 80.8% in the second quarter, and up from 77.5% in the year-ago quarter. 
Moving to our Unum UK results, risk results were worse than last year and up slightly sequentially, with a third quarter 2010 benefit ratio at 66.9%. Weaker results have a number of drivers, including lower net claim resolutions and continued competitive pricing pressures in the group disability line, which is only partially offset by a slight improvement in group life experience. The impact of inflation on the inflation index-linked group policies is generally a non-economic influence and was a significant contributor to the year-ago year-over-year change in the benefit ratio, but had minimal impact on the sequential quarter results. 
The competitive market conditions are negatively impacting our margins in the U.K., and we expect this drag to continue for the near term. I'll remind you that the Unum UK pretax margin was 29% and ROE was nearly 21% this quarter, still a very healthy level of profitability. 
And finally, Colonial Life's risk result this quarter was somewhat unfavorable in the accidents, sickness and disability line of business and drove the benefit ratio for the quarter to just under 50% compared to 48.2% in the year-ago quarter. As we have mentioned before, we believe that the benefit ratio of around 50% is likely an ongoing expectation for Colonial Life as a whole.
Turning to the premium line, the challenges continue in today's economic and business environment. Looking at Unum US first, we are not seeing any improvement in the natural growth that we have discussed with you over the past several quarters. Our estimate is that natural growth still represents a stubborn headwind of approximately 1% today, as the economy and, specifically, high unemployment and low wage inflation continue to pressure our top line. 
The highlight we continue to see within Unum US is our success in growing our voluntary benefits business. Sales in this line increased 27% in the third quarter and are now up 17% year-to-date. Having a strong voluntary benefits presence is essential to our strategy, as we believe our markets will move towards more employee participation in benefit plans, and our team is executing very well in this area of growth.
Within Unum UK, we are starting to see some stabilization of our premium income. However, we continue to expect to see pressure over the near-term as competitive market conditions persist and economic trends remain challenging in the U.K. Our new sales were somewhat encouraging this quarter. And while they were down 3% in local currency this quarter, the comparison was very difficult given the success we had in the second half of 2009, gaining sales as a competitor was exiting the market. In addition, we are continuing to see a greater portion of our sales mix from group disability relative to group life, which is more in line with the balance that we're looking for. 
And rounding it out with Colonial Life results, our growth metrics remain in good shape. Third quarter sales increased by 2.3%, less than the rate of growth we experienced in the first half of the year as public sector sales were down on a year-over-year basis, but the commercial markets' results remained good, with third quarter sales growth of 5.7%. Recruiting trends continue to be strong, with new contracts up 14.2% this quarter and up 19.6% year-to-date. 
New account growth also remains encouraging, up 10.2% this quarter and 17% for year-to-date. Countering these positive results, our average new case size is lower by 8.8%, driven by the economy and the tendency for our newer agents to have their initial success in the smaller end of the market. With positive sales and recruiting momentum, along with stable persistency trends, Colonial Life's premium grew 6.2% for the third quarter. 
As you shift to the balance sheet, our investment portfolio continues to be a highlight as we continue to see excellent results in the credit profile of our portfolio. With a rally in the Treasury markets during the third quarter, our net unrealized gain position for our fixed maturity securities portfolio improved further to a quarter end level of $5.1 billion compared to a gain of $3.7 billion at June 30. Net realized investment losses this quarter were insignificant. Importantly, our internal watch list of potential credit problems in the investment portfolio continues to decline to the point where, in aggregate, they sit in an unrealized loss position of less than $5 million. 
As happy as we are about the strong credit profile, the downside of low interest rates and tiny corporate bond spreads is obviously the challenge it creates for new money investment opportunities. As we have discussed with you in the past, the key focus for our business in this environment is the relationship between the portfolio yields backing our various product lines and the aggregate discount rates embedded in the reserves. For the third quarter, our portfolio yields held up very well, with our aggregate portfolio yield of 6.73% down only 3 basis points from the second quarter of 2010 and down only 1 basis point from 12/31/2009 yields. Our individual product line portfolios showed similar results.
And although no insurer enjoys this environment, we believe we are relatively well positioned for ongoing low interest rates for a few key reasons. Number one, we have a relatively small amount of new cash to invest in our product lines relative to the size of our existing investment portfolios, which allows our investment team to be very choosy in the assets we take from a relative-value perspective. Two, we have maintained a conservative discount rate assumptions, while our new money investment opportunities benefited from the wide investment spreads of 2008 and early 2009. Three, we're still putting on new claim reserves each quarter at discount rates lower than the aggregate rate, which will continually lower our aggregate discount rate, just as lower new money yields will lower the overall portfolio yield. And lastly, we have the ability to reprice many of our product lines, which allows us to price for lower interest rates over time. So to sum up, while today's low interest rates are a challenge, I believe we are well positioned to tolerate this environment.
So with solid financial and investment results, book value per share continues to grow. The company's book value per share was $28.08 at September 30, 2010, an increase of 13% relative to a year ago. And looking at our capital, our statutory earnings continue to be quite healthy, which drives a very sound capital position for the company. Net income on a statutory basis for our traditional U.S. life insurance subsidiaries in the third quarter was $148 million, in line with the roughly $150 million we've been generating. This healthy level of earnings resulted in growth in our capital base at our insurance subsidiaries and improvement in our RBC ratio to approximately 410%, which is above the range we have set out for ourselves. 
Holding company cash and marketable securities remains at a very strong level, totaling $1.03 billion at quarter end. During the third quarter, we issued $400 million of 10-year senior notes, primarily to fund the payment of a debt maturity of $225 million in the first quarter of 2011. In addition, we have recently used $100 million of the proceeds for an additional pension contribution, which occurred in October after the close of the third quarter, and it is an acceleration of the pension plan contribution we expected to make in 2011. 
With the $400 million debt issuance, our leverage ratio is now 23.3%. However, this will decline by approximately 200 basis points as we pay off the debt maturing in the first quarter next year. We also continue to return capital to shareholders by buying back our shares, repurchasing 9.5 million shares in the third quarter. We have been opportunistic in buying back shares when the price has been low, but this quarter's repurchase is done at an average share price of $20.91. We have approximately $173 million remaining of the $500 million authorized by our board in May. 
And I'll close with a comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2010. Our outlook a year ago, coming into 2010, was for operating income growth within a range of 4% to 6%. We believe that the lower end of this range is more likely for operating earnings growth for the full year 2010, with continued challenges result -- continued challenging results expected from our U.K. operation in the near term. However, given our share repurchases, we anticipate operating earnings per share towards the higher end of that target range. We will discuss this, as well as our outlook for 2011, at our investor meeting on November 17. And now I'll turn it back to Tom for his closing comments."

If I could, Darin, let me just sort of set the stage a little bit before I ask Jack maybe to make a few comments on his observations. But I think, as you and others know, for the last couple of years as we've been talking our U.K. business, we've been talking about the fact that the generous margins that we've been so fortunate to be able to experience are probably not sustainable, just because they're going to invite competition. And as competition comes in, we expected our margins to certainly come down. The other thing, too, is we certainly didn't see any acquisitions that I think that could continue to help support those higher levels of margins. And what we certainly didn't expect was the really venomous level of competitive dynamics that Jack can talk to in that market, nor did we expect the economy obviously to soften to the extent it did. But I think just to set the stage for why I thought a change was necessary, it certainly wasn't about a quarter. It wasn't about a feeling or concerned about our business and prices. It was more about just concerned about the speed by which we are addressing the short-term issues, which are really more competitive market conditions and economic issues. But then the other part is also the speed by which we are positioning ourselves to benefit from what I think is a tremendous set of growth opportunities there. So that's really what's behind the change. You're right; Jack's got a tremendous track record in the things that he's done. We have a lot of confidence in that business. It's still our highest ROE business, as Rick said in his comments. And I think, as you know, Jack has been there since really the middle of July. And I think, Jack, you've had a chance to get some pretty good observations on things, and maybe I'll just turn it to you just to share some of those insights."

Darin, I think the things we're focusing on are really 2-fold. The first is improving our operations. The U.K. is now finding itself operating in a competitive environment that's more similar to the environment that the U.S. has operated in over the last several years. Fortunately, the margins are higher in the U.K., but a lot of the things that you need to do to succeed in the U.K. are similar to the things we did in the U.S. Those would be focusing on pricing and underwriting discipline; make sure we're controlling the rates we're quoting; having milestone sign-offs; increasing the focus of underwriting in sales on profitability; and implementing some of the comprehensive renewal programs that we had in the U.S., here within the U.K. in order to improve margins. We're also going to bring across a lot of the claims management processes that we've developed over the last couple of years within the U.S. and implement those in the U.K. I'd note that it's a well-worn path that we're implementing. It's something we've done before in the U.S. It's something that I personally was involved in, both within underwriting and the claims process. And where we believe that by bringing those best practices over here, we will be able to buck against the competitive headwinds we're facing, continue to get strong margins and continue to improve results. The second piece of that, though, beyond kind of shoring up the business with operational and financial controls, relates to really tapping into the untapped market over here. In the U.K., only 1 out of 10 employees in the private sector are currently covered for group income protection. That's probably 70% to 80% in the U.S., Canada and several other developed countries. And so we want to take a good run at expanding that coverage. We think that's a huge growth opportunity within the U.K. The time is ripe, both in terms of what's happening in the government as well as in employee benefits. And we hope to capitalize on that."

I do think prices have eroded in the marketplace over the past 2 years. I think there's recognition in the U.K. that it's been a very soft market and that it's not in the best interest of carriers, intermediaries or anyone to continue in that direction. And so we are the market leader in the U.K. If prices are going to harden in the U.K., we need to participate in that. And so that will be a part of pricing discipline with an attempt to make sure we shore up margins, make sure they don't continue to erode and face pressure from the economy, but do it in a strategic and really targeted way so that we minimize the impact on our inforce block while we're improving margins. From a claims management perspective, there's a big difference between claims management practices within the U.K. and what we had done within the U.S. My read on that one is kind of a ""Why wouldn't you do it?"" I mean, we have solid practices. We know how to implement it. We're confident that it can improve results. It's a better process both from everyone's perspective, both internally with regulators and with claimants and employers. And so it just makes sense to implement that. And we do believe our margin in claims management relative to competitors is not as wide as it's been in the past. By implementing these practices, we think we can begin to spread that out a little bit and give us more opportunity to grow the market and invest in it."

In this environment, we probably would still look to around 2x coverage as a holding company, which is quite conservative but probably a good benchmark. 1x coverage is roughly $250 million, so there's still excess there.

And this has been -- with outlook on employment or the economy not turning around, new sales are just down across the board in the industry. As we track pricing levels using some outside research support, industry pricing levels continue to sort of slide downward. They haven't flattened, and they certainly haven't turned in the other direction. We're entering the 2011 renewal season. We would've expected, maybe based on some comments we've heard in the marketplace, that renewals might be easier to place. But we haven't seen that so far.

It’s a valuable part of our portfolio, consistent with the brokers that we do voluntary benefits with. And it's very consistent with our employee benefit strategy. Much of our group long term care business includes employer funding. The average age is still quite smack in the middle of the workforce in the mid-40s. That said, we have the ability to reprice group long term care because it is a group product. And we continue to evaluate sort of, over the course of time, what the right level of pricing is and how do we make sure that, that pricing matches up with the interest rate environment in particular. But in terms of operational experience, group long term care has performed quite well. On the individual side, we're no longer writing business. We’re in the process of looking at what kind of rate increase will be necessary to shore up that book of business, and we'll be rolling that through a number of discussions with state regulators over the next several weeks. And then we'll have more to report in a few weeks."

No, we're just focused on the basics with our field force. We're really emphasizing the service side of our business and getting our agents back out to visit our inforce customers and spending time with them doing benefits counseling.

And in many others, it does, but at least gets our folks out in front of our existing customers, and we're just staying after that and having nice, steady and even improving persistency results as you pointed out.
