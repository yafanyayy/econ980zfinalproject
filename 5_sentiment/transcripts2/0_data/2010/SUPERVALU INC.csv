With the start of the new year, I want you to know that I'm approaching fiscal 2011 optimistically. This isn't because I see a robust pickup in the economy because frankly, I don't. It is because I believe",2807,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. With the start of the new year, I want you to know that I'm approaching fiscal 2011 optimistically. This isn't because I see a robust pickup in the economy because frankly, I don't. It is because I believe SUPERVALU is running its business better and that means we are in control of our own destiny.Let me be specific here. The work streams that we previewed with you in October are showing traction and that makes me confident that they will deliver meaningful and visible results in the year ahead. I'm pleased to announce that SUPERVALU reported net earnings of $0.51 per diluted share on net sales of $9.2 billion for the third quarter, exceeding the consensus estimate. These results were achieved against significant economic headwinds and consumer spending trends, which have heightened competition throughout our industry.You've heard me say that grocery retail is a business and I believe that our results show that we are getting back to basics. Clearly defined areas of accountability are helping to fuel more intelligent data-driven decision-making throughout our organization. Today, SUPERVALU's associates understand better their respective roles and responsibilities and I am proud of their accomplishments and dedication to improving the shopping experience for our customers.This quarter's earnings performance reflects our product risks and initiatives we set into motion earlier this year. Our margins held up well, which is the direct result of improved communications and stronger relationships between our corporate merchants and our banners. In general, we saw more effective promotional spending, which helped to stabilize gross margins and we also benefited from good expense controls. Either with this meaningful progress, work still remains. I am not satisfied with the same-store sales performance but believe that our company is gaining momentum on key initiatives and behavioral changes that are designed to improve sales in fiscal '11 and beyond as they are implemented across our company. My objective is to position the company for long-term sustainable growth. While Pam will discuss details of our financial performance shortly, I did want to touch up on four items that I view as particularly important to the quarter.First, the quarter was a tough quarter and one in which we made difficult decisions in terms of striking the right balance between sales and promotional investment. I'm pleased to report that we achieved the appropriate balance and our results validate these decisions. As you may recall, our retail gross margins were off 60 basis points in the second quarter and 80 basis points in the first quarter when compared to last year. Clearly, our promotional activities during the first half of the year were costly and did not produce the sales and margin results that we had hoped for. In contrast to the first two quarters, our third quarter retail gross margins were off by only 10 basis points relative to the prior year. At our very core, we remain a promotional retailer as our promotional mix increased by 350 basis points compared to last year. However, we will not sacrifice margins but promotional activities, which we do not believe will influence long-term customer loyalty. Rather, our goal is to offer every everyday pricing that customers believe to be fair and merchandise that is relevant to the local markets where we serve.Second, we're making progress in narrowing the gap between our regular shelf price and our promotional prices. I can say this because our pricing surveys validate this effort. Today, price improvements have been driven through centralized decision-making, the consolidation of vendors, sometimes even leading to exclusive providers and leveraging the scale of our 4,300 store network. Fair pricing is top of mind at SUPERVALU and I'm pleased with the progress that we've made this quarter. Third, it is important to note that segment EBIT margins improved in third quarter relative to the prior two quarters. Third quarter retail EBIT, excluding the benefit of Salt Lake City, was 3.5% compared to 3.9% last year, but well ahead of the 2.5% last quarter and the 3.1% in the first quarter. Our Supply Chain business also achieved its operating goals, even after fully transitioning the Target business, delivering 3.1% compared to 3% a year earlier. I recognize that one quarter is not a winning streak, but I am starting to count.And finally, SUPERVALU is fulfilling its long-term commitment to reduce debt and regain financial flexibility. With our exit of the Salt Lake city market, the company reaped $150 million in after-tax proceeds. These funds have been applied to outstanding debt and through the end of Q3, debt is down over $300 million. We remain on target to pay down $700 million in fiscal '10.As a backdrop to the quarter, the overall industry remains challenged by the economic environment, heightened competitive activity and deflationary pressures. Deflation continued in November with a CPI food and home index declining 2.9% year-over-year. This figure was generally in line with October's reading and driven primarily by dairy and produce. Further, I believe the value orientation of today's shopper is secular and will remain with us for the foreseeable future.Industry-wide, we are seeing increased promotional activity targeting the thrift-conscious consumer. In my 30 plus years in retail, I've never witnessed the intense level of price reductions and promotional activity now occurring. My belief is that the recent industry trend toward lower pricing is here to stay. However, a hyper promotional environment can encourage routine cherry-picking and may not, in my view, necessarily builds long-term brand equity.This trend has only intensified an already competitive landscape. Consumers have become adept to tracking weekly advertisements and executing with surgical precision the purchase of those items that maximize their own savings. Accordingly, price tactics once used to drive foot traffic and tonnage are now driving lower transaction size and margin erosion.I'm sure many of you are wondering how this tough environment will impact SUPERVALU's full year earnings guidance. To that, I would respond that our earnings outlook for the fourth quarter fully captures the competitive retail climate in today's thrift-conscious consumer. We entered the fourth quarter with many headwinds including weak sales trends, however, we continue to focus on the basics of food retailing, placing the customer at the center of everything we do. We remain comfortable with the earnings guidance previously provided for fiscal '10 of diluted earnings per share within a range of $1.95 to $2.05. Now I'd like to turn my attention to the long-term outlook for the company and so doing, add more color to the vision that I outlined in our last call. SUPERVALU possesses many unique strengths, including a diverse network of owned and supplied stores. My vision for the company builds upon these tremendous assets integrating SUPERVALU's multiple distinct businesses to better serve our customers.As I said, future growth for the company will emphasize geography over ownership or banner and be driven by long-term strategic impact, rather than by quarter-to-quarter sales and earnings. I am optimistic about the future of this company and believe that there is significant untapped value. My goal as a steward of the stockholder is to capture the value for our investors, customers, affiliated independent retailers and employees.The principles that guide my decision making, at least at a high level, can be summarized as follows: Maximize the strength inherent in our diverse formats; effectively leverage our size and scale; nurture the unique brands we possess; create a sustainable competitive advantage that is relevant, differentiated and compelling for our customers; and finally, deliver financial results indicative of the growth company. Over the long term, as we execute against this vision of ""America’s Neighborhood Grocer"", we will improve on our return on invested capital by maximizing the value of our diverse store network and asset base. We will diligently review our existing portfolio and will take action to monetize assets where it makes sense.As I said in the past, SUPERVALU is capable of producing long-term financial results characterized by top line annual growth of approximately 4%, annual improvement in EBIT of 8%, bottom-line growth of 10% annually and a return on invested capital of 15%. While these goals will not be reached overnight, they are achievable by making fundamental changes to the management of our company in weaving together the fragmented operations of our traditional retail, hard discount and wholesale businesses.As CEO, one of my primary responsible is to build a leadership team that will execute on SUPERVALU's new vision. I'm happy to announce today that three new executives have joined our team. The first is Steve Jungmann, who will serve as Executive Vice President of Merchandising. Steve brings 25 years of sales and marketing experience to SUPERVALU, including a long tenure at Kraft and his most recent work with Solo Cup Company. His deep knowledge in consumer behavior and corporate planning will aid him in overseeing merchandising for all of our retail banners. Next, Chuck Elias will be SUPERVALU's Group Vice President of Strategic Planning. Chuck brings over 20 years of experience in operations and strategic management and has held leadership positions at Home Depot and General Electric. Finally, Keith Wyche joins us as President of Cub Foods. Most recently, Keith led U.S. operations for Pitney Management Services and brings 28 years of strong leadership experience to our company. Steve, Chuck and Keith strengthen SUPERVALU's management team and I look forward to their contributions as members of my leadership team. Last quarter I shared with you the major tenets of my vision for SUPERVALU. Among these was the decision to operate our multiple, distinct businesses as one cohesive entity. This is a departure from how SUPERVALU has historically viewed itself, so I'd like to spend a bit more time discussing the strategic benefits of this new operational paradigm.As you know, SUPERVALU is a large company serving a wide range of customers and neighborhoods nationwide, through both owned and affiliated locations. No one format we operate can effectively meet the varied needs of consumers in all the markets we serve. However, our complementary operations in multiple formats are key strengths that both differentiate SUPERVALU from other retail competitors and provide us significant flexibility in addressing the local needs of each market.In the second quarter, we talked about Chicago as a specific example of this opportunity. As I've traveled across the country, I've seen a number of other markets where our traditional retail format does not necessarily resonate with all of the customer preferences in that market. In these markets, there are niche ethnic players, high-end retail operators and other independent stores that do an excellent job in serving their diverse customer bases. The differentiator for these retailers is that they are hyper local, they exist to serve a narrow segment to the population and know their customers needs intimately. For example, some of the Hispanic retailers I met during my trips operate in-store at the [indiscernible] and offer vast arrays of meats and cheeses, as well as freshly prepared foods, tailored to their neighboring customers. Partnering with these local entrepreneurs will allow SUPERVALU to capture incremental market share that today is not available through our traditional retail banners. While we have a meaningful retail presence in many major markets across America, focusing on hyper local independents will offer SUPERVALU another incremental growth opportunity that leverages existing capabilities without having to invest in retail store locations. Again, this is incremental growth that would not come from our retail banners as they exist today and it is a unique growth opportunity available only at SUPERVALU. I should also point out that our Save-A-Lot format is another brand not present in many of these markets and will represent a catalyst for growth over the long term.By thinking of our business holistically rather than by banner or ownership, we will be more agile and better able to capitalize on expanded market opportunities. Among the growth vehicles that SUPERVALU possesses, none is as potent as Save-A-Lot. I'm committed to doubling the size of this hard discount format over the next five years. As you saw this morning's press, next year's capital plans calls for doubling of Save-A-Lot's new store openings. We continue to refine our execution with the opening of each new store and have approved an aggressive growth plan for our fiscal '11, which includes opening 100 locations, leveraging our existing network across the U.S.We believe the current commercial real estate market only enhances the already strong growth opportunities available to Save-A-Lot. Over the past four months, our real estate team has been working at a feverish pace to build fill pipeline. Already, we're seeing interest from new prospects to licensed Save-A-Lot stores and we continue to market locations to existing licensees. We believe our ability to grow with both licensed and corporately owned stores will ensure that Save-A-Lot achieves its growth target and maximizes the potential of this format. As we look to the future, speed and simplicity will be SUPERVALU's mantra, especially from an operating perspective. We will shine a light on inefficiency and bureaucratic decision-making to streamline operations and facilitate nimble action. As I commented last quarter, we are embarking on a metamorphosis that will redefine and reposition the company over the long-term. Going forward, we will be ""America’s Neighborhood Grocer"", a company that is focused on the consumer with fair everyday prices, partnering with the finest independent retailers in the country, operating with a lower cost structure, ruthlessly allocating capital, leveraging our national scale while remaining locally relevant, operating with best in class systems and easier to do business with. We will honor our pledge as stewards of the environment and will return to an investment grade company. Since the second quarter, we have taken actions to eliminate redundancies, make decision making more transparent and bring uniformity to information systems and business reporting activities. I'd like to highlight our progress on these areas to illustrate how SUPERVALU is coding speed and simplicity into its corporate DNA and everyday interaction with customers. We're now delivering clear more visible value statements to consumers in our stores, our promotional areas and grocery endcaps are much simpler, displays have been limited to two significant sale items to draw attention to the best values we offer, we streamline procurement of advertising by centralizing decision-making and negotiating better distribution and print rates for our weekly circulars, we remain on track to complete SKU rationalization across our retail network within the next 15 months. Let me add that SKU rationalization is going well. During the quarter we completed the review of 15 product categories that will be implemented beginning in February. Among the categories we looked at was bath tissue. To give you some insight into this category, each national brand offers multiple distinct varieties tissue and historically, SUPERVALU has carried four- to five-pack sizes in each assortment. This practice creates inefficiencies in stocking and visual noise for the customer. By February, we will have paired back tissue SKUs used by 25%. This will reduce the number of package sizes across brands, but still keeps those varieties that are most relevant to our customer. This will increase holding power for our best selling items and add space for SUPERVALU's own brands. If you think about what this does, it makes shopping easier because it reduces clutter and more clearly defines choices for consumers. It also makes it easier for our store associates who manage inventory and logistics. Consider this, the changes in this one category will eliminate one supplier from our operations, reduce stored inventory by one palette and trim in-store labor associated with maintenance. Now multiply these savings by 1,200 stores in our traditional retail network. You can see where I'm going. What each category review and implementation, SUPERVALU drives savings and improves the shopability of our stores. Finally, we've implementing guard rails around our own brand pricing. We're no longer bashful in endorsing our wide assortment of own brand products, with more prominent positioning on our shelves and representations on our displays.The last thing I want to cover is SUPERVALU's most recent store-level of customer satisfaction survey. I introduced this survey on our last call and am delighted to report that for the second consecutive quarter, customer scores improved by 300 to 600 points when asked about the quality and freshness of our perishables, courtesy and friendliness of our checkers, if they would recommend us to others and our overall price competitiveness. I would also add that Save-A-Lot scores are showing similar upswing. As always, I appreciate your continued interest in SUPERVALU and believe that the positive traction that you have begun to get to see this quarter is a good indicator of future trends and underscores our commitment to getting back to the basics of retail. With that, let me now turn the call over to Pam for additional information on our financial results."

In addition to providing some comments on the third quarter, which ended December 5, I will also cover SUPERVALU's financial condition and outlook for the fourth quarter.Let me begin with the observations that",1907,"Thank you, Craig, and good morning, everyone. In addition to providing some comments on the third quarter, which ended December 5, I will also cover SUPERVALU's financial condition and outlook for the fourth quarter.Let me begin with the observations that touch upon today's operating environment. First and foremost, unemployment remains high and the behavior of today's consumer can best be characterized as cautious. With national unemployment sitting at 10%, a level not seen since the of summer of 1983, many Americans are concerned about our financial future and have responded to this uncertainty by changing their shopping and savings habits. Consumer confidence, which is closely linked to the labor market, has improved slightly, but it is languishing near historical lows. Interestingly, the Conference Board, which publishes this index, attributes the modest improvement in recent months to a decline in the percent of consumers expecting business conditions to worsen as opposed to an increase in the percentage of consumers expecting it to improve. In short, less bad seems to be the new good. This environment poses practical challenges for consumers as well as for retailers. Consumers remain concerned about their jobs and have become even more value-conscious in making everyday decisions.Retailers have responded by investing in price, increasing promotional activities, reducing inventories and adjusting staffing to accommodate today's consumer. Compounding these challenges, we have also seen five consecutive months of year-over-year deflation in the CPI food at home index, a trend that benefits consumers that had pressured the top line of food retailers. The general sentiment seems to be that inflation will return in 2010 and we expect to begin cycling deflation in variant produce in our fourth quarter. With that as a backdrop, let me turn my remarks to our third quarter results.As Craig stated, we are pleased to announce that SUPERVALU's third quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.51, which included a $0.06 gain from the sale of [indiscernible] from Salt Lake City market and a $0.01 charge for previously announced foreclosures. Adjusting for these two items, our earnings per share of $0.46 exceeded First Call consensus of $0.40 and compares to earnings per share of $0.62 a year earlier before $14.57 in non-cash impairment charges. As Craig stated, quarter three was a tough quarter. Net sales were $9.2 billion compared to $10.2 billion last year, a decline of 9.4%. The change in year-over-year sales was driven by our exit from the Salt Lake City retail market, the impact of previously announced store closures, the transition to self distribution by the Target Corporation and negative 6.5 ID sales. The fall in identical store sales was attributable to a 2% decline in customer count and a 4.5% drop in average basket size.So what makes up the 4.5%? Consistent with my comments on our second quarter, the quarter three transaction size was again impacted by high levels of deflation, accelerating by 40 basis points over quarter two to approximately 1.2% in quarter three. Deflation was most pronounced in the dairy and produce categories. Trade down remained a factor as customers continue to look for ways to stretch their shopping dollars. Overall, we estimate the impact of trade down was about 100 basis points. One favorable side effect of this behavior was improved penetration of our own brand products, which increased slightly to 17.6% of sales, and now represent 21% of total units sold. Initial fourth quarter data shows continued improvements in own brand penetration, highlighting our merchants' increased focused on first tier label. We continue to see approximately one half item less per transaction. This trend was driven by the same factors I spoke to last quarter, mainly consumers' adherence to shopping lists and a reduced willingness to add impulse items to their baskets.Lastly, to comment on the change in customer count to negative 2% in quarter three, we were not surprised to see this slight decrease over the quarter two run rate of 70 basis points, as it is the direct result of our decision to eliminate ineffective promotions. Our ID sales guidance for full year F10 is approximately negative 5%, as the fourth quarter is trending comparable to the third quarter.Turning to operating earnings, we delivered good results despite a challenging environment. Excluding one-time items in both periods, retail food operating earnings were 3.5% of sales in the third quarter compared to 3.9% a year earlier. Supply chain operating earnings were 3.1% of sales in the third quarter compared to 3.0% a year earlier. Let me provide some additional detail on these results beginning with retail food. The 40 basis point change in operating earnings is composed of a 10 basis point decline in gross margin and a 30 basis point increase in expenses as a percentage of sales.The gross margin rate during the quarter primarily reflected price and promotional investments, which were partially offset by a lower LIFO charge. The gross margin rate was down only slightly to last year, as we did a good job balancing our promotional spending during the highly promotional holiday period. On the expense side, the largest driver of the 30 basis point increase was lower sales. Yes, expense reductions were a focus during the quarter and excellent progress was made. However, these results were not sufficient to offset reduced sales leverage.I would like to share various initiatives on which we are currently working to improve SUPERVALU's cost structure as we strive to achieve the 50 basis point selling and administrative reduction we had targeted for the long term. First, workforce productivity. So far this year, metrics per ton per item and time per customer, as well as overtime hours improved concurrent with front-end customer satisfaction scores.Next, reductions in store capital cost. Both traditional and hard discount remodel costs are down an average of 10% to 30%. We are also driving lower energy consumption. Energy costs are down 2% through efforts that include lighting retrofits and the installation of case curtains to reduce cold air loss during off hours.And finally, we are reducing in-store costs. We are leveraging SUPERVALU's scale to save dollars in procuring goods and services not offered for resale including floor maintenance, in-store product demos, bags and print services.I do want to also comment that our supply chain team did an excellent job managing operations in the quarter and posted a 10 basis point improvement in operating margin as a percent of sales year-over-year. Efficiency initiatives fully offset the completion of Target's previously announced transition of certain volumes to self [ph] distribution. As well as in the third quarter, we saw at the cumulative benefits of standardization of our distribution centers, the consolidation of East Coast operations and the mechanization of our Lancaster facility.Let me now turn to our financial condition starting with capital spending. This quarter we opened one new traditional store, our Shaw's Chestnut Hill location, which Craig spoke to on our last quarter call, and it is off to a great start. And we completed 24 major store remodels. At the end of quarter three, almost 70% of our stores were either new or newly remodeled within the past seven years and we expect to finish the fiscal year close to this level.This morning's release provided guidance on fiscal '11 capital, which includes new customer facing initiatives designed to drive sales. We commented last quarter that we are now comfortable with the overall condition of our facilities and consistent with our customer-focus vision, are now turning our attention to new merchandising activities within the four walls of our stores. We expect to cut well over 300 locations in fiscal '11 with these activities, allowing us to be locally relevant with compelling differentiated offerings, yet not requiring the level of capital investments captured in our seven-year metric.It is particularly exciting for me to share the coming year's capital plan, which doubles the number of Save-A-Lot store to openings relative to fiscal '10, as we begin the task of doubling the size of our hard discount format. Since we launched this growth objective late in October, I have met personally with a number of Save-A-Lot licensees in their respective markets to learn about their businesses, understand their growth objectives and hear what we can do to support their growth. We are confident with our new focus on Save-A-Lot growth, that we will achieve 100 openings in fiscal '11.Turning to the balance sheet, SUPERVALU remains on plan to reduce debt by $700 million in this fiscal year. In fact, year-to-date through last week, we reduced total debt by $580 million and have reduced over $1.6 billion in total debt since our acquisition of Albertsons in 2006. We remain in compliance with our debt covenant, including the most restrictive levels that take effect as of the end of the fiscal year. For the trailing 12 months, EBIT, excluding impairment and non-operating charges, totaled $1.4 billion. Depreciation and amortization was $1.0 billion. Net rent expense was $0.4 billion and total debt, including capital leases, was $8.2 billion, reflecting the typical seasonal borrowing peak.We finished the third quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in total borrowing capacity available to us under our revolving credit in AR facilities. As we look towards future debt maturities, we have sufficient cash flow and available borrowing capacity to meet our fiscal '11 obligations, which total approximately $1.2 billion. Our senior credit facility expires in June of fiscal '12. As we think about replacing this facility, we recognize that today's credit markets indicate less favorable rates than we presently have.We are actively engaged with our banking partners to determine the appropriate time and manner to replace the facility and would expect it to reflect terms indicative of our strong cash flows. As you likely recall, when we announced the exit of the Salt Lake City retail market, we stated that the overall impact of the transaction would be negligible to our results. As a recap, we did record approximately $0.04 of impairment charges in the second quarter. The transaction closed in the third quarter, netting a $0.06 gain, and we expect an additional $0.01 in exit cost in the fourth quarter for a full year favorable net impact of $0.01.We affirm fiscal '10 guidance for net earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.95 to $2.05 on a GAAP basis and $2.01 to $2.11 on an adjusted basis when excluding costs related primarily to previously announced store closures. Based on this outlook, our fourth quarter GAAP earnings guidance is a $0.56 to $0.66 per diluted share and compares to adjusted earnings of $0.81 in the fourth quarter of last year, which excludes $0.06 for the 53rd week.In April, as we have traditionally done in the past, we will provide guidance for fiscal '11 sales and earnings per share as well as our debt-reduction target. And as promised last quarter, we will also provide additional disclosures in terms of operating metrics and market shares to improve transparency into our Retail, Hard Discount and Wholesale businesses.Let me close by saying that the balance of this year will be challenging. We made real progress in the third quarter in stabilizing our margins and we remain focused on retail basics to better meet the evolving needs of our customers. I look forward to updating you in April on our fourth quarter results and our outlook for fiscal '11. I will now open up the call for your questions, and following Q&A, Craig will provide some closing remarks. Thank you."

In fact, Pam, I think, the last report only had one market where we would be sort of the high-priced player in every other market we are not, and in most markets, we are not by a significant percent, which is really good news and we see continued progress on that front. And we see continued positive feedback from customers. The customer scores I referred to earlier, that's customers telling us what they think of us. It's not an internal thing.

I frankly am -- I would like for customers to be responding more quickly. I'm not surprised. The stuff that we're working on is on one hand fairly simple stuff, the SKU rationalization, the pricing, the sort of narrowing the gap between our promotional price and our regular shelf price. That said, with 50,000 SKUs and thousands of stores in our network, it takes time to get all these things executed. And we're trying to do them thoughtfully and in a manner that is not disruptive to our consumers. So I think what we've talked about before is we're looking at a year or 18 months as we roll out all of these initiatives. What I said in my script and I really believe I love the pace that which I see this company moving. SUPERVALU associates have embraced this idea and we're moving at a very vast cliff. But this is going to take some time for us to both execute the programs and then once they get executed, have our customers really sort of see the breadth of that which we're doing. So I can point to one-off situations, John, where we've address the pricing thing, but that might not be enough to change customer behavior. It's only when she sees that change across a broad range of categories in our stores. The fixing of the bathroom tissue category is incredibly important for us. But it alone, won't change customer perception nor will it change operational efficiency enough to matter. But if I do that in a bunch of category, and I will, and I will do so in the next 15 months, I think that's when the customer notices and you will be able to see it then in the metrics."

I'll start with, particularly with own brands, we've seen some great success as we've looked at consolidating suppliers with some of our own brand categories. And we've seen really, really good benefit and cooperation and partnership with our supplier partners, clearly, with the ones who end up getting the business. I mentioned that in some cases, we've consolidated vendors that would clearly be in the case of some of our own brands and I'm pleased with what the own brand team has accomplishing in that area. Let me take, maybe, the case study of the bathroom tissue regarding a broad range of categories. Really, and I think we see this, we actually had a good walk through the executive team just yesterday where we looked at a number of categories where the team has actually gone through this process. Primarily, what we're seeing is not elimination of brands but elimination of redundant sizes or packs. Bathroom tissue would be a great case study here. We actually don't eliminate -- we eliminate one tertiary brand. But in all the brands that matter, to our customer, we don't eliminate the brand and we did not eliminate a variety. What we eliminated maybe was a pack count because we have gotten to where we are carrying virtually every pack count available. And that caused us to be really inefficient and that we couldn't even get, in many cases, a full case on the shelf at a time, which as you know, that means I'm taking stuff to the backroom or moving it somewhere. So we sort of set some rules in place of what we have to be able to get on the shelf. And I'll tell you, when we actually looked at the shelf yesterday, the clarity for the consumer, the clarity of offering, I think, is so improved versus where we were. I don't think that consumers are going to look at it and say we've taken any choice away. In fact, I think what we look at is we now see that the consumer will look at better choice, and so that's that. On the vendor side, I guess it's a mix. When I was talking to our business development managers yesterday, I think the vendors, the bigger, the better ones, they know we have to do this. I've actually talked to a couple of the CEOs. I wouldn't lie to you and say that they're comfortable. But I would say that they know we have to do this. They understand that we've gotten to where we're inefficient. And I think to the degree that we are partnering with them, they are embracing this and saying, ""Look, what we can actually do is sell more product because we'll be in stock on the weekends. We'll be in stock at 4:00 on Saturday afternoon and Sunday afternoon and we'll have the right brands that the consumer is looking for."" And so ultimately, this will be a win. So I hope I've answered the question there."

So I kind of reiterate what I said in the past quarter, we want to be thoughtful about our spend. And I think you're right. Your words are fine to me with regards to how we're approaching this. This team is doing so much good work right now on finding ways to take costs out of our business or to be more efficient or to leverage better cost from suppliers. And how we pass that along in the form of better pricing, particularly everyday shelf pricing, that's exactly what we're working on. And you're right, this is not a magic bullet, but it is something that over time, I think will be effective and sustainable, which is important to us here is what we want to do are things that are sustainable."

This isn’t because I see a robust pick up in the economy because frankly I don’t. It is because I believe SUPERVALU is running its business better and that means we are in control of our own destiny. 
Let me be specific here. The work streams we previewed with you in October are showing traction and that makes me confident that they will deliver meaningful and visible results in the year ahead. I am pleased to announce that SUPERVALU reported net earnings of $0.51 per diluted share on net sales of $9.2 billion for the third quarter, exceeding the consensus estimate. These results were achieved against significant economic headwinds and consumer spending trends which have heightened competition throughout our industry. 
You have heard me say that grocery retail is a simple business and I believe that our results show we are getting back to basics. Clearly defined areas of accountability are helping to fuel more intelligent data driven decision making throughout our organization. Today SUPERVALU’s associates understand better their respective roles and responsibilities and I am proud of their accomplishments and dedication to improving the shopping experience for our customers. 
This quarter’s earnings performance reflects our progress on initiatives we set into motion early this year. Our margins held up well which is the direct result of improved communications and stronger relationships between our corporate merchants and our banners. In general we saw more effective promotional spending which helped to stabilize gross margins and we also benefited from good expense controls. 
Even with this meaningful progress work still remains. I am not satisfied with the same store sales performance but believe that our company is gaining momentum on key initiatives and behavioral changes that are designed to improve sales in fiscal 2011 and beyond as they are implemented across our company. My objective is to position the company for long-term, sustainable growth. 
While Pam will discuss details of our financial performance shortly I do want to touch upon four items that I view as particularly important to the quarter. 
First, the quarter was a tough quarter and one in which we made difficult decisions in terms of striking the right balance between sales and promotional investment. I am pleased to report we achieved the appropriate balance and our results validate these decisions. As you may recall our retail gross margins were off 60 basis points in the second quarter and 80 basis points in the first quarter when compared to last year. Clearly our promotional activities during the first half of the year were costly and did not produce the sales and margin results we had hoped for. 
In contrast to the first two quarters our third quarter retail gross margins were off by only 10 basis points relative to the prior year. At our very core we remain a promotional retailer as our promotional mix increased by 350 basis points compared to last year. However, we will not sacrifice margins for promotional activities which we do not believe will influence long-term customer loyalty. Rather, our goal is to offer everyday pricing that customers believe to be fair and merchandise that is relevant to the local markets we serve. 
Second, we are making progress in narrowing the gap between our regular shelf price and our promotional pricing. I can say this because our pricing surveys validate this effort. To date, price improvements have been driven through centralized decision making, the consolidation of vendors sometimes even leading to exclusive providers and leveraging the scale of our 4,300 store network. Fair pricing is top of mind at SUPERVALU and I am pleased with the progress we have made this quarter. 
Third, it is important to note that segment EBIT margins improved in the third quarter relative to the prior two quarters. Third quarter retail EBIT excluding the benefit of Salt Lake City was 3.5% compared to 3.9% last year but well ahead of the 2.5% last quarter and the 3.1% in the first quarter. Our supply chain business also achieved its operating goals even after fully transitioning to target business delivering 3.1% compared to 3% a year earlier. I recognize that one quarter is not a winning streak but I am starting to count. 
Finally, SUPERVALU is fulfilling its long-term commitment to reduce debt and regain financial flexibility. With our exit of the Salt Lake City market the company reaped $150 million in after-tax proceeds. These funds have been applied to outstanding debt and through the end of Q3 debt is down over $300 million. We remain on target to pay down $700 million in fiscal 2010. 
As a backdrop to the quarter, the overall industry remains challenged by the economic environment, heightened competitive activity and deflationary pressures. Deflation continued in November with the CPI Food and Home Index declining 2.9% year-over-year. This figure was generally in line with October’s reading and driven primarily by dairy and produce. Further I believe the value orientation of today’s shopper is secular and will remain with us for the foreseeable future. 
Industry wide we are seeing increased promotional activity targeting the thrift conscious consumer. In my 30 plus years in retail I have never witnessed the intense level of price reductions and promotional activity now occurring. My belief is that the recent industry trend towards lower pricing is here to stay. However, a hyper promotional environment can encourage routine cherry picking and may not in my view necessarily build long-term brand equity. This trend has only intensified an already competitive landscape. 
Consumers have become adept at tracking weekly advertisements and executing with surgical precision the purchase of those items that maximize their own savings. Accordingly price tactics once used to drive foot traffic and tonnage are now driving lower transaction size and margin erosion. 
I am sure many of you are wondering how this tough environment will impact SUPERVALU’s full year earnings guidance. To that I would respond that our earnings outlook for the fourth quarter fully captures the competitive retail climate and today’s thrift conscious consumer. We entered the fourth quarter with many headwinds including weak sales trends. However, we continue to focus on the basics of food retailing, placing the customer at the center of everything we do. We remain comfortable with the earnings guidance previously provided for fiscal 2010 of diluted earnings per share within a range of $1.95 to $2.05. 
Now I would like to turn my attention to the long-term outlook for the company and in so doing add more color to the vision that I outlined in our last call. SUPERVALU possesses many unique strengths including a diverse network of owned and supplied stores. My vision for the company builds upon these tremendous assets integrating SUPERVALU’s multiple distinct businesses to better serve our customers. As I said, future growth for the company will emphasize geography over ownership or banner and be driven by long-term strategic impact rather than by quarter-to-quarter sales and earnings. I am optimistic about the future of this company and believe there is significant uncapped value here. 
My goal as the steward of the stockholder is to capture the value for our investors, customers, [ability] of independent retailers and employees. The principles that guide my decision making at least at a high level can be summarized as follows: Maximize the strength inherent in our diverse formats. Effectively leverage our size and scale. Nurture the unique brands we posses. Create a sustainable competitive advantage that is relevant, differentiated and compelling for our customers. Finally, deliver financial results indicative of a growth company. 
Over the long-term as we execute against this vision of America’s neighborhood grocer, we will improve on our return on invested capital by maximizing the value of our diverse store network and asset base. We will diligently review our existing portfolio and will take action to monetize assets where it makes sense. As I have said in the past, SUPERVALU is capable of producing long-term financial results characterized by top line annual growth of approximately 4%, annual improvement in EBIT of 8%, bottom line growth of 10% annually and a return on invested capital of 15%. 
While these goals will not be reached overnight, they are achievable by making fundamental changes to the management of our company and weaving together the fragmented operations of our traditional retail, hard discount and wholesale businesses. 
As CEO one of my primary responsibilities is to build a leadership team that will execute on SUPERVALU’s new vision. I am happy to announce today that three new executives have joined our team. The first is Steve Jungmann who will serve as the Executive Vice President of Merchandising. Steve brings 25 years of sales and marketing experience to SUPERVALU including a long tenure with Kraft and his most recent work with Solo Cup Company. His deep knowledge of consumer behavior and corporate planning will aid him in overseeing merchandising for all of our retail banners. 
Next, Chuck [Golias] will be SUPERVALU’s Group Vice President of Strategic Planning. Chuck brings over 20 years experience in operations in strategic management and has held leadership positions at Home Depot and General Electric. 
Finally, Keith Wyche joins us as President of Cub Foods. Most recently, Keith Led US operations for Pitney Management Services and brings 28 years of strong leadership experience to our company. Steve, Chuck and Keith strengthen SUPERVALU’s management team and I look forward to their contributions as members of my leadership team. 
Last quarter I shared with you the major tenets of my vision for SUPERVALU. Among these was my decision to operate our multiple, distinct businesses as one cohesive entity. This is a departure of how SUPERVALU has historically viewed itself so I would like to spend a bit more time discussing the strategic benefits of this new operational paradigm. 
As you know, SUPERVALU is a large company serving a wide range of customers in neighborhoods nationwide through both owned and affiliated locations. No one format we operate can effectively meet the varying needs of consumers in all the markets we serve. However, our complimentary operations in multiple formats are a key strength that both differentiates SUPERVALU from other retail competitors and provides us significant flexibility in addressing the local needs of each market. 
In the second quarter we talked about Chicago as a specific example of this opportunity. As I have traveled across the country I have seen a number of other markets where a traditional retail format does not necessarily resonate with all of the customer preferences in that market. In these markets there are niche ethnic players, high end retail operators and other independent stores that do an excellent job in serving their diverse customer base. The differentiator for these retailers is that they are hyper-local. They exist to serve a narrow segment of the population and know their customer’s needs intimately. 
For example, some of the Hispanic retailers I met during my trips operate in-store tortillaria’s and offer vast arrays of meats and cheeses as well as freshly prepared foods tailored to their neighborhood customers. Partnering with these local entrepreneurs will allow SUPERVALU to capture incremental market share that today is not available to our traditional retail banners. 
While we have a meaningful retail presence in many major markets across America, focusing on hyper-local independents will offer SUPERVALU another incremental growth opportunity that leverages existing capabilities without having to invest in retail store locations. Again, this is incremental growth that would not come from our retail banners as they exist today and it is a unique growth opportunity available only to SUPERVALU. 
I should also point out that our Sav-A-Lot format is another brand not present in many of these markets and will represent a catalyst for growth over the long-term. By thinking about business holistically rather than by banner or ownership we will be more agile and better able to capitalize on expanded market opportunities. 
Among the growth vehicles that SUPERVALU possesses, none is as potent as Sav-A-Lot. I am committed to doubling the size of this hard discount format over the next five years. As you saw in this morning’s press release, next year’s capital plan calls for a doubling of Sav-A-Lot’s new store openings. We continue to refine our execution with the opening of each new store and have approved an aggressive growth plan for fiscal 2011 which includes opening 100 locations, leveraging our existing network across the US. 
We believe the current commercial real estate market only enhances the already strong growth opportunities available to Sav-A-Lot. Over the past four months our real estate team has been working at a feverish pace to fill our pipeline. Already we are seeing interest from new prospects to license Sav-A-Lot stores and we continue to market locations to existing licensees. We believe our ability to grow both licensed and corporately owned stores will ensure that Sav-A-Lot achieves its growth targets and maximizes the potential of this format. 
As we look to the future, speed and simplicity will be SUPERVALU’s mantra especially from an operating perspective. We will shine a light on inefficiency and bureaucratic decision making to streamline operations and facilitate operations. As I commented last quarter we are embarking on a metamorphosis that will redefine and reposition the company over the long-term. Going forward we will be America’s neighborhood grocer, a company that is focused on the consumer with fair everyday prices partnering with the finest independent retailers in the country operating with a lower cost structure, ruthlessly allocating capital, leveraging our national scale while remaining locally relevant, operating with best in class systems and easier to do business with. 
We will honor our pledge as stewards of the environment and return to an investment grade company. Since the second quarter we have taken actions to eliminate redundancies, make decision making more transparent and bring uniformity to information systems and business reporting activities. 
I would like to highlight our progress on these areas to illustrate how SUPERVALU is coding speed and simplicity into its corporate DNA and everyday interaction with its customers. We are now bringing more clear, more visible value statements to consumers in our stores. Our promotional areas and grocery end caps are much simpler. Displays have been limited to two significant sale items to draw attention to the best values we offer. 
We streamlined procurement of advertising by centralizing decision making and negotiating better distribution and print rates for our weekly circulars. We remained on track to complete SKU rationalization across our retail network within the next 15 months. Let me add that SKU rationalization is going well. During the quarter we completed the review of 15 product categories that will be implemented beginning in February. Among the categories we looked at was bath tissue. To give you some insight into this category each national brand offers multiple distinct varieties of tissue and historically SUPERVALU has carried 4-5 pack sizes in each assortment. 
This package creates inefficiencies in stocking and visual noise for the customer. By February we will have pared back tissue SKUs by 25%. This will reduce the number of package sizes across brands but still keeps those varieties that are most relevant to our customers. This will increase holding power for our best selling items and add space for SUPERVALU’s owned brands. If you think about what this does, it makes shopping easier because it reduces clutter and more clearly defines choices for consumers. It also makes it easier for our store associates who manage inventory and logistics. 
Consider this, the changes in this one category will eliminate one supplier from our operations, reduce stored inventory by one pallet and trim in-store labor associated with maintenance. Now multiply these savings by 1,200 stores in a traditional retail network. You can see where I am going. With each category review and implementation SUPERVALU drives savings and improves the shopability of our stores. 
Finally, we have implemented new guard rails around our owned brand pricing. We are no longer bashful in endorsing our wide assortment of owned brand products with more prominent positioning on our shelves and representation on our displays. 
The last thing I want to cover is SUPERVALU’s most recent store level customer satisfaction survey. I introduced this survey on our last call and am delighted to report that for the second consecutive quarter customer scores improved by 300-600 points when asked about the quality and freshness of our perishables, courtesy and friendliness of our checkers, if they would recommend us to others and our overall price competitiveness. I will also add that Sav-A-Lot stores are showing similar upswing. 
As always, I appreciate your continued interest in SUPERVALU and believe that the positive traction you have begun to see this quarter is a good indicator of future trends and underscores our commitment to getting back to the basics of retail. 
With that let me now turn the call over to Pam for additional information on our financial results. 
"
306013,83890672,45728,"SUPERVALU Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jan-12-2010",2010-01-12,"Earnings Calls","SUPERVALU INC.","Executives","Thank you Craig and good morning everyone. In addition to providing some comments on the third quarter which ended December 5th, I will also cover SUPERVALU’s financial condition and outlook for the fourth quarter. Let me begin with observations that",1917,"Thank you Craig and good morning everyone. In addition to providing some comments on the third quarter which ended December 5th, I will also cover SUPERVALU’s financial condition and outlook for the fourth quarter. 
Let me begin with observations that touch upon today’s operating environment. First and foremost unemployment remains high and the behavior of today’s consumer can best be characterized as cautious. With national unemployment sitting at 10%, a level not seen since the summer of 1983, many Americans are concerned about their financial future and have responded to this uncertainty by changing their shopping and savings habits. 
Consumer confidence which is closely linked to the labor market has improved slightly but it is languishing near historical lows. Interestingly, the conference board which publishes this index attributes the modest improvement in recent months to a decline in the percent of consumers expecting business conditions to worsen as opposed to an increase in percentage of consumers expecting it to improve. In short, less bad seems to be the new good. 
This environment poses practical challenges for consumers as well as for retailers. Consumers remain concerned about their jobs and have become even more value conscious in making every day decisions. Retailers have responded by investing in price, increasing promotional activity, reducing inventories and adjusting staffing to accommodate today’s consumer. 
Compounding these challenges we have also seen five consecutive months of year-over-year deflation in the CPI Food and Home Index, a trend that benefits consumers but it pressures the top line of food retailers. The general sentiment seems to be that inflation will return in 2010 and we expect to begin cycling deflation in varying produce in our fourth quarter. 
With that as a backdrop let me turn my remarks to our third quarter results. 
As Craig stated, we are pleased to announce that SUPERVALU’s third quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.51 which included a $0.06 gain from the sale of stores in the Salt Lake City market and a $0.01 charge for previously announced store closures. Adjusting for these two items, our earnings per share of $0.46 exceeded First Call consensus of $0.40 and compares to earnings per share of $0.62 a year earlier before $14.57 in non-cash impairment charges. 
As Craig stated, quarter three was a tough quarter. Net sales were $9.2 billion compared to $10.2 billion last year, a decline of 9.4%. The change in year-over-year sales was driven by our exit from the Salt Lake City market, the impact of previously announced store closures, the transition to self distribution by the Target Corporation and negative 6.5% ID sales. 
The fall in identical store sales was attributable to a 2% decline in customer count and a 4.5% drop in average basket size. So what makes up the 4.5%? Consistent with my comments on our second quarter the quarter three transaction size was again impacted by high levels of deflation accelerating by 40 basis points over quarter two to approximately 1.2% in quarter three. Deflation was most pronounced in the dairy and produce categories. 
Trade down remained a factor as customers continue to look for ways to stretch their shopping dollars. Overall, we estimate the impact of trade down was about 100 basis points. One favorable side effect of this behavior was improved penetration of our owned brand products which increased slightly to 17.6% of sales and now represents 21% of total units sold. Initial fourth quarter data shows continued improvements in owned brand penetration highlighting our merchant’s increased focus on first tier labels. 
We continue to see approximately ½ items less per transaction. This trend was driven by the same factors I spoke to last quarter namely the consumer’s adherence to shopping lists and a reduced willingness to add impulse items to their baskets. 
Lastly, to comment on the change in customer count to negative 2% in quarter three we were not surprised to see this slight decrease over the quarter two run rate of 70 basis points as it is the direct result of our decision to eliminate ineffective promotions. Our ID sales guidance for full year F10 is approximately negative 5% as the fourth quarter is trending comparable to the third quarter. 
Turning to operating earnings, we delivered good results despite a challenging environment. Excluding one-time items in both periods, retail food operating earnings were 3.5% of sales in the third quarter compared to 3.9% a year earlier. Supply chain operating earnings were 3.1% of sales in the third quarter compared to 3.0% a year earlier. 
Let me provide some additional detail on these results beginning with retail food. The 40 basis point change in operating earnings is composed of a 10 basis point decline in gross margin and a 30 basis point increase in expenses as a percentage of sales. The gross margin rate during the quarter primarily reflected price and promotional investment which was partially offset by a lower LIFO charge. The gross margin rate was down only slightly to last year as we did a good job balancing our promotional spending during the highly promotional holiday period. 
On the expense side the largest driver of the 30 basis point increase was lower sales. Yes, expense reductions were a focus during the quarter and excellent progress was made. However, these results were not sufficient to offset reduced sales leverage. 
I would like to share various initiatives on which we are currently working to improve SUPERVALU’s cost structure as we strive to achieve the 50 basis point selling and administrative reduction we have targeted for the long-term. 
First, workforce productivity. So far this year, metrics for time per item and time per customer as well as overtime hours improved concurrent with front end customer satisfaction scores. Next, reductions in store capital costs. Both traditional and hard discount remodel costs are down an average of 10-30%. We are also driving lower energy consumption. Energy costs are down 2% through efforts that include lighting retrofits and installation of case curtains to reduce cold air loss during off hours. 
Finally, we are reducing in-store costs. We are leveraging SUPERVALU’s scale to save dollars in restoring goods and services not offered for resale including floor maintenance, in-store product demos, bag and print services. I do want to also comment that our supply chain team did an excellent job managing operations in the quarter and posted a 10 basis point improvement in operating margin as a percent of sales year-over-year. Efficiency initiatives fully offset the completion of Target’s previously announced transition of certain volumes of self distribution. 
As well, in the third quarter we saw the cumulative benefit of standardization of our distribution centers, the consolidation of the east coast operations and the mechanization of our Lancaster facility. 
Let me now turn to our financial condition starting with capital spending. This quarter we opened one new traditional store, our Shaw’s Chestnut Hill location which Craig spoke to on our last quarter call and it is off to a great start. And we completed 24 major store remodels. At the end of Q3 almost 70% of our stores were either new or newly remodeled within the past seven years and we expect to finish with this year close to this level. 
This morning’s release provided guidance on fiscal 2011 capital which includes new customer facing initiatives designed to drive sales. We commented last quarter that we are now comfortable with the overall condition of our facilities and consistent with our customer focus vision are now turning our attention to new merchandising activities within the four walls of our stores. We expect to touch well over 300 locations in fiscal 2011 with these activities allowing us to be locally relevant with compelling differentiated offerings yet not requiring the level of capital investment captured in our seven year metrics. 
It is particularly exciting for me to share the coming year’s capital plan which doubles the number of Sav-A-Lot store openings relevant to fiscal 2010 as we begin the task of doubling the size of our hard discount format. Since we launched this growth objective late in October I have met personally with a number of Sav-A-Lot licensees in their respective markets to learn about their businesses, understand their growth objectives and hear what we can do to support their growth. We are confident with our new focus on Sav-A-Lot growth we will achieve 100 openings in fiscal 2011. 
Turning to the balance sheet, SUPERVALU remains on plan to reduce debt by $700 million in this fiscal year. In fact, year-to-date through last week we have reduced total debt by $580 million and have reduced over $1.6 billion in total debt since our acquisition of Albertsons in 2006. We remain in compliance with our debt covenants including the most restrictive levels that take effect as of the end of the fiscal year. 
For the trailing 12 months, EBIT excluding impairment and non-operating charges totaled $1.4 billion. Depreciation and amortization was $1.0 billion. Net rent expense was $0.4 billion and total debt including capital leases was $8.2 billion reflecting the typical seasonal [inaudible] peak. We finished the third quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in total borrowing capacity available to us under our revolving credit and AR facilities. 
As we look towards future debt maturities we have sufficient cash flow and available borrowing capacity to meet our fiscal 2011 obligations which total approximately $1.2 billion. Our senior credit facility expires in June of fiscal 2012. As we think about replacing this facility we recognize that today’s credit markets indicate less favorable rates than we presently have. We are actively engaged with our banking partners to determine the appropriate time and manage a replacement facility and expect it to reflect terms indicative of our strong cash flows. 
As you likely recall when we announced the exit of the Salt Lake City retail market we stated that the overall impact of the transaction would be negligible to our results. As a recap, we did record approximately $0.04 of impairment charges in the second quarter. The transaction closed in the third quarter netting a $0.06 gain and we expect an additional $0.01 in exit costs in the fourth quarter for a full year favorable net impact of $0.01. 
We affirm fiscal 2010 guidance for net earnings per diluted share in a range of $1.95 to $2.05 on a GAAP basis and $2.01 to $2.11 on an adjusted basis when excluding costs related primarily to previously announced store closures. Based on this outlook our fourth quarter GAAP earnings guidance is $0.56 to $0.66 per diluted share and compares to adjusted earnings of $0.81 in the fourth quarter of last year which excludes $0.06 for the 53rd week. 
In April, as we have traditionally done in the past, we will provide guidance for fiscal 2011 sales and earnings per share as well as our debt reduction targets. As promised last quarter, we will also provide additional disclosures in terms of operating metrics and market share to improve transparency into our retail, hard discount and wholesale businesses. 
Let me close by saying the balance of this year will be challenging. We made real progress in the third quarter in stabilizing our margins and we remain focused on retail basics to better meet the evolving needs of our customers. I look forward to updating you in April on our fourth quarter results and our outlook for fiscal 2011. 
I will now open up the call for your questions and following Q&A Craig will provide some closing remarks. Thank you.

On the positive side I would say what Pam mentioned in her script and that is we are seeing some nice improvements in our price gap relative to traditional competitors in many of our markets. 
In fact I think the last report only had one market where we would be sort of the high priced player. In every other market we are not and in most markets we are not by a significant percent which is really good news and we see continued progress on that front and we see continued positive feedback from customers. The customer scores I referred to earlier, that is customers telling us what they think of us. That is not an internal thing. I think that ought to be read as good news that the customers are continuing to say good things about their experiences and the pricing at our stores.

I would like for customers to be responding more quickly. I am not surprised. The stuff we are working on is on one hand fairly simple stuff. The SKU rationalization, the pricing, the narrowing of the gap between our promotional price and our regular shelf price. That said, with 50,000 SKUs and thousands of stores in our network it is time to get all these things executed and we are trying to do them thoughtfully and in a manner that is not disruptive to our consumers. So I think as we talked about before we are looking at a year or 18 months as we roll out all of these initiatives. 
What I said in my script and I really believe, I love the pace at which I see this company moving. SUPERVALU associates have embraced this idea. We are moving at a very fast clip but this is going to take some time for us to both execute the programs and then once they get executed have our customers really sort of see the breadth of that which we are doing. So I can point to one-off situations where we address the pricing things but that might not be enough to change customer behavior. It is only when she sees that change across a broad range of categories in our stores. The fixing of the bathroom tissue category is incredibly important for us but it alone won’t change customer perception nor will it change operational efficiency enough to matter. But if I do that in a bunch of categories and I will and I will do so in the next 15 months, I think that is when the customer notices and you will be able to see it then in the metrics.

Actually let me hit on a couple of things. I will start with particularly owned brands. We have seen some great success as we have looked at consolidating suppliers with some of our owned brand categories and we have seen really, really good benefit and cooperation partnership with our supplier partners clearly with the ones who end up getting the business. I mentioned in some cases we have consolidated vendors. That would clearly be in the case of some of our owned brands. I am pleased with what the owned brand team is accomplishing in that area. 
Let me take the case of the bathroom tissue regarding a broad range of categories. I think we have seen this and we actually had a good walk through with the executive team just yesterday where we looked at a number of categories where the team has actually gone through this process. Primarily what we are seeing is not the elimination of brands but elimination of redundant sizes or packs. Bathroom tissue would be a great case study here. 
We actually eliminate one tertiary brand but in all the brands that matter to our customer we don’t eliminate a brand and we did not eliminate a variety. What we eliminated maybe was a pack count because we had gotten to where we were carrying virtually every pack count available. That caused us to be really inefficient in that in many cases we couldn’t even get a full case on a shelf at a time which as you know that means I am picking stuff in the back room or moving it somewhere. So we sort of set some rules in place about what we have to get on the shelf. I will tell you when we actually looked at the shelf yesterday the clarify for the consumer, the clarity of the offering I think is so improved versus where we were I don’t think the consumer is going to look at it and say that we have taken any choice away. 
In fact, I think what we look at is we now see the consumer will look at better choice. So that is that. On the vendor side, I guess it is a mix. When I was talking to our business development managers yesterday I think the vendors, the bigger and better ones, they know we have to do this. I have actually talked to a couple of the CEOs. I wouldn’t lie to you and say they are comfortable but I would say they know we have to do this and they understand we have gotten to where we are inefficient. I think to the degree we are partnering with them they are embracing this and saying what we can actually do is sell more products because we will be in stock on the weekends. We will be in stock at 4 o’clock on a Saturday afternoon and Sunday afternoon and we will have the right brands the consumer is looking for so ultimately this will be a win. I hope I have answered the question there.

In closing, I would like to wrap up today’s call with a final thought. That is since my arrival in May we have been pushing hard for SUPERVALU to embrace speed and simplicity in everything we do, especially important in the current environment with consumers focused on value. We need to execute on the simple blocking and tackling, offering the right merchandise relative to neighborhoods we serve at a fair price. 
As I have said many times, grocery retail is ultimately a simple business and SUPERVALU is repositioning itself to meet the consumer needs in this challenging environment driving operational efficiencies and producing results that resonate with our shareholders. I look forward to visiting with many of you in the months ahead and thank you for your continued interest in SUPERVALU.

This isn't because I see a robust pickup in the economy because frankly, I don't. It is because I believe SUPERVALU is running its business better and that means we are in control of our own destiny.Let me be specific here. The work streams that we previewed with you in October are showing traction and that makes me confident that they will deliver meaningful and visible results in the year ahead. I'm pleased to announce that SUPERVALU reported net earnings of $0.51 per diluted share on net sales of $9.2 billion for the third quarter, exceeding the consensus estimate. These results were achieved against significant economic headwinds and consumer spending trends, which have heightened competition throughout our industry.You've heard me say that grocery retail is a business and I believe that our results show that we are getting back to basics. Clearly defined areas of accountability are helping to fuel more intelligent data-driven decision-making throughout our organization. Today, SUPERVALU's associates understand better their respective roles and responsibilities and I am proud of their accomplishments and dedication to improving the shopping experience for our customers.This quarter's earnings performance reflects our progress on initiatives we set into motion early this year. Our margins held up well, which is the direct result of improved communications and stronger relationships between our corporate merchants and our banners. In general, we saw more effective promotional spending, which helped to stabilize gross margins, and we also benefited from good expense controls. Either with this meaningful progress, work still remains. I am not satisfied with the same-store sales performance but believe that our company is gaining momentum on key initiatives and behavioral changes that are designed to improve sales in fiscal '11 and beyond as they are implemented across our company. My objective is to position the company for long-term sustainable growth. While Pam will discuss details of our financial performance shortly, I did want to touch upon four items that I view as particularly important to the quarter.First, the quarter was a tough quarter and one in which we made difficult decisions in terms of striking the right balance between sales and promotional investment. I'm pleased to report that we achieved the appropriate balance and our results validate these decisions. As you may recall, our retail gross margins were off 60 basis points in the second quarter and 80 basis points in the first quarter when compared to last year. Clearly, our promotional activities during the first half of the year were costly and did not produce the sales and margin results that we had hoped for. In contrast to the first two quarters, our third quarter retail gross margins were off by only 10 basis points relative to the prior year. At our very core, we remain a promotional retailer as our promotional mix increased by 350 basis points compared to last year. However, we will not sacrifice margins but promotional activities, which we do not believe will influence long-term customer loyalty. Rather, our goal is to offer everyday pricing that customers believe to be fair and merchandise that is relevant to the local markets where we serve.Second, we're making progress in narrowing the gap between our regular shelf price and our promotional prices. I can say this because our pricing surveys validate this effort. Today, price improvements have been driven through centralized decision-making, the consolidation of vendors, sometimes even leading to exclusive providers and leveraging the scale of our 4,300 store network. Fair pricing is top of mind at SUPERVALU, and I'm pleased with the progress that we've made this quarter. Third, it is important to note that segment EBIT margins improved in third quarter relative to the prior two quarters. Third quarter retail EBIT, excluding the benefit of Salt Lake City, was 3.5% compared to 3.9% last year, but well ahead of the 2.5% last quarter and the 3.1% in the first quarter. Our Supply Chain business also achieved its operating goals, even after fully transitioning the Target business, delivering 3.1% compared to 3% a year earlier. I recognize that one quarter is not a winning streak, but I am starting to count.And finally, SUPERVALU is fulfilling its long-term commitment to reduce debt and regain financial flexibility. With our exit of the Salt Lake city market, the company reaped $150 million in after-tax proceeds. These funds have been applied to outstanding debt and through the end of Q3, debt is down over $300 million. We remain on target to pay down $700 million in fiscal '10.As a backdrop to the quarter, the overall industry remains challenged by the economic environment, heightened competitive activity and deflationary pressures. Deflation continued in November with the CPI food and home index declining 2.9% year-over-year. This figure was generally in line with October's reading and driven primarily by dairy and produce. Further, I believe the value orientation of today's shopper is secular and will remain with us for the foreseeable future.Industry-wide, we are seeing increased promotional activity targeting the thrift-conscious consumer. In my 30 plus years in retail, I've never witnessed the intense level of price reductions and promotional activity now occurring. My belief is that the recent industry trend toward lower pricing is here to stay. However, a hyper promotional environment can encourage routine cherry-picking and may not, in my view, necessarily build long-term brand equity.This trend has only intensified an already competitive landscape. Consumers have become adept to tracking weekly advertisements and executing with surgical precision the purchase of those items that maximize their own savings. Accordingly, price tactics once used to drive foot traffic and tonnage are now driving lower transaction size and margin erosion.I'm sure many of you are wondering how this tough environment will impact SUPERVALU's full year earnings guidance. To that, I would respond that our earnings outlook for the fourth quarter fully captures the competitive retail climate in today's thrift-conscious consumer. We entered the fourth quarter with many headwinds including weak sales trends. However, we continue to focus on the basics of food retailing, placing the customer at the center of everything we do. We remain comfortable with the earnings guidance previously provided for fiscal '10 of diluted earnings per share within a range of $1.95 to $2.05. Now I'd like to turn my attention to the long-term outlook for the company and so doing, add more color to the vision that I outlined in our last call. SUPERVALU possesses many unique strengths, including a diverse network of owned and supplied stores. My vision for the company builds upon these tremendous assets integrating SUPERVALU's multiple distinct businesses to better serve our customers.As I said, future growth for the company will emphasize geography over ownership or banner and be driven by long-term strategic impact, rather than by quarter-to-quarter sales and earnings. I am optimistic about the future of this company and believe that there is significant untapped value. My goal as a steward of the stockholder is to capture the value for our investors, customers, affiliated independent retailers and employees.The principles that guide my decision making, at least at a high level, can be summarized as follows: Maximize the strength inherent in our diverse formats; effectively leverage our size and scale; nurture the unique brands we possess; create a sustainable competitive advantage that is relevant, differentiated and compelling for our customers; and finally, deliver financial results indicative of the growth company. Over the long term, as we execute against this vision of ""America’s Neighborhood Grocer"", we will improve on our return on invested capital by maximizing the value of our diverse store network and asset base. We will diligently review our existing portfolio and will take action to monetize assets where it makes sense.As I said in the past, SUPERVALU is capable of producing long-term financial results characterized by top line annual growth of approximately 4%, annual improvement in EBIT of 8%, bottom-line growth of 10% annually and a return on invested capital of 15%. While these goals will not be reached overnight, they are achievable by making fundamental changes to the management of our company in weaving together the fragmented operations of our traditional retail, hard discount and wholesale businesses.As CEO, one of my primary responsible is to build a leadership team that will execute on SUPERVALU's new vision. I'm happy to announce today that three new executives have joined our team. The first is Steve Jungmann, who will serve as Executive Vice President of Merchandising. Steve brings 25 years of sales and marketing experience to SUPERVALU, including a long tenure at Kraft and his most recent work with Solo Cup Company. His deep knowledge in consumer behavior and corporate planning will aid him in overseeing merchandising for all of our retail banners. Next, Chuck Elias will be SUPERVALU's Group Vice President of Strategic Planning. Chuck brings over 20 years of experience in operations and strategic management and has held leadership positions at Home Depot and General Electric. Finally, Keith Wyche joins us as President of Cub Foods. Most recently, Keith led U.S. operations for Pitney Management Services and brings 28 years of strong leadership experience to our company. Steve, Chuck and Keith strengthen SUPERVALU's management team and I look forward to their contributions as members of my leadership team. Last quarter I shared with you the major tenets of my vision for SUPERVALU. Among these was the decision to operate our multiple, distinct businesses as one cohesive entity. This is a departure from how SUPERVALU has historically viewed itself, so I'd like to spend a bit more time discussing the strategic benefits of this new operational paradigm.As you know, SUPERVALU is a large company serving a wide range of customers and neighborhoods nationwide, through both owned and affiliated locations. No one format we operate can effectively meet the varied needs of consumers in all the markets we serve. However, our complementary operations in multiple formats are key strengths that both differentiate SUPERVALU from other retail competitors and provide us significant flexibility in addressing the local needs of each market.In the second quarter, we talked about Chicago as a specific example of this opportunity. As I've traveled across the country, I've seen a number of other markets where our traditional retail format does not necessarily resonate with all of the customer preferences in that market. In these markets, there are niche ethnic players, high-end retail operators and other independent stores that do an excellent job in serving their diverse customer bases. The differentiator for these retailers is that they are hyper local, they exist to serve a narrow segment to the population and know their customers needs intimately. For example, some of the Hispanic retailers I met during my trips operate in-store Tortillarias and offer vast arrays of meats and cheeses, as well as freshly prepared foods, tailored to their neighboring customers. Partnering with these local entrepreneurs will allow SUPERVALU to capture incremental market share that today is not available through our traditional retail banners. While we have a meaningful retail presence in many major markets across America, focusing on hyper local independents will offer SUPERVALU another incremental growth opportunity that leverages existing capabilities without having to invest in retail store locations. Again, this is incremental growth that would not come from our retail banners as they exist today and it is a unique growth opportunity available only at SUPERVALU. I should also point out that our Save-A-Lot format is another brand not present in many of these markets and will represent a catalyst for growth over the long term.By thinking of our business holistically rather than by banner or ownership, we will be more agile and better able to capitalize on expanded market opportunities. Among the growth vehicles that SUPERVALU possesses, none is as potent as Save-A-Lot. I'm committed to doubling the size of this hard discount format over the next five years. As you saw this morning's press release, next year's capital plans calls for doubling of Save-A-Lot's new store openings. We continue to refine our execution with the opening of each new store and have approved an aggressive growth plan for our fiscal '11, which includes opening 100 locations, leveraging our existing network across the U.S.We believe the current commercial real estate market only enhances the already strong growth opportunities available to Save-A-Lot. Over the past four months, our real estate team has been working at a feverish pace to fill our pipeline. Already, we're seeing interest from new prospects to licensed Save-A-Lot stores and we continue to market locations to existing licensees. We believe our ability to grow with both licensed and corporately owned stores will ensure that Save-A-Lot achieves its growth target and maximizes the potential of this format. As we look to the future, speed and simplicity will be SUPERVALU's mantra, especially from an operating perspective. We will shine a light on inefficiency and bureaucratic decision-making to streamline operations and facilitate nimble action. As I commented last quarter, we are embarking on a metamorphosis that will redefine and reposition the company over the long term. Going forward, we will be America’s Neighborhood Grocer, a company that is focused on the consumer with fair everyday prices, partnering with the finest independent retailers in the country, operating with a lower cost structure, ruthlessly allocating capital, leveraging our national scale while remaining locally relevant, operating with best in class systems and easier to do business with. We will honor our pledge as stewards of the environment and will return to an investment grade company. Since the second quarter, we have taken actions to eliminate redundancies, make decision making more transparent and bring uniformity to information systems and business reporting activities. I'd like to highlight our progress on these areas to illustrate how SUPERVALU is coding speed and simplicity into its corporate DNA and everyday interaction with customers. We're now delivering clear more visible value statements to consumers in our stores. Our promotional areas and grocery endcaps are much simpler. Displays have been limited to two significant sale items to draw attention to the best values we offer. We streamline procurement of advertising by centralizing decision-making and negotiating better distribution and print rates for our weekly circulars. We remain on track to complete SKU rationalization across our retail network within the next 15 months. Let me add that SKU rationalization is going well. During the quarter, we completed the review of 15 product categories that will be implemented beginning in February. Among the categories we looked at was bath tissue. To give you some insight into this category, each national brand offers multiple distinct varieties of tissue. And historically, SUPERVALU has carried four- to five-pack sizes in each assortment. This practice creates inefficiencies in stocking and visual noise for the customer. By February, we will have paired back tissue SKUs used by 25%. This will reduce the number of package sizes across brands, but still keeps those varieties that are most relevant to our customer. This will increase holding power for our best selling items and add space for SUPERVALU's own brands. If you think about what this does, it makes shopping easier because it reduces clutter and more clearly defines choices for consumers. It also makes it easier for our store associates who manage inventory and logistics. Consider this, the changes in this one category will eliminate one supplier from our operations, reduce stored inventory by one palette and trim in-store labor associated with maintenance. Now multiply these savings by 1,200 stores in our traditional retail network. You can see where I'm going. What each category review and implementation, SUPERVALU drives savings and improves the shopability of our stores. Finally, we've implemented new guard rails around our own brand pricing. We're no longer bashful in endorsing our wide assortment of own brand products, with more prominent positioning on our shelves and representations on our displays.The last thing I want to cover is SUPERVALU's most recent store level customer satisfaction survey. I introduced this survey on our last call and I'm delighted to report that for the second consecutive quarter, customer scores improved by 300 to 600 points when asked about the quality and freshness of our perishables, courtesy and friendliness of our checkers, if they would recommend us to others and our overall price competitiveness. I would also add that Save-A-Lot scores are showing similar upswing. As always, I appreciate your continued interest in SUPERVALU and believe that the positive traction that you have begun to get to see this quarter is a good indicator of future trends and underscores our commitment to getting back to the basics of retail. With that, let me now turn the call over to Pam for additional information on our financial result."

In addition to providing some comments on the third quarter, which ended December 5, I will also cover SUPERVALU's financial condition and outlook for the fourth quarter.Let me begin with the observations that",1908,"Thank you, Craig, and good morning, everyone. In addition to providing some comments on the third quarter, which ended December 5, I will also cover SUPERVALU's financial condition and outlook for the fourth quarter.Let me begin with the observations that touch upon today's operating environment. First and foremost, unemployment remains high and the behavior of today's consumer can best be characterized as cautious. With national unemployment sitting at 10%, a level not seen since the of summer of 1983, many Americans are concerned about our financial future and have responded to this uncertainty by changing their shopping and savings habits. Consumer confidence, which is closely linked to the labor market, has improved slightly, but it is languishing near historical lows. Interestingly, the Conference Board, which publishes this index, attributes the modest improvement in recent months to a decline in the percent of consumers expecting business conditions to worsen as opposed to an increase in the percentage of consumers expecting it to improve. In short, less bad seems to be the new good. This environment poses practical challenges for consumers as well as for retailers. Consumers remain concerned about their jobs and have become even more value-conscious in making everyday decisions.Retailers have responded by investing in price, increasing promotional activities, reducing inventories and adjusting staffing to accommodate today's consumer. Compounding these challenges, we have also seen five consecutive months of year-over-year deflation in the CPI food at home index, a trend that benefits consumers that had pressured the top line of food retailers. The general sentiment seems to be that inflation will return in 2010 and we expect to begin cycling deflation in variant produce in our fourth quarter. With that as a backdrop, let me turn my remarks to our third quarter results.As Craig stated, we are pleased to announce that SUPERVALU's third quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.51, which included a $0.06 gain from the sale of store [ph] from Salt Lake City market and a $0.01 charge for previously announced foreclosures. Adjusting for these two items, our earnings per share of $0.46 exceeded First Call consensus of $0.40 and compares to earnings per share of $0.62 a year earlier before $14.57 in non-cash impairment charges. As Craig stated, quarter three was a tough quarter. Net sales were $9.2 billion compared to $10.2 billion last year, a decline of 9.4%. The change in year-over-year sales was driven by our exit from the Salt Lake City retail market, the impact of previously announced store closures, the transition to self distribution by the Target Corporation and negative 6.5 ID sales. The fall in identical store sales was attributable to a 2% decline in customer count and a 4.5% drop in average basket size.So what makes up the 4.5%? Consistent with my comments on our second quarter, the quarter 3 transaction size was again impacted by high levels of deflation, accelerating by 40 basis points over quarter two to approximately 1.2% in quarter three. Deflation was most pronounced in the dairy and produce categories. Trade down remained a factor as customers continue to look for ways to stretch their shopping dollars. Overall, we estimate the impact of trade down was about 100 basis points. One favorable side effect of this behavior was improved penetration of our own brand products, which increased slightly to 17.6% of sales, and now represent 21% of total units sold. Initial fourth quarter data shows continued improvements in own brand penetration, highlighting our merchants' increased focused on first tier label. We continue to see approximately one half item less per transaction. This trend was driven by the same factors I spoke to last quarter, mainly consumers' adherence to shopping lists and a reduced willingness to add impulse items to their baskets.Lastly, to comment on the change in customer count to negative 2% in quarter three, we were not surprised to see this slight decrease over the quarter two run rate of 70 basis points, as it is the direct result of our decision to eliminate ineffective promotions. Our ID sales guidance for full year F10 is approximately negative 5%, as the fourth quarter is trending comparable to the third quarter.Turning to operating earnings, we delivered good results despite a challenging environment. Excluding one-time items in both periods, retail food operating earnings were 3.5% of sales in the third quarter compared to 3.9% a year earlier. Supply chain operating earnings were 3.1% of sales in the third quarter compared to 3.0% a year earlier. Let me provide some additional detail on these results beginning with retail food. The 40 basis point change in operating earnings is composed of a 10 basis point decline in gross margin and a 30 basis point increase in expenses as a percentage of sales.The gross margin rate during the quarter primarily reflected price and promotional investments, which were partially offset by a lower LIFO charge. The gross margin rate was down only slightly to last year, as we did a good job balancing our promotional spending during the highly promotional holiday period. On the expense side, the largest driver of the 30 basis point increase was lower sales. Yes, expense reductions were a focus during the quarter and excellent progress was made. However, these results were not sufficient to offset reduced sales leverage.I would like to share various initiatives on which we are currently working to improve SUPERVALU's cost structure as we strive to achieve the 50 basis point selling and administrative reduction we had targeted for the long term. First, workforce productivity. So far this year, metrics per ton per item and time per customer, as well as overtime hours improved concurrent with front-end customer satisfaction scores.Next, reductions in store capital cost. Both traditional and hard discount remodel costs are down an average of 10% to 30%. We are also driving lower energy consumption. Energy costs are down 2% through efforts that include lighting retrofits and the installation of case curtains to reduce cold air loss during off hours.And finally, we are reducing in-store costs. We are leveraging SUPERVALU's scale to save dollars in procuring goods and services not offered for resale including floor maintenance, in-store product demos, bags and print services.I do want to also comment that our supply chain team did an excellent job managing operations in the quarter and posted a 10 basis point improvement in operating margin as a percent of sales year-over-year. Efficiency initiatives fully offset the completion of Target's previously announced transition of certain volumes to self [ph] distribution. As well as in the third quarter, we saw at the cumulative benefits of standardization of our distribution centers, the consolidation of East Coast operations and the mechanization of our Lancaster facility.Let me now turn to our financial condition starting with capital spending. This quarter we opened one new traditional store, our Shaw's Chestnut Hill location, which Craig spoke to on our last quarter call, and it is off to a great start. And we completed 24 major store remodels. At the end of quarter three, almost 70% of our stores were either new or newly remodeled within the past seven years and we expect to finish the fiscal year close to this level.This morning's release provided guidance on fiscal '11 capital, which includes new customer facing initiatives designed to drive sales. We commented last quarter that we are now comfortable with the overall condition of our facilities and consistent with our customer-focus vision, are now turning our attention to new merchandising activities within the four walls of our stores. We expect to cut well over 300 locations in fiscal '11 with these activities, allowing us to be locally relevant with compelling differentiated offerings, yet not requiring the level of capital investments captured in our seven-year metric.It is particularly exciting for me to share the coming year's capital plan, which doubles the number of Save-A-Lot store to openings relative to fiscal '10, as we begin the task of doubling the size of our hard discount format. Since we launched this growth objective late in October, I have met personally with a number of Save-A-Lot licensees in their respective markets to learn about their businesses, understand their growth objectives and hear what we can do to support their growth. We are confident with our new focus on Save-A-Lot growth, that we will achieve 100 openings in fiscal '11.Turning to the balance sheet, SUPERVALU remains on plan to reduce debt by $700 million in this fiscal year. In fact, year-to-date through last week, we reduced total debt by $580 million and have reduced over $1.6 billion in total debt since our acquisition of Albertsons in 2006. We remain in compliance with our debt covenant, including the most restrictive levels that take effect as of the end of the fiscal year. For the trailing 12 months, EBIT, excluding impairment and non-operating charges, totaled $1.4 billion. Depreciation and amortization was $1.0 billion. Net rent expense was $0.4 billion and total debt, including capital leases, was $8.2 billion, reflecting the typical seasonal borrowing peak.We finished the third quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in total borrowing capacity available to us under our revolving credit in AR facilities. As we look towards future debt maturities, we have sufficient cash flow and available borrowing capacity to meet our fiscal '11 obligations, which total approximately $1.2 billion. Our senior credit facility expires in June of fiscal '12. As we think about replacing this facility, we recognize that today's credit markets indicate less favorable rates than we presently have.We are actively engaged with our banking partners to determine the appropriate time and manner to replace the facility and would expect it to reflect terms indicative of our strong cash flows. As you likely recall, when we announced the exit of the Salt Lake City retail market, we stated that the overall impact of the transaction would be negligible to our results. As a recap, we did record approximately $0.04 of impairment charges in the second quarter. The transaction closed in the third quarter, netting a $0.06 gain, and we expect an additional $0.01 in exit cost in the fourth quarter for a full year favorable net impact of $0.01.We affirm fiscal '10 guidance for net earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.95 to $2.05 on a GAAP basis and $2.01 to $2.11 on an adjusted basis when excluding costs related primarily to previously announced store closures. Based on this outlook, our fourth quarter GAAP earnings guidance is a $0.56 to $0.66 per diluted share and compares to adjusted earnings of $0.81 in the fourth quarter of last year, which excludes $0.06 for the 53rd week.In April, as we have traditionally done in the past, we will provide guidance for fiscal '11 sales and earnings per share as well as our debt-reduction target. And as promised last quarter, we will also provide additional disclosures in terms of operating metrics and market shares to improve transparency into our Retail, Hard Discount and Wholesale businesses.Let me close by saying that the balance of this year will be challenging. We made real progress in the third quarter in stabilizing our margins and we remain focused on retail basics to better meet the evolving needs of our customers. I look forward to updating you in April on our fourth quarter results and our outlook for fiscal '11. I will now open up the call for your questions, and following Q&A, Craig will provide some closing remarks. Thank you."

And we see continued positive feedback from customers. The customer scores I referred to earlier, that's customers telling us what they think of us. It's not an internal thing.

What I said in my script and I really believe, I love the pace at which I see this company moving. SUPERVALU associates have embraced this idea and we're moving at a very vast cliff. But this is going to take some time for us to both execute the programs and then once they get executed, have our customers really sort of see the breadth of that which we're doing. So I can point to one-off situations, John, where we've address the pricing thing, but that might not be enough to change customer behavior. It's only when she sees that change across a broad range of categories in our stores. The fixing of the bathroom tissue category is incredibly important for us. But it alone won't change customer perception nor will it change operational efficiency enough to matter. But if I do that in a bunch of categories, and I will, and I will do so in the next 15 months, I think that's when the customer notices and you will be able to see it then in the metrics."

I'll start with particularly with own brands, we've seen some great success as we've looked at consolidating suppliers with some of our own brand categories. And we've seen really, really good benefit and cooperation and partnership with our supplier partners, clearly, with the ones who end up getting the business. I mentioned that in some cases, we've consolidated vendors. That would clearly be in the case of some of our own brands and I'm pleased with what the own brand team is accomplishing in that area. Let me take, maybe, the case study of the bathroom tissue regarding a broad range of categories. Really, and I think we see this, we actually had a good walk through the executive team just yesterday where we looked at a number of categories where the team has actually gone through this process. Primarily, what we're seeing is not elimination of brands but elimination of redundant sizes or packs. Bathroom tissue would be a great case study here. We actually don't eliminate -- we eliminate one tertiary brand. But in all the brands that matter to our customer, we don't eliminate the brand and we did not eliminate a variety. What we eliminated maybe was a pack count because we have gotten to where we are carrying virtually every pack count available. And that caused us to be really inefficient and that we couldn't even get, in many cases, a full case on the shelf at a time, which as you know, that means I'm taking stuff to the backroom or moving it somewhere. So we sort of set some rules in place about what we have to be able to get on the shelf. And I'll tell you, when we actually looked at the shelf yesterday, the clarity for the consumer, the clarity of offering, I think, is so improved versus where we were. I don't think that consumers are going to look at it and say we've taken any choice away. In fact, I think what we look at is we now see that the consumer will look at better choice, and so that's that. On the vendor side, I guess it's a mix. When I was talking to our business development managers yesterday, I think the vendors, the bigger, the better ones, they know we have to do this. I've actually talked to a couple of the CEOs. I wouldn't lie to you and say that they're comfortable, but I would say that they know we have to do this. They understand that we've gotten to where we're inefficient. And I think to the degree that we are partnering with them, they are embracing this and saying, ""Look, what we can actually do is sell more product because we'll be in stock on the weekends. We'll be in stock at 4:00 on Saturday afternoon and Sunday afternoon and we'll have the right brands that the consumer is looking for."" And so ultimately, this will be a win. So I hope I've answered the question there."

So I think we accomplished both opening stores that we think matter in this environment and going forward, and we've spoken about that. I think we can continue to update our traditional retail stores with appropriate customer-facing initiatives that I think will matter to our customers, and that's important to us. And as Pam said, I think we have a robust program to ensure that our physical plans are up to date. And then finally, even as Scott alluded to just a moment ago, I think we have a built-in capacity with our supply chain that allows us to grow our business without necessarily having to invest in new, physical assets in the near term and still allow us to grow as we get more efficient and sweat those assets even further."

We need to execute on the simple blocking and tackling, offering the right merchandise relevant to neighborhoods we serve at a fair price.

As you read in this morning's release, SUPERVALU reported earnings per share of $0.62 in the fourth quarter before one-time items, and $2.03 for the full year. All in all, I'm pleased with our fourth quarter results, and would say that we've accomplished a lot, not the least of which was delivering on the earnings and beating the debt reduction guidance provided at the end of the first quarter shortly after I joined the company.
I want to start the call by emphasizing that we're making steady progress, streamlining operations, taking expenses out of the business, and meeting our financial plans despite a challenging economic and competitive environment. Consumer spending and buying habits are changing due to the prolonged economic recovery. Today, the majority of my prepared remarks will focus on the strategic actions that SUPERVALU is taking in fiscal '11 to become a more effective retailer, more intently focused on meeting the needs of our customers, and positioned for a long term financial success.
I'd like to briefly recap the significant accomplishments of the fourth quarter as strategically it was an important time for us. First, we've completely redesigned the role of our store leadership to fully reflect that our store directors, more than anyone else, have the ability to positively influence the shopping experience. In the past, too much of the store director's time was spent on administrative task.
Second, we've also refined and aligned our marketing and merchandising organizations. The lion's share of our better merchant and marketing teams representing nearly 75% of our sales no matter where they reside physically now report to our centralized leadership team here in Minneapolis.
Third, we optimized 10 major center store categories across all of our traditional retail stores. In doing so, we moved with pace, completing these resets in record time. On average, we've removed about 20% of the FTUs from each category. We also exited 26 general merchandise categories that were not core to our customer focus, items such as fragrances, automotive accessories, and everyday electronics. These efforts contributed to lower year-end inventory levels.
Fourth, in private brands, we corrected pricing and imposed new shelf placement disciplines company-wide.
Fifth, we've opened 22 new Save-A-Lot stores during the quarter, and will accelerate this growth rate with 100 new locations planned for fiscal '11.
Sixth, during the quarter, we sold 15 Shaw stores in Connecticut, most recently, announced our exit from the Cincinnati market. A great family operated grocer, Remke Markets, who has been in the food business for over a century, agreed to purchase seven of our bigg's locations. As part of this deal, SUPERVALU will continue to supply the bigg's stores that Remke operates, and will supply Remke's existing seven stores. All told, this is a great example of SUPERVALU leveraging its relationship and expertise to execute as America's neighborhood grocer.
Seventh, we paid down $545 million in debt during the quarter, exceeding our debt reduction goal by nearly $150 million for the year.
Eighth, we launched the replacement of our credit facility, which was successfully completed earlier this month. This milestone should remove any questions about our financial flexibility.
Lastly, but of critical importance, I have filled out my management team. I now have the right people in the right jobs, each with a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities. On our last earnings call, I shared with you the addition of Steve Jungmann, EVP of merchandising. Steve's drive and leadership have already been felt throughout the organization. And we are reshaping the way that we work with our suppliers as well as with our vendors. He's been working in partnership with our vendors to bring value to customers and improve return of investment for all parties.
Julie Dexter Berg, our chief marketing officer has been on board for four weeks. She is a true marketer, and has a long career forging strong customer connections, improving brand help, and driving improvements in operations performance. During the course of the year, I look forward to sharing with you Julie's impact and the accomplishments of her team.
Finally, earlier this month, we announced the hiring of our chief information officer. Wayne Shurts will join SUPERVALU next week, and will lead us through the full integration of our corporate systems. Most recently, Wayne served as the global CIO for Cadbury. His contributions will allow SUPERVALU to gain the functionality of state of the art marketing and merchandising systems, and move us to a fully centralized technology platform. I can't tell you how pleased I am to have been able to assemble an executive team with professionals I have confidence in, who share my vision for this company's future, and I know will get the job done.
Now that I shared some of the more recent accomplishment, you can see that the fourth quarter was a very productive period for SUPERVALU. We made significant headway in refocusing on the costumer, streamlining functions throughout the organization, assessing our market position, on-boarding new leadership, and improving our balance sheet. As I look forward to fiscal '11, my executive team will have a handful of priorities. In discussing these, I'd like to underscore the deliberate actions we are taking to improve operations and become a more relevant retailer.
The broadest initiative and the one that I am most excited about is what we call Project SHE, which stands simply for Simplify Her Experience. The SHE initiative has many components, will evolve several years, and will fundamentally alter the shopping experience for our customers. Consistent with my vision, Project SHE will allow us to improve our relevance to our customers in their neighborhoods by leveraging our brand equity while maintaining all the advantage of our national scale.
We are in the first stages of this multi-year initiative, all focused on dramatically enhancing the shopability of our stores, not only making them customer friendly, but also simplifying the retail experience. Activities in this past year have many facets and include SKU rationalization of creative displays, compelling product adjacencies, and clear signage. All will heighten our focus on customer engagement and bolster our local relevance. We will be more effective in capital spending as we redefine the in-store experience and redesign it with her in mind.
Our fiscal '11 capital plan contemplates rolling out initial basis of SHE to approximately 300 stores. Needless to say, you'll hear more detail on this in the coming months as we touch and learn from early implementations and roll these out across our retail network.
Now you remain a top of mind to today's drift conscious consumer. SUPERVALU will continue to invest in price, call out value, and promote its private brands. While internal metrics in third party surveys confirmed that we are competitively priced relative to traditional retail peers, this does not mean that we will stop pursuing opportunities to lower price for a good retailer price investment never ends.
As I previously commented, the vast majority of our marketing and merchandising functions at the banner level have been centralized with our enterprise team in Minneapolis. This step creates a single unified touch point between SUPERVALU and the vendor community, which enables us to capture the benefits of national scale while maintaining the flexibility to tailor our approach at the local level. We already know that this alignment eliminated many of the complexities and extra costs that vendors incurred in servicing our company. This improvements, combined with our purchasing clout, will reduce the cost of goods, which as I see it is the single largest opportunity for SUPERVALU to bring greater value to its customers.
The merchandising team under Steve's leadership is already moving aggressively on this front. These efforts will give us more flexibility to invest in price and provide even greater value to our customers. With this new structure, we'll also see more effective promotional programs as well as more consistent store-level execution across our banners. As a company, our goal is to simplify how we go to market for our customers, vendors, and employees. I firmly believe our ability to deliver our programs, facilitate strategic objectives, and drive sales will fundamentally change the way our vendors and partners view us.
In fact, later this quarter, we will leverage the strength of our 4,300 store network to execute multiple national sales events with our vendor partners. Our network of stores is larger than any traditional grocer. This is a big deal for us and an indication of things to come. Our near term goal is to make our product offering more relevant for our customers and deliver on the value proposition in service they expect. The good news here is that our marketing, merchandising, operating teams are coordinated and focused. A good partnership has been established among Steve, Julie, Pete, and Janel. And their organizations are moving with a sense of urgency and speed capitalizing on early wins and incorporating learnings as we continue to test, refine, and roll out new operational initiatives.
SUPERVALU's private brand offering is another unrealized opportunity for the company. We have aggressively negotiated new company-wide sourcing agreements to achieve cost reductions. For example, in a popular beverage category, we've realized savings in the mid-single-digit millions, which will lower the base price of this product and improve our margin.
Already in the first quarter, we're aggressively promoting the marketing and value of our private brands to shoppers. We have in-source spender negotiations as well as research and analysis with the objective of developing and maintaining a direct relationship with our private brand vendors. And just last week, we embedded private brand personnel within the category teams, which I believe is critical to the success of overall category management. I believe these changes will place a more appropriate emphasis on our private brands and allow us to better control our destiny. I challenge our merchandising team to increase private brand sales penetration by more then 200 basis points in fiscal '11. This puts our year-end sales mix target at just over 20%.
Reducing shrink and improving workforce productivity remained focal points for SUPERVALU. In fiscal '11, we plan to make further improvements to simplify shelf stocking, minimize backroom inventory, and reduce the frequency with which product is handled. Each of these activities will ultimately drive improvements in shrink.
We've also began a series of initiatives that will adjust hours of operation, improve staffing levels in service department during peak hours, and reallocate store personnel to customer phasing activities. As I stated before, our goal is to reduce corporate S&A cost by at least 50 basis points. In fiscal '10, our progress towards this goal was masked by soft sales that we put many of the necessary disciplines in place. As of now, we expect to get to a run rate in fiscal '13 that meets our target.
Our expansion in Save-A-Lot is well on track. With100 stores in this year's pipeline, we are developing the internal expertise and skills to ramp up to a pace that will allow us to more than double in five years. Our newest Save-A-Lot stores are doing quite well, with sales averaging 10% above our internal projections, and initial capital costs 10% below our best spend rate. The Save-A-Lot team has had good success controlling capital by utilizing existing storing periods, aggressively negotiating construction bids, and leveraging internal architectural and engineering expertise.
Looking into fiscal '11, we plan to open around 15 stores in the first quarter, slightly more than that in the second and the balance of the stores in the back half of the year. I'm also excited about the prospects for our supply chain business. We've had new business coming on board this year, including over 50 new affiliations with independent customers, representing 126 total stores that joined us in the past year. Janel and her team are committed to growing our independent customer base and are actively pursuing new affiliations while they work with existing customers to grow their market relevance and share.
And finally, we continue to weave analytical discipline into our corporate DNA. Each initiative I laid out today is data driven, quantified, and time bound, and will generate considerable savings and sales growth for this company. We have also adjusted our compensation programs to appropriately align management incentives with these priorities. I'm proud of the 150,000 associates who have rededicated themselves to focus on the customer.
On that note, let me turn the call over to Pam for a discussion of our financial performance and outlook.

306013,100560789,56665,"SUPERVALU Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-20-2010",2010-04-20,"Earnings Calls","SUPERVALU INC.","Executives","Thank you, Craig, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will be covering our fourth quarter operating results, the company's financial condition, and lastly giving some color to our fiscal '11 guidance.As Craig alluded, the economy has not changed much s",2129,"Thank you, Craig, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will be covering our fourth quarter operating results, the company's financial condition, and lastly giving some color to our fiscal '11 guidance.
As Craig alluded, the economy has not changed much since we reported our quarter three results in January. Although hooded [ph] home deflation appears to have bottomed out and unemployment as reported by the federal government is not getting worse, consumer confidence still remains low. The value-seeking shopper of 2009 used 27% more coupons than in 2008, the first yearly increase since 1992. In addition, small businesses and consumers are finding credit more difficult to obtain. And finally, the housing market remains uneasy, at best.
This morning, we reported net sales for our fourth quarter for $9.2 billion, compared to $10.8 billion last year, a decrease of 14.9%. The change in year-over-year sales is predominantly the result of four items. First, the loss of last year's 53rd week, which we disclosed was approximately $800 million or approximately 50% of the decline; second, identical store sales of negative 6.8%, in line with our expectations and similar to the third quarter run rate; third, the impact from the F'09 previously announced store closures in addition to the third quarter exit from the Salt Lake City retail market; and finally, the completion of Target's previously announced plan to transition certain volumes to self-distribution.
The identical store sales of negative 6.8% reflected a 3% decrease in customer count and a 3.8% decrease in average basket size. The customer count decrease represents a slight decline from the third quarter run rate and one of Julie's top priorities is to address customer traffic. Average basket size, which did show a slight improvement of 70 basis points from a negative 4.5% third quarter figure, was influenced by factors we have talked about before, namely trade down, deflation and a number of items per order.
We estimate trade down at approximately 70 basis point in the quarter, which when combined with last year's fourth quarter and quarter four of fiscal '08, puts the three year stat at close to 300 basis points and includes higher private brands penetration, which reached nearly 80% of sales for the quarter and accounted for approximately 21% of units sold. Inflation ran at approximately negative 80 basis points. This was the third consecutive quarter that we have seen falling price levels, a reflection of both product cost deflation and our own price investment activity. The balance of the basket size decline was attributable to customers buying fewer items per visit, which again was down by roughly one-half item per order.
Moving to operating earnings, despite weak top-line sales, we delivered retail food operating earnings of 3.1% net sales, which included charges triggered by the quarter one fiscal '11 sale of our Connecticut Shaw's stores and our Cincinnati bigg's locations. Prior to these charges, operating earnings were 3.8% of net sales compared to 4.5% last year. This change was driven by loss of sales leverage on six expenses as growth margins, benefiting from a favorable LIFO credit compared to a LIFO charge last year, were up modestly.
Despite continued investment in price, gross margin reflects a slight decline in promotional mix. We had actually seen a reduction in overall units sold on promotion with an offsetting increase in units sold at the everyday retail. It is great to see our progress in fixing these pricing in balances, where we had high shelf prices on some great everyday items and therefore sold the vast majority of units on promotion.
It's good to no longer have to repeat Craig's example of a national brand of cookie that he talked about when he first arrived. I would also add that we absorbed another $0.01 in cost related to the Salt Lake City retail market exit, which brought the full year net benefit from these transactions to a positive $0.01.
Our supply chain services segment had another solid quarter. Operating earnings were 4.5% of net sales, which included these received from the early termination of our supply agreement with Ukrop. Excluding these items, operating earnings were 3.8% of net sales for the quarter, compared to 3.2% of net sales last year, and reflected both the LIFO credit and careful expense management in light of softer sales.
Turning to our financial condition, we finished the year with total outstanding debt of $7.6 billion, which represented an aggregate fiscal '10 debt reduction of approximately $850 million, exceeding our guidance by $150 million. Our FIFO inventory levels declined by over $300 million, compared to the end of fiscal '09, reflecting the initial benefit of SKU rationalization across both our retail and distribution networks and a heightened focus on managing working capital company-wide. Our inventory days supply was the lowest since we bought Albertsons in 2006.
Our debt-to-total capital ratio declined by approximately 400 basis points as we finished the year with debt, representing 73% of total capital, compared to 77% a year earlier. At year-end, we were in compliance with our debt covenants, with a trailing 12-month EBIT of $1.3 billion, excluding impairment and other non-operating charges. Depreciation and amortization for the year was $1.0 billion, and rent was $0.4 billion.
Earlier this month, we announced that we had successfully amended and extended our existing credit facility or agreement. Our agreement includes a $1.5 billion revolver with a five-year term, extends the term on $500 million of term loan B, and resets covenant levels. With this transaction, we have insured our liquidity for the coming five years.
Let me move on to provide several other disclosures. First I want to speak to SUPERVALU's market share. At our second quarter call, we committed to provide color of our top 90 DMAs or designated marketing areas. These are markets in which we generally have at least 10 stores. The market share figures that we track reflect a combined market share that includes our traditional retail stores, all stable lot locations; and, independent stores, where we are the primary supplier.
As of February, on a year-over-year basis, we either gained or held share in nearly 40% of these 90 DMAs, and lost market share in the balance. For the top 20 DMAs, which accounts for approximately two-thirds of our sales volumes, the cumulative total share loss was approximately 60 basis points. These figures capture both our ID sales performance and planned store closures, which has reduced square footage by 6.2% over the last 12 months.
Next, let me comment on our most recent store level customer satisfaction surveys, which again rose over the prior quarter. Scores for price competitiveness, staff courtesy and friendliness of our checkers, the likelihood of customers' willingness to return or recommended to others, and the quality and freshness of our perishables, all increased by approximately 100 basis points to 400 basis points. It goes without saying that we are pleased with these results. It describes the rival last spring and our company's renewed focus on the customer, shopper's responses on all four items have improved at least 400 basis points. Our perishable scores, which have been a real focus, are up nearly 900 basis points. Clearly, we are moving in the right direction and making meaningful progress toward meeting customer expectations and improving the overall shopping experience.
And last, an update on the performance of our remodels. Our first year remodel shows an average lift in the fourth quarter of about 1.5% when compared to other stores in their respective markets. Those stores that have cycled their one-year opening were up an additional 100 basis points in their second year.
Moving to the new fiscal year, we have built our plans around the expectation that the economy will continue to pressure consumer spending. This morning, we introduced fiscal '11 GAAP earnings per share guidance in the range of $1.65 to $1.85 per diluted share. This includes $0.10 of one-time costs primarily related to the fiscal '11 quarter one retail market exit in Connecticut and Cincinnati. Prior to these charges, earnings per share is forecasted to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.95 per diluted share, a decline from the $2.03 adjusted EPS we reported for fiscal '10.
I would like to spend some time commenting on our guidance and headwinds we are facing. First, all markets exited in F'10 and '11 as well as the target in Ukrop's business, were positive contributors to earnings and cash flow. Next, our new revolving credit agreement reflects the current market rate environment, which I can tell you is not as attractive as when we closed on the Albertsons deal. However, we are pleased that the pricing achieved reflects our strong cash-generating capabilities even though any borrowings will cost us roughly 60 basis points more than our previous facility.
Our plans also call for a higher LIFO charge this year if we believe inflation, albeit at a moderate rate, assumes at 1.5%, will return by the end of fiscal '11. And finally, pension expense, the company's defined benefit pension plan will increase this year compared to fiscal '10 as the implications of the financial market, having not yet fully recovered, will impact our annual expense. Therefore, the many initiatives that Craig just shared with you around sales margin and cost reduction will, collectively, almost offset these items.
How do we see fiscal '11 unfolding? We expect the identical store sales run rate to improve across fiscal '11. It still will be approximately negative 2% for the full year. By the fourth quarter, we believe total company IDs will be flat to slightly positive as our marketing, merchandising, and operational initiatives build throughout the year. Included in total company IDs is our assumption for positive ID sales from our corporately-owned Save-A-Lot stores.
From a total sales perspective, keep in mind that fiscal '10 sales included bigg's, the Connecticut Shaw's stores, and Ukrop's business for the entire year as well as Salt Lake City sales through the third quarter, and the Target volume for approximately half the year. As well, we also expect ID licensee pool purchases which we call pools from our Save-A-Lot warehouses to be positive, and ID wholesale pool for our independent customers to be flat for the year. We expect to have additional gross profit dollars available to us as we negotiate better costs of goods, run more effective promotions, increase private brand penetration, and further reduce shrink. This will give us added flexibility to invest in price and bring greater value to our costumers as we look to effectively manage the balance between sales and margin.
Our fiscal '11 capital plan of $700 million, with an emphasis on remodels and in-store merchandising initiatives focused on driving sales. We are also excited with the growth initiative at Save-A-Lot, which totals 100 net new stores. We finished fiscal '10 with about 66% of our stores either new or newly remodelled within the past seven years. And we plan to remodel approximately 90 to 115 stores this year in addition to touching 300 stores with in-store merchandising initiatives.
Going forward, we will place less emphasis on this metric as we touch more stores with more (inaudible) that would not meet our remodel threshold of $500,000. We believe these customer facing capital investments will better drive sales and at the same time, we will not allow the physical condition of our facilities to deteriorate. With this capital plan, depreciation and amortization will be largely unchanged from the current run rate.
In the coming year, despite slightly lower earnings, we will again generate free cash flow to further reduce debt through prudent capital investment decisions and aggressive management of working capital. Our total debt reduction target for this year is $600 million, which when combined with the $850 million pay down we achieved in F'10, will allow us to exceed the $1.3 billion two-year expectation I spoke to at this time last year, well exceeding the debt-reduction target set as part of the Albertsons transaction. This will result in debt-to-total capital of approximately 68% by year-end
Fiscal '11 maturities total approximately $975 million. After fiscal '11, debt maturities average about $175 million over each of the next five years with the highest single year being fiscal '13 when approximately $800 million comes due. We expect the first half of fiscal '11 to be considerably more challenging than the second half based on our view of the economy and the build of our marketing, merchandising, and operational initiatives that Craig reviewed earlier. The first quarter will also be - will also include the negative impact of approximately $0.10 worth of charges, primarily related to the completion of retail market exit in Connecticut and Cincinnati.
I will now turn the call back over to Craig.

Prior to opening up the call for questions and answers, I'd like to touch upon this morning's announcement regarding the Board. After a deliberative review, the Board is making changes to its size and compositions. Actions include reducing current membership from 15 to 12 directors, adding new directors to bring perspectives - new perspectives to the Board's oversight of the company and naming a non-executive chairman. The Board believes these actions are consistent with high standards of corporate governance.
With that, I'd like to open up the call to your questions.

We've seen a significant shift, a very positive significant shift in consumer behavior to where she feels like she can buy those items everyday in our store and not simply wait for them to be on sale.
We had an item I may have talked about in the past in the bakery department. It's just a great item for us. But we had gotten (inaudible) price to be so out of whack that something in excess of 85% of our sales were only occurring when the item was on sale. We made a dramatic shift in that item. We love what we're learning from that. And we're beginning to roll that out across the various categories. But it will be a long term process, a multi-year process because we want to be thoughtful as we do it. As I said in the past, work with our vendor partners as we think about how we're costing products and how we bring value to our customers. I want to be careful that I don't make you believe that somehow because we're learning good things that we're going to change the proposition of all the items in our stores over night.

I'll tell you, Meredith, as we travel across our company and visit our great independent retailers as well as many of our owned vendors, we see amazing things happening. What Pete, and Janel, and Steve, and Julie are really working towards is capturing the Best Practices of what we already do, and do that more broadly.
And it's not dependent on system solutions. System solutions would be nice when they come. But being focused on our local customer is not dependent on a systems solution, it's dependent on having the store director be able to make the right decisions for his or her community, which I mentioned earlier I think Pete has done, is requiring that Steve and his team to build the capability to get the leverage that we have as a $40 billion retail. And we're talking to the national brand of suppliers, but at the same time making sure that the local products can be sourced locally, and that we give the opportunity to our local merchants to in fact take care of those local items.
The fact that those local merchants report into Steve's group here is, I think, very consequential. But it doesn't mean that all stores across the country are going to carry only national branded items. Our goal is to continue to be great local retailers, whether that's lost in Philadelphia or Idaho Falls.

We have a great private brand program. We've got a team here that has delivered beautiful products. But we were hiding them, quite frankly, because we were over sorted, it was very difficult for our consumers to find these products. So I mentioned we instilled disciplines today about positioning, placement, and pricing for these private brands, which I think are very, very important for our consumers who I think you all know continue to look for value. And as I've said, I think it's a new normal. I think consumers will - they changed their habits. And many consumers have learned that they liked private brands. And we want to be a great place for them to come and buy our private brand.
And finally, I think the thing that's been really good and we have just begun to see this is the efficiencies of the SKU rationalization in some of these categories where the Q of the products was quite large. We were in a situation where virtually - maybe of many years, a third to half of the items in the category, you couldn't fit a case on the shelf at a time. So that meant that every time the store ordered product, some of that product is going to the back room. That clearly is not an efficiency move for us. And we're working diligently to undue that behavior so that we can get our cost structures in mind.

And so, as I said, I think in Q2 or Q3, we are going to thoughtful and deliberative as we look to how we negotiate with our vendors, and make sure that our vendors come to us because they get a return. So we do view this as a partnership with our supplier partners. Our early resolve, I think, are quite positive. There certainly has been some challenge and discussions between that the merchants and the vendor partners as we've looked towards SKU rationalization.
But I will tell you, I've spoken personally to several of these CEOs of our large vendor partners, and they too would see the need for the SKU rationalization. They, too, see the benefit of having their strongest brand actually be in stock on the chef when the customers are in our stores, on one afternoon and fun day.
It's not been all that easy, but I think ultimately they liked that. The very fun thing I think is as I mentioned earlier, Steve has gotten on board and begun to work with all the Save-A-Lot team and the independent retailer that works with Janel, and leverages the scale of 4,300 stores. And actually, we now have a couple of events coming up this year already scheduled where we can put products in front of customers in the whole lot of grocery stores across this country, I think that's very exciting. And I think as we develop that skill set and prove to our vendor partners that we can be a place to sell products profitably, we'll see more and more benefit.

It's more than just about price at our traditional grocery stores. There is a value proposition our customers are looking for that includes the above local relevance - service that Pam spoke about. And I'm very, very proud of what our team has gotten done in the service component. While the importance to be a leader in fresh foods certainly prices a component to that, but so much more is involved in being a leader in fresh foods. And we've spoken about health and wellness.
So quite frankly, it's not just about price. Price is a component. We've talked about some of those initiatives that we will continue to work on, most importantly, private brands and some fair pricing initiatives. I don't want to leave you with the idea that we're not focusing on price this year. But we are focusing on the entire value proposition in our traditional retail stores. And then finally, with the addition of Julie Dexter Berg, we continue - we really aspire to continue to build on those great brands that have existed for so long and have relevance. And so I think there's more to this story than simply price.

In addition to making sure we're priced right, as I said before, I love the fact that what this team is now doing, particularly in the 10 categories that we've already optimized, you'll see private brand positioning much, much better than it was before. Off times, it was maybe on the bottom shelf or the lower shelves, or as one phasing. We've now put those products - we're proud of those products, so we put them front and center. We put them at eye level. We put them where you can see them. And we've given them pacing that are appropriate so the consumer can make the choice. If she wants to buy the product, if she wants to buy a brand of product, we want her to be able to buy either of those at our stores. I think that's important.
And then I guess the final piece is we increasingly are putting the appropriate items in our promotional mix. So that when consumers come to our stores, she will now and again see those products on displays. We are, at the end of the day, in most of our traditional retail stores, we are promotional merchants. And customers love to come to our stores for promotion.

I think the landscape is littered with companies who did not invest in their physical assets. And so, we will continue, as we've said in the past, to invest appropriately in our physical assets to ensure that - quite frankly, it seems like refrigeration breaks over time. They need to be replaced.
These stores get a lot of customer traffic, and particularly, if you look in places like Chicago where we have very high volume stores, you need to make sure you continue to maintain those assets, and so almost regardless of what the lift is. What I like is the fact that we are being thoughtful and deliberative, as I said, I think in the Q3 call. Instead of doing what we did in the past, which was a one size-fits-all major remodel. I think we called the premium fresh and healthy. What we're now doing is being very thoughtful. In some neighborhood and some demographics, maybe that is in fact the appropriate store, but we now have several versions of a remodel that we can go. And therefore, we don't necessarily have to have this huge lift to go in and spend that money.
So long story, but we will continue to remodel stores. I think it's part of what we must do. And then what we'll do, which is very exciting to me, is in those stores where we really don't have the need to replace the physical assets and spend all that money, but we do want to make the store feel fresher and more relevant, this is where project C comes in really handy because you can go with a fairly modest expense and make that store much more relevant to the consumer without having that big capital outlay.
But again, to make sure our store base is fresh, we will continue to make sure all of our stores or 70% of our stores are remodeled between seven and eight years. So we need to make sure that we keep spending that money.

As you read in this morning's release, SUPERVALU reported earnings per share of $0.62 in the fourth quarter before one-time items, and $2.03 for the full year. All in all, I'm pleased with our fourth quarter results, and would say that we've accomplished a lot, not the least of which was delivering on the earnings and beating the debt reduction guidance provided at the end of the first quarter shortly after I joined the company.
 I want to start the call by emphasizing that we're making steady progress, streamlining operations, taking expenses out of the business, and meeting our financial plans despite a challenging economic and competitive environment. Consumer spending and buying habits are changing due to the prolonged economic recovery. Today, the majority of my prepared remarks will focus on the strategic actions that SUPERVALU is taking in fiscal '11 to become a more effective retailer, more intently focused on meeting the needs of our customers, and positioned for a long term financial success.
 I'd like to briefly recap the significant accomplishments of the fourth quarter as strategically it was an important time for us. First, we've completely redesigned the role of our store leadership to fully reflect that our store directors, more than anyone else, have the ability to positively influence the shopping experience. In the past, too much of the store director's time was spent on administrative task.
 Second, we've also refined and aligned our marketing and merchandising organizations. The lion's share of our better merchant and marketing teams representing nearly 75% of our sales no matter where they reside physically now report to our centralized leadership team here in Minneapolis.
 Third, we optimized 10 major center store categories across all of our traditional retail stores. In doing so, we moved with pace, completing these resets in record time. On average, we've removed about 20% of the FTUs from each category. We also exited 26 general merchandise categories that were not core to our customer focus, items such as fragrances, automotive accessories, and everyday electronics. These efforts contributed to lower year-end inventory levels.
 Fourth, in private brands, we corrected pricing and imposed new shelf placement disciplines company-wide.
 Fifth, we've opened 22 new Save-A-Lot stores during the quarter, and will accelerate this growth rate with 100 new locations planned for fiscal '11.
 Sixth, during the quarter, we sold 15 Shaw stores in Connecticut, most recently, announced our exit from the Cincinnati market. A great family operated grocer, Remke Markets, who has been in the food business for over a century, agreed to purchase seven of our bigg's locations. As part of this deal, SUPERVALU will continue to supply the bigg's stores that Remke operates, and will supply Remke's existing seven stores. All told, this is a great example of SUPERVALU leveraging its relationship and expertise to execute as America's neighborhood grocer.
 Seventh, we paid down $545 million in debt during the quarter, exceeding our debt reduction goal by nearly $150 million for the year.
 Eighth, we launched the replacement of our credit facility, which was successfully completed earlier this month. This milestone should remove any questions about our financial flexibility.
 Lastly, but of critical importance, I have filled out my management team. I now have the right people in the right jobs, each with a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities. On our last earnings call, I shared with you the addition of Steve Jungmann, EVP of merchandising. Steve's drive and leadership have already been felt throughout the organization. And we are reshaping the way that we work with our suppliers as well as with our vendors. He's been working in partnership with our vendors to bring value to customers and improve return of investment for all parties.
 Julie Dexter Berg, our chief marketing officer has been on board for four weeks. She is a true marketer, and has a long career forging strong customer connections, improving brand help, and driving improvements in operations performance. During the course of the year, I look forward to sharing with you Julie's impact and the accomplishments of her team.
 Finally, earlier this month, we announced the hiring of our chief information officer. Wayne Shurts will join SUPERVALU next week, and will lead us through the full integration of our corporate systems. Most recently, Wayne served as the global CIO for Cadbury. His contributions will allow SUPERVALU to gain the functionality of state of the art marketing and merchandising systems, and move us to a fully centralized technology platform. I can't tell you how pleased I am to have been able to assemble an executive team with professionals I have confidence in, who share my vision for this company's future, and I know will get the job done.
 Now that I shared some of the more recent accomplishment, you can see that the fourth quarter was a very productive period for SUPERVALU. We made significant headway in refocusing on the costumer, streamlining functions throughout the organization, assessing our market position, on-boarding new leadership, and improving our balance sheet. As I look forward to fiscal '11, my executive team will have a handful of priorities. In discussing these, I'd like to underscore the deliberate actions we are taking to improve operations and become a more relevant retailer.
 The broadest initiative and the one that I am most excited about is what we call Project SHE, which stands simply for Simplify Her Experience. The SHE initiative has many components, will evolve several years, and will fundamentally alter the shopping experience for our customers. Consistent with my vision, Project SHE will allow us to improve our relevance to our customers in their neighborhoods by leveraging our brand equity while maintaining all the advantage of our national scale.
 We are in the first stages of this multi-year initiative, all focused on dramatically enhancing the shopability of our stores, not only making them customer friendly, but also simplifying the retail experience. Activities in this past year have many facets and include SKU rationalization of creative displays, compelling product adjacencies, and clear signage. All will heighten our focus on customer engagement and bolster our local relevance. We will be more effective in capital spending as we redefine the in-store experience and redesign it with her in mind.
 Our fiscal '11 capital plan contemplates rolling out initial basis of SHE to approximately 300 stores. Needless to say, you'll hear more detail on this in the coming months as we touch and learn from early implementations and roll these out across our retail network.
 Now you remain a top of mind to today's drift conscious consumer. SUPERVALU will continue to invest in price, call out value, and promote its private brands. While internal metrics in third party surveys confirmed that we are competitively priced relative to traditional retail peers, this does not mean that we will stop pursuing opportunities to lower price for a good retailer price investment never ends.
 As I previously commented, the vast majority of our marketing and merchandising functions at the banner level have been centralized with our enterprise team in Minneapolis. This step creates a single unified touch point between SUPERVALU and the vendor community, which enables us to capture the benefits of national scale while maintaining the flexibility to tailor our approach at the local level. We already know that this alignment eliminated many of the complexities and extra costs that vendors incurred in servicing our company. This improvements, combined with our purchasing clout, will reduce the cost of goods, which as I see it is the single largest opportunity for SUPERVALU to bring greater value to its customers.
 The merchandising team under Steve's leadership is already moving aggressively on this front. These efforts will give us more flexibility to invest in price and provide even greater value to our customers. With this new structure, we'll also see more effective promotional programs as well as more consistent store-level execution across our banners. As a company, our goal is to simplify how we go to market for our customers, vendors, and employees. I firmly believe our ability to deliver our programs, facilitate strategic objectives, and drive sales will fundamentally change the way our vendors and partners view us.
 In fact, later this quarter, we will leverage the strength of our 4,300 store network to execute multiple national sales events with our vendor partners. Our network of stores is larger than any traditional grocer. This is a big deal for us and an indication of things to come. Our near term goal is to make our product offering more relevant for our customers and deliver on the value proposition in service they expect. The good news here is that our marketing, merchandising, operating teams are coordinated and focused. A good partnership has been established among Steve, Julie, Pete, and Janel. And their organizations are moving with a sense of urgency and speed capitalizing on early wins and incorporating learnings as we continue to test, refine, and roll out new operational initiatives.
 SUPERVALU's private brand offering is another unrealized opportunity for the company. We have aggressively negotiated new company-wide sourcing agreements to achieve cost reductions. For example, in a popular beverage category, we've realized savings in the mid-single-digit millions, which will lower the base price of this product and improve our margin.
 Already in the first quarter, we're aggressively promoting the marketing and value of our private brands to shoppers. We have in-source spender negotiations as well as research and analysis with the objective of developing and maintaining a direct relationship with our private brand vendors. And just last week, we embedded private brand personnel within the category teams, which I believe is critical to the success of overall category management. I believe these changes will place a more appropriate emphasis on our private brands and allow us to better control our destiny. I challenge our merchandising team to increase private brand sales penetration by more then 200 basis points in fiscal '11. This puts our year-end sales mix target at just over 20%.
 Reducing shrink and improving workforce productivity remained focal points for SUPERVALU. In fiscal '11, we plan to make further improvements to simplify shelf stocking, minimize backroom inventory, and reduce the frequency with which product is handled. Each of these activities will ultimately drive improvements in shrink.
 We've also began a series of initiatives that will adjust hours of operation, improve staffing levels in service department during peak hours, and reallocate store personnel to customer phasing activities. As I stated before, our goal is to reduce corporate S&A cost by at least 50 basis points. In fiscal '10, our progress towards this goal was masked by soft sales that we put many of the necessary disciplines in place. As of now, we expect to get to a run rate in fiscal '13 that meets our target.
 Our expansion in Save-A-Lot is well on track. With100 stores in this year's pipeline, we are developing the internal expertise and skills to ramp up to a pace that will allow us to more than double in five years. Our newest Save-A-Lot stores are doing quite well, with sales averaging 10% above our internal projections, and initial capital costs 10% below our best spend rate. The Save-A-Lot team has had good success controlling capital by utilizing existing storing periods, aggressively negotiating construction bids, and leveraging internal architectural and engineering expertise.
 Looking into fiscal '11, we plan to open around 15 stores in the first quarter, slightly more than that in the second and the balance of the stores in the back half of the year. I'm also excited about the prospects for our supply chain business. We've had new business coming on board this year, including over 50 new affiliations with independent customers, representing 126 total stores that joined us in the past year. Janel and her team are committed to growing our independent customer base and are actively pursuing new affiliations while they work with existing customers to grow their market relevance and share.
 And finally, we continue to weave analytical discipline into our corporate DNA. Each initiative I laid out today is data driven, quantified, and time bound, and will generate considerable savings and sales growth for this company. We have also adjusted our compensation programs to appropriately align management incentives with these priorities. I'm proud of the 150,000 associates who have rededicated themselves to focus on the customer.
 On that note, let me turn the call over to Pam for a discussion of our financial performance and outlook.

Today, I will be covering our fourth quarter operating results, the company's financial condition, and lastly giving some color to our fiscal '11 guidance. As Craig alluded, the economy has not changed much",2129," Thank you, Craig, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will be covering our fourth quarter operating results, the company's financial condition, and lastly giving some color to our fiscal '11 guidance.
 As Craig alluded, the economy has not changed much since we reported our quarter three results in January. Although hooded [ph] home deflation appears to have bottomed out and unemployment as reported by the federal government is not getting worse, consumer confidence still remains low. The value-seeking shopper of 2009 used 27% more coupons than in 2008, the first yearly increase since 1992. In addition, small businesses and consumers are finding credit more difficult to obtain. And finally, the housing market remains uneasy, at best.
 This morning, we reported net sales for our fourth quarter for $9.2 billion, compared to $10.8 billion last year, a decrease of 14.9%. The change in year-over-year sales is predominantly the result of four items. First, the loss of last year's 53rd week, which we disclosed was approximately $800 million or approximately 50% of the decline; second, identical store sales of negative 6.8%, in line with our expectations and similar to the third quarter run rate; third, the impact from the F'09 previously announced store closures in addition to the third quarter exit from the Salt Lake City retail market; and finally, the completion of Target's previously announced plan to transition certain volumes to self-distribution.
 The identical store sales of negative 6.8% reflected a 3% decrease in customer count and a 3.8% decrease in average basket size. The customer count decrease represents a slight decline from the third quarter run rate and one of Julie's top priorities is to address customer traffic. Average basket size, which did show a slight improvement of 70 basis points from a negative 4.5% third quarter figure, was influenced by factors we have talked about before, namely trade down, deflation and a number of items per order.
 We estimate trade down at approximately 70 basis point in the quarter, which when combined with last year's fourth quarter and quarter four of fiscal '08, puts the three year stat at close to 300 basis points and includes higher private brands penetration, which reached nearly 80% of sales for the quarter and accounted for approximately 21% of units sold. Inflation ran at approximately negative 80 basis points. This was the third consecutive quarter that we have seen falling price levels, a reflection of both product cost deflation and our own price investment activity. The balance of the basket size decline was attributable to customers buying fewer items per visit, which again was down by roughly one-half item per order.
 Moving to operating earnings, despite weak top-line sales, we delivered retail food operating earnings of 3.1% net sales, which included charges triggered by the quarter one fiscal '11 sale of our Connecticut Shaw's stores and our Cincinnati bigg's locations. Prior to these charges, operating earnings were 3.8% of net sales compared to 4.5% last year. This change was driven by loss of sales leverage on six expenses as growth margins, benefiting from a favorable LIFO credit compared to a LIFO charge last year, were up modestly.
 Despite continued investment in price, gross margin reflects a slight decline in promotional mix. We had actually seen a reduction in overall units sold on promotion with an offsetting increase in units sold at the everyday retail. It is great to see our progress in fixing these pricing in balances, where we had high shelf prices on some great everyday items and therefore sold the vast majority of units on promotion.
 It's good to no longer have to repeat Craig's example of a national brand of cookie that he talked about when he first arrived. I would also add that we absorbed another $0.01 in cost related to the Salt Lake City retail market exit, which brought the full year net benefit from these transactions to a positive $0.01.
 Our supply chain services segment had another solid quarter. Operating earnings were 4.5% of net sales, which included these received from the early termination of our supply agreement with Ukrop. Excluding these items, operating earnings were 3.8% of net sales for the quarter, compared to 3.2% of net sales last year, and reflected both the LIFO credit and careful expense management in light of softer sales.
 Turning to our financial condition, we finished the year with total outstanding debt of $7.6 billion, which represented an aggregate fiscal '10 debt reduction of approximately $850 million, exceeding our guidance by $150 million. Our FIFO inventory levels declined by over $300 million, compared to the end of fiscal '09, reflecting the initial benefit of SKU rationalization across both our retail and distribution networks and a heightened focus on managing working capital company-wide. Our inventory days supply was the lowest since we bought Albertsons in 2006.
 Our debt-to-total capital ratio declined by approximately 400 basis points as we finished the year with debt, representing 73% of total capital, compared to 77% a year earlier. At year-end, we were in compliance with our debt covenants, with a trailing 12-month EBIT of $1.3 billion, excluding impairment and other non-operating charges. Depreciation and amortization for the year was $1.0 billion, and rent was $0.4 billion.
 Earlier this month, we announced that we had successfully amended and extended our existing credit facility or agreement. Our agreement includes a $1.5 billion revolver with a five-year term, extends the term on $500 million of term loan B, and resets covenant levels. With this transaction, we have insured our liquidity for the coming five years.
 Let me move on to provide several other disclosures. First I want to speak to SUPERVALU's market share. At our second quarter call, we committed to provide color of our top 90 DMAs or designated marketing areas. These are markets in which we generally have at least 10 stores. The market share figures that we track reflect a combined market share that includes our traditional retail stores, all stable lot locations; and, independent stores, where we are the primary supplier.
 As of February, on a year-over-year basis, we either gained or held share in nearly 40% of these 90 DMAs, and lost market share in the balance. For the top 20 DMAs, which accounts for approximately two-thirds of our sales volumes, the cumulative total share loss was approximately 60 basis points. These figures capture both our ID sales performance and planned store closures, which has reduced square footage by 6.2% over the last 12 months.
 Next, let me comment on our most recent store level customer satisfaction surveys, which again rose over the prior quarter. Scores for price competitiveness, staff courtesy and friendliness of our checkers, the likelihood of customers' willingness to return or recommended to others, and the quality and freshness of our perishables, all increased by approximately 100 basis points to 400 basis points. It goes without saying that we are pleased with these results. It describes the rival last spring and our company's renewed focus on the customer, shopper's responses on all four items have improved at least 400 basis points. Our perishable scores, which have been a real focus, are up nearly 900 basis points. Clearly, we are moving in the right direction and making meaningful progress toward meeting customer expectations and improving the overall shopping experience.
 And last, an update on the performance of our remodels. Our first year remodel shows an average lift in the fourth quarter of about 1.5% when compared to other stores in their respective markets. Those stores that have cycled their one-year opening were up an additional 100 basis points in their second year.
 Moving to the new fiscal year, we have built our plans around the expectation that the economy will continue to pressure consumer spending. This morning, we introduced fiscal '11 GAAP earnings per share guidance in the range of $1.65 to $1.85 per diluted share. This includes $0.10 of one-time costs primarily related to the fiscal '11 quarter one retail market exit in Connecticut and Cincinnati. Prior to these charges, earnings per share is forecasted to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.95 per diluted share, a decline from the $2.03 adjusted EPS we reported for fiscal '10.
 I would like to spend some time commenting on our guidance and headwinds we are facing. First, all markets exited in F'10 and '11 as well as the target in Ukrop's business, were positive contributors to earnings and cash flow. Next, our new revolving credit agreement reflects the current market rate environment, which I can tell you is not as attractive as when we closed on the Albertsons deal. However, we are pleased that the pricing achieved reflects our strong cash-generating capabilities even though any borrowings will cost us roughly 60 basis points more than our previous facility.
 Our plans also call for a higher LIFO charge this year if we believe inflation, albeit at a moderate rate, assumes at 1.5%, will return by the end of fiscal '11. And finally, pension expense, the company's defined benefit pension plan will increase this year compared to fiscal '10 as the implications of the financial market, having not yet fully recovered, will impact our annual expense. Therefore, the many initiatives that Craig just shared with you around sales margin and cost reduction will, collectively, almost offset these items.
 How do we see fiscal '11 unfolding? We expect the identical store sales run rate to improve across fiscal '11. It still will be approximately negative 2% for the full year. By the fourth quarter, we believe total company IDs will be flat to slightly positive as our marketing, merchandising, and operational initiatives build throughout the year. Included in total company IDs is our assumption for positive ID sales from our corporately-owned Save-A-Lot stores.
 From a total sales perspective, keep in mind that fiscal '10 sales included bigg's, the Connecticut Shaw's stores, and Ukrop's business for the entire year as well as Salt Lake City sales through the third quarter, and the Target volume for approximately half the year. As well, we also expect ID licensee pool purchases which we call pools from our Save-A-Lot warehouses to be positive, and ID wholesale pool for our independent customers to be flat for the year. We expect to have additional gross profit dollars available to us as we negotiate better costs of goods, run more effective promotions, increase private brand penetration, and further reduce shrink. This will give us added flexibility to invest in price and bring greater value to our costumers as we look to effectively manage the balance between sales and margin.
 Our fiscal '11 capital plan of $700 million, with an emphasis on remodels and in-store merchandising initiatives focused on driving sales. We are also excited with the growth initiative at Save-A-Lot, which totals 100 net new stores. We finished fiscal '10 with about 66% of our stores either new or newly remodelled within the past seven years. And we plan to remodel approximately 90 to 115 stores this year in addition to touching 300 stores with in-store merchandising initiatives.
 Going forward, we will place less emphasis on this metric as we touch more stores with more (inaudible) that would not meet our remodel threshold of $500,000. We believe these customer facing capital investments will better drive sales and at the same time, we will not allow the physical condition of our facilities to deteriorate. With this capital plan, depreciation and amortization will be largely unchanged from the current run rate.
 In the coming year, despite slightly lower earnings, we will again generate free cash flow to further reduce debt through prudent capital investment decisions and aggressive management of working capital. Our total debt reduction target for this year is $600 million, which when combined with the $850 million pay down we achieved in F'10, will allow us to exceed the $1.3 billion two-year expectation I spoke to at this time last year, well exceeding the debt-reduction target set as part of the Albertsons transaction. This will result in debt-to-total capital of approximately 68% by year-end
 Fiscal '11 maturities total approximately $975 million. After fiscal '11, debt maturities average about $175 million over each of the next five years with the highest single year being fiscal '13 when approximately $800 million comes due. We expect the first half of fiscal '11 to be considerably more challenging than the second half based on our view of the economy and the build of our marketing, merchandising, and operational initiatives that Craig reviewed earlier. The first quarter will also be – will also include the negative impact of approximately $0.10 worth of charges, primarily related to the completion of retail market exit in Connecticut and Cincinnati.
 I will now turn the call back over to Craig.

Our renewed focus on consumers, strengthen merchandising and marketing capabilities, strict capital discipline, and an unrelenting focus on cost reduction are the priorities for fiscal '11 that will position us for growth at fiscal '12 and beyond.
 Prior to opening up the call for questions and answers, I'd like to touch upon this morning's announcement regarding the Board. After a deliberative review, the Board is making changes to its size and compositions. Actions include reducing current membership from 15 to 12 directors, adding new directors to bring perspectives – new perspectives to the Board's oversight of the company and naming a non-executive chairman. The Board believes these actions are consistent with high standards of corporate governance.
 With that, I'd like to open up the call to your questions.

As Steve has really come on board and have been very aggressive about thinking granularly regarding our pricing proposition, including branded products and, Meredith, even fresh food products as we repositioned some things to where we have a fair everyday price. And we'll still promote many of these items that we have a fair everyday price. We've seen a significant shift, a very positive significant shift in consumer behavior to where she feels like she can buy those items everyday in our store and not simply wait for them to be on sale.
 We had an item I may have talked about in the past in the bakery department. It's just a great item for us. But we had gotten (inaudible) price to be so out of whack that something in excess of 85% of our sales were only occurring when the item was on sale. We made a dramatic shift in that item. We love what we're learning from that. And we're beginning to roll that out across the various categories. But it will be a long term process, a multi-year process because we want to be thoughtful as we do it. As I said in the past, work with our vendor partners as we think about how we're costing products and how we bring value to our customers. I want to be careful that I don't make you believe that somehow because we're learning good things that we're going to change the proposition of all the items in our stores over night. This will be a thoughtful multi-year process as we make these changes.

We have some great solutions coming. And no, those solutions are not this year. That said, we actually have the capability with the current technology we have to do some great local things. I'll tell you, Meredith, as we travel across our company and visit our great independent retailers as well as many of our owned vendors, we see amazing things happening. What Pete, and Janel, and Steve, and Julie are really working towards is capturing the Best Practices of what we already do, and do that more broadly.
 And it's not dependent on system solutions. System solutions would be nice when they come. But being focused on our local customer is not dependent on a systems solution, it's dependent on having the store director be able to make the right decisions for his or her community, which I mentioned earlier I think Pete has done, is requiring that Steve and his team to build the capability to get the leverage that we have as a $40 billion retail. And we're talking to the national brand of suppliers, but at the same time making sure that the local products can be sourced locally, and that we give the opportunity to our local merchants to in fact take care of those local items.
 The fact that those local merchants report into Steve's group here is, I think, very consequential. But it doesn't mean that all stores across the country are going to carry only national branded items. Our goal is to continue to be great local retailers, whether that's lost in Philadelphia or Idaho Falls.

And no, it does not explain any of the sales weakness we're seeing now. We've actually been diligent about measuring the impact in – I mentioned we had 10 categories that we've rolled out, a couple of them quite big categories. And frankly, the stuff we took out still positions us to be a leader in assortment and variety. So we were simply – I think I may have mentioned this before. And we're simply so over assorted before.
 The 20% of skews that we've taken out in some of these categories still allows us to be an assortment leader. There may have been a handful of items that we've had to respond to consumer request for. But it's been very, very small. And frankly, the improved in-stock that we're seeing is that we're actually improving sales. The other thing we're able to do, and I'm thinking of one particular food category, is because we took out 20% of the skews. In addition to improving in-stock, we're able to position our private brands much better than we were before.
 We have a great private brand program. We've got a team here that has delivered beautiful products. But we were hiding them, quite frankly, because we were over sorted, it was very difficult for our consumers to find these products. So I mentioned we instilled disciplines today about positioning, placement, and pricing for these private brands, which I think are very, very important for our consumers who I think you all know continue to look for value. And as I've said, I think it's a new normal. I think consumers will – they changed their habits. And many consumers have learned that they liked private brands. And we want to be a great place for them to come and buy our private brand.
 And finally, I think the thing that's been really good and we have just begun to see this is the efficiencies of the SKU rationalization in some of these categories where the Q of the products was quite large. We were in a situation where virtually – maybe of many years, a third to half of the items in the category, you couldn't fit a case on the shelf at a time. So that meant that every time the store ordered product, some of that product is going to the back room. That clearly is not an efficiency move for us. And we're working diligently to undue that behavior so that we can get our cost structures in mind.

And so, as I said, I think in Q2 or Q3, we are going to thoughtful and deliberative as we look to how we negotiate with our vendors, and make sure that our vendors come to us because they get a return. So we do view this as a partnership with our supplier partners. Our early resolve, I think, are quite positive. There certainly has been some challenge and discussions between that the merchants and the vendor partners as we've looked towards SKU rationalization.
 But I will tell you, I've spoken personally to several of these CEOs of our large vendor partners, and they too would see the need for the SKU rationalization. They, too, see the benefit of having their strongest brand actually be in stock on the chef when the customers are in our stores, on one afternoon and fun day.
 It's not been all that easy, but I think ultimately they liked that. The very fun thing I think is as I mentioned earlier, Steve has gotten on board and begun to work with all the Save-A-Lot team and the independent retailer that works with Janel, and leverages the scale of 4,300 stores. And actually, we now have a couple of events coming up this year already scheduled where we can put products in front of customers in the whole lot of grocery stores across this country, I think that's very exciting. And I think as we develop that skill set and prove to our vendor partners that we can be a place to sell products profitably, we'll see more and more benefit.

While the importance to be a leader in fresh foods certainly prices a component to that, but so much more is involved in being a leader in fresh foods. And we've spoken about health and wellness.
 So quite frankly, it's not just about price. Price is a component. We've talked about some of those initiatives that we will continue to work on, most importantly, private brands and some fair pricing initiatives.

So I hate to send the message that says everything we do is going to be somehow passed along. This will be a very thoughtful and deliberative process to determine item-by-item and really starting with the consumer and what's relevant there for the consumer.
 In addition to making sure we're priced right, as I said before, I love the fact that what this team is now doing, particularly in the 10 categories that we've already optimized, you'll see private brand positioning much, much better than it was before. Off times, it was maybe on the bottom shelf or the lower shelves, or as one phasing. We've now put those products – we're proud of those products, so we put them front and center. We put them at eye level. We put them where you can see them. And we've given them pacing that are appropriate so the consumer can make the choice. If she wants to buy the product, if she wants to buy a brand of product, we want her to be able to buy either of those at our stores. I think that's important.
 And then I guess the final piece is we increasingly are putting the appropriate items in our promotional mix. So that when consumers come to our stores, she will now and again see those products on displays. We are, at the end of the day, in most of our traditional retail stores, we are promotional merchants. And customers love to come to our stores for promotion. Our private brands will be part of that mix.

I think the landscape is littered with companies who did not invest in their physical assets. And so, we will continue, as we've said in the past, to invest appropriately in our physical assets to ensure that – quite frankly, it seems like refrigeration breaks over time. They need to be replaced.
 These stores get a lot of customer traffic, and particularly, if you look in places like Chicago where we have very high volume stores, you need to make sure you continue to maintain those assets, and so almost regardless of what the lift is. What I like is the fact that we are being thoughtful and deliberative, as I said, I think in the Q3 call. Instead of doing what we did in the past, which was a one size-fits-all major remodel. I think we called the premium fresh and healthy. What we're now doing is being very thoughtful. In some neighborhood and some demographics, maybe that is in fact the appropriate store, but we now have several versions of a remodel that we can go. And therefore, we don't necessarily have to have this huge lift to go in and spend that money.
 So long story, but we will continue to remodel stores. I think it's part of what we must do. And then what we'll do, which is very exciting to me, is in those stores where we really don't have the need to replace the physical assets and spend all that money, but we do want to make the store feel fresher and more relevant, this is where project C comes in really handy because you can go with a fairly modest expense and make that store much more relevant to the consumer without having that big capital outlay.
 But again, to make sure our store base is fresh, we will continue to make sure all of our stores or 70% of our stores are remodeled between seven and eight years. So we need to make sure that we keep spending that money.

As you read in this morning's release, SUPERVALU reported earnings per share of $0.62 in the fourth quarter before one-time items and $2.03 for the full year. All in all, I'm pleased with our fourth quarter results and would say that we've accomplished a lot, not the least of which was delivering on the earnings and beating the debt reduction guidance provided at the end of the first quarter, shortly after I joined the company.
I want to start the call by emphasizing that we're making steady progress, streamlining operations, taking expenses out of the business and meeting our financial plans despite a challenging economic and competitive environment. Consumer spending and buying habits are changing due to the prolonged economic recovery. Today, the majority of my prepared remarks will focus on the strategic actions that SUPERVALU is taking in fiscal '11 to become a more effective retailer, more intently focused on meeting the needs of our customers and positioned for long-term financial success.
I'd like to briefly recap the significant accomplishments of the fourth quarter and strategically, it was an important time for us. First, we've completely redesigned the role of our store leadership to fully reflect that our store directors, more than anyone else, have the ability to positively influence the shopping experience. In the past, two months of the store directors' time was spent on administrative tasks.
Second, we've also refined and aligned our marketing and merchandising organizations. The lion's share of our banner merchants and marketing teams, representing nearly 75% of our sales, no matter where they reside physically now report to our centralized leadership team here in Minneapolis. 
Third, we optimized 10 major center-store categories across all of our traditional retail stores. In doing so, we moved with pace, completing these resets in record time. On average, we removed about 20% of the SKUs from each category. We also exited 26 general merchandise categories that were not core to our customer focus, items such as fragrances, automotive accessories and everyday electronics. These efforts contributed to lower year end inventory levels.
Fourth, in private brands, we corrected pricing and imposed new shelf placement disciplines company-wide. Fifth, we've opened 22 new Save-A-Lot stores during the quarter and will accelerate this growth rate with 100 new locations planned for fiscal '11.
Sixth, during the quarter, we sold 15 Shaw's stores in Connecticut, most recently announced our exit from the Cincinnati market. A great family-operated grocer, Remke Markets, who has been in the food business for over a century, agreed to purchase seven of our bigg's locations. As part of this deal, SUPERVALU will continue to supply the bigg's stores that Remke operates and will supply Remke's existing seven stores. All told, this is a great example of SUPERVALU leveraging its relationship and expertise to execute as ""America's Neighborhood Grocer"".
Seventh, we paid down $545 million in debt during the quarter, exceeding our debt reduction goal by nearly $150 million for the year. Eighth, we launched the replacement of our credit facility, which was successfully completed earlier this month. This milestone should remove any questions about our financial flexibility.
Lastly, but of critical importance, I have filled out my management team. I now have the right people in the right jobs, each with a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities. On our last earnings call, I shared with you the addition of Steve Jungmann, EVP of Merchandising. Steve's drive and leadership have already been felt throughout the organization, and we are reshaping the way that we work with our suppliers as well as with our banners.  He has been working with partnership in our vendors to bring value to customers and improve return on investment for all parties. 
Julie Dexter Berg, our Chief Marketing Officer, has been on board for four weeks. She is a true marketer and has a long career forging strong customer connections, improving brand health and driving improvements in operations performance. During the course of the year, I look forward to sharing with you Julie's impact and the accomplishments of her team.
Finally, earlier this month, we announced the hiring of our Chief Information Officer, Wayne Shurts will join SUPERVALU next week and will lead us through the full integration of our corporate systems. Most recently, Wayne served as the Global CIO for Cadbury. His contributions will allow SUPERVALU to gain the functionality of state-of-the-art marketing and merchandising systems and move us to a fully centralized technology platform.
I can't tell you how pleased I am to have been able to assemble an executive team with professionals I have confidence in, who share my vision for this company's future, and I know will get the job done.
Now that I shared some of the more recent accomplishments, you can see that the fourth quarter was a very productive period for SUPERVALU. We made significant headway in refocusing on the customer, streamlining functions throughout the organization, assessing our market position, on-boarding new leadership and improving our balance sheet.
As I look forward to fiscal '11, my executive team will have a handful of priorities. In discussing these, I'd like to underscore the deliberate actions we are taking to improve operation and become a more relevant retailer. The broadest initiative and the one that I am most excited about is what we call Project SHE, which stands simply for simplify her experience. The SHE initiative has many components, will evolve over several years and will fundamentally alter the shopping experience for our customers.
Consistent with my vision, Project SHE will allow us to improve our relevance to our customers in their neighborhoods by leveraging our brand equity while maintaining all the advantage of our national scale. We are in the first stages of this multiyear initiative, all focused on dramatically enhancing the shopability of our stores, not only making them more customer friendly, but also simplifying the retail experience.
Activities in this past year have many facets and include SKU rationalization, upgraded displays, compelling product adjacencies and clearer signage. All will heighten our focus on customer engagement and bolster our local relevance.
We will be more effective in capital spending as we redefine the in-store experience and redesign it with her in mind. Our fiscal '11 capital plan contemplates rolling out the initial phases of SHE to approximately 300 stores. Needless to say, you'll hear more detail on this in the coming months as we test and learn from early implementations and roll this out across our retail network.
Value remains a top-of-mind to today's thrift-conscious consumer. SUPERVALU will continue to invest in price, call out value and promote its private brand. While internal metrics and third-party surveys confirm that we are competitively priced relative to traditional retail peers, this does not mean that we will stop pursuing opportunities to lower price for a good retailer price investment never ends.
As I previously commented, the vast majority of our marketing and merchandising functions at the banner level have been centralized with our enterprise team in Minneapolis. This step creates a single unified touchpoint between SUPERVALU and the vendor community, which enables us to capture the benefits of national scale, while maintaining the flexibility to tailor our approach at the local level. We already know that this alignment eliminated many of the complexities and extra costs that vendors incurred in serving our company. These improvements, combined with our purchasing clout, will reduce the cost of goods, which, as I see it, is a single large opportunity for SUPERVALU giving greater value to its customers.
The merchandising team under Steve's leadership is already moving aggressively on this front. These efforts will give us more flexibility to invest in price and provide even greater value to our customers.  With this new structure, we'll also see more effective promotional programs, as well as more consistent store level execution across our banners. As a company, our goal is to simplify how we go to market for our customers, vendors and employees. I firmly believe our ability to deliver our programs, facilitate strategic objectives and drive sales will fundamentally change the way our vendor partners view us. In fact, later this quarter, we will leverage the strength of our 4,300 store network to execute multiple national sales events with our vendor partners. Our network of stores is larger than any other traditional grocer. This is a big deal for us and an indication of things to come.
Our near-term goal is to make our product offering more relevant for our customers and deliver on the value proposition and service they expect. The good news here is that our marketing, merchandising, operating teams are coordinated and focused. A good partnership has been established amongst Steve, Julie, Pete and Janel; and their organizations are moving with a sense of urgency and speed, capitalizing on early wins and incorporating learnings as we continue to test, refine and roll out new operational initiatives.
SUPERVALU's private brand offering is another unrealized opportunity for the company. We have aggressively negotiated new company-wide sourcing agreements to achieve cost reductions. For example, in a popular beverage category, we've realized savings in the mid-single digit millions, which will lower the base price of this product and improve our margin. Already in the first quarter, we're aggressively promoting the marketing and value of our private brands to shoppers.
We have in-source vendor negotiations, as well as research and analysis with the objective of developing and maintaining a direct relationship with our private brand vendors. And just last week, we embedded private brand personnel within the category teams, which I believe is critical to the success of overall category management.
I believe these changes will place a more appropriate emphasis in our private brand and allow us to better control our destiny. I've  challenged our merchandising team to increase private brand sales penetration by more than 200 basis points in fiscal '11. This puts our year end sales mix target at just over 20%.
Reducing shrink and improving workforce productivity remains a focal point for SUPERVALU. In fiscal '11, we plan to make further improvements to simplify shelf stocking, minimize backroom inventory and reduce the frequency with which product is handled. Each of these activities will ultimately drive improvements in shrink. 
We've also begun a series of initiatives that will adjust hours of operations, improve staffing level in service departments during peak hours and reallocate store personnel to customer-facing activities. As I stated before, our goal is to reduce corporate S&A cost by at least 50 basis points. In fiscal '10, our progress towards this goal was masked by soft sales that we put many of the necessary disciplines in place. As of now, we expect to get to a run rate in fiscal '13 that meets our target.
Our expansion is stabilized, is well on track. With 100 stores in this year's pipeline, we are developing the internal expertise and skills to ramp up to a pace that will allow us to more than double in five years. Our newest Save-A-Lot stores are doing quite well with sales averaging 10% above our internal projections and initial capital across 10% percent below our past spend rate. 
The Save-A-Lot team has had good success controlling capital by utilizing existing store interiors, aggressively negotiating construction bids and leveraging internal architecture and engineering expertise.
Looking at the fiscal '11, we plan to open around 15 stores in the first quarter, slightly more than that in the second and the balance of the stores in the back half of the year. I'm also excited about the prospects for our Supply Chain business. We've had new business coming on board this year, including over 50 new affiliations with independent customers, representing 126 total stores that joined us in the past year. Janel and her team are committed to growing our independent customer base and are actively pursuing new affiliations while they work with existing customers to grow their market relevance and share.
And finally, we continue to weave analytical discipline into our corporate DNA. Each initiative I laid out today is data-driven, quantified and time-bound and will generate considerable savings and sales growth for this company. We have also adjusted our compensation programs to appropriately align management incentives with these priorities. I'm proud of the 160,000 associates who have rededicated themselves to focus on the customer. On that note, let me turn the call over to Pam for a discussion of our financial performance and outlook."
306013,100560789,56703,"SUPERVALU Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-20-2010",2010-04-20,"Earnings Calls","SUPERVALU INC.","Executives","Thank you, Craig, and good morning, everyone. Today I will be covering our fourth quarter operating results, the company's financial condition and lastly, giving some color to our fiscal '11 guidance.As Craig alluded, the economy has not changed much si",2138,"Thank you, Craig, and good morning, everyone. Today I will be covering our fourth quarter operating results, the company's financial condition and lastly, giving some color to our fiscal '11 guidance.
As Craig alluded, the economy has not changed much since we reported our quarter three results in January. Although food at home deflation appears to have bottomed out and unemployment, as reported by the federal government, is not getting worse, consumer confidence still remains low. The value-seeking shopper of 2009 used 27% more coupons than in 2008, the first yearly increase since 1992.  In addition, small businesses and consumers are finding credit more difficult to obtain. And finally, the housing market remains uneasy at best. 
This morning, we reported net sales for our fourth quarter for $9.2 billion compared to $10.8 billion last year, a decrease of 14.9%. The change in year-over-year sales was predominantly the result of four items: first, the loss of last year's 53rd week, which we disclosed was approximately $800 million or approximately 50% of the decline; second, identical store sales of negative 6.8%, in line with our expectations and similar to the third quarter run rate; third, the impact from the F '09 previously announced store closures in addition to the third quarter exit from the Salt Lake City retail market; and finally, the completion of Target's previously announced plan to transition certain volumes to self-distribution.
The identical store sales of negative 6.8% reflected a 3% decrease in customer count and a 3.8% decrease in average basket size. The customer count decrease represents a slight decline from the third quarter run rate. And one of Julie's top priorities is to address customer traffic.
Average basket size, which did show a slight improvement of 70 basis points from a negative 4.5% third quarter figure, was influenced by factors we have talked about before: namely, trade down, deflation and the number of items per order. We estimate trade down at approximately 70 basis points in the quarter, which when combined with last year's fourth quarter and quarter four of fiscal '08, puts the three-year stack at close to 300 basis points and includes higher private brand penetration, which reached nearly 80% of sales for the quarter and accounted for approximately 21% of units sold.
Inflation ran at approximately negative 80 basis points. This was the third consecutive quarter that we have seen falling price levels, a reflection of both product cost deflation and our own price investment activity. The balance of the basket size decline was attributable to customers buying fewer items per visit, which again was down by roughly one half-item per order.
Moving to operating earnings, despite weak top line sales, we delivered retail food operating earnings of 3.1% of net sales, which included charges triggered by the quarter one fiscal '11 sale of our Connecticut Shaw's stores and our Cincinnati bigg's location. Prior to these charges, operating earnings were 3.8% of net sales compared to 4.5% last year. This change was driven by a loss of sales leverage on fixed expenses as gross margins, benefiting from a favorable LIFO credit compared to LIFO charge last year, were up modestly.
Besides continued investment in price, gross margin reflects a slight decline in promotional mix. We had actually seen a reduction in overall units sold on promotions with an offsetting increase in units sold at the everyday retail. It is great to see our progress in fixing these pricing imbalances where we had high shelf prices on some great everyday items, and therefore sold the vast majority of units on promotion. It's good to no longer have to repeat Craig's example of the national brand cookie that he talked about when he first arrived.  I would also add that we absorbed another $0.01 in cost related to the Salt Lake City retail market exit, which brought the full year net benefit from this transaction to a positive $0.01. 
Our Supply Chain Services segment had another solid quarter. Operating earnings were 4.5% of net sales, which included fees received from the early termination of our supply agreement with Ukrop's. Excluding this item, operating earnings were 3.8% of net sales for the quarter, compared to 3.2% of net sales last year and reflected both the LIFO credit and careful expense management in light of softer sale.
Turning to our financial condition, we finished the year with total outstanding debt of $7.6 billion, which represented an aggregate fiscal '10 debt reduction of approximately $850 million, exceeding our guidance by $150 million. Our FIFO inventory levels declined by over $300 million compared to the end of fiscal '09, reflecting the initial benefits of SKU rationalization across both our retail and distribution networks and a heightened focus on managing working capital company-wide. Our inventory days supply was the lowest since we bought Albertsons in 2006. Our debt to total capital ratio declined by approximately 400 basis points as we finished the year with debt representing 73% of total capital, compared to 77% a year earlier.
At year end, we were in compliance with our debt covenants with a trailing 12-month EBIT of $1.3 billion, excluding impairment on other non-operating charges. Depreciation and amortization for the year was $1.0 billion, and rent was $0.4 billion. 
Earlier this month, we announced that we had successfully amended and extended our existing credit facility or agreement. Our agreement includes a $1.5 billion revolver with a five-year term, extends the term on $500 million of Term Loan B and reset covenant levels. With this transaction, we have ensured our liquidity for the coming five years.
Let me move on to provide several other disclosures. First, I want to speak to SUPERVALU's market share. On our second quarter call, we committed to provide color on the market share performance of our top 90 DMAs or Designated Marketing Areas. These are markets in which we generally have at least 10 stores. The market share figures that we track reflect a combined market share that includes our traditional retail stores, all Save-A-Lot locations and independent stores where we are the primary supplier. 
As of February, on a year-over-year basis, we either gained or held share in nearly 40% of these 90 DMAs and lost market share in the balance. For the top 20 DMAs, which account for approximately 2/3 of our sales volume, the cumulative total share loss was approximately 60 basis points. These figures capture both our ID sales performance and planned store closures, which has reduced square footage by 6.2% over the last 12 months.
Next let me comment on our most recent store level customer satisfaction surveys, which again rose over the prior quarter. Scores for price competitiveness, the courtesy and friendliness of our checkers, the likelihood of customers' willingness to return or recommend us to others and the quality and freshness of our perishable, all increased by approximately 100 to 400 basis points. It goes without saying that we are pleased with these results. Since Craig's arrival last spring and our company's renewed focus on the customer, shoppers' responses on all four items has improved at least 400 basis points.
Our perishable scores, which have been a real focus, are up nearly 900 basis points. Clearly, we are moving in the right direction and making meaningful progress towards meeting customer expectations and improving the overall shopping experience.
And last, an update on the performance of our remodels. Our first year remodel shows an average lift in the fourth quarter of about 1.5% when compared to other stores in their respective markets. Those stores that have cycled their one-year opening were up an additional 100 basis points in their second year. 
Moving to the new fiscal year, we have built our plans around the expectation that the economy will continue to pressure consumer spending. This morning, we introduced fiscal '11 GAAP earnings per share guidance in the range of $1.65 to $1.85 per diluted share. This includes $0.10 of one-time cost primarily related to the fiscal '11 quarter one retail market exit in Connecticut and Cincinnati. Prior to these charges, earnings per share is forecasted to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.95 per diluted share, a decline from the $2.03 adjusted EPS we reported for fiscal '10.
I would like to spend some time commenting on our guidance and headwinds we are facing. First, all markets exited in F '10 and '11, as well as the Target and Ukrop's business, were positive contributors to earnings and cash flows. Next, our new revolving credit agreement reflects the current market rate environment, which I can tell you is not as attractive as when we closed on the Albertsons deal. However, we are pleased that the pricing achieved reflects our strong cash generation capabilities, even though any borrowings will cost us roughly 60 basis points more than our previous facility.
Our plans also call for a higher LIFO charge this year as we view the lead inflation, albeit at a moderate rate assumed at 1.5%, will return by the end of fiscal '11. And finally, pension expense for the company's defined benefit pension plan will increase this year compared to fiscal '10, as the implications of the financial markets having not yet fully recovered will impact our annual expense.
Therefore, the many initiatives that Craig just shared with you around sales, margin and cost reduction will, collectively, almost offset these items. How do we see fiscal '11 unfolding? We expect the identical store sales run rate to improve across fiscal '11, but still be approximately negative 2% for the full year. By the fourth quarter, we believe total company IDs will be flat to slightly positive as our marketing, merchandising and operational initiatives build throughout the year. Included in total company IDs is our assumption for positive ID sales from our corporately-owned Save-A-Lot stores.
From a total sales perspective, keep in mind that fiscal '10 sales included bigg's, the Connecticut Shaw's stores and Ukrop's business for the entire year, as well as Salt Lake City sale through the third quarter and the Target volume for approximately half the year. As well, we also expect ID licensee pool purchases, which we call poll [ph], from our Save-A-Lot warehouses to be positive, and IDs wholesale pool for our independent customers to be flat for the year.
We expect to have additional gross profit dollars available to us as we negotiate better cost of goods, run more effective promotion, increased  private brand penetration and further reduce shrink. This will give us added flexibility to invest in price and bring greater value to our customers as we look to effectively manage the balance between sales and margin. Our fiscal '11 capital plan at $700 million, with an emphasis on remodels and in-store merchandising initiatives focused on driving sales. We are also excited with the growth initiative at Save-A-Lot, which totaled 100 net new stores. We finished fiscal '10 with about 66% of our stores either new or newly remodeled within the past seven years. And we plan to remodel approximately 90 to 115 stores this year, in addition to touching 300 stores with in-store merchandising initiatives.
Going forward, we will place less emphasis on this metric as we touch more stores with more efficient stance [ph] that would not meet our remodel threshold of 500,000. We believe these customer-facing capital investments will better drive sales. And at the same time, we will not allow the physical condition of our facilities to deteriorate. With this capital plan, depreciation, amortization will be largely unchanged from the current run rate.
In the coming year, despite slightly lower earnings, we will again generate free cash flow to further reduce debt through prudent capital investment decisions and aggressive management of working capital. Our total debt reduction target for this year is $600 million, which when combined with the $850 million paydown we achieved in F10, will allow us to exceed the $1.3 billion two-year expectation I spoke to at this time last year, well exceeding the debt reduction target set as part of the Albertsons transaction. This will result in debt to total capital of approximately 68% by year end. Fiscal '11 maturities total approximately $975 million. After fiscal '11, debt maturities average about $475 million over each of the next five years, with the highest single year being fiscal '13 when approximately $800 million comes due. 
We expect the first half of fiscal '11 to be considerably more challenging than the second half, based on our view of the economy and the build of our marketing, merchandising and operational initiatives that Craig reviewed earlier. The first quarter will also include the negative impact of approximately $0.10 worth of charges, primarily related to the completion of retail market exits in Connecticut and Cincinnati. 
I will now turn the call back over to Craig."

Prior to opening up the call for questions and answers, I'd like to touch upon this morning's announcement regarding the board. After a deliberative review, the board is making changes to its size and compositions. Actions include reducing current board membership from 15 to 12 directors, adding two new directors to bring new perspectives to the board's oversight of the company and naming a non-executive chairman. The board believes these actions are consistent with high standards of corporate governance. 
With that, I'd like to open up the call to your questions."

We have very specific examples. As Steve has really come on board and been very aggressive about thinking granularly regarding our pricing proposition, including branded products and, Meredith, even fresh food products, as we repositioned some things to where we have a fair everyday price. And we'll still promote many of these items that we have a fair everyday price. We've seen a significant shift, a very positive significant shift in consumer behavior to where she feels like she can buy those items every day in our store and not simply wait for them to be on sale. We had an item, I may have talked about in the past, in the bakery department, such a great item for us. But we have gotten the regular price to be so out of whack that something in excess of 85% of our sales were only occurring when the item was on sale. We made a dramatic shift in that item. We love what we're learning from that, and we're beginning to roll that out across various categories. But it will be a long-term process, a multi-year process because we want to be thoughtful as we do it.

We have some great solutions coming. And no, those solutions are not this year. That said, we actually have the capability, with the crude technology we have, to do some great local things. I'll tell you, Meredith, as we travel across our company and visit our great, independent retailers as well as many of our owned banners, we see amazing things happening. What Pete and Janel and Steve and Julie are really working towards is capturing the best practices of what we already do and do that more broadly. And it's not dependent on system solutions. System solutions will be nice when they come, but being focused on our local customer is not dependent on a system solution, it's dependent on having the store director be able to make the right decisions for his or her community, which I mentioned earlier, I think Pete has done. It's requiring that Steve and his team build a capability to get the leverage that we have as a $40-billion retail when we're talking to the national-branded suppliers. But at the same time making sure that the local products can be sourced locally, and that we give the opportunity for our local merchants to, in fact, take care of those local items. The fact that those local merchants report into Steve's group here is I think very consequential. But it doesn't mean that all stores across the country are going to carry only national-branded item. Our goal is to continue to be great local retailers, whether that's Boston, Philadelphia or Idaho Falls."

And no, it does not explain any of the sales weakness we're seeing now. We've actually been diligent about measuring the impact in, I mentioned we had 10 categories that we've rolled out, a couple of them quite big categories. And frankly, the stuff we took out still positions us to be a leader in assortment and variety. So we were simply, I think I may have mentioned this before, and we're simply so overassorted before. The 20% of SKUs that we've taken out in some of these categories still allows us to be an assortment leader. There may have been a handful of items that we've had to respond to consumer request for, but it's been very, very small. And frankly, the improved in-stock that we're seeing is that we're actually improving sales. The other thing we're able to do, and I'm thinking of one particular food category, is because we took out 20% of the SKUs. In addition to improving in-stock, we're able to position our private brand much better than we were before. We have a great private brand program. We got a team here that has delivered beautiful products, but we were hiding them, quite frankly. Because we're overassorted, it was very difficult for our consumers to find these products. So I mentioned, we instill disciplines today about positioning, placement and pricing for these private brands, which I think our very, very important for our consumers who I think you all know continue to look for value. And as I said, I think it's the new normal. I think consumers will -- they've changed their habits. And many consumers have learned that they liked private brands, and we want to be a great place for them to come and buy our private brands. And then finally, I think the thing that's been really good and have just begun to see this is the efficiencies of the SKU rationalization. In some of these categories where the queue over the products was quite large. We were in a situation where virtually maybe as many as a third to a half of the items in the category, you couldn't fit a case on the shelf at a time. So that meant that every time the store order products, some of that products is going to the backroom. That clearly is not an efficiency move for us. And we're working diligently to undo that kind of behavior, so that we can get our cost structures in line."

And so as I said, I think in Q2 and Q3, we are going to be thoughtful and deliberative as we look to how we negotiate with our vendors and make sure that our vendors come to us because they get a return. So we do view this as a partnership with our supplier partners. Our early result, I think, are quite positive. There are certainly has been some challenging discussions between the merchants and the vendor partners as we've looked towards SKU rationalization. But I would tell you, I've spoken personally to several of the CEOs of our large vendor partners and they, too, have seen the need for the SKU rationalization. They, too, see the benefit of having their strongest brand actually be in stock on the shelf when our customers are in our stores on Saturday afternoon, on Sunday. So it's not all been easy but I think, ultimately, they like that. The very fun thing I think is, as I mentioned earlier, Steve has gotten on board and begun to work with both the Save-A-Lot team and the independent retailer team that works with Janel, and leverages the scale of 4,300 stores. And actually, we now have a couple of events coming up this year, already scheduled where we can put product in front of customers in a whole lot of grocery stores across this country. I think that's very exciting. And I think as we develop that skill set and prove to our vendor partners that we can be a place to sell products profitably, we'll see more and more benefit."

We put them at eye level. We put them where you can see them. And we've given them facings that are appropriate, so the consumer can make the choice if she wants to buy that product or she wants to buy a branded product. We want her to be able to buy either of those at our stores. I think that's important. And then I guess the final piece is we increasingly are putting the appropriate items in our promotional mix. So that when consumers come to our stores, she will now and again see those products on displays. We are, at the end of the day, in most of our traditional retail stores, we are promotional merchants. And customers love to come to our stores for promotions.

These stores get a lot of customer traffic. And particularly, if you look in places like Chicago where we have a very high volume stores, you need to make sure you continue to maintain those assets, and so almost regardless of what the lift is. What I like is the fact that we are being thoughtful and deliberative. As I said I think in the Q3 call, instead of doing what we did in the past, which was a one-size-fits-all major remodel, I think we called it Premium Fresh & Healthy, what we're now doing is being very thoughtful. In some neighborhood, in some demographics, maybe that is in fact the appropriate store, but we now have some several versions of a remodel that we can go. And therefore, we don't necessary have to have this huge lift to go within and spend the money. So long story, but we will continue to remodel stores. I think it's part of what we must do. And then what we'll do, which is very exciting to me, is in those stores where we really don't have the need to replace the physical assets and spend all that money, but we do want to make the store feel pressure and more relevant, this is where project SHE comes in really handy, because you can go in at a fairly modest expense and make that store much more relevant to the consumer without having that big capital outlay. But again, to make sure our store base is fresh, we will continue to make sure all of our stores or 70% of our stores are remodeled between seven and eight years. So we need to make sure that we keep spending that money."

As you read in today's release, SUPERVALU reported earnings per share of $0.43 for the first quarter of fiscal '11, which excludes the impact of onetime items. This was a tough quarter for us but one that",2143,"Well, thank you, Ken, and good morning, everybody. As you read in today's release, SUPERVALU reported earnings per share of $0.43 for the first quarter of fiscal '11, which excludes the impact of onetime items. This was a tough quarter for us but one that ushered in positive operational progress. 
Despite weak top line sales and expense deleveraging, we controlled our margins well and continued to take cost out of the business. First, let me provide some color on our ID sales. Excluding Shaw's, due to the labor dispute which was resolved earlier this month, ID sales declined 6.5% year-over-year. To put this in context, we're cycling last year's heavy promotional period, and the consumer remained stretched. 
Since the beginning of the year, our merchandising, marketing and retail operations teams have worked collaboratively to improve value perception at store level, and our efforts to control margins have begun to show tangible signs of traction. The 10 basis-point improvement to gross margin during the quarter reflects more effective promotional spending, which was partially offset by price investment. 
For the quarter, the percent of items sold on promotion was down approximately 100 basis points from a year earlier. Over the long term, we believe this work will help us drive sales, restore customer confidence in our brand position and be more deliberative with our promotional activities. Though much work remains, I do want to provide a candid update of the progress we're making. 
In merchandising, we've identified a number of opportunities to better leverage our extensive store network. One particular opportunity that I have spoken to before is SUPERVALU's network-wide promotional events for power sale items. Today, I'm able to provide you an update on two events we completed this past quarter. 
In May, we successfully ran a national sales promotion on Soup across our 4,300 store network, including Save-A-Lot and our independent retailers. This promotion drove several million incremental unit sales within the category. In June, this event was followed by a similar promotion in the Cereal category. 
Both power sale events went well, met sales targets and serve as an initial marker for our vendor partners that SUPERVALU can execute company-wide programs and move product quickly. Each successful event builds vendor confidence in our company-wide capabilities and should ultimately level the playing field with others in the industry. Our 4,300 store network is a distinct advantage that further differentiate SUPERVALU from its competitors. 
Another refinement to our merchandising strategy focuses on everyday pricing in select categories to maximize sales and generate labor efficiencies. Across the store, we have a number of product groups that can best be described as convenience items. They don't necessarily drive foot traffic or incremental store purchases, but our customers have come to expect them as part of the store assortment. These products require a high level of labor maintenance when promoted though their demand profile is relatively inelastic. 
Over the next few months, we will begin offering these products at constant everyday prices rather than employing promotional cycles. Pricing will be competitive, and this change will allow us to realize significant incremental labor efficiencies. 
To illustrate, today, our store associates spent countless hours changing shelf tags across 140 SKU category throughout our 1,200 store traditional network several times a month. A constant price strategy will eliminate or redirect these labor hours to customer-facing activities. However, brands are another important component of our effort to drive incremental sales. 
Last quarter, I talked about our decision to bring SUPERVALU's private brand activities in-house. Additionally, we've corrected pricing and imposed new shelf placement disciplines company-wide. Since making these changes, I'm pleased to point out that our private brand penetration rose above 18%, moving us closer to our year-end target of 20%. For the quarter, unit sales were north of just 20%. 
At SUPERVALU, customers are shopping our private brands with increasing frequency. Our entry-level price point offering, Shoppers Value, is also gaining greater traction with the independent retailers we service through our Supply Chain business. Year-to-date, this brand is up 19% with our independent retailers. 
As customers discover the quality of our offerings, we are building product loyalty that we believe will outlast the current economic cycle. We estimate that customers can save about $450 per year by selecting our private brands over national brand alternatives. 
Moving to SKU rationalization. There's been a great deal of attention and discussion around this initiative, both for SUPERVALU and across the retail industry at large. Today, I want to be clear about what SKU rationalization is for SUPERVALU, how we approach this discipline and what it means to our shoppers. As SUPERVALU executes its SKU initiative, we have a well-defined vision for each center-store category. First, it is to offer variety in each category. Second is to avoid product redundancy and improve shelf space for offerings that are locally relevant. Next is to get the appropriate facings for private brand products. And finally, we seek to enhance labor productivity and curtail excess inventory. 
The discipline with which we have executed this program to date allows us to improve in-stock positions on high-velocity items, continue to maintain a wide assortment of products and create labor efficiencies. To be successful, we have to be flexible. Running an algorithm or a spreadsheet will not tell you how each customer is affected by these changes. 
We expect that new sets will need tweaking. It's a normal part of process and a healthy way to better understand and meet the unique needs of each community in which we operate. Whether we've made decisions that are unpopular with a number of shoppers, we go back and fix our assortment. Ultimately, we are confident that our methodical approach will result in efficiently run stores that carry a product assortment customized for the communities they serve. 
To illustrate, let me call out one category, Oral Care, from which we removed about 20% of the SKUs. The vast majority of these edits related to tube size and slow-moving flavors. We did, however, remove some tertiary brands within each Oral Care segment. Where there was an impact to our customers, we made adjustments. Let me also add that following the reset, sales in this category improved 2.4%. Through the end of the first quarter, we completely reset 31 center-store categories and touched over 900 stores. 
Next, let me provide an update on our project focused on improving the shopping experience in our traditional retail stores. Our goal is to simplify the shopping experience for all of our customers by making our product offering clear and our stores more inviting. Some aspects of this program will be evidenced sooner than others. For example, we've already redesigned shelf tags, improved signage and are communicating our brand position and product selection more clearly. Other aspects will take more time as we fine-tune implementation to appropriately fit the banner and locality store. 
Last quarter, we projected that we would complete 300 stores this fiscal year. In addition, with our commitment to ensure we make the right decisions, we are extending the time line for completing these stores by about three to six months. This will provide us ample time to study additional pilot stores that are varying sizes and serve different demographics to improve execution for a broader rollout over the coming years. 
Since March, Julie Dexter Berg, our Chief Marketing Officer, has begun to map out a new strategy for SUPERVALU that improves our market position and reinvigorates our emotional engagement with customers. These programs will sharpen the brand position for each of our banner brands and leverage all channels available to us to converse with our customers about who we are and what we stand for. I look forward to shedding more light on these activities on our next call, and I'm confident that at that time, we will have realized improvements in consumer messaging, which will heighten the awareness of our brands. 
Across our organization and customer-facing initiatives, information technology plays a key role. I'm very excited about the work being led by our new CIO, Wayne Shurts. Since joining SUPERVALU in April, Wayne has launched activities enterprise-wide that will provide immediate benefits for this fiscal year. With Wayne's leadership, we are taking a closer look at the status of our merchandising system implementation. While a number of foundational applications are already up and running, we're evaluating staffing and other applications to re-prioritize those rollouts that will have the greatest near-term impact. 
Over the long term, our priorities for information technology remain the same, to support a centralized merchandising organization while simplifying the business processes for our banners and stores. 
As you know, I continue to be very excited about the prospects for growth and innovation within our Save-A-Lot organization. Bill Shaner, President and CEO for Save-A-Lot, has been leading a number of strategic opportunities to extend Save-A-Lot's brand equity in existing markets and better position this hard-discount format in the neighborhoods it serves. The Save-A-Lot model is built on efficiency and harnessing a strong distribution network with limited SKU assortment to offer customers everyday low prices at retail. Still, Save-A-Lot must work in each community to be hyper-local and establish a degree of customer intimacy that drives loyalty and brand recognition. 
Structurally, we've done a good job of leveraging resources to improve internal planning capabilities that can help facilitate and accelerate Save-A-Lot's growth. By aligning our Business Development and Real Estate teams into a single organization, we are more effectively identifying new markets, store locations and licensees. Bill and I agree that these are all critical ingredients to Save-A-Lot's growth trajectory. 
You previously heard me speak to our cost initiative called, let the building be the building, which allows licensees to open stores with significantly less capital. Another way we're making investment proposition more attractive for licensees is through a new incentive program, which offers upfront cash incentives or rebates based upon anticipated sales. With 100 new locations planned for this fiscal year and about half of these stores scheduled to be opened by licensees, these programs will help to improve the return on their investments. 
Going forward, we believe we have significant opportunity to expand our base of licensees beyond traditional retailers. We've added talent to our development teams specifically to attract non-traditional retailers into the Save-A-Lot network, who otherwise might have opted for other franchise-oriented opportunities. Outreach to mainstream entrepreneurs is a significant focus for Save-A-Lot and will help us to double our store count by fiscal 2015. 
Our Save-A-Lot plans for this year remained on track and include particular emphasis on Southeastern United States, with over half of this year's stores planned for the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. Save-A-Lot will also continue to back drop [ph] markets where we have existing infrastructure to manage this growth and where the Save-A-Lot brand has built a loyal following in cities such as Detroit, Cleveland and Philadelphia. In these particular markets, Save-A-Lot can successfully build nutritional gaps and meet the needs of local consumers for low-priced, high-quality groceries in urban food deserts. 
Equally exciting are the new ways Save-A-Lot is developing strategically to serve different population demographics. Let me share with you an example of how we are bringing this vision to life. 
Houston and South Texas are relatively new markets for Save-A-Lot and are each defined by their significant Hispanic populations. As Save-A-Lot explored opportunities to customize stores that resonate with this demographic, the Save-A-Lot team decided to enter into a relationship that will allow us to learn about marketing and merchandising to this population. 
Today, Save-A-Lot has formed an affiliation with Rafael Ortega, a grocer with more than 24 years of experience serving shoppers in South Texas through multiple grocery retail enterprises. Mr. Ortega has a deep understanding of the need and expectations of this rapidly growing Hispanic community and a developed business model that is highly compatible with the Save-A-Lot format. 
As part of this relationship, Save-A-Lot has re-branded six stores in Texas as El Ahorro Save-A-Lot. The stores will showcase Save-A-Lot's hard discount pricing and easy to navigate floor plan. The shopping experience will be enhanced with hyper-local product selection that is fundamental to Mr. Ortega's retail experience. 
In an El Ahorro Save-A-Lot, Save-A-Lot will supply center-store items while Ms. Ortega will source the specific meats, cheeses and produce to satisfy the unique taste of these communities. This is a very exciting partnership for us and one that will allow SUPERVALU to learn more about the Hispanic community. It should also help Save-A-Lot continue to deliver an overall return on invested capital of greater than 30% to our company. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Pam Knous, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide some comments on our first quarter performance and SUPERVALU's financial condition. I will then follow up with some closing remarks."

Starting with our income statement, quarter one net sales were $11.5 billion compared to $12.7 billion last year. This 9.2% decline was primarily the result of three items. First, identical store sales declined by 7.2%. Excluding Shaw's, which was impacted by a labor dispute for much of the quarter, IDs were negative 6.5%. Second, the impact from previously announced retail store closures, including the submarket exits in Salt Lake City, Connecticut and Cincinnati, and finally, Target's transition to self distribution. 
Our ID sales were driven by a 3.5% decline in customer count and a 3.0% decrease in average transaction size. Customer count declined modestly from the fourth quarter. Compared to Q1 last year, we did cycle the introduction of Big Relief in Chicago, Southern California and Las Vegas in addition to a period of ineffective promotions which all drove traffic last year. 
In contrast, transaction size improve modestly from the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the first quarter reflected favorable trends in both trade-down and inflation, which were offset by additional investments in price and fewer items per basket. In quarter one, for the first time in the past 10 quarters, trade-down was essentially flat, representing a 100 basis-point improvement from quarter one fiscal '10. Cost inflation ran about 90 basis points. 
We also made price investments in the quarter that included: A price cut program at Cub Foods, where we reduced everyday prices on thousands of items across the store; Save-A-Lot, where we lowered prices on a number of items, most notably in dairy; company-wide adjustments to private brands as price spreads were corrected in the fourth quarter of fiscal '10; and our broader initiative to bring reasonable everyday pricing to our customers as we continue to migrate away from an extreme high-low strategy. The balance of the change in average ticket was driven by customers buying fewer items per visit, which was again down by nearly one-half item per order. We attribute this decline to cycling the Big Relief and our promotional efforts from last year. 
Moving to operating earnings before onetime items, retail food was 3.0% of sales compared to 3.1% last year. This decline was driven primarily by lower sales and the impact of deleveraging on expenses. It is important to note that we have removed over $40 million in cost from our business since the beginning of the year and plan to finish the year achieving savings of roughly $160 million. Note that this savings estimate does not include cost of goods initiatives. 
Supply Chain services delivered an operating margin of 3.0% sales compared to last year's 2.9%. We remain pleased with the contributions of our Supply Chain business, which continues to aggressively manage expenses and produce stable earnings. 
Though small, I do want to mention corporate expenses. Corporate expenses were $29 million this quarter compared to $26 million in the prior year, excluding onetime items. In the current quarter, we absorbed $9 million of charges related to non-operating properties. 
For the quarter, reported earnings per share was $0.31 per diluted share and included $0.12 in onetime charges, with $0.07 related to our market exit in Connecticut and Cincinnati and a nickel attributable to the impact of the labor strike that affected Shaw's. 
Turning to our financial condition. We finished the first quarter with total debt outstanding of $7.4 billion, down by roughly $235 million from year end and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 72%. Inventory days supply fell by almost a full day compared to last year's quarter one, partly due to the benefits of SKU rationalization. We remain in compliance with our debt covenants with trailing 12-month EBIT of $1.2 billion, excluding impairment and other non-operating charges. 
Depreciation and amortization was $0.9 billion and rent expense amounted to $0.4 billion. Recall that with the April 5 amendment and extension of our senior credit facility, the two covenants related to our credit agreement reset to less-restrictive levels. For fiscal '11, our interest coverage ratio must be greater than 2.20x and our leverage ratio must be less than 4.25x. Current year maturities are $611 million, which will primarily be repaid from internally generated funds. 
I would now like to provide two brief comments on performance of our store remodels and customer satisfaction surveys. With regard to the performance of recently remodeled stores, our first-year remodel showed an average lift of nearly 3% when compared to other stores in their respective markets. Stores cycling their one-year opening were up close to 200 basis points in their second year. In our competitive customer tracking study, our customer satisfaction scores improved in eight out of the nine banners we track. Let me provide some comments on our fiscal '11 guidance. 
Our first quarter sales were softer than we had anticipated, but with new leadership within our marketing and merchandising teams, we do have plans in place to help drive volume during the balance of the year. Our updated full year guidance for identical store sales now stands at approximately negative 5%. This puts total sales at approximately $38 billion for the year. Our capital plan of $700 million remains unchanged, although we have decided to extend slightly the time line for our in-store merchandising initiative, initially planned for 300 stores since fiscal '11. These projects were back-end loaded in our initial plans, and the completion of our pilot store testing will now delay a broader rollout into fiscal '12. However, as Craig mentioned, we now see a 50-50 mix of corporate to license stores for our new Save-A-Lot. So our capital spending will remain at approximately $700 million. 
Our debt reduction goal also remains unchanged at $600 million and assumes capital spending of $700 million. This would place our debt-to-capital ratio under 70%, an important step on our path to returning to investment grade. So while first quarter sales were slightly softer than we had expected, we believe the plans we have in place around sales, margin and expenses will keep us on pace to deliver earnings per share guidance for other onetime items and achieve our debt reduction goal. We now anticipate $0.07 per share in charges for the Connecticut and Cincinnati market exits and $0.07 from the labor dispute for a total of $0.14 for the year. 
As we stated with our initial guidance, we expect the first half of fiscal '11 to be considerably more challenging than the second half based on our view of the economy and the building of our marketing, merchandising and operational initiatives. 
Before I turn the call back to Craig, I want to share with you my decision to leave SUPERVALU in order to pursue new career interest. Craig and I have discussed this over the past year and believe that now is an appropriate time to make this transition since we are both comfortable that SUPERVALU has the proper financial systems, policies and procedures in place, and we have taken the steps necessary to ensure the company's financial flexibility for the long term. From all perspectives, now is an ideal time to make this move. 
As you will recall, over the past year, we have issued $1 billion of public notes, rightsized our dividend policy, amended and extended our revolving credit facilities, as well as introduce Craig and his strategic vision to our many stakeholders. Having served SUPERVALU for almost 13 years, I am ready for new challenges and have much left to accomplish in my career. I have greatly enjoyed my time with this company and feel privileged to have played a leadership role in transforming SUPERVALU from a predominantly supply chain enterprise into a major supermarket retailer. 
In that regard, the acquisition and integration of Albertsons and the SUPERVALU family will always be one of my proudest professional accomplishments. I have enjoyed working with Craig since his arrival and wish Craig and his team the very best. I remain confident in his leadership and vision and know the company is in excellent financial shape for the long term. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Craig."

I'm especially grateful that you delayed your decision to depart until I had a deeper appreciation of the organization and its various components. Your presence and stewardship over the past year were especially important as I focused on the operational issues. 
On a personal note, I understand the decision Pam made, and I wish her well. She's been a part of the company and has been the company's face for the financial community and has been instrumental in providing leadership and a strong financial discipline for this company during her tenure. 
With regard to her successor, the company has already retained a search firm and expects to fill the CFO position by the time of our second quarter call. I'm pleased to say that Pam will be available to us to provide a smooth and seamless transition. Thank you again, Pam. 
To wrap things up, I did want to address our outlook for the balance of the year. First, we are revising our guidance on identical store sales to negative 5% for the fiscal year. Full year sales are now projected to be at $38 billion. Second, we have accelerated our time line to achieve 50 basis points of savings from S&A. These savings will be realized by year end and help offset ongoing cost increases, including healthcare and pensions. Finally, I remain comfortable with our prior adjusted EPS range of $1.75 to $1.95 per share before onetime items. I would reiterate that earnings should continue to firm throughout the balance of the year. 
In closing, let me say that we are gaining positive momentum across our organization as we continue to write our course. We have a lot of work in front of us, but I have confidence in my team and we know where we must go. This effort will take time, but when it's completed, it will be fundamentally altering the course of this company and the trajectory of our earnings. 
With that, I'd now like to open up the call to your questions."

Our Senior Vice President of Finance, Sherry Smith, has been leading a team who's really tracking this and holding us accountable to it, so I do feel good about that. The other part your question really is about gross margin stabilization. And when Steve Jungmann arrived here earlier this year, one of the first things we did was we actually centralized the accountability for our retails. And as that's taken hold, we've really seen a nice stabilization of gross margins. I'm actually very, very pleased with the performance that group has put behind that effort and really gives us now the opportunity to focus on our promotional plans and making sure that we're driving effective promotions for our consumers."

The power sale light has been a very, very cool event for us as we begin to demonstrate to the vendor community that we can actually move product in real, real significant volumes, leveraging the scale listing. And then Pete Van Helden, his team just doing a great job of focusing on customer satisfaction. So there's no sort of one magic bullet.

So that's we're focused on as opposed to focus on any particular market where we might have some people. We are focused, to answer first part of your question, I think, Meredith, both on in-store labor and that's kind of a really interesting thing because it's not just Pete and his team. It's really a combination of we have to buy right. So I talk about the SKU rationalization. I believe we went into some detail in the last quarterly call. We had one really significant category where I think we had 90 SKUs where we could not fit a full case on the shelf at a time. Of course, when that happens across the 1,200 stores, that means that you're just putting massive labor out there each time you have to stop that shelf. So as we correct those initiatives, that actually makes it easier for the operating team to control their expenses. And as we correct those initiatives, it helps with Janel and her team in supply-chain to more efficiently and effectively run the distribution centers and build the trucks. So it's sort of on all-encompassing program that we look at to really get at store level savings. And that's really a different stream than the corporate stuff that I spoke of earlier. So we have the two streams going at the same time."

The next area of the cost reduction would be around simplifying our business processes. He didn't want to be specific about corporate administrative-type items. But clearly, we're looking at ways to simplify those business processes. We have been investing in systems. And with Wayne on board, we should be able to -- we're continuing to make progress on moving to common systems and platforms, which will eliminate a lot of the complexity out of our business.

That is, we have not made short-term decisions that we're going to have to undo in the future quarter in order to run our business. We are making long-term sustainable cost reductions. A lot of it, as I think through your question, comes back to the change in strategy that we articulated last year, we're instead of thinking about our company at sort of three different divisions that run independently of each other, remember we talked about, we're America is neighborhood grocery, we run 4,300 stores, some of which are independently owned, some are licensees, some are hard discount, some are traditional. And as we think about our business that way, we've been able to leverage a lot of back office expenses that were redundant in the past, and that could be things like goods that for resale under Janel's leadership, we've seen some real nice savings, a very talented group of people who work in her organization, driving out cost in goods that for resale because now we're talking as one as opposed to as a whole different group. As we look at all kinds of supply-chain initiatives, as we look at under adhering organization, when we look at store development, we now look at that holistically. So we get some savings there under Julie's organization, we now look at marketing, holistically. So it's just simple things like how we negotiate with our partners who are working with us on buying media and paper and things of that nature, significant savings because we look at our business differently and we have people centrally who are empowered now to drive those savings.

As you read in today's release, SUPERVALU reported earnings per share of $0.43 for the first quarter of fiscal '11, which excludes the impact of onetime items. This was a tough quarter for us but one that",2142,"Well, thank you, Ken, and good morning, everybody. As you read in today's release, SUPERVALU reported earnings per share of $0.43 for the first quarter of fiscal '11, which excludes the impact of onetime items. This was a tough quarter for us but one that ushered in positive operational progress. 
Despite weak top line sales and expense deleveraging, we controlled our margins well and continued to take cost out of the business. First, let me provide some color on our ID sales. Excluding Shaw's, due to the labor dispute which was resolved earlier this month, ID sales declined 6.5% year-over-year. To put this in context, we're cycling last year's heavy promotional period, and the consumer remained stretched. 
Since the beginning of the year, our merchandising, marketing and retail operations teams have worked collaboratively to improve value perception at store level, and our efforts to control margins have begun to show tangible signs of traction. The 10 basis-point improvement to gross margin during the quarter reflects more effective promotional spending, which was partially offset by price investment. 
For the quarter, the percent of items sold on promotion was down approximately 100 basis points from a year earlier. Over the long term, we believe this work will help us drive sales, restore customer confidence in our brand position and be more deliberative with our promotional activities. Though much work remains, I do want to provide a candid update of the progress we're making. 
In merchandising, we've identified a number of opportunities to better leverage our extensive store network. One particular opportunity that I have spoken to before is SUPERVALU's network-wide promotional events for power sale items. Today, I'm able to provide you an update on two events we completed this past quarter. 
In May, we successfully ran a national sales promotion on Soup across our 4,300 store network, including Save-A-Lot and our independent retailers. This promotion drove several million incremental unit sales within the category. In June, this event was followed by a similar promotion in the Cereal category. 
Both power sale events went well, met sales targets and serve as an initial marker for our vendor partners that SUPERVALU can execute company-wide programs and move product quickly. Each successful event builds vendor confidence in our company-wide capabilities and should ultimately level the playing field with others in the industry. Our 4,300 store network is a distinct advantage that further differentiate SUPERVALU from its competitors. 
Another refinement to our merchandising strategy focuses on everyday pricing in select categories to maximize sales and generate labor efficiencies. Across the store, we have a number of product groups that can best be described as convenience items. They don't necessarily drive foot traffic or incremental store purchases, but our customers have come to expect them as part of the store assortment. These products require a high level of labor maintenance when promoted though their demand profile is relatively inelastic. 
Over the next few months, we will begin offering these products at constant everyday prices rather than employing promotional cycles. Pricing will be competitive, and this change will allow us to realize significant incremental labor efficiencies. 
To illustrate, today, our store associates spent countless hours changing shelf tags across 140 SKU category throughout our 1,200 store traditional network several times a month. A constant price strategy will eliminate or redirect these labor hours to customer-facing activities. However, brands are another important component of our effort to drive incremental sales. 
Last quarter, I talked about our decision to bring SUPERVALU's private brand activities in-house. Additionally, we've corrected pricing and imposed new shelf placement disciplines company-wide. Since making these changes, I'm pleased to point out that our private brand penetration rose above 18%, moving us closer to our year-end target of 20%. For the quarter, unit sales were north of just 20%. 
At SUPERVALU, customers are shopping our private brands with increasing frequency. Our entry-level price point offering, Shoppers Value, is also gaining greater traction with the independent retailers we service through our Supply Chain business. Year-to-date, this brand is up 19% with our independent retailers. 
As customers discover the quality of our offerings, we are building product loyalty that we believe will outlast the current economic cycle. We estimate that customers can save about $450 per year by selecting our private brands over national brand alternatives. 
Moving to SKU rationalization. There's been a great deal of attention and discussion around this initiative, both for SUPERVALU and across the retail industry at large. Today, I want to be clear about what SKU rationalization is for SUPERVALU, how we approach this discipline and what it means to our shoppers. As SUPERVALU executes its SKU initiative, we have a well-defined vision for each center-store category. First, it is to offer variety in each category. Second is to avoid product redundancy and improve shelf space for offerings that are locally relevant. Next is to get the appropriate facings for private brand products. And finally, we seek to enhance labor productivity and curtail excess inventory. 
The discipline with which we have executed this program to date allows us to improve in-stock positions on high-velocity items, continue to maintain a wide assortment of products and create labor efficiencies. To be successful, we have to be flexible. Running an algorithm or a spreadsheet will not tell you how each customer is affected by these changes. 
We expect that new sets will need tweaking. It's a normal part of process and a healthy way to better understand and meet the unique needs of each community in which we operate. Whether we've made decisions that are unpopular with a number of shoppers, we go back and fix our assortment. Ultimately, we are confident that our methodical approach will result in efficiently run stores that carry a product assortment customized for the communities they serve. 
To illustrate, let me call out one category, Oral Care, from which we removed about 20% of the SKUs. The vast majority of these edits related to tube size and slow-moving flavors. We did, however, remove some tertiary brands within each Oral Care segment. Where there was an impact to our customers, we made adjustments. Let me also add that following the reset, sales in this category improved 2.4%. Through the end of the first quarter, we completely reset 31 center-store categories and touched over 900 stores. 
Next, let me provide an update on our project focused on improving the shopping experience in our traditional retail stores. Our goal is to simplify the shopping experience for all of our customers by making our product offering clear and our stores more inviting. Some aspects of this program will be evidenced sooner than others. For example, we've already redesigned shelf tags, improved signage and are communicating our brand position and product selection more clearly. Other aspects will take more time as we fine-tune implementation to appropriately fit the banner and locality store. 
Last quarter, we projected that we would complete 300 stores this fiscal year. In addition, with our commitment to ensure we make the right decisions, we are extending the time line for completing these stores by about three to six months. This will provide us ample time to study additional pilot stores that are varying sizes and serve different demographics to improve execution for a broader rollout over the coming years. 
Since March, Julie Dexter Berg, our Chief Marketing Officer, has begun to map out a new strategy for SUPERVALU that improves our market position and reinvigorates our emotional engagement with customers. These programs will sharpen the brand position for each of our banner brands and leverage all channels available to us to converse with our customers about who we are and what we stand for. I look forward to shedding more light on these activities on our next call, and I'm confident that at that time, we will have realized improvements in consumer messaging, which will heighten the awareness of our brands. 
Across our organization and customer-facing initiatives, information technology plays a key role. I'm very excited about the work being led by our new CIO, Wayne Shurts. Since joining SUPERVALU in April, Wayne has launched activities enterprise-wide that will provide immediate benefits for this fiscal year. With Wayne's leadership, we are taking a closer look at the status of our merchandising system implementation. While a number of foundational applications are already up and running, we're evaluating staffing and other applications to re-prioritize those rollouts that will have the greatest near-term impact. 
Over the long term, our priorities for information technology remain the same, to support a centralized merchandising organization while simplifying the business processes for our banners and stores. 
As you know, I continue to be very excited about the prospects for growth and innovation within our Save-A-Lot organization. Bill Shaner, President and CEO for Save-A-Lot, has been leading a number of strategic opportunities to extend Save-A-Lot's brand equity in existing markets and better position this hard-discount format in the neighborhoods it serves. The Save-A-Lot model is built on efficiency and harnessing a strong distribution network with limited SKU assortment to offer customers everyday low prices at retail. Still, Save-A-Lot must work in each community to be hyper-local and establish a degree of customer intimacy that drives loyalty and brand recognition. 
Structurally, we've done a good job of leveraging resources to improve internal planning capabilities that can help facilitate and accelerate Save-A-Lot's growth. By aligning our Business Development and Real Estate teams into a single organization, we are more effectively identifying new markets, store locations and licensees. Bill and I agree that these are all critical ingredients to Save-A-Lot's growth trajectory. 
You previously heard me speak to our cost initiative called, let the building be the building, which allows licensees to open stores with significantly less capital. Another way we're making investment proposition more attractive for licensees is through a new incentive program, which offers upfront cash incentives or rebates based upon anticipated sales. With 100 new locations planned for this fiscal year and about half of these stores scheduled to be opened by licensees, these programs will help to improve the return on their investments. 
Going forward, we believe we have significant opportunity to expand our base of licensees beyond traditional retailers. We've added talent to our development teams specifically to attract non-traditional retailers into the Save-A-Lot network, who otherwise might have opted for other franchise-oriented opportunities. Outreach to mainstream entrepreneurs is a significant focus for Save-A-Lot and will help us to double our store count by fiscal 2015. 
Our Save-A-Lot plans for this year remained on track and include particular emphasis on Southeastern United States, with over half of this year's stores planned for the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. Save-A-Lot will also continue to back drop [ph] markets where we have existing infrastructure to manage this growth and where the Save-A-Lot brand has built a loyal following in cities such as Detroit, Cleveland and Philadelphia. In these particular markets, Save-A-Lot can successfully build nutritional gaps and meet the needs of local consumers for low-priced, high-quality groceries in urban food deserts. 
Equally exciting are the new ways Save-A-Lot is developing strategically to serve different population demographics. Let me share with you an example of how we are bringing this vision to life. 
Houston and South Texas are relatively new markets for Save-A-Lot and are each defined by their significant Hispanic populations. As Save-A-Lot explored opportunities to customize stores that resonate with this demographic, the Save-A-Lot team decided to enter into a relationship that will allow us to learn about marketing and merchandising to this population. 
Today, Save-A-Lot has formed an affiliation with Rafael Ortega, a grocer with more than 24 years of experience serving shoppers in South Texas through multiple grocery retail enterprises. Mr. Ortega has a deep understanding of the need and expectations of this rapidly growing Hispanic community and a developed business model that is highly compatible with the Save-A-Lot format. 
As part of this relationship, Save-A-Lot has rebranded six stores in Texas as El Ahorro Save-A-Lot. The stores will showcase Save-A-Lot's hard discount pricing and easy to navigate floor plan. The shopping experience will be enhanced with hyper-local product selection that is fundamental to Mr. Ortega's retail experience. 
In an El Ahorro Save-A-Lot, Save-A-Lot will supply center-store items while Ms. Ortega will source the specific meats, cheeses and produce to satisfy the unique taste of these communities. This is a very exciting partnership for us and one that allow SUPERVALU to learn more about the Hispanic community. It should also help Save-A-Lot continue to deliver an overall return on invested capital of greater than 30% to our company. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Pam Knous, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide some comments on our first quarter performance and SUPERVALU's financial condition. I will then follow up with some closing remarks."

Today, I will be covering our first quarter operating results, our financial condition and updated fiscal '11 guidance. Starting with our income statement, quarter one net sales were $11.5 billion compared t",1368,"Thank you, Craig, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will be covering our first quarter operating results, our financial condition and updated fiscal '11 guidance. 
Starting with our income statement, quarter one net sales were $11.5 billion compared to $12.7 billion last year. This 9.2% decline was primarily the result of three items. First, identical store sales declined by 7.2%. Excluding Shaw's, which was impacted by a labor dispute for much of the quarter, IDs were negative 6.5%. Second, the impact from previously announced retail store closures, including the submarket exits in Salt Lake City, Connecticut and Cincinnati, and finally, Target's transition to self distribution. 
Our ID sales were driven by a 3.5% decline in customer count and a 3.0% decrease in average transaction size. Customer count declined modestly from the fourth quarter. Compared to Q1 last year, we did cycle the introduction of Big Relief in Chicago, Southern California and Las Vegas in addition to a period of ineffective promotions which all drove traffic last year. 
In contrast, transaction size improved modestly from the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the first quarter reflected favorable trends in both trade-down and inflation, which were offset by additional investments in price and fewer items per basket. In quarter one, for the first time in the past 10 quarters, trade-down was essentially flat, representing a 100 basis-point improvement from quarter one fiscal '10. Cost inflation ran about 90 basis points. 
We also made price investments in the quarter that included: A price cut program at Cub Foods, where we reduced everyday prices on thousands of items across the store; Save-A-Lot, where we lowered prices on a number of items, most notably in dairy; company-wide adjustments to private brands as price spreads were corrected in the fourth quarter of fiscal '10; and our broader initiative to bring reasonable everyday pricing to our customers as we continue to migrate away from an extreme high-low strategy. The balance of the change in average ticket was driven by customers buying fewer items per visit, which was again down by nearly one half item per order. We attribute this decline to cycling the Big Relief and our promotional efforts from last year. 
Moving to operating earnings before onetime items, retail food was 3.0% of sales compared to 3.1% last year. This decline was driven primarily by lower sales and the impact of deleveraging on expenses. It is important to note that we have removed over $40 million in cost from our business since the beginning of the year and plan to finish the year achieving savings of roughly $160 million. Note that this savings estimate does not include cost of goods initiatives. 
Supply chain services delivered an operating margin of 3.0% of sales compared to last year's 2.9%. We remain pleased with the contributions of our supply chain business, which continues to aggressively manage expenses and produce stable earnings. 
Though small, I do want to mention corporate expenses. Corporate expenses were $29 million this quarter compared to $26 million in the prior year, excluding onetime items. In the current quarter, we absorbed $9 million of charges related to non-operating properties. 
For the quarter, reported earnings per share was $0.31 per diluted share and included $0.12 in onetime charges, with $0.07 related to our market exit in Connecticut and Cincinnati and $0.05 attributable to the impact of the labor strike that affected Shaw's. 
Turning to our financial condition. We finished the first quarter with total debt outstanding of $7.4 billion, down by roughly $235 million from year end and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 72%. Inventory days supply fell by almost a full day compared to last year's quarter one, partly due to the benefits of SKU rationalization. We remain in compliance with our debt covenants with trailing 12-month EBIT of $1.2 billion, excluding impairment and other non-operating charges. 
Depreciation and amortization was $0.9 billion and rent expense amounted to $0.4 billion. Recall that with the April 5 amendment and extension of our senior credit facility, the two covenants related to our credit agreement reset to less-restrictive levels. For fiscal '11, our interest coverage ratio must be greater than 2.20x and our leverage ratio must be less than 4.25x. Current year maturities are $611 million, which will primarily be repaid from internally generated funds. 
I would now like to provide two brief comments on performance of our store remodels and customer satisfaction surveys. With regard to the performance of recently remodeled stores, our first-year remodel showed an average lift of nearly 3% when compared to other stores in their respective markets. Stores cycling their one-year opening were up close to 200 basis points in their second year. In our competitive customer tracking study, our customer satisfaction scores improved in eight out of the nine banners we track. Let me provide some comments on our fiscal '11 guidance. 
Our first quarter sales were softer than we had anticipated, but with new leadership within our marketing and merchandising teams, we do have plans in place to help drive volume during the balance of the year. Our updated full year guidance for identical store sales now stands at approximately negative 5%. This puts total sales at approximately $38 billion for the year. Our capital plan of $700 million remains unchanged, although we have decided to extend slightly the time line for our in-store merchandising initiative, initially planned for 300 stores since fiscal '11. These projects were back-end loaded in our initial plans, and the completion of our pilot store testing will now delay a broader rollout into fiscal '12. However, as Craig mentioned, we now see a 50-50 mix of corporate to licensed stores for our new Save-A-Lots. So our capital spending will remain at approximately $700 million. 
Our debt reduction goal also remains unchanged at $600 million and assumes capital spending of $700 million. This would place our debt-to-capital ratio under 70%, an important step on our path to returning to investment grade. So while first quarter sales were slightly softer than we had expected, we believe the plans we have in place around sales, margin and expenses will keep us on pace to deliver earnings per share guidance for other onetime items and achieve our debt reduction goal. We now anticipate $0.07 per share in charges for the Connecticut and Cincinnati market exits and $0.07 from the labor dispute for a total of $0.14 for the year. 
As we stated with our initial guidance, we expect the first half of fiscal '11 to be considerably more challenging than the second half based on our view of the economy and the building of our marketing, merchandising and operational initiatives. 
Before I turn the call back to Craig, I want to share with you my decision to leave SUPERVALU in order to pursue new career interest. Craig and I have discussed this over the past year and believe that now is an appropriate time to make the transition since we are both comfortable that SUPERVALU has the proper financial systems, policies and procedures in place, and we have taken the steps necessary to ensure the company's financial flexibility for the long term. From all perspectives, now is an ideal time to make this move. 
As you will recall, over the past year, we have issued $1 billion of public notes, rightsized our dividend policy, amended and extended our revolving credit facilities, as well as introduce Craig and his strategic vision to our many stakeholders. Having served SUPERVALU for almost 13 years, I am ready for new challenges and have much left to accomplish in my career. I have greatly enjoyed my time with this company and feel privileged to have played a leadership role in transforming SUPERVALU from a predominantly supply chain enterprise into a major supermarket retailer. 
In that regard, the acquisition and integration of Albertsons and the SUPERVALU family will always be one of my proudest professional accomplishments. I have enjoyed working with Craig since his arrival and wish Craig and his team the very best. I remain confident in his leadership and vision and know the company is in excellent financial shape for the long term. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Craig."

On a personal note, I understand the decision Pam made, and I wish her well. She's been a part of the company and has been the company's face for the financial community and has been instrumental in providing leadership and a strong financial discipline for this company during her tenure. 
With regard to her successor, the company has already retained a search firm and expects to fill the CFO position by the time of our second quarter call. I'm pleased to say that Pam will be available to us to provide a smooth and seamless transition. Thank you again, Pam. 
To wrap things up, I did want to address our outlook for the balance of the year. First, we are revising our guidance on identical store sales to negative 5% for the fiscal year. Full year sales are now projected to be at $38 billion. Second, we have accelerated our time line to achieve 50 basis points of savings from S&A. These savings will be realized by year end and help offset ongoing cost increases, including healthcare and pensions. Finally, I remain comfortable with our prior adjusted EPS range of $1.75 to $1.95 per share before onetime items. I would reiterate that earnings should continue to firm throughout the balance of the year. 
In closing, let me say that we are gaining positive momentum across our organization as we continue to write our course. We have a lot of work in front of us, but I have confidence in my team and we know where we must go. This effort will take time, but when it's completed, it will be fundamentally altering the course of this company and the trajectory of our earnings.

Our Senior Vice President of Finance, Sherry Smith, has been leading a team who's really tracking this and holding us accountable to it, so I do feel good about that. The other part your question really is about gross margin stabilization. And when Steve Jungmann arrived here earlier this year, one of the first things we did was we actually centralized the accountability for our retails. And as that's taken hold, we've really seen a nice stabilization of gross margins. I'm actually very, very pleased with the performance that group has put behind that effort and really gives us now the opportunity to focus on our promotional plans and making sure that we're driving effective promotions for our consumers."

We are focused, to answer first part of your question, I think, Meredith, both on in-store labor and that's kind of a really interesting thing because it's not just Pete and his team. It's really a combination of we have to buy right. So I talk about the SKU rationalization. I believe we went into some detail in the last quarterly call. We had one really significant category where I think we had 90 SKUs where we could not fit a full case on the shelf at a time. Of course, when that happens across the 1,200 stores, that means that you're just putting massive labor out there each time you have to stop that shelf. So as we correct those initiatives, that actually makes it easier for the operating team to control their expenses. And as we correct those initiatives, it helps with Janel and her team in supply-chain to more efficiently and effectively run the distribution centers and build the trucks. So it's sort of on all-encompassing program that we look at to really get at store level savings. And that's really a different stream than the corporate stuff that I spoke of earlier.

And as we think about our business that way, we've been able to leverage a lot of back office expenses that were redundant in the past, and that could be things like goods that for resale under Janel's leadership, we've seen some real nice savings, a very talented group of people who work in her organization, driving out cost in goods that for resale because now we're talking as one as opposed to as a whole different group. As we look at all kinds of supply-chain initiatives, as we look at under adhering organization, when we look at store development, we now look at that holistically.

As you read in today's release, SUPERVALU reported earnings per share of $0.43 for the first quarter of fiscal '11, which excludes the impact of onetime items. This was a tough quarter for us but one tha",2143," Well, thank you, Ken, and good morning, everybody. As you read in today's release, SUPERVALU reported earnings per share of $0.43 for the first quarter of fiscal '11, which excludes the impact of onetime items. This was a tough quarter for us but one that ushered in positive operational progress.
 Despite weak top line sales and expense deleveraging, we controlled our margins well and continued to take cost out of the business. First, let me provide some color on our ID sales. Excluding Shaw's, due to the labor dispute which was resolved earlier this month, ID sales declined 6.5% year-over-year. To put this in context, we're cycling last year's heavy promotional period, and the consumer remained stretched.
 Since the beginning of the year, our merchandising, marketing and retail operations teams have worked collaboratively to improve value perception at store level, and our efforts to control margins have begun to show tangible signs of traction. The 10 basis-point improvement to gross margin during the quarter reflects more effective promotional spending, which was partially offset by price investment.
 For the quarter, the percent of items sold on promotion was down approximately 100 basis points from a year earlier. Over the long term, we believe this work will help us drive sales, restore customer confidence in our brand position and be more deliberative with our promotional activities. Though much work remains, I do want to provide a candid update of the progress we're making.
 In merchandising, we've identified a number of opportunities to better leverage our extensive store network. One particular opportunity that I have spoken to before is SUPERVALU's network-wide promotional events for power sale items. Today, I'm able to provide you an update on two events we completed this past quarter.
 In May, we successfully ran a national sales promotion on Soup across our 4,300 store network, including Save-A-Lot and our independent retailers. This promotion drove several million incremental unit sales within the category. In June, this event was followed by a similar promotion in the Cereal category.
 Both power sale events went well, met sales targets and serve as an initial marker for our vendor partners that SUPERVALU can execute company-wide programs and move product quickly. Each successful event builds vendor confidence in our company-wide capabilities and should ultimately level the playing field with others in the industry. Our 4,300 store network is a distinct advantage that further differentiate SUPERVALU from its competitors.
 Another refinement to our merchandising strategy focuses on everyday pricing in select categories to maximize sales and generate labor efficiencies. Across the store, we have a number of product groups that can best be described as convenience items. They don't necessarily drive foot traffic or incremental store purchases, but our customers have come to expect them as part of the store assortment. These products require a high level of labor maintenance when promoted though their demand profile is relatively inelastic.
 Over the next few months, we will begin offering these products at constant everyday prices rather than employing promotional cycles. Pricing will be competitive, and this change will allow us to realize significant incremental labor efficiencies.
 To illustrate, today, our store associates spent countless hours changing shelf tags across 140 SKU category throughout our 1,200 store traditional network several times a month. A constant price strategy will eliminate or redirect these labor hours to customer-facing activities. However, brands are another important component of our effort to drive incremental sales.
 Last quarter, I talked about our decision to bring SUPERVALU's private brand activities in-house. Additionally, we've corrected pricing and imposed new shelf placement disciplines company-wide. Since making these changes, I'm pleased to point out that our private brand penetration rose above 18%, moving us closer to our year-end target of 20%. For the quarter, unit sales were north of just 20%.
 At SUPERVALU, customers are shopping our private brands with increasing frequency. Our entry-level price point offering, Shoppers Value, is also gaining greater traction with the independent retailers we service through our Supply Chain business. Year-to-date, this brand is up 19% with our independent retailers.
 As customers discover the quality of our offerings, we are building product loyalty that we believe will outlast the current economic cycle. We estimate that customers can save about $450 per year by selecting our private brands over national brand alternatives.
 Moving to SKU rationalization. There's been a great deal of attention and discussion around this initiative, both for SUPERVALU and across the retail industry at large. Today, I want to be clear about what SKU rationalization is for SUPERVALU, how we approach this discipline and what it means to our shoppers. As SUPERVALU executes its SKU initiative, we have a well-defined vision for each center-store category. First, it is to offer variety in each category. Second is to avoid product redundancy and improve shelf space for offerings that are locally relevant. Next is to get the appropriate facings for private brand products. And finally, we seek to enhance labor productivity and curtail excess inventory.
 The discipline with which we have executed this program to date allows us to improve in-stock positions on high-velocity items, continue to maintain a wide assortment of products and create labor efficiencies. To be successful, we have to be flexible. Running an algorithm or a spreadsheet will not tell you how each customer is affected by these changes.
 We expect that new sets will need tweaking. It's a normal part of process and a healthy way to better understand and meet the unique needs of each community in which we operate. Whether we've made decisions that are unpopular with a number of shoppers, we go back and fix our assortment. Ultimately, we are confident that our methodical approach will result in efficiently run stores that carry a product assortment customized for the communities they serve.
 To illustrate, let me call out one category, Oral Care, from which we removed about 20% of the SKUs. The vast majority of these edits related to tube size and slow-moving flavors. We did, however, remove some tertiary brands within each Oral Care segment. Where there was an impact to our customers, we made adjustments. Let me also add that following the reset, sales in this category improved 2.4%. Through the end of the first quarter, we completely reset 31 center-store categories and touched over 900 stores.
 Next, let me provide an update on our project focused on improving the shopping experience in our traditional retail stores. Our goal is to simplify the shopping experience for all of our customers by making our product offering clear and our stores more inviting. Some aspects of this program will be evidenced sooner than others. For example, we've already redesigned shelf tags, improved signage and are communicating our brand position and product selection more clearly. Other aspects will take more time as we fine-tune implementation to appropriately fit the banner and locality store.
 Last quarter, we projected that we would complete 300 stores this fiscal year. In addition, with our commitment to ensure we make the right decisions, we are extending the time line for completing these stores by about three to six months. This will provide us ample time to study additional pilot stores that are varying sizes and serve different demographics to improve execution for a broader rollout over the coming years.
 Since March, Julie Dexter Berg, our Chief Marketing Officer, has begun to map out a new strategy for SUPERVALU that improves our market position and reinvigorates our emotional engagement with customers. These programs will sharpen the brand position for each of our banner brands and leverage all channels available to us to converse with our customers about who we are and what we stand for. I look forward to shedding more light on these activities on our next call, and I'm confident that at that time, we will have realized improvements in consumer messaging, which will heighten the awareness of our brands.
 Across our organization and customer-facing initiatives, information technology plays a key role. I'm very excited about the work being led by our new CIO, Wayne Shurts. Since joining SUPERVALU in April, Wayne has launched activities enterprise-wide that will provide immediate benefits for this fiscal year. With Wayne's leadership, we are taking a closer look at the status of our merchandising system implementation. While a number of foundational applications are already up and running, we're evaluating staffing and other applications to re-prioritize those rollouts that will have the greatest near-term impact.
 Over the long term, our priorities for information technology remain the same, to support a centralized merchandising organization while simplifying the business processes for our banners and stores.
 As you know, I continue to be very excited about the prospects for growth and innovation within our Save-A-Lot organization. Bill Shaner, President and CEO for Save-A-Lot, has been leading a number of strategic opportunities to extend Save-A-Lot's brand equity in existing markets and better position this hard-discount format in the neighborhoods it serves. The Save-A-Lot model is built on efficiency and harnessing a strong distribution network with limited SKU assortment to offer customers everyday low prices at retail. Still, Save-A-Lot must work in each community to be hyper-local and establish a degree of customer intimacy that drives loyalty and brand recognition.
 Structurally, we've done a good job of leveraging resources to improve internal planning capabilities that can help facilitate and accelerate Save-A-Lot's growth. By aligning our Business Development and Real Estate teams into a single organization, we are more effectively identifying new markets, store locations and licensees. Bill and I agree that these are all critical ingredients to Save-A-Lot's growth trajectory.
 You previously heard me speak to our cost initiative called, let the building be the building, which allows licensees to open stores with significantly less capital. Another way we're making investment proposition more attractive for licensees is through a new incentive program, which offers upfront cash incentives or rebates based upon anticipated sales. With 100 new locations planned for this fiscal year and about half of these stores scheduled to be opened by licensees, these programs will help to improve the return on their investments.
 Going forward, we believe we have significant opportunity to expand our base of licensees beyond traditional retailers. We've added talent to our development teams specifically to attract non-traditional retailers into the Save-A-Lot network, who otherwise might have opted for other franchise-oriented opportunities. Outreach to mainstream entrepreneurs is a significant focus for Save-A-Lot and will help us to double our store count by fiscal 2015.
 Our Save-A-Lot plans for this year remained on track and include particular emphasis on Southeastern United States, with over half of this year's stores planned for the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. Save-A-Lot will also continue to back drop [ph] markets where we have existing infrastructure to manage this growth and where the Save-A-Lot brand has built a loyal following in cities such as Detroit, Cleveland and Philadelphia. In these particular markets, Save-A-Lot can successfully build nutritional gaps and meet the needs of local consumers for low-priced, high-quality groceries in urban food deserts.
 Equally exciting are the new ways Save-A-Lot is developing strategically to serve different population demographics. Let me share with you an example of how we are bringing this vision to life.
 Houston and South Texas are relatively new markets for Save-A-Lot and are each defined by their significant Hispanic populations. As Save-A-Lot explored opportunities to customize stores that resonate with this demographic, the Save-A-Lot team decided to enter into a relationship that will allow us to learn about marketing and merchandising to this population.
 Today, Save-A-Lot has formed an affiliation with Rafael Ortega, a grocer with more than 24 years of experience serving shoppers in South Texas through multiple grocery retail enterprises. Mr. Ortega has a deep understanding of the need and expectations of this rapidly growing Hispanic community and a developed business model that is highly compatible with the Save-A-Lot format.
 As part of this relationship, Save-A-Lot has re-branded six stores in Texas as El Ahorro Save-A-Lot. The stores will showcase Save-A-Lot's hard discount pricing and easy to navigate floor plan. The shopping experience will be enhanced with hyper-local product selection that is fundamental to Mr. Ortega's retail experience.
 In an El Ahorro Save-A-Lot, Save-A-Lot will supply center-store items while Ms. Ortega will source the specific meats, cheeses and produce to satisfy the unique taste of these communities. This is a very exciting partnership for us and one that will allow SUPERVALU to learn more about the Hispanic community. It should also help Save-A-Lot continue to deliver an overall return on invested capital of greater than 30% to our company.
 With that, let me now turn the call over to Pam Knous, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide some comments on our first quarter performance and SUPERVALU's financial condition. I will then follow up with some closing remarks.

Today, I will be covering our first quarter operating results, our financial condition and updated fiscal '11 guidance. Starting with our income statement, quarter one net sales were $11.5 billion compared",1367," Thank you, Craig, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will be covering our first quarter operating results, our financial condition and updated fiscal '11 guidance.
 Starting with our income statement, quarter one net sales were $11.5 billion compared to $12.7 billion last year. This 9.2% decline was primarily the result of three items. First, identical store sales declined by 7.2%. Excluding Shaw's, which was impacted by a labor dispute for much of the quarter, IDs were negative 6.5%. Second, the impact from previously announced retail store closures, including the submarket exits in Salt Lake City, Connecticut and Cincinnati, and finally, Target's transition to self distribution.
 Our ID sales were driven by a 3.5% decline in customer count and a 3.0% decrease in average transaction size. Customer count declined modestly from the fourth quarter. Compared to Q1 last year, we did cycle the introduction of Big Relief in Chicago, Southern California and Las Vegas in addition to a period of ineffective promotions which all drove traffic last year.
 In contrast, transaction size improve modestly from the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the first quarter reflected favorable trends in both trade-down and inflation, which were offset by additional investments in price and fewer items per basket. In quarter one, for the first time in the past 10 quarters, trade-down was essentially flat, representing a 100 basis-point improvement from quarter one fiscal '10. Cost inflation ran about 90 basis points.
 We also made price investments in the quarter that included: A price cut program at Cub Foods, where we reduced everyday prices on thousands of items across the store; Save-A-Lot, where we lowered prices on a number of items, most notably in dairy; company-wide adjustments to private brands as price spreads were corrected in the fourth quarter of fiscal '10; and our broader initiative to bring reasonable everyday pricing to our customers as we continue to migrate away from an extreme high-low strategy. The balance of the change in average ticket was driven by customers buying fewer items per visit, which was again down by nearly one-half item per order. We attribute this decline to cycling the Big Relief and our promotional efforts from last year.
 Moving to operating earnings before onetime items, retail food was 3.0% of sales compared to 3.1% last year. This decline was driven primarily by lower sales and the impact of deleveraging on expenses. It is important to note that we have removed over $40 million in cost from our business since the beginning of the year and plan to finish the year achieving savings of roughly $160 million. Note that this savings estimate does not include cost of goods initiatives.
 Supply Chain services delivered an operating margin of 3.0% sales compared to last year's 2.9%. We remain pleased with the contributions of our Supply Chain business, which continues to aggressively manage expenses and produce stable earnings.
 Though small, I do want to mention corporate expenses. Corporate expenses were $29 million this quarter compared to $26 million in the prior year, excluding onetime items. In the current quarter, we absorbed $9 million of charges related to non-operating properties.
 For the quarter, reported earnings per share was $0.31 per diluted share and included $0.12 in onetime charges, with $0.07 related to our market exit in Connecticut and Cincinnati and a nickel attributable to the impact of the labor strike that affected Shaw's.
 Turning to our financial condition. We finished the first quarter with total debt outstanding of $7.4 billion, down by roughly $235 million from year end and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 72%. Inventory days supply fell by almost a full day compared to last year's quarter one, partly due to the benefits of SKU rationalization. We remain in compliance with our debt covenants with trailing 12-month EBIT of $1.2 billion, excluding impairment and other non-operating charges.
 Depreciation and amortization was $0.9 billion and rent expense amounted to $0.4 billion. Recall that with the April 5 amendment and extension of our senior credit facility, the two covenants related to our credit agreement reset to less-restrictive levels. For fiscal '11, our interest coverage ratio must be greater than 2.20x and our leverage ratio must be less than 4.25x. Current year maturities are $611 million, which will primarily be repaid from internally generated funds.
 I would now like to provide two brief comments on performance of our store remodels and customer satisfaction surveys. With regard to the performance of recently remodeled stores, our first-year remodel showed an average lift of nearly 3% when compared to other stores in their respective markets. Stores cycling their one-year opening were up close to 200 basis points in their second year. In our competitive customer tracking study, our customer satisfaction scores improved in eight out of the nine banners we track. Let me provide some comments on our fiscal '11 guidance.
 Our first quarter sales were softer than we had anticipated, but with new leadership within our marketing and merchandising teams, we do have plans in place to help drive volume during the balance of the year. Our updated full year guidance for identical store sales now stands at approximately negative 5%. This puts total sales at approximately $38 billion for the year. Our capital plan of $700 million remains unchanged, although we have decided to extend slightly the time line for our in-store merchandising initiative, initially planned for 300 stores since fiscal '11. These projects were back-end loaded in our initial plans, and the completion of our pilot store testing will now delay a broader rollout into fiscal '12. However, as Craig mentioned, we now see a 50-50 mix of corporate to license stores for our new Save-A-Lot. So our capital spending will remain at approximately $700 million.
 Our debt reduction goal also remains unchanged at $600 million and assumes capital spending of $700 million. This would place our debt-to-capital ratio under 70%, an important step on our path to returning to investment grade. So while first quarter sales were slightly softer than we had expected, we believe the plans we have in place around sales, margin and expenses will keep us on pace to deliver earnings per share guidance for other onetime items and achieve our debt reduction goal. We now anticipate $0.07 per share in charges for the Connecticut and Cincinnati market exits and $0.07 from the labor dispute for a total of $0.14 for the year.
 As we stated with our initial guidance, we expect the first half of fiscal '11 to be considerably more challenging than the second half based on our view of the economy and the building of our marketing, merchandising and operational initiatives.
 Before I turn the call back to Craig, I want to share with you my decision to leave SUPERVALU in order to pursue new career interest. Craig and I have discussed this over the past year and believe that now is an appropriate time to make this transition since we are both comfortable that SUPERVALU has the proper financial systems, policies and procedures in place, and we have taken the steps necessary to ensure the company's financial flexibility for the long term. From all perspectives, now is an ideal time to make this move.
 As you will recall, over the past year, we have issued $1 billion of public notes, rightsized our dividend policy, amended and extended our revolving credit facilities, as well as introduce Craig and his strategic vision to our many stakeholders. Having served SUPERVALU for almost 13 years, I am ready for new challenges and have much left to accomplish in my career. I have greatly enjoyed my time with this company and feel privileged to have played a leadership role in transforming SUPERVALU from a predominantly supply chain enterprise into a major supermarket retailer.
 In that regard, the acquisition and integration of Albertsons and the SUPERVALU family will always be one of my proudest professional accomplishments. I have enjoyed working with Craig since his arrival and wish Craig and his team the very best. I remain confident in his leadership and vision and know the company is in excellent financial shape for the long term.
 With that, I will turn the call back to Craig.

I'm especially grateful that you delayed your decision to depart until I had a deeper appreciation of the organization and its various components. Your presence and stewardship over the past year were especially important as I focused on the operational issues.
 On a personal note, I understand the decision Pam made, and I wish her well. She's been a part of the company and has been the company's face for the financial community and has been instrumental in providing leadership and a strong financial discipline for this company during her tenure.
 With regard to her successor, the company has already retained a search firm and expects to fill the CFO position by the time of our second quarter call. I'm pleased to say that Pam will be available to us to provide a smooth and seamless transition. Thank you again, Pam.
 To wrap things up, I did want to address our outlook for the balance of the year. First, we are revising our guidance on identical store sales to negative 5% for the fiscal year. Full year sales are now projected to be at $38 billion. Second, we have accelerated our time line to achieve 50 basis points of savings from S&A. These savings will be realized by year end and help offset ongoing cost increases, including healthcare and pensions. Finally, I remain comfortable with our prior adjusted EPS range of $1.75 to $1.95 per share before onetime items. I would reiterate that earnings should continue to firm throughout the balance of the year.
 In closing, let me say that we are gaining positive momentum across our organization as we continue to write our course. We have a lot of work in front of us, but I have confidence in my team and we know where we must go. This effort will take time, but when it's completed, it will be fundamentally altering the course of this company and the trajectory of our earnings.
 With that, I'd now like to open up the call to your questions.

Of course, when that happens across the 1,200 stores, that means that you're just putting massive labor out there each time you have to stop that shelf. So as we correct those initiatives, that actually makes it easier for the operating team to control their expenses. And as we correct those initiatives, it helps with Janel and her team in supply-chain to more efficiently and effectively run the distribution centers and build the trucks. So it's sort of on all-encompassing program that we look at to really get at store level savings. And that's really a different stream than the corporate stuff that I spoke of earlier. So we have the two streams going at the same time.

That is, we have not made short-term decisions that we're going to have to undo in the future quarter in order to run our business. We are making long-term sustainable cost reductions. A lot of it, as I think through your question, comes back to the change in strategy that we articulated last year, we're instead of thinking about our company at sort of three different divisions that run independently of each other, remember we talked about, we're America is neighborhood grocery, we run 4,300 stores, some of which are independently owned, some are licensees, some are hard discount, some are traditional. And as we think about our business that way, we've been able to leverage a lot of back office expenses that were redundant in the past, and that could be things like goods that for resale under Janel's leadership, we've seen some real nice savings, a very talented group of people who work in her organization, driving out cost in goods that for resale because now we're talking as one as opposed to as a whole different group. As we look at all kinds of supply-chain initiatives, as we look at under adhering organization, when we look at store development, we now look at that holistically. So we get some savings there under Julie's organization, we now look at marketing, holistically. So it's just simple things like how we negotiate with our partners who are working with us on buying media and paper and things of that nature, significant savings because we look at our business differently and we have people centrally who are empowered now to drive those savings. And I must tell you, I feel really good that these are long-term savings.

We continue to see a very, very challenged economic environment in America today. We track things like EBT usage across our network, and it is at highest levels since we've been tracking it, particularly across our Save-A-Lot network, we see unbelievable growth numbers and consumers who are requiring government assistance to feed their families. We see a huge increases in coupon usage across our enterprise. We continue to see, as you all know, a massive unemployment, but also underemployment. And particularly, in some of the big markets where we are, it's certainly more challenged than in the country as a whole if you think about Southern California. Again, this is public information. You're all aware of that. But we do track our consumers and we are working diligently to make sure we are addressing the consumers needs in this very tough economic environment that we're in.

This morning, SUPERVALU reported adjusted net income of $59 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.28, excluding a non-cash impairment and other charges. 
We continue to generate strong cash flows, and now expect to pay down $650 million of debt by fiscal year-end. Free cash flow for the quarter was a strong $285 million, and we have reduced debt by $512 million through Q2. Sales for the quarter were $8.7 billion and ID sales were negative 5.9%, excluding Shaw's, which was impacted by a labor dispute. These results are disappointing to me and my leadership team. And frankly, given the slower-than-anticipated economic recovery, we see a longer timeline for our corporate initiatives to gain traction. Consequently, we are revising downward our full year guidance to a range of $1.40 to $1.60. 
The economy continues to provide a headwind to our efforts. In spite of near-record low interest rates meant to drive spending, the mindset of our customers remains decidedly cautious with the ongoing focus on price. We find the continuing sluggishness of the private sector employment has made any uplift in grocery spending difficult. Remember that the bulk of our retail footprint is in large metropolitan areas, where unemployment remains above the national average. 
While our results this quarter were below our internal projections, we did make steady progress on some of our key strategic goals, which are geared towards positioning us for improving the long-term performance of this company. So rather than spend my time on today's call looking backward, I would like to use this time to give you an update on where we are in the transformation that is currently underway. Sherry will provide more insight into our second quarter performance and revised guidance later on the call. 
About a year ago, I introduced our vision for SUPERVALU to become ""America’s Neighborhood Grocer"", and I remain convinced that there is an absolute need for well-run neighborhood grocery stores. We know this from our many long-standing relationships with our great independent retailers across the country. They know their customers intimately, stock products to satisfy local taste and operate with the efficiency of a family-owned business. 
At the core of this vision is our unwavering focus on operating as one company, winning for our customers. This means our stores will be merchandised locally, carry fresh perishables and relevant regional brands and cater to the fundamental needs of the shoppers, who call these neighborhoods home. 
We will leverage the scale of SUPERVALU's 4,300 store network to economically byproduct but assort based on customer preferences, and execute at a local level, region-by-region, neighborhood-by-neighborhood and importantly, store-by-store. This focus and discipline around hyper-local retailing will make our stores more compelling for the customers we serve. 
To this end, SUPERVALU began taking initial steps late last year to realign its business, clarify accountability and refocus priorities on customer-centric measures. Over the past 12 months, this organization has aligned key reporting structures as it added several new senior leaders. We secured flexible long-term funding, we reviewed our store portfolio and monetized select non-core assets. When completed, our culture will have shifted to one that is singularly focused on anticipating and meeting the needs of our customers. Through our traditional retail operations and independent partners, we will deliver the freshest meat and produce, unmatched assortment of fairly priced products, great promotions and a no-hassle customer-oriented experience. This commitment to our customers will underscore what SUPERVALU stands for and give us a more favorable position in the minds of our customers, something that has waned in recent quarters. 
To guide us, we have developed a detailed action plan that is now being put into motion. The near-term impact will be a more robust understanding of our key business metrics, which will enhance our ability to measure real-time results and react to ongoing business trends. Over the long-term, this intense focus around doing the right thing for our customers will pay off in terms of increased loyalty, top line growth and profitability. 
I also want to be clear that this transformation will require additional price investments. We believe, however, that widespread efficiency improvements will help to offset the margin impact of these moves, and result in improved operating results over time. 
SUPERVALU remains committed to operating as one company, winning for our customers and focused on growth. In line with this strategic imperative, the company will undergo a business transformation that we will expect to take about three years, and address both our price position and product offering to ensure that we are dedicated to hyper-local activities, are stewards of our company's resources and are focused on growth and innovation. 
Let me start with SUPERVALU's renewed commitment to its customers. Our focus on the customer is the single most important element of our corporate transformation. To that end, we have begun to act as an agent of our customers, and are working to offer those products shoppers want at a fair price in a friendly, inviting environment. From my standpoint, anything less is simply unacceptable. 
Our ability to deliver on these core expectations will ensure that we are rewarded with loyal customers, positive sales trends and improved customer satisfaction scores. Putting the customer front and center has required a significant cultural adjustment. Our company is shifting from a purchase-oriented model to a strategy focused on stocking and selling the products most relevant to our customers. By streamlining decision-making, being more responsive to customer preferences, negotiating better terms with our suppliers and allocating more vendor support into pricing, we are slowly shifting our operating paradigm. Over time, I am confident that our renewed focus on customer expectations will reverse any unfavorable value perceptions. 
Let me be clear that SUPERVALU is committed to its traditional retail positioning. And as part of that, we must regain our relevance to a customer who has multiple outlets to choose from to satisfy her grocery needs. Our prices must be fair, the quality of our perishables needs to improve, our assortments have to be more locally relevant and our stores have to be simpler to shop. 
In short, we must address the underlying issues impacting our retail sales and promote customer engagement through our knowledgeable and friendly associates. In effect, these changes will help SUPERVALU return to its heritage and the values of Sam Skaggs' and Joe Albertson's, of which many of our banners are found. 
We have well-conceived plans to address each of these items. Some are extensions of programs that I have already discussed and others are new to SUPERVALU, and modeled after the practices of our most successful independent customers. 
For example, SKU rationalization is improving our sets by removing redundant sizes, creating better in-stock position, reducing labor costs, and in most cases, sharpening retail prices. Through the second quarter, we've completed resets on 40 center-store categories and expect to optimize all of our non-perishable categories by February. 
More importantly, we have developed enterprise-wide standards that will allow us to better monitor our assortments, so we don't allow excess SKUs to creep back into our stores. This disciplined approach will ensure that appropriate standards are ingrained into our corporate culture and become part of our everyday decision-making. 
We are also making headway to better match our assortment to the local preferences of neighborhoods in which we operate. As an example, our Philadelphia-based Acme banner, covers a broad range of neighborhoods, ranging from the affluent suburbs of Northwest Philly and outside Newark, to urban locations in the center of both cities, to seasonal beach areas in the South Jersey Shore, such as Wildwood and Avalon. 
All of our stores, even across these diverse geographies, will carry regional staples like Tastykake, Herr's chips and Scott's bath tissue. But the individual store assortments are being further tailored to cater to the local shopper. This effectively means that, where appropriate, stores in more affluent suburbs will feature expanded deli counters and olive bars. While stores in close proximity to many colleges in the area will cater to students with a broader assortment of energy drinks and ready-to-eat foods and school supplies. Stores in coastal beach towns will now stock a wider selection of convenience and general merchandise, like coolers and beach towels, to better accommodate the needs of our seasonal shoppers. 
Equally important to our work on optimizing assortment is the effort we have taken to improve price and change customer perceptions. We fully understand our brand and price position relative to our competition and will implement fair pricing plus promotions to appeal to customers' value needs. Let me give you a few examples of how we are acting on this today. 
First, in one of our banners, we introduced value pricing on key seasonal produce. We reset base retails and promoted it with less depth and frequency. The results were greater sales volume and stronger margins throughout the category. Given the success of this program, we have accelerated the rollout of this strategy to other banners. 
Second, through our entire retail network, we've reduced the pricing on a prominent juice item to $1.99 everyday. That's about $1 better than our price a year ago, and I can tell you that parents shopping for their families have noticed this change in price. And as a result, we are moving more units than we did last summer. This is a great example of how SUPERVALU can drive traffic and change price perception by offering customers better value on key shopping items. 
SUPERVALU is increasingly doing more things like this to enhance the relevance of our offering to our customers. These price changes are a departure from past practices, and a good example of how our company is now acting differently. 
We are engaging with our vendor partners to discuss how we can change our pricing architecture with the shared goal of moving more units. As we are able to drive price points that are more competitive, the shoppers are reacting with increased purchases that drive volume for the manufacturer and build loyalty to our banners. 
You have heard me talk about the power sale items as a way to drive foot traffic. And this quarter, we have success with ready-to-serve items like canned tuna and canned pasta. A recent promotion delivered double-digit percent increases to category trends, with over 200 truckloads of products sold across our entire 4,300 store network in just two weeks time. As of the second quarter, we have also focused on an innovative customer promotion as a means to drive traffic and build customer loyalty. 
In September, we rolled out a continuity program to more than 400 stores, offering professional-grade cookware to our top shoppers as a reward for spending their dollars with us. The cookware program encourages repeat visits and is at the heart of what we do, which is the celebration of food and cooking. 
Individual pieces are available for full retail and at discount purchases at participating locations. Having just completed the sixth week of this program, it is tracking to expectations. The full impact of the promotion, however, won't be known until we move closer to the program's conclusion in the fourth quarter. Loyalty programs like this will help pull customers back into our stores and in doing so, expose them to the investments we are making to shelf prices. These investments remain an important part of our strategy and will allow us to address consumer perceptions and nullify the price differential that we face in some, though not all, of our markets. 
To assure that our efforts to drive customer traffic, sales and loyalty do not impact profitability, we have created detailed action plans to offset investments in price. These include operational improvements to enhance product freshness, improve our in-stock position and offer faster-turning assortments, more effective promotions, improved cost of goods and aggressive cost cutting on things like overhead, energy and goods not for resale. 
We will be diligent and act with passion and a sense of urgency as we move forward, recognizing that this journey will take time. I understand my obligation to our shareholders, and the strategy, which we are executing, is intended to build an improved business model for SUPERVALU that will enhance our market position and performance over time. 
Human capital is at the cornerstone of any successful enterprise. And for a customer-facing business like food retail, associate engagement can be a true competitive advantage. As we streamline our operations and improve accountability, we have communicated near-term metrics and long-term goals to SUPERVALU's associates to ensure that we operate as one cohesive entity. 
We have realigned reporting structures and leveraged shared resources. We have helped to empower individuals and removed bureaucratic layers from our decision-making process. You may recall that earlier this year, I told you we were redesigning the role of our store directors to give them more opportunity to interact with shoppers, manage their stores and develop their associates. 
In redefining this critical retail position, we have assessed the skills and performance of each one of our nearly 1,200 store directors, develop leadership training programs to help each of them improve their skill set. We've modified a number of in-store processes to reduce the administrative element of their job and made regular engagement with customers primary to this job function. 
At the corporate level, our associates are engaging with peers to find better ways to execute on everyday task. As an example, the production of signs and shelf tags has historically been managed by individual banner teams. Earlier this summer, members of our Retail operations, IT and Marketing groups came together to simplify this process and establish a set of best practices. Up until this point, there were more than 130 different types of tag stock and over 700 different types of sign templates used throughout our store networks. 
Our Enterprise Marketing group took the lead and engaged with consumers to determine the most appealing way to display price and value. Our IT and Operations team addressed the logistical challenges posed by streamlining production, concurrent with the ongoing weekly promotions. The cross-functional team crafted a workable plan that began to roll out within weeks. The result has been a 70% reduction in stock inventory on signs, and a dramatic streamlining of tag stock types, which should yield an annual cost savings of approximately $1 million in terms of banner labor and materials procurement. 
This new signage has been rolled out to half of our corporate stores, making for a much cleaner, consistent visual display for our customers, and we'll cascade through the rest of our banners through year-end to help simplify customer communications and brand recognition. 
What excites me most and is exemplified by this project is that associates are responding to a call to take control and ownership throughout this organization. Corporate resources are increasingly being managed with the same care and attention that associates would show as if those resources were their own. Beyond training and solution-based collaboration, we continue to aggressively control expenses and seek out new opportunities for efficiency. 
As we noted last quarter, we expect to realize more than $160 million in SG&A savings this year alone. This quarter, we saw an additional $40 million in new savings. And I believe, we still have a tremendous opportunity here, specifically on initiatives around shrink, facilities and goods not for resale, which will continue to reduce operating costs well into the next year. 
SUPERVALU's long-term competitiveness will depend heavily upon our ability to be better stewards of our corporate resources and execute with a sense of urgency. I can assure you that from our enterprise teams to in-store associates, this organization is committed to running leanly, implementing near-term solutions and leveraging our national distribution to support the efforts of our independent retailers and traditional banners. 
When I assumed my role as SUPERVALU CEO over a year ago, I did so with the conviction to enhance operations and drive new growth and innovation. This growth can and will come from all parts of the company. I've talked about doubling the size of Save-A-Lot by the end of fiscal '15, and I am pleased with the progress we have made to date. This quarter, we opened 18 new stores for a total of 38 stores during our first half of the year. And we remain on track for more than 100 new locations by year-end. 
This quarter, Save-A-Lot launched its first sustained media campaign since 2004. Radio and television ads carrying the message of ""Savings made easy"" are now being broadcast in 42 markets, which span more than 700 stores. The cost of this campaign is being shared by our licensees and is already helping to raise ID sales in most of our established geographies. 
Over the long-term, this investment will help to strengthen our brand as a hard discount leader and improve customer awareness in our expansion 
markets. 
As you may have heard, drugstore operator Rite Aid is among Save-A-Lot's newest licensees. We are jointly working on a co-branding test in 10 existing South Carolina Rite Aid stores. The conversion of the first store was completed in late September and another nine stores opened earlier this month. We're excited to test this co-branding strategy with an experienced drugstore operator and look forward to reporting on our progress next quarter. 
I would also like to mention that the initial performance of our recently converted South Texas stores is showing great promise, with sales up double-digits in stores that are still undergoing remodeling, and which have yet to formerly host their grand reopening as El Ahorro Save-A-Lot stores. 
I see clear opportunities for this organization to grow and improve upon our existing business model by innovating. Last month, we announced a strategic relationship with Tata Consultancy Services, through which SUPERVALU would sell its IT operations in India. This long-term business outsourcing solution will improve efficiency and free up corporate resources. 
The retail food industry also has a history of implementing new technologies and business efficiencies to serve our customers better and keep our costs low. I'm proud to say that SUPERVALU has been an early adopter in integrating these new technologies. Our newest Albertsons store, which opened last month in San Diego, uses state-of-the-art technology for heating, cooling and lighting. The backbone of this effort is a 400-kilowatt fuel cell, which will generate nearly 90% of the energy needs of the store. In addition to improving our energy efficiency, this technology also reduces the company's carbon footprint. 
Along the same vein, SUPERVALU received recognition from the Carbon Disclosure Project, and last month, became the first food retailer to join World Wildlife Fund's Climate Savers program. In doing so, we have taken a leadership position within the industry and pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10% in the five-year period ending in 2012. 
Finally, SUPERVALU continues to look for cost-effective ways to operate stores and improve our environmental stewardship. Our Store Design group has been installing skylights, more efficient LED lighting and high-efficiency air handlers within our stores, while the Distribution team is working to improve logistics to integrate free transportation and reduce fuel consumption. As we move forward, you can expect to see SUPERVALU continue to take steps to innovate and be a good environment partner. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Sherry for a more detailed look at our second quarter performance and outlook. I will then wrap up with some closing comments."
306013,114113625,80147,"SUPERVALU Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","SUPERVALU INC.","Executives","Thank you, Craig, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will be covering our second quarter operating results and financial condition, providing an update on a number of our operating metrics and comment on our fiscal 2011 full year guidance. Let me firs",1600,"Thank you, Craig, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will be covering our second quarter operating results and financial condition, providing an update on a number of our operating metrics and comment on our fiscal 2011 full year guidance. 
Let me first address the non-cash impairment charge that we recorded this quarter. This non-cash charge was related to our market capitalization, which has fallen with the recent sustained weakness in our share price. Accounting rules require that we reconcile our book value to our stock price in assessing the recoverable value of goodwill and other intangible assets. 
The second quarter charge represents an estimate and is subject to our finalizing fair market values, which will be completed in the third quarter. Let me assure you that this non-cash impairment charge does not impact any of our financial covenants, our ability to assess our credit facility or any of our business strategies. 
This quarter, sales totaled $8.7 billion, compared to $9.5 billion a year earlier. The 8.5% decline was a function of four main items. First, weakness in identical store sales, which declined by 6.4% this quarter. Excluding Shaw's, IDs were negative 5.9%. With the labor dispute settled in early July, we will only break this out separately in year-to-date comparisons going forward. 
Second, the impact of previously announced submarket access and retail store closures, including Salt Lake City, Connecticut and Cincinnati. Third, Target's transition to self-distribution. And finally, the loss of Ukrop's as a supply-chain customer. 
Breaking identical store sales, we saw a 3.9% decline in customer count and a 2% decrease in transaction size. Customer count is down modestly from the first quarter and really reflects the cycling of ineffective pricing and promotional initiatives introduced during the first half of fiscal '10, which drove traffic in several of our largest markets. 
The sequential improvement in average transaction size is encouraging. This quarter, we also saw an improvement in total unit volume compared to Q1. Similar to last quarter, tradedown remained essentially flat. We estimate that cost inflation ran about 1% this quarter, driven partly by increases in the dairy and meat categories. 
During Q2, we continue to make targeted price investments across our company. Within private brands, we improved our marketing and ad plans to better promote items and shelf placement, while continuing to realize procurement cost savings. 
In the second quarter, private brand sales penetration hit a record 18.5%. We also began implementing everyday fair pricing in convenience categories. These are product lines where promotional pricing generates little incremental volume but requires a disproportionate amount of labor. Lastly, we started the broader rollout of our fair price plus promotions strategy, meant to remove the extreme ends of our high-low pricing. We believe this change to our pricing architecture is significant, and will help us address the perceived value gap that has weighed on customer traffic trends in recent quarters. 
Our same-store sales results through the first five weeks of the third quarter have improved about 100 basis points from the 5.9% decline in Q2, another encouraging sign. 
Moving to operating earnings. Retail food was 2.6% of sales before one-time items, compared to 2.5% last year. This modest increase was driven by improved margins, primarily attributable to more targeted price investments and promotional spending, which was partially offset by the sales deleveraging. 
Supply Chain Services delivered a very strong quarter as operating earnings were 3.5% of sales compared to last year's 3.0%. Results this quarter continue to benefit from a strong focus on cost and efficiency. 
Year-over-year, operating metrics in Supply Chain have improved total throughput increase, which drove improvements in warehousing costs per case by over 1%. And we did a better job of optimizing our fleet to reduce miles and fully utilize the capacity of our trailers. We remain pleased with the contributions of our Supply Chain business as we aggressively manage expenses, while producing stable earnings and cash flow. 
Now let me provide some color on the year-over-year variance in corporate expenses, where the $19 million change was predominantly driven by surplus property activity. Last year, in the second quarter, we had about $9 million in net gains from a number of properties. Whereas this quarter, we absorbed about $6 million in expense, due in part to the continued softening of the commercial real estate market. There was also an additional $3 million in one-time charges, primarily related to litigation matters. 
On the broader topic of SG&A expenses, we remain on track to remove $160 million from business by year-end, having taken out over $80 million in the first half of fiscal '11. The savings we expect to achieve for the balance of the year will come largely from administrative costs as we recognize the benefit of centralization efforts and process efficiencies implemented over the last few months. These efforts are ongoing and will lead to additional savings in QF'12. 
For the quarter, we reported a GAAP EPS loss of $6.94 per diluted share, which includes $7.16 in non-cash impairment charges and $0.06 in other costs. The largest portion of the other costs were related to the labor dispute at Shaw's, with smaller amounts primarily tied to employees' severance and litigation charges. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Inventory days supply fell by almost six full days compared to last year's Q2, due to better inventory management and the benefits of SKU rationalization. We finished the second quarter with total outstanding debt of $7.1 billion, down about $280 million from the first quarter. 
Year-to-date, we have reduced outstanding debt, including capital lease obligations, by over $500 million, putting us on pace to achieve $650 million of debt repayment this fiscal year, $50 million more than originally expected. This increase is driven largely by our inventory reduction efforts and strong working capital management, which is more than offsetting our reduced earnings guidance. 
We remain in compliance with our debt covenants with trailing 12 months EBIT of $1.2 billion, excluding impairment and other costs. Depreciation and amortization was $0.9 billion and rent expense amounted to $0.4 billion. 
Remaining current fiscal year debt maturities of $475 million and will be repaid from internally generated funds and available capacity under our revolving credit facility. SUPERVALU's return to investment grade still remains a corporate priority. 
Let me now provide some color on the performance of our store remodels, customer satisfaction surveys and market share. With this regards to the performance of recently remodeled stores, our first-year remodels showed an average lift of approximately 3.5% when compared to other stores in their respective markets. Store cycling their one-year opening were up 180 basis points in their second year on a comparable basis. 
Moving to our customer satisfaction metrics. I am pleased to report that we have made progress in the last six months. We now have a customer service manager at each banner, responsible for improving the shopping experience in each of our stores. We also introduced a new Web-based tool that allows our customers to provide immediate feedback to our store director. Through the second quarter, eight of the nine banners we tracked enjoyed improved overall satisfaction scores from a year earlier, while scores for ninth banner remained unchanged. 
Turning to market share. In the latest quarter, SUPERVALU either gained or held market share in 55% of our top 86 DMAs, losing share in the balance. As a reminder, these designated marketing areas generally have at least 10 stores and do over $1.5 million per week in aggregate retail sales, which include our traditional retail stores, all Save-A-Lot locations and independent stores for whom we act as the primary supplier. 
For the top 20 DMAs, which account for approximately 2/3 of our sales volume, the accumulative total share loss was approximately 40 basis points relative to a year ago, and is consistent with the trend we reported in April. 
I should also note that this figure captures planned store closures, which amount to over 2 million square feet in addition to our negative ID sales performance for the quarter. 
Let me next provide some comments on our fiscal '11 guidance. Our second quarter sales were softer than planned. And as a result, our current expectation is for full year IDs to be around negative 5.5%. We also reduced full year EPS guidance based on first-half results. 
Our initial guidance calls for the first half of fiscal '11 to be considerably more challenging than the second half, and this will continue to be the case through the third quarter. Traction has clearly been slower than expected. As Craig noted, we now expect full year adjusted earnings to be within a range of $1.40 to $1.60 this fiscal year. 
Our capital plan of $700 million remains unchanged. And as noted, we have increased our debt reduction goals to $650 million this fiscal year. 
Let me conclude by saying that we have firm plans in place around sales, margins and expenses to deliver our revised guidance of $1.40 to $1.60 per share. This reduced estimate reflects the still-competitive landscape, a stretched consumer and some changes in the pace of our execution as we carry out the business transformation Craig outlined. 
We still expect to gain traction on many of our initiatives in the back half of this fiscal year. By and large, Q3 will remain a transition quarter, and we will begin to realize the true impact of our marketing, merchandising and operational initiatives in Q4. Our leadership team is committed to taking bold actions to execute on this timeline and ensure our long-term success. With that, I will turn the call back to Craig."

Today, our company is modifying its operating norms and redefining its business culture and financial expectations. While we remain in the early stages of this process, these efforts will address our competitive position within food retail and instill a culture that promotes action and continuous improvement. 
We have a strong leadership team, and together with SUPERVALU's 150,000 associates, we share a sense of urgency to improve enterprise-wide execution, reinvigorate sales, address the perceived value gap that exists for some of our banners. 
The business transformation currently underway will be end-to-end and allow us to better serve the local needs of the neighborhoods we serve. And in doing so, the value we create will accrue to our shareholders. I would now like to open up the call for your questions."

It's less about the banner, it's about the store.

W have all been reading of late about commodity costs. We did have a price increases communicated to us from a major supplier just yesterday, a significant cost increases across-the-board for this particular supplier. So that's relatively new news to us. The value gap, John, that's a great question. What we really look at is, if you look at our total basket versus the total basket of our traditional retail competitors, we're actually fairly in line, which is what we've articulated in the past. Where we're going, however, is we want to make sure that we reduce the extremes of the high-low. In too many cases, particularly on some key items that our customers want, we've allowed, over the years, our regular prices to get too high. So a great example is that juice side that I mentioned, where we were at $2.99 in many of our banners. We would promote it down to a great price, in which case, we'd sell a bunch on promotion. And we could argue that the average of those prices was fair. The problem for us is the regular price clearly was not fair and was not in line with what our customers were looking for. So the basket actually is pretty good today, John. And so I think that gives us the room we need to go and surgically address items, literally items, not even categories, and say, ""How do we redirect our vendor negotiations and our internal funding to make sure that rather than the extreme high-low where we've been for a number of years, we get to what Steve has called fair pricing plus promotions."" Where we've done this, and particularly in some fresh food areas, we've seen customers respond very, very positively. We think it will take us time, which is why I said that we think this is a multi-year journey. We are not going to take any broad-based price cuts. We are going to be very surgical and very thoughtful, and work with our vendor partners as we go down this journey."

This morning, SUPERVALU reported adjusted net income of $59 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.28, excluding a non-cash impairment and other charges.

This morning, SUPERVALU reported adjusted net income of $59 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.28, excluding a non-cash impairment and other charges. 
We continue to generate strong cash flows, and now expect to pay down $650 million of debt by fiscal year-end. Free cash flow for the quarter was a strong $285 million, and we have reduced debt by $512 million through Q2. Sales for the quarter were $8.7 billion and ID sales were negative 5.9%, excluding Shaw's, which was impacted by a labor dispute. These results are disappointing to me and my leadership team. And frankly, given the slower-than-anticipated economic recovery, we see a longer timeline for our corporate initiatives to gain traction. Consequently, we are revising downward our full-year guidance to a range of $1.40 to $1.60. 
The economy continues to provide a headwind to our efforts. In spite of near-record low interest rates meant to drive spending, the mindset of our customers remains decidedly cautious with the ongoing focus on price. We find the continuing sluggishness of the private-sector employment has made any uplift in grocery spending difficult. Remember that the bulk of our retail footprint is in large metropolitan areas, where unemployment remains above the national average. 
While our results this quarter were below our internal projections, we did make steady progress on some of our key strategic goals, which are geared towards positioning us for improving the long-term performance of this company. So rather than spend my time on today's call looking backward, I would like to use this time to give you an update on where we are in the transformation that is currently underway. Sherry will provide more insight into our second quarter performance and revised guidance later on the call. 
About a year ago, I introduced our vision for SUPERVALU to become ""America’s Neighborhood Grocer"", and I remain convinced that there is an absolute need for well-run neighborhood grocery stores. We know this from our many long-standing relationships with our great independent retailers across the country. They know their customers intimately, stock products to satisfy local taste and operate with the efficiency of a family-owned business. 
At the core of this vision is our unwavering focus on operating as one company, winning for our customers. This means our stores will be merchandised locally, carry fresh perishables and relevant regional brands and cater to the fundamental needs of the shoppers, who call these neighborhoods home. 
We will leverage the scale of SUPERVALU's 4,300-store network to economically buy product but assort based on customer preferences, and execute at a local level, region-by-region, neighborhood-by-neighborhood and importantly, store-by-store. This focus and discipline around hyper-local retailing will make our stores more compelling for the customers we serve. 
To this end, SUPERVALU began taking initial steps late last year to realign its business, clarify accountability and refocus priorities on customer-centric measures. Over the past 12 months, this organization has aligned key reporting structures as it added several new senior leaders. We secured flexible long-term funding, we reviewed our store portfolio and monetized select non-core assets. When completed, our culture will have shifted to one that is singularly focused on anticipating and meeting the needs of our customers. Through our traditional retail operations and independent partners, we will deliver the freshest meat and produce, unmatched assortment of fairly priced products, great promotions and a no-hassle customer-oriented experience. This commitment to our customers will underscore what SUPERVALU stands for and give us a more favorable position in the minds of our customers, something that has waned in recent quarters. 
To guide us, we have developed a detailed action plan that is now being put into motion. The near-term impact will be a more robust understanding of our key business metrics, which will enhance our ability to measure real-time results and react to ongoing business trends. Over the long-term, this intense focus around doing the right thing for our customers will pay off in terms of increased loyalty, top-line growth and profitability. 
I also want to be clear that this transformation will require additional price investments. We believe, however, that widespread efficiency improvements will help to offset the margin impact of these moves, and result in improved operating results over time. 
SUPERVALU remains committed to operating as one company, winning for our customers and focused on growth. In line with this strategic imperative, the company will undergo a business transformation that we will expect to take about three years, and address both our price position and product offering to ensure that we are dedicated to hyper-local activities, are stewards of our company's resources and are focused on growth and innovation. 
Let me start with SUPERVALU's renewed commitment to its customers. Our focus on the customer is the single most important element of our corporate transformation. To that end, we have begun to act as an agent of our customers, and are working to offer those products shoppers want at a fair price in a friendly, inviting environment. From my standpoint, anything less is simply unacceptable. 
Our ability to deliver on these core expectations will ensure that we are rewarded with loyal customers, positive sales trends and improved customer satisfaction scores. Putting the customer front and center has required a significant cultural adjustment. Our company is shifting from a purchase-oriented model to a strategy focused on stocking and selling the products most relevant to our customers. By streamlining decision-making, being more responsive to customer preferences, negotiating better terms with our suppliers and allocating more vendor support into pricing, we are slowly shifting our operating paradigm. Over time, I am confident that our renewed focus on customer expectations will reverse any unfavorable value perceptions. 
Let me be clear that SUPERVALU is committed to its traditional retail positioning. And as part of that, we must regain our relevance to a customer who has multiple outlets to choose from to satisfy her grocery needs. Our prices must be fair, the quality of our perishables needs to improve, our assortments have to be more locally relevant and our stores have to be simpler to shop. 
In short, we must address the underlying issues impacting our retail sales and promote customer engagement through our knowledgeable and friendly associates. In effect, these changes will help SUPERVALU return to its heritage and the values of Sam Skaggs' and Joe Albertson's, of which many of our banners are found. 
We have well-conceived plans to address each of these items. Some are extensions of programs that I have previously discussed and others are new to SUPERVALU, and modeled after the practices of our most successful independent customers. 
For example, SKU rationalization is improving our sets by removing redundant sizes, creating better in-stock position, reducing labor costs, and in most cases, sharpening retail prices. Through the second quarter, we've completed resets on 40 center-store categories and expect to optimize all of our non-perishable categories by February. 
More importantly, we have developed enterprise-wide standards that will allow us to better monitor our assortments, so we don't allow excess SKUs to creep back into our stores. This disciplined approach will ensure that appropriate standards are ingrained into our corporate culture and become part of our everyday decision-making. 
We are also making headway to better match our assortment to the local preferences of neighborhoods in which we operate. As an example, our Philadelphia-based Acme banner, covers a broad range of neighborhoods, ranging from the affluent suburbs of Northwest Philly and outside Newark, to urban locations in the center of both cities, to seasonal beach areas in the South Jersey Shore, such as Wildwood and Avalon. 
All of our stores, even across these diverse geographies, will carry regional staples like Tastykake, Herr's chips and Scott's bath tissue. But the individual-store assortments are being further tailored to cater to the local shopper. This effectively means that, where appropriate, stores in more affluent suburbs will feature expanded deli counters and olive bars. While stores in close proximity to many colleges in the area will cater to students with a broader assortment of energy drinks and ready-to-eat foods and school supplies. Stores in coastal beach towns will now stock a wider selection of convenience and general merchandise, like coolers and beach towels, to better accommodate the needs of our seasonal shoppers. 
Equally important to our work on optimizing assortment is the effort we have taken to improve price and change customer perceptions. We fully understand our brand and price position relative to our competition and will implement fair pricing plus promotions to appeal to customers' value needs. Let me give you a few examples of how we are acting on this today. 
First, in one of our banners, we introduced value pricing on key seasonal produce. We reset base retails and promoted it with less depth and frequency. The results were greater sales volume and stronger margins throughout the category. Given the success of this program, we have accelerated the rollout of this strategy to other banners. 
Second, through our entire retail network, we've reduced the pricing on a prominent juice item to $1.99 every day. That's about $1 better than our price a year ago, and I can tell you that parents shopping for their families have noticed this change in price. And as a result, we are moving more units than we did last summer. This is a great example of how SUPERVALU can drive traffic and change price perception by offering customers better value on key shopping items. 
SUPERVALU is increasingly doing more things like this to enhance the relevance of our offering to our customers. These price changes are a departure from past practices, and a good example of how our company is now acting differently. 
We are engaging with our vendor partners to discuss how we can change our pricing architecture with the shared goal of moving more units. As we are able to drive price points that are more competitive, shoppers are reacting with increased purchases that drive volume for the manufacturer and build loyalty to our banners. 
You have heard me talk about the power sale items as a way to drive foot traffic. And this quarter, we have success with ready-to-serve items like canned tuna and canned pasta. A recent promotion delivered double-digit percent increases to category trends, with over 200 truckloads of products sold across our entire 4,300-store network in just two weeks’ time. As of the second quarter, we have also focused on an innovative customer promotion as a means to drive traffic and build customer loyalty. 
In September, we rolled out a continuity program to more than 400 stores, offering professional-grade cookware to our top shoppers as a reward for spending their dollars with us. The cookware program encourages repeat visits and is at the heart of what we do, which is the celebration of food and cooking. 
Individual pieces are available for full retail and at discount purchases at participating locations. Having just completed the sixth week of this program, it is tracking to expectations. The full impact of the promotion, however, won't be known until we move closer to the program's conclusion in the fourth quarter. Loyalty programs like this will help pull customers back into our stores and in doing so, expose them to the investments we are making to shelf prices. These investments remain an important part of our strategy and will allow us to address consumer perceptions and nullify the price differential that we face in some, though not all, of our markets. 
To assure that our efforts to drive customer traffic, sales and loyalty do not impact profitability, we have created detailed action plans to offset investments in price. These include operational improvements to enhance product freshness, improve our in-stock position and offer faster-turning assortments, more effective promotions, improved cost of goods and aggressive cost cutting on things like overhead, energy and goods not for resale. 
We will be diligent and act with passion and a sense of urgency as we move forward, recognizing that this journey will take time. I understand my obligation to our shareholders, and the strategy, which we are executing, is intended to build an improved business model for SUPERVALU that will enhance our market position and performance over time. 
Human capital is at the cornerstone of any successful enterprise. And for a customer-facing business like food retail, associate engagement can be a true competitive advantage. As we streamline our operations and improve accountability, we have communicated near-term metrics and long-term goals to SUPERVALU's associates to ensure that we operate as one cohesive entity. 
We have realigned reporting structures and leveraged shared resources. We have helped to empower individuals and removed bureaucratic layers from our decision-making process. You may recall that earlier this year, I told you we were redesigning the role of our store directors to give them more opportunity to interact with shoppers, manage their stores and develop their associates. 
In redefining this critical retail position, we have assessed the skills and performance of each one of our nearly 1,200 store directors, developed leadership training programs to help each of them improve their skill set. We've modified a number of in-store processes to reduce the administrative element of their job and made regular engagement with customers primary to this job function. 
At the corporate level, our associates are engaging with peers to find better ways to execute on everyday tasks. As an example, the production of signs and shelf tags has historically been managed by individual banner teams. Earlier this summer, members of our retail operations, IT and marketing groups came together to simplify this process and establish a set of best practices. Up until this point, there were more than 130 different types of tag stock and over 700 different types of sign templates used throughout our store network. 
Our enterprise marketing group took the lead and engaged with consumers to determine the most appealing way to display price and value. Our IT and Operations team addressed the logistical challenges posed by streamlining production, concurrent with the ongoing weekly promotions. The cross-functional team crafted a workable plan that began to roll out within weeks. The result has been a 70% reduction in stock inventory on signs, and a dramatic streamlining of tag-stock types, which should yield an annual cost savings of approximately $1 million in terms of banner labor and materials procurement. 
This new signage has been rolled out to half of our corporate stores, making for a much cleaner, consistent visual display for our customers, and will cascade through the rest of our banners through year-end to help simplify customer communications and brand recognition. 
What excites me most and is exemplified by this project is that associates are responding to a call to take control and ownership throughout this organization. Corporate resources are increasingly being managed with the same care and attention that associates would show as if those resources were their own. Beyond training and solution-based collaboration, we continue to aggressively control expenses and seek out new opportunities for efficiency. 
As we noted last quarter, we expect to realize more than $160 million in SG&A savings this year alone. This quarter, we saw an additional $40 million in new savings. And I believe, we still have a tremendous opportunity here, specifically, on initiatives around shrink, facilities and goods not for resale, which will continue to reduce operating costs well into the next year. 
SUPERVALU's long-term competitiveness will depend heavily upon our ability to be better stewards of our corporate resources and execute with a sense of urgency. I can assure you that from our enterprise teams to in-store associates, this organization is committed to running leanly, implementing near-term solutions and leveraging our national distribution to support the efforts of our independent retailers and traditional banners. 
When I assumed my role as SUPERVALU CEO over a year ago, I did so with the conviction to enhance operations and drive new growth and innovation. This growth can and will come from all parts of the company. I've talked about doubling the size of Save-A-Lot by the end of fiscal '15, and I am pleased with the progress we have made to date. This quarter, we opened 18 new stores for a total of 38 stores during the first half of the year. And we remain on track for more than 100 new locations by year-end. 
This quarter, Save-A-Lot launched its first sustained media campaign since 2004. Radio and television ads carrying the message of ""Savings made easy"" are now being broadcast in 42 markets, which span more than 700 stores. The cost of this campaign is being shared by our licensees and is already helping to raise ID sales in most of our established geographies. 
Over the long-term, this investment will help to strengthen our brand as a hard-discount leader and improve customer awareness in our expansion 
markets. 
As you may have heard, drugstore operator Rite Aid is among Save-A-Lot's newest licensees. We are jointly working on a co-branding test in 10 existing South Carolina Rite Aid stores. The conversion of the first store was completed in late September and another nine stores opened earlier this month. We're excited to test this co-branding strategy with an experienced drugstore operator and look forward to reporting on our progress next quarter. 
I would also like to mention that the initial performance of our recently converted South Texas stores is showing great promise, with sales up double-digits in stores that are still undergoing remodeling, and which have yet to formerly host their grand reopening as El Ahorro Save-A-Lot stores. 
I see clear opportunities for this organization to grow and improve upon our existing business model by innovating. Last month, we announced a strategic relationship with Tata Consultancy Services, through which SUPERVALU would sell its IT operations in India. This long-term business outsourcing solution will improve efficiency and free up corporate resources. 
The retail-food industry also has a history of implementing new technologies and business efficiencies to serve our customers better and keep our costs low. I'm proud to say that SUPERVALU has been an early adopter in integrating these new technologies. Our newest Albertsons store, which opened last month in San Diego, uses state-of-the-art technology for heating, cooling and lighting. The backbone of this effort is a 400-kilowatt fuel cell, which will generate nearly 90% of the energy needs of the store. In addition to improving our energy efficiency, this technology also reduces the company's carbon footprint. 
Along the same vein, SUPERVALU received recognition from the Carbon Disclosure Project, and last month, became the first food retailer to join World Wildlife Fund's Climate Savers program. In doing so, we have taken a leadership position within the industry and pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10% in the five-year period ending in 2012. 
Finally, SUPERVALU continues to look for cost-effective ways to operate stores and [audio break] (0:35:17) environmental stewardship. Our Store Design group has been installing skylights, more efficient LED lighting and high-efficiency air handlers within our stores, while the Distribution team is working to improve logistics to integrate fleet transportation and reduce fuel consumption. As we move forward, you can expect to see SUPERVALU continue to take steps to innovate and be good environment partner. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Sherry for a more detailed look at our second quarter performance and outlook. I will then wrap up with some closing comments."
306013,114113625,80223,"SUPERVALU Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","SUPERVALU INC.","Executives","Thank you, Craig, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will be covering our second quarter operating results and financial condition, providing an update on a number of our operating metrics and comment on our fiscal 2011 full-year guidance. Let me firs",1600,"Thank you, Craig, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will be covering our second quarter operating results and financial condition, providing an update on a number of our operating metrics and comment on our fiscal 2011 full-year guidance. 
Let me first address the non-cash impairment charge that we recorded this quarter. This non-cash charge was related to our market capitalization, which had fallen with the recent sustained weakness in our share price. Accounting rules require that we reconcile our book value to our stock price in assessing the recoverable value of goodwill and other intangible assets. 
The second quarter charge represents an estimate and is subject to our finalizing fair-market values, which will be completed in the third quarter. Let me assure you that this non-cash impairment charge does not impact any of our financial covenants, our ability to assess our credit facility or any of our business strategies. 
This quarter, sales totaled $8.7 billion, compared to $9.5 billion a year earlier. The 8.5% decline was a function of four main items: First, weakness in identical store sales, which declined by 6.4% this quarter. Excluding Shaw's, IDs were negative 5.9%. With the labor dispute settled in early July, we will only break this out separately in year-to-date comparisons going forward. 
Second, the impact of previously announced submarket exits and retail store closures, including Salt Lake City, Connecticut and Cincinnati. Third, Target's transition to self-distribution. And finally, the loss of Ukrop's as a supply-chain customer. 
Breaking down identical-store sales, we saw a 3.9% decline in customer count and a 2% decrease in transaction size. Customer count is down modestly from the first quarter and really reflects the cycling of ineffective pricing and promotional initiatives introduced during the first half of fiscal '10, which drove traffic in several of our largest markets. 
The sequential improvement in average transaction size is encouraging. This quarter, we also saw an improvement in total unit volume compared to Q1. Similar to last quarter, trade down remained essentially flat. We estimate that cost inflation ran about 1% this quarter, driven partly by increases in the dairy and meat categories. 
During Q2, we continue to make targeted price investments across our company. Within private brands, we improved our marketing and ad plans to better promote items and shelf placement, while continuing to realize procurement cost savings. 
In the second quarter, private-brand sales penetration hit a record 18.5%. We also began implementing everyday fair pricing in convenience categories. These are product lines where promotional pricing generates little incremental volume but requires a disproportionate amount of labor. Lastly, we started the broader rollout of our fair price plus promotions strategy, meant to remove the extreme ends of our high-low pricing. We believe this change to our pricing architecture is significant, and will help us address the perceived value gap that has weighed on customer traffic trends in recent quarters. 
Our same-store sales results through the first five weeks of the third quarter have improved about 100 basis points from the 5.9% decline in Q2, another encouraging sign. 
Moving to operating earnings. Retail food was 2.6% of sales before one-time items, compared to 2.5% last year. This modest increase was driven by improved margins, primarily attributable to more targeted price investments and promotional spending, which was partially offset by the sales deleveraging. 
Supply Chain Services delivered a very strong quarter as operating earnings were 3.5% of sales compared to last year's 3.0%. Results this quarter continue to benefit from a strong focus on cost and efficiency. 
Year-over-year, operating metrics in Supply Chain have improved total throughput increase, which drove improvements in warehousing costs per case by over 1%. And we did a better job of optimizing our fleet to reduce miles and fully utilize the capacity of our trailers. We remain pleased with the contributions of our Supply Chain business as we aggressively manage expenses, while producing stable earnings and cash flow. 
Now let me provide some color on the year-over-year variance in corporate expenses, where the $19 million change was predominantly driven by surplus property activity. Last year, in the second quarter, we had about $9 million in net gains from a number of properties. Whereas this quarter, we absorbed about $6 million in expense, due in part to the continued softening of the commercial real estate market. There was also an additional $3 million in one-time charges, primarily related to litigation matters. 
On the broader topic of SG&A expenses, we remain on track to remove $160 million from business by year-end, having taken out over $80 million in the first half of fiscal '11. The savings we expect to achieve for the balance of the year will come largely from administrative costs as we recognize the benefit of centralization efforts and process efficiencies implemented over the last few months. These efforts are ongoing and will lead to additional savings in 2F [ph] (0:41:49) '12. 
For the quarter, we reported a GAAP EPS loss of $6.94 per diluted share, which includes $7.16 in non-cash impairment charges and $0.06 in other costs. The largest portion of the other costs were related to the labor dispute at Shaw's, with smaller amounts primarily tied to employees' severance and litigation charges. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Inventory days supply fell by almost a full day compared to last year's Q2, due to better inventory management and the benefits of SKU rationalization. We finished the second quarter with total outstanding debt of $7.1 billion, down about $280 million from the first quarter. 
Year-to-date, we have reduced outstanding debt, including capital-lease obligations, by over $500 million, putting us on pace to achieve $650 million of debt repayment this fiscal year, $50 million more than originally expected. This increase is driven largely by our inventory- reduction efforts and strong working capital management, which is more than offsetting our reduced earnings guidance. 
We remain in compliance with our debt covenants with trailing 12 months EBIT of $1.2 billion, excluding impairment and other costs. Depreciation and amortization was $0.9 billion and rent expense amounted to $0.4 billion. 
Remaining current fiscal year debt maturities are $475 million and will be repaid from internally generated funds and available capacity under our revolving credit facility. SUPERVALU's return to investment grade still remains a corporate priority. 
Let me now provide some color on the performance of our store remodels, customer satisfaction surveys and market share. With regard to the performance of recently remodeled stores, our first-year remodels showed an average lift of approximately 3.5% when compared to other stores in their respective markets. Store cycling their one-year opening were up 180 basis points in their second year on a comparable basis. 
Moving to our customer satisfaction metrics. I am pleased to report that we have made progress in the last six months. We now have a customer service manager at each banner, responsible for improving the shopping experience in each of our stores. We also introduced a new Web-based tool that allows our customers to provide immediate feedback to our store director. Through the second quarter, eight of the nine banners we tracked enjoyed improved overall satisfaction scores from a year earlier, while scores for the ninth banner remained unchanged. 
Turning to market share. In the latest quarter, SUPERVALU either gained or held market share in 55% of our top 86 DMAs, losing share in the balance. As a reminder, these designated marketing areas generally have at least 10 stores and do over $1.5 million per week in aggregate retail sales, which include our traditional retail stores, all Save-A-Lot locations and independent stores for whom we act as the primary supplier. 
For the top 20 DMAs, which account for approximately 2/3 of our sales volume, the cumulative total share loss was approximately 40 basis points relative to a year ago, and is consistent with the trend we reported in April. 
I should also note that this figure captures planned store closures, which amount to over 2 million square feet in addition to our negative ID sales performance for the quarter. 
Let me next provide some comments on our fiscal '11 guidance. Our second quarter sales were softer than planned. And as a result, our current expectation is for full year IDs to be around negative 5.5%. We also reduced full year EPS guidance based on first-half results. 
Our initial guidance calls for the first half of fiscal '11 to be considerably more challenging than the second half, and this will continue to be the case through the third quarter. Traction has clearly been slower than expected. As Craig noted, we now expect full year adjusted earnings to be within a range of $1.40 to $1.60 this fiscal year. 
Our capital plan of $700 million remains unchanged. And as noted, we have increased our debt reduction goal to $650 million this fiscal year. 
Let me conclude by saying that we have firm plans in place around sales, margins and expenses to deliver our revised guidance of $1.40 to $1.60 per share. This reduced estimate reflects the still-competitive landscape, a stretched consumer and some changes in the pace of our execution as we carry out the business transformation Craig outlined. 
We still expect to gain traction on many of our initiatives in the back half of this fiscal year. By and large, Q3 will remain a transition quarter, and we will begin to realize the true impact of our marketing, merchandising and operational initiatives in Q4. Our leadership team is committed to taking bold actions to execute on this timeline and ensure our long-term success. With that, I will turn the call back to Craig."

Since my arrival at SUPERVALU, the company has made significant strides to realign operations, streamline decision-making and shine a light on those areas on which we must improve. 
Today, our company is modifying its operating norms and redefining its business culture and financial expectations. While we remain in the early stages of this process, these efforts will address our competitive position within food retail and instill a culture that promotes action and continuous improvement. 
We have a strong leadership team, and together with SUPERVALU's 150,000 associates, we share a sense of urgency to improve enterprise-wide execution, reinvigorate sales, address the perceived value gap that exists for some of our banners. 
The business transformation currently underway will be end-to-end and allow us to better serve the local needs of the neighborhoods we serve. And in doing so, the value we create will accrue to our shareholders. I would now like to open up the call for your questions."

So yes, we do, in many ways, want to return to that incredible heritage that we have, whether that be at Albertsons, Jewel, Shaw's, Acme, Farm Fresh. So yes to that. But it's actually a little bit different. It's not going back to what was happening in the 1970s or '80s. What I'm trying to articulate is it's really about the store, Meredith. It's less about the banner, it's about the store. And that's why I want to bring up the story about Acme because if it was only about the banner, then the assumption might be that every Acme store will be assorted the same. But frankly, we know that the store in Avalon needs to be assorted differently than the store in Ridley. And really, what we're trying to build is a process whereby the vast majority of what we sell is in fact supported here, and I think the vendors love what they're getting from support of this company and Steve Jungmann and the team. But there are those things on the edges which are going to be local. And my sense is the vendors are comfortable with it because if our sales improve, so do theirs.

We have all been reading of late about commodity costs. We did have price increases communicated to us from a major supplier just yesterday, significant cost increases across-the-board for this particular supplier. So that's relatively new news to us. The value gap, John, that's a great question. What we really look at is, if you look at our total basket versus the total basket of our traditional retail competitors, we're actually fairly in line, which is what we've articulated in the past. Where we're going, however, is we want to make sure that we reduce the extremes of the high-low. In too many cases, particularly on some key items that our customers want, we've allowed, over the years, our regular prices to get too high. So a great example is that juice side that I mentioned, where we were at $2.99 in many of our banners. We would promote it down to a great price, in which case, we'd sell a bunch on promotion. And we could argue that the average of those prices was fair. The problem for us is the regular price clearly was not fair and was not in line with what our customers were looking for. So the basket actually is pretty good today, John. And so I think that gives us the room we need to go and surgically address items, literally items, not even categories, and say, ""How do we redirect our vendor negotiations and our internal funding to make sure that rather than the extreme high-low where we've been for a number of years, we get to what Steve has called “fair pricing plus promotions."" Where we've done this, and particularly in some fresh food areas, we've seen customers respond very, very positively. We think it will take us time, which is why I said that we think this is a multi-year journey. We are not going to take any broad-based price cuts. We are going to be very surgical and very thoughtful, and work with our vendor partners as we go down this journey."

This morning SUPERVALU reported adjusted net income of $59 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.28 excluding a non-cash impairment and other charges. We continue to generate strong cash flows and now expect to pay down $650 million of debt by fiscal year-end. Free cash flow for the quarter was a strong $285 million and we have reduced debt by $512 million through Q2. Sales for the quarter were $8.7 billion and ID sales were negative 5.9%, excluding Shaw’s which was impacted by a labor dispute.
These results are disappointing to me and my leadership team and frankly given this forward and anticipated economic recovery, we see a longer time line for our corporate initiatives to gain attraction. Consequently, we are revising downward our full year guidance to a range of $1.40 to $1.60.
The economy continues to provide a headwind to our efforts. In spite of near record low interest rates meant to drive spending, the mindset of our customers remains decisively cautious with an ongoing focus on price. We find a continuing sluggishness of the private sector employment has made any uplift in grocery spending difficult. Remember that the bulk of our retail footprint is in large metropolitan areas where unemployment remains above the national average.
While the results this quarter were below our internal projections, we did make steady progress on some of our key strategic goals, which are geared towards positioning us for improving the long-term performance of this company. So, rather than spend my time on today's call looking backward, I would like to use this time to give you an update on where we are in the transformation that is currently underway. Sherry will provide more insight into our second quarter performance and revised guidance later on the call.
About a year ago, I introduced our vision for SUPERVALU to become America’s neighborhood grocer, and I remain convinced that there is an absolute need for well-run neighborhood grocery stores. We know this from our many longstanding relationships with our great independent retailers across the country. They know their customers intimately, stock products to satisfy local taste and operate with the efficiency of a family owned business.
At the core of this vision is our unwavering focus on operating as one company winning for our costumers. This means our stores will be merchandised locally, carry fresh perishables and relevant regional brands and cater to the fundamental needs of the shoppers who call these neighborhoods home. We will leverage the scale of SUPERVALU’s 4,300 store network to economically buy product, but assort based on customer preferences and execute at a local level, region by region, neighborhood by neighborhood, and importantly store by store.
This focus and discipline around hyper-local retailing will make our stores more compelling for the customers we serve. To this end, SUPERVALU began taking initial steps late last year to realign its business, clarify accountability and refocus priorities on customer-centric measures. Over the past 12 months, this organization has aligned key reporting structures as it added several new senior leaders.
We secured flexible long-term funding, we reviewed our store portfolio and monetized select non-core assets. When completed our culture will have shifted to one that is singularly focused on anticipating and meeting the needs of our customers. Through our traditional retail operations and independent partners we will deliver the freshest meat and produce, unmatched assortment of fairly priced products, great promotions, and a no hassle customer oriented experience. This commitment to our customers who underscore what SUPERVALU stands for and give us a more favorable position in the minds of our customers, something that has waned in the recent quarters.
To guide us, we have developed a detailed action plan that is now being put into motion. The near term impact will be a more robust understanding of our key business metrics, which will enhance our ability to measure real time result and react to ongoing business trends. Over the long-term, this intense focus around doing the right thing for our customers will pay off in terms of increased loyalty, top line growth end profitability.
I also want to be clear that this transformation will require additional price investments. We believe, however, that widespread efficiency improvement will help to offset the margin impact of these moves and result in improved operating results over time.
SUPERVALU remains committed to operating as one company, winning for our customers and focused on growth. In line with this strategic imperative the company will undergo a business transformation that we will expect to take about three years and address both our price position and product offering to ensure that we are dedicated to the hyper-local activities. Our stores are our company’s resources and are focused on growth and innovation.
Let me start with SUPERVALU’s renewed commitment to its customers. Our focus on the customer is the single most important element of our corporate transformation. To that end, we have begun to act as an agent of our customers and are working to offer those products shoppers want at a fair price in a friendly inviting environment. From my standpoint anything less is simply unacceptable. Our ability to deliver on these core expectations will ensure that we are rewarded with loyal customers, positive sales trends, and improved customer satisfaction scores.
Putting the customer front and center has required a significant cultural adjustment. Our company is shifting from a purchase oriented model to a strategy focused on stocking and selling the products most relevant to our customers.
By streamlining decision making, being more responsive to customer preferences, negotiating better terms with our suppliers and allocating more vendor support into pricing. We are slowly shifting our operating paradigm. Over time, I am confident that our renewed focus on customer expectations will reverse any unfavorable value perceptions.
Let me be clear that SUPERVALU is committed to its traditional retail positioning and as part of that, we must regain our relevance to customer who has multiple outlets to choose from to satisfy her grocery needs, our prices must be fair, the quality of our perishables needs to improve, our assortments have to be more locally relevant and our stores have to be simpler to shop.
In short, we must address the underlying issues impacting our retail sales and promote customer engagement through our knowledgeable and friendly associates. In effect, these changes will help SUPERVALU return to its heritage and the values of Sam Skaggs and Joe Albertson's and which many of our banners were about.
We have well-conceived plans to address each of these items. Some are extension to programs that I had previously discussed and others are new to SUPERVALU and modeled after the practices our most successful independent customers. For example, SKU rationalization is improving our steps by removing redundant sizes, creating better in-stock position, reducing labor cost and in most cases sharpening retail prices.
Through the second quarter, we completed resets on 40 center store categories and expect to optimize all of our non-perishable categories by February. More importantly, we have developed enterprise-wide standards that will allow us to better monitor our assortments so we don't allow excess SKUs to creep back into our stores. 
This disciplined approach will ensure that appropriate standards are ingrained into our corporate culture and become part of our everyday decision-making. We are also making headway to better match our assortment to the local preferences of neighborhood in which we operate. 
As an example, I am Philadelphia-based Acme vendor, covers a broad range of neighborhoods ranging from the, at north suburbs of Northwest Philly and outside (inaudible) to urban locations in the center of both cities to seasonal beach areas on the South Jersey shore such as Wildwood in Avalon.
All of our stores even across these diverse geographies will carry regional staples like tasty cakes, Herr's chips and Scott Bath Tissue, but the individual store assortments are being further tailored to cater to the local shopper. This effectively means that, where appropriate, stores in more affluent suburbs will feature expanded daily counters and (inaudible).
While stores in close proximity to many colleges in the area will cater to students with a border assortment of energy drinks and ready to eat foods and school supplies. Stores in coastal beach towns will now stock a wider selection of convenient and general merchandise like coolers and beach towels to better accommodate the needs of our seasonal shoppers.
Equally important to our work on optimizing assortment is the effort we have taken to improve price and changed customer perceptions. We fully understand our brand and price position relative to our competition and will implement fair pricing plus promotions to appeal to customers' value needs.
Let me give you a few examples of how we are acting on this today. First, in one of our banners, we introduce value pricing on keys seasonal produce. We reset base retails promoted with length, depth and frequency. The results were greater sales volume and stronger margins throughout the category. Given the success with this program, we have accelerated the roll out of this strategy to other banners.
Second. Through our entire retail network, we reduce the pricing on a prominent juice item to a $1.99 every day. That's about a $1 better than our price a year ago and I can tell you that parent shopping for their families have noticed this change in price, and as a result, we are moving more units than we did last summer. This is a great example of how SUPERVALU can drive traffic and changed prices' perception by offering customers better values on key shopping items.
SUPERVALU is increasingly doing more things like this to enhance the relevance of our offering to our customers. These price changes are departure from past practices and good example of how are companies now acting differently.
We are engaging with our vendor partners to discuss how we can change our pricing architecture with the shared goal of moving more units. As we are able to drive price points that are more competitive, shoppers are reacting with increased purchase that drive value for the manufacture and build loyalty to our banners.
You have heard me talk about the power sale items as a way to drive foot traffic, and this quarter, we had success with ready-to-serve items like canned tuna and canned pasta. Our recent promotion delivered double-digit percent increases to category trends with over 200 truckloads of product sold across our entire 4,300 store network in just two weeks time. As of the second quarter, we have also focused on an innovative customer promotion as a means to drive traffic and build customer loyalty.
In September, we rolled out a continuity program to more than 400 stores offering professional great cookware to our top shoppers as a reward for spending their dollars with us. The cookware program encourages repeat visits and is at the heart of what we do, which is the celebration of food and cooking.
Individual pieces are available for full retail and at discount purchases at participating locations. Having just completed the six-week of this program, it is tracking to expectations. The full impact of this promotion, however, won’t be known until we move closer to the program's conclusion in the fourth quarter.
Loyalty programs like this will help pull customers back into our stores, and in doing so, expose them to the investments we are making in sharp prices. These investments remain an important part of our strategy and will allow us to address consumer perceptions and nullify the price differential that we face in some, though not all of our markets.
To assure that our efforts to drive customer traffic, sales and loyalty do not impact profitability, we have created detailed action plans to offset investments in price. These include operational improvements to enhance product freshness, improve our in-stock position and offer fast returning assortments, more effective promotions, improved cost to goods and aggressive cost cutting and things like overhead, energy and goods not-for-resale.
We will be diligent and act with passion and a sense of urgency as we move forward recognizing that this journey will take time. I understand my obligation to our shareholders and the strategy, which we are executing, is intended to build an improved business model for SUPERVALU that will enhance our market position and performance over time.
Human capital is at the cornerstone of any successful enterprise and for our customer-facing business like food retail, associate engagement can be a true competitive advantage.
As we streamline our operations and improve accountability, we have communicated near-term metrics and long-term goals to SUPERVALU's associates to ensure that we operate as one cohesive entity. We have realigned reporting structures and leveraged shared resources. We have helped to empower individuals and removed bureaucratic layers from our decision-making process.
You may recall that earlier this year, I told you we were redesigning the role of our store directors to give them more opportunity to interact with shoppers, manage their stores and develop their associates.
In redefining this critical retail position, we have assessed the skills and performance of each one of our nearly 1,200 store directors, developed leadership training programs to help each of them improve their skill set. We have modified a number of in-store processes to reduce the administrative element of their job and made regular engagement with customers’ primary to this job function.
At the corporate level, our associates are engaging with peers to find better ways to execute on everyday task. As an example, the production of signs and shelve [space] has historically been managed by individual banner teams.
Earlier this summer, members of our retail operations IT and marketing groups came together to simplify this process and establish a set of best practices. Up until this point, there were more than 130 different types of tag stock and over 700 different types of sign templates used throughout our store network.
Our enterprise marketing group took the lead and engaged with consumers to determine the most appealing way to display price and value. Our IT and operations team addressed the logistical challenges posed by streamlining production, concurrent with the ongoing weekly promotions.
The cross functional team crafted a workable plan that began to rollout within weeks. The result has been a 70% reduction in stock inventory on signs and a dramatic streamlining of tag stock types. We should yield an annual cost savings of approximately a $1 million in terms of banner labor and materials procurement.
This new signage has been rolled out half our corporate stores, making for a much cleaner consisted visual display for our customers and will cascade through the rest of our banners through yearend to help simplify customer communications and brand recognition, but excitedly most and is exemplified by this project is that associates are responding to a call could take control and ownership throughout this organization.
Corporate resources are increasingly being managed with the care and attention that is associated would show as if those resources, where their own. Beyond training and solution based collaboration, we continue to aggressively control expenses and seek out new opportunities for efficiency.
As we noted last quarter, we expect to realize more than $160 million in SG&A savings this year alone. This quarter, we saw an additional $40 million in new savings and I believe we still have a tremendous opportunity here specifically an initiatives around strength, facilities and goods not-for-resale, which will continue to reduce operating cost well in to the next year.
SUPERVALU’s long-term competitiveness will depend heavily upon our ability to be better stores of our corporate resources and execute with the sense of urgency. I can assure you that from our enterprise teams to our in-store associates, this organization is committed to running leanly implementing near-term solutions and leveraging our national distribution to support the efforts of our independent retailers and traditional banners.
When I assumed my role as SUPERVALU CEO over a year ago, I did so with the conviction to enhance operations and drive new growth and innovation. This growth can and will come from all parts of the company. I talked about doubling the size of Save-A-Lot by the end of fiscal 15 and I am pleased with the progress we have made to-date. This quarter, we opened 18 new stores for a total of 38 stores during the first half of the year and we remain on track for more than 100 new locations by year end.
This quarter Save-A-Lot launched its first sustained media campaign since 2004, radio and television ads caring the message of savings made easy are now being broadcast in 42 markets with expand more than 700 stores. The cost of this campaign is being shared by our licensees and is already helping to raise ID sales in most of our established geographies.
Over the long-term, this investment will help to strengthen our brand as a hard-discount leader and improve customer awareness in our expansion markets. As you may have heard, drug store operator Rite Aid is among Save-A-Lot’s new list licensees. We are currently working on a co-branding test in 10 existing South Carolina Rite Aid stores.
The conversion of the first store was completed in late September and another nine stores opened earlier this month. We are excited to test this co-branding strategy with an experienced drug store operator and look forward to reporting on our progress next quarter, but also like to mention that the initial performance of our recently converted South Texas stores is showing great promise with sales up double digits in stores that are still undergoing remodeling in which we have yet to formally host their grand reopening as (inaudible) Save-A-Lot stores.
The clear opportunities for this organization to grow and improve upon our existing business model by innovating. Last month we announced a strategic relationship with Tata Consultancy Services through which SUPERVALU would sell its IT operations in India. This long-term business outsourcing solution will improve efficiency and free up corporate resources.
The retail food industry also has a history of implementing new technologies and business efficiencies to service our customers better and keep our cost low. I am proud to say that SUPERVALU has been an early adapter in integrating these new technologies our newest Albertsons store, which opened last month in San Diego, uses state-of-the-art technology for heating, cooling and lighting. The backbone of this effort is the 400 kilowatt fuel cell, which will generate nearly 90% of the energy need of the store. In addition, to improving our energy efficiency this technology also reduces the company’s carbon footprint.
Along the same thing, SUPERVALU received recognition from the Carbon Disclosure Project in last month become the first food retailer to join Worldwide Life Fund’s Climate Savers Program. In doing so, we have taken the leadership position within the industry and pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10% in the five-year period ending in 2012.
Finally, SUPERVALU continues to look for cost effective ways to operator stores and improve our environmental stewardship. Our store design group has been installing skylights, more efficient LED lighting and high efficiency air hand doors within our stores as well the distribution team is working to improve logistics to integrate fleet transportation and reduce fuel consumption.
As we move forward, you can expect to see SUPERVALU continue to take steps to innovate and be good environmental partner.
With that, let me turn the call over to Sherry for more detailed look at our second quarter performance and outlook, I will then wrap up with some closing comments.
"
306013,114113625,80285,"SUPERVALU Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","SUPERVALU INC.","Executives","Today, I will be covering our second quarter operating results and financial condition providing an update on a number of our operating metrics and comment on a fiscal 2011 full your guidance.Let me first address the non-cash impairment charge that we r",1603,"Today, I will be covering our second quarter operating results and financial condition providing an update on a number of our operating metrics and comment on a fiscal 2011 full your guidance.
Let me first address the non-cash impairment charge that we recorded this quarter. This non-cash charge was related to our market capitalization, which has fallen with the recent sustained weakness in our share price. Accounting rules required that we reconcile our book value to our stock price in assessing the recoverable value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Second quarter charge represents an estimate and is subject to our finalizing fair market values, which will be completed in the third quarter. Let me assure you that this non-cash impairment charge does not impact any of our financial covenants, our ability to assess our credit facility or any of our business strategy.
This quarter sales totaled $8.7 billion compared to $9.5 billion a year earlier. The 8.5% decline was a function of four main items. First, weakness in identical store sales, which declined by 6.4% this quarter. Excluding charge, IDs were negative 5.9%. With the labor dispute settled in early July we will only break this out separately in year-to-date comparisons going forward. Second, the impact of previously announced submarket access and retail store closure including Salt Lake City, Connecticut and Cincinnati. Third, target transition to self-distribution and finally the loss of Ukrop's as a supply chain customers.
Breaking down identical stores sales, we saw a 3.9% decline in customer count and a 2% decrease in transaction side. Customer count is down modestly from the first quarter and really reflects the cycling of any sector pricing and promotional initiatives introduced during the third half of fiscal 2010, which drove traffic in several of our largest markets. The sequential improvement in average transaction size is encouraging. This quarter we also saw an improvement in total unit volume compared to Q1. Similar to that quarter, trade down remained essentially flat. We estimate cost inflation ran about 1% this quarter driven partly by increases in the dairy and meat category.
During Q2, we continued to make targeted price investments across our company. Within private brand we improved our marketing and ad plans to better promote items and shelve placements while continuing to realize procurement cost savings.
In the second quarter, private brand sales penetration set a record 18.5%. We also began implementing everyday fair pricing in convenient category. These product lines were promotional pricing generates little incremental volume but requires at this proportionate amount of labor.
Lastly, we started the broader roll out of our fair price plus promotion strategy meant to remove extreme ends of our high low pricing. We believe this change to our pricing architecture is significant and will help us to address the perceived value gap that had weighed on customer traffic trends in recent quarter.
Our same store sales result through the first five weeks of the third quarter have improved about a 100 basis points from the 5.9% decline in Q2, another encouraging sign.
Moving to operating earning retail food was 2.6% of sales before one-time item compared to 2.5% last year. This modest increase was driven by improved margin primarily attributable to more targeted price investments and promotional spending, which was partially offset by the sales de-leveraging.
Supply chain services delivered a very strong quarter as operating earnings were 3.5% of sales compared to last year's 3.0%. Results this quarter continue to benefit from a strong focus on cost and efficiency. Year-over-year operating metrics and supply chain have improved. Total throughput increase which drove improvement in warehousing costs per case by over 1% and we did a better job of optimizing our fleet to reduce miles and fully utilize the capacity of our trailers. We remained pleased with the contributions of our supply chain business as we aggressively manage expenses while producing stable earnings and cash flow.
Now, let me provide some color on the year-over-year variance in corporate expenses, where the 19 million change was predominantly driven by the surplus property activity. Last year, in the second quarter, we had about 9 million in net gains from a number of properties whereas this quarter we have sourced about $6 million in expense due in part to the continued softening of the commercial real estate market .There was also an addition of $3 million in one time charges primarily related to litigations.
On the broader topic of SG&A expenses we remain on track to remove $160 million from business by year-end having taken out over $80 million in the first half fiscal 2011.The savings we expect to achieve for the balance of the year will come largely from administrative costs as we recognize the benefit of centralization efforts and process efficiencies implemented over the last few months. These efforts are ongoing and will lead to additional saving into F'12.
For the quarter, we reported a GAAP EPS loss of $6.94 per diluted share which includes $7.16 in non-cash impairment charges $0.6 in other costs. The largest portion of the other costs were related to the labor dispute at Shaw's with smaller amounts primarily tied to employees’ severance and litigation charges.
Turning to the a balance sheet, inventory days supplied fell by almost a full day compared to the last year's Q2 due to better inventory management and the benefits of skew rationalization.
We finished the second quarter with total outstanding of $7.1 billion down about $280 million from the first quarter. Year-to-date, we have reduced outstanding debt including capital lease obligations by over $500 million putting us on pace to achieve $650 million of debt repayment this fiscal year, $50 million more than originally expected. This increase is driven largely by our inventory reduction efforts and strong working capital management which is more than offsetting our reduced earnings guidance.
We remain in compliance with our debt covenants with trailing 12-month EBIT of $1.2 billion excluding impairment and other costs. Depreciation and amortization was $0.9 billion and rents expense amounted to $0.4 billion. Remaining current fiscal year debt maturities at $475 million and will be repaid from internally generated funds and availability capacity under our revolving credit facility. SUPERVALU's return to investment grade still remains a corporate priority.
Let me now provide some color on the performance of our store remodel, customer satisfaction surveys and market share. With regard to the performance of recently remodeled stores, our first year remodels showed an average lift of 3.5%when compared to other stores in their respective markets. Stores cycling their one year opening were up 180 basis points in a second year on a comparable basis.
Moving to our customer satisfaction metrics I am pleased to report that we have made progress in the last six months. We now have a customer service manager at each banner responsible for improving the shopping experience in each of our stores. We also introduced a new web based tool that allows our customers to provide immediate feedback to our store directors. Through the second quarter eight of the nine banners we tracked enjoyed improved overall satisfaction scores from a year earlier, while scores for the ninth banner remain unchanged
Turning to the market share, in the latest quarter SUPERVALU either gained or held market share in 55% of our top 86 DMAs losing share in the balance. As a reminder, these designated marketing areas generally have at least 10 stores and do over $1.5 million per week in aggregate retail sales which included our traditional retail stores, all (inaudible) location and independent stores for whom we act as the primary supplier.
For the top 20 DMAs which account for approximately two-thirds of our sales volume, the cumulative total share loss was approximately 40 basis points relative to a year ago and is consistent with the trend we reported on April. I should also note that this figure captures plans for closures which amount to over 2 million square feet in addition to our negative id sales performance for the quarter.
Let me next provide some comments on our fiscal 2011 guidance. Our second quarter sales we softer than planned and as a result our correct expectation is for full year ID to be around negative 5.5%.
We also reduced full year EPS guidance based on first half results. Our initial guidance calls for the first half of fiscal ‘11 to be considerably more challenging than the second half and this will continue to be the case through the third quarter. Traction has clearly been slower than expected. As Craig noted, we now expect full year adjusted earning to be within a range of $1.40 to $1.60 this fiscal year. Our capital plan of $700 million remains unchanged and, as noted, we have increased our debt reduction goal to $650 million this fiscal year.
Let me conclude by saying that we have firm plans in place around sales margin and expenses to deliver our revised guidance of a $1.40 to $1.60 per share. This reduced estimate reflects the still competitive landscape, a stretched consumer and some changes in the pace of our execution as we carry out the business transformation Craig outlined. We still expect gain traction on many of our initiatives in the back half of this fiscal year. By and large, Q3 will remain a transition quarter and we will begin to realize the true impact of our marketing, merchandising, and operational initiatives in Q4. Our leadership team is committed to taking both actions to execute on this timeline and ensure a long-term success.
With that, I will turn the call back to Craig.

So what he and his team are doing is really trying to re-engineer. He has to take some labor out but I think more importantly to put the labor back and to taking care of our customers.

It’s about the store and that’s why I want to bring up the story about Acme because if that there was only about the banner then the assumption might be that every Acme store will be a sort of the same, but frankly we know that the store in [Avalon] needs to be assorted differently than the store in Ridley and really what we are trying to build is the process whereby the vast majority of what we sell isn’t back supported here and I think the vendors love what they are taking from support of this company and feed the young men in the team, but they are those things on the edges, which are going to be local. My sense is the vendors are comfortable with it because if our sales improve so to theirs and the only thing our vendors are looking for from us is increased moving the product.

We did have the price increases communicated to us from a major supplier just yesterday, significant cost increases across the board for this particular supplier, so that’s relatively new news to us.
Here the value, yes john it’s a great question, but what we really look at is if you look at our total basket versus the total basket of our traditional retail competitors, what actually fairly in line, which is what we’ve articulated in the past, where we’re going, however, is we want to make sure that the reduced the extremes of the high low.
In too many cases, particularly on some key items that our customers want, we've allowed over the years, our regular prices to get too high. So a great example is that juice item I mentioned where we were at 2.99 in many of our banners. We were promoted down to a great price in which case we sell a bunch on promotion and we could argue that the average of those prices was fair. The problem for us is the regular price clearly was not fair, was not in line with what our customers were looking for.
So the basket actually is pretty good today, John. So, I think that gives us the room we need to go and surgically address items, literally items, not even categories and say, ""How do we redirect our vendor negotiations and our internal funding to make sure that rather than the extreme high-low, where we've been for a numbers of years, we get to what Steve has called fair pricing plus promotion.""
Where we've done this in particularly? In some fresh food areas, we've seen customers respond very, very positively. We think it will take us time, which is why I said that we think this is a multi-year journey, we are not going to take any broad-based price cuts. We are going to be very surgical and very thoughtful and work with our vendor partners as we go down this journey.

I wanted to first touch on the skew reduction program. In light of the fact that Wal-Mart has obviously reversed much of the skew reduction made over the past year, I was wondering if you could provide some color on your progress to-date, and whether or not some of the skew reduction could be affecting your sales trends?

It is primarily, Radina, focused on redundant sizes more than taking brands out. There have been some cases where we have taken brands out that weren't effective. For the most part, what this has been focused on is taking out redundant sizes. I have to spoken to that in the past. We also have taken out some entire categories that ended up being fairly skew intensive but were not selling at all. So, we just removed some categories.
So that’s really where we are and we've had some items we've put back in. we're listening to our customers but it's been at the edges as opposed to wholesale having to put things back in. we do have a program in place where we make sure we are listening, we're taking care of our customers.

I think, quite frankly, the way Steve and I talk about this, this has got to be a way of life for us. The nature of the beast in food retail is that new items come out, and thank goodness, it is the life blood of this business that new items come out. I think we've done so, we need to develop a process that makes sure that we continue to bring to our customers innovative new products, new flavors, new designs. We got to get a discipline in our business that says when we do that we got to take other things out. So, its just a natural course of affairs I believe that you have to be doing skew reduction all the time and that’s sort of becoming part of our DNA today.
