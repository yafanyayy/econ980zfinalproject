Thank you for joining our call to discuss the fiscal third quarter 2010 financial results. With me today are Enrique Salem, Symantec's President and CEO; and James Beer, Symantec's Executive Vice President and CFO. In a moment, I will turn the call over to Enrique. He will discuss how Symantec executed during the quarter, then James will provide highlights of our financial results, as well as discuss our guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website at symantec.com/invest. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are also posted on our website, and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the website shortly after the call is completed.Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we will review our non- GAAP financial results focusing on year-over-year constant currency growth rate, unless otherwise stated in this prepared remarks. Sequential growth rates are based on as-reported basis. For the December 2009 quarter, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.48 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.43 per euro, compared to our guided rate of $1.47 per euro. For the December '08 quarter, the actual weighted average rate was $1.32 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.39 per euro. We have included a summary and reconciliation of the year-over-year growth rate in our press tables and our supplemental information provided on the website. Given the rapidly fluctuating exchange rate environment, I'd like to remind everyone to apply the rules of thumb provided on our October 28 call as a guide to estimating the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial metrics.Moving on, some of the information discussed on this call concluding our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the quarter, contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in these statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic report filed with the SEC. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepting accounting principles (sic) [generally accepted accounting principles] or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. And now, I'd like to introduce you to our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem."

Our focus on a few priorities enabled us to achieve better-than-expected results. We also benefited from the stabilizing economy and a moderate IT budget flush. The continued strength of our Consumer business, along with our sales and product initiatives in our Enterprise Security and Compliance portfolio, drove the strength of our results this quarter. Looking across the geographies, Europe generated strong bookings, the Americas saw continued demand in the government sector and Asia was driven by strength in China and Australia. We also saw a rebound from customers in the financial services vertical worldwide.Sales activity continue to improve, as the sales force effectively utilized the broader Symantec portfolio that take advantage of up-sell and cross-sell opportunities. During the quarter, 39% of our deals over $1 million, included sales from both our Security and Storage segments. Our focused sales initiatives implemented over the last few quarters, are starting to have a positive impact on our execution. We won numerous competitive deals with companies in various industries and countries around the world. Our Security and Compliance business benefited from selling solutions rather than just point products. Data loss prevention and compliance solutions posted double-digit bookings growth this quarter.Barclays, a global leader in banking and asset management, signed a multi-year contract expanding our product portfolio. The deal allows Barclays to reduce costs by decreasing their vendor count, standardizing technology across multiple business lines, simplifying complex IT processes and taking advantage of both our on-premise and hosted solutions. This is one of the many examples, which illustrates that Hosted Services is an opportunity for us across enterprises of all sizes.In addition, we expanded our security partnership with another global financial institution to include our Data Loss Prevention compliance and Endpoint Security suites. Our focus on various mid-market product and channel initiatives is also beginning to produce encouraging results. We are receiving positive product feedback and higher net promoter scores from our customers and partners positioning us well for the future. A recent CRM review praised the latest release of Symantec Endpoint Protection for being well-tailored to small business customers. Partners including Ingram Micro, Tech Data, CDW and Insight recognized us for delivering programs and resources that are helping them to grow their businesses.Our Consumer business maintained its momentum. Our 2010 Norton Internet Security and Norton AntiVirus products have gained tremendous market acceptance, winning more than 50 awards in the first four months of availability. AV-Comparatives awarded Norton Internet Security the Best Product of the Year for its high detection rates, low system impact and ease of use, and our market-leading products continue to drive very high customer loyalty scores. Our reputation-based Malware Detection technology will be included in our 2010 Norton 360 products, which will ship in the March quarter. The strength of our consumer products gives us a competitive advantage with partners in all of our customer channels including OEM, ISP, online and retail. This quarter, we had several ISP wins including a competitive displacement of Comcast to provide security for its 15 million high-speed Internet customers. We also benefit from strategic marketing initiatives and from the opportunity to cross-sell consumer services. This multi-year deal was driven by the quality of our products, as well as our ability to leverage our enterprise relationship with Comcast in their data centers.We also signed a deal with Qwest, another top global ISP to offer security products to their high-speed Internet customers. This expands the existing agreement in which Qwest offers its high-speed Internet customers automatic online backup. Furthermore, in Europe, we renewed a multi-year agreement to provide security to Deutsche Telecom's T-Home customers. Additionally, our Norton Security Scan solution will be available as a download to four new partnerships this quarter. In Asia, we continue to have partnerships with multiple motherboard manufacturers and expanded our relationship with MSI to include Norton Internet Security and Norton Online Backup.We also won an agreement with the Positivo, the largest OEM in Brazil. In the retail channel, we further expanded our relationship with Staples. We have seamlessly rolled out new eCommerce stores in all major markets around the world. The additional customer information we have already acquired is being used to develop enhancements and offers that will benefit our business, both in the short and long-term. We are on track to complete the transition on schedule.Now moving to our Cloud and SaaS [Software-as-a-Service]-based offerings. We are pleased with the record bookings performance by the Symantec Hosted Services team this quarter. The strong results were driven by leveraging Symantec's go-to-market network, which generated more than 75 deals during the quarter. Our Hosted Services business now works with 1,800 partners. Additionally, we won multiple deals over $1 million. This is indicative of what we're starting to see with large enterprises adopting hosted solutions.Also during the quarter, we acquired SoftScan, the privately-held SaaS security leader in the Nordic region. This industry-consolidating deal extends our SaaS security leadership. For the healthcare vertical, we launched a SaaS solution addressing hospitals' growing need for storing medical images. We will also allow secure access to these images for affiliated and non-affiliated providers over the Internet.Other Cloud initiatives, including consumer online backup, now host over 45 petabytes of data for more than 11 million customers. Our new cloud storage platform that supports SaaS services is largely built on the Symantec FileStore architecture. FileStore is the latest in scalable file server technology that is now being used by customers to create their own public and private cloud infrastructures.In our Storage business, customers continue to buy licenses for only their current needs. We remain focused on leveraging partnerships to drive sales of our storage products. Customers now have the option to select Storage Foundation and Symantec Endpoint Protection to manage and protect their cloud-based servers with Amazon's EC2 cloud platform.We saw increased adoption of next-generation data production in the enterprise, resulting in solid growth for NetBackup. PureDisk realized double-digit sequential revenue growth as our deduplication technology is a clear differentiator. Customers are pleased with PureDisk's faster installation and more user-friendly interface in the new 6.6 release. Also, Backup Exec sales remains stable as a result of our focused marketing programs and strong partner relationships.Earlier this week, we were pleased to announce the launch of NetBackup 7 and Backup Exec 2010, providing innovative solutions across all business customer segments. Both releases have integrated deduplication technology so customers can store less data, recovery data faster and save more money. Symantec is the only company to provide multiple deduplication options for our customers at the client, the media server and with a variety of third party appliances to our Symantec open storage technology.Customers participating in our First Availability program are excited about the integrated deduplication features and our market-leading virtual machine protection capabilities for both the SMB [small and mid-sized business] and Enterprise segments.Backup Exec 2010 now provide the SMB market an integrated archiving option powered by Enterprise Vault. Our software archive data from the backup data set run on separately, pulling data from the source. This approach is more efficient and reduces costs per our customers. We expect these releases will benefit our cross-selling capabilities during the next fiscal year as we educate our customers and the channel on the benefits of these products.During the quarter, we saw strong year-over-year revenue growth for Enterprise Vault. Customers are using Enterprise Vault to improve storage optimization by deduplicating e-mail and file server data. This reduces the backup size and in addition, we are able to help house long-term archives on cheaper storage tiers.In conclusion, the December quarter illustrates the ongoing progress that we're making. The sales team is diligently executing the productivity initiatives put into place earlier in the year. And I'm especially pleased with the focus we have on selling our security and backup solutions to enterprise and consumer customers. We will continue to deliver product integration across the portfolio and have a healthy pipeline of new product releases, which we will be discussing with our customers in more detail at our User Conference in April. I'll now turn the call over to James to provide you the financial details for the quarter."

I am pleased to report that Symantec achieved better-than-expected third quarter results in each of our key financial metrics, both on an as-reported basis and after adjusting for foreign currency. During",1202,"Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report that Symantec achieved better-than-expected third quarter results in each of our key financial metrics, both on an as-reported basis and after adjusting for foreign currency. During the quarter, the U.S. dollar weakened 12% against the euro versus the year-ago period, increasing our international revenue as measured in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency movements positively impacted revenue by $63 million or by four percentage points year-over-year. Currency effects had no impact on revenue as compared to the guidance we have provided on October 28. Revenue for the third quarter was $1.55 billion, a decline of 3% from the year-ago period and an increase of 5% sequentially. Net income was $326 million resulting in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.40 for the December 2009 period. We are encouraged by the improving trends in our license revenue and by the sequential stabilization of our maintenance revenues. In particular, we saw strong performance from our energy and government verticals. We are pleased with the favorable ruling we received from the U.S. Tax Court regarding the Veritas tax assessment for 2000 and 2001. After evaluating the December ruling, we concluded that our previous accrual related to this matter, exceeded our revised estimated incremental tax liability. As a result, we realized a one-time benefit to get net income of $78.5 million, equivalent to $0.10 of benefit to earnings per share.On a non-GAAP basis, we recorded a one-time benefit to net income of $16.5 million, equivalent to $0.02 of earnings per share benefit. The non-GAAP benefit is due to the reversal of accrued interest on the original tax assessment, which we've been recording since the Veritas acquisition. As a result of the judge's ruling, we do not expect to make any additional cash payments related to this matter.Now, I will review the financial details of the December quarter. By geography, our international revenue of $793 million represented 51% of our total and decreased 5% year-over-year. The Asia Pacific/Japan region grew 5%, while the Americas declined 2% and the Europe, Middle East, Africa region declined by 9%. Now, moving on to revenue by segment. The Consumer business had another strong quarter, generating revenue of $478 million, up 3% versus the December 2008 quarter. Sequentially, revenue was up 3%. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for the Consumer group. Electronic distribution continues to represent approximately 80% of the units revenue, while our award-winning Norton 360 suite grew 41% versus the reported results in the year-ago period and accounted for 36% of consumer revenue.Across our Enterprise business, we generated a total of 460 transactions, valued at more than $300,000 each, up 3% year-over-year and up 65% sequentially. We generated 108 transactions worth more than $1 million, up 4% year-over-year and up to 54% sequentially.All of our deals valued at more than $300,000, 73% included more than one of our products. The Security and Compliance group generated revenue of $372 million, a decline of 2% year-over-year and an increase of 7% sequentially. We are pleased both with our security deal win rate and with the improvement we saw in cross-selling of various security products. In fact, eight of our top 10 deals included multiple security offerings, with Data Loss Prevention posting double-digit year-over-year growth.The Storage and Server Management group generated revenue of $594 million, a decline of 80% year-over-year and an increase of 6% sequentially. This year-over-year performance was driven by the continuation of the near-term focused customer buying behavior that we have experienced during the last two quarters. In addition, the server market deceleration continued to put pressure on the Storage business, particularly related to new license sales on the Sun platform. Our Services business generated revenue of $107 million, down 5% year-over-year but up 4% sequentially. Turning now to margins, gross margin was 86.5% for the December 2009 quarter, in line with the comparable year-ago period. Our operating margin of 28.3% was down 390 basis points year-over-year, due to higher OEM placement fees and the launch of our new eCommerce platform. We expect to see the corresponding benefits of these investments during the next 12 to 24 months. Now moving on to the balance sheet, we exited the December quarter with the cash position of approximately $2.6 billion. Cash flow from operating activities generated $393 million in the December quarter. Our business continues to deliver strong cash flow from operations, generating approximately $1 billion to date this fiscal year. During the quarter, we spent $121 million to repurchase 6.8 million shares at an average price of $17.76. Days sales outstanding was 53 days. Non-GAAP deferred revenue at the end of the December 2009 quarter, was $3.065 billion, up 2% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis, and up 5% sequentially on an as-reported basis. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted non-GAAP deferred revenue versus our guidance. At foreign exchange remained at the guided rate for the quarter, deferred revenue would have been $3.1 billion, exceeding guidance by a greater amount than the reported figure.Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for the March 2010 quarter. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.40 per euro versus the $1.30 per euro we experienced the March 2009 quarter, equivalent to approximately an 80% currency tail. Also the end-of-period rate for the March 2009 quarter was $1.34 per euro, equivalent to a 4.5% currency tailwind versus our $1.40 per euro assumption. It is worth noting that sequentially, our $1.40 per euro assumption is equivalent to a currency headwind for both revenue and deferred revenue, something we haven't experienced during this fiscal year.Specifically, the sequential revenue headwind is equivalent to approximately 5% and the deferred revenue headwind is equivalent to approximately 2%. Our guidance also assumes a common stock equivalence total for the quarter of approximately 819 million shares and an effective tax rate of 28%.For the March 2010 quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.51 billion to $1.525 billion, as compared to revenue of $1.488 billion during the March 2009 quarter. At the midpoint of the guided range, we expect revenue to increase by approximately 2% year-over-year on an as-reported basis.Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.36 to $0.37, as compared to $0.38 in the year-ago period. Approximately $0.02 of dilution is related to the projected increase in consumer OEM unit shipments, which results in higher placement fees. Clearly, higher-than-expected PC unit shipments bodes well for our Consumer business.We expect non-GAAP deferred revenue to be between $3.175 billion and $3.205 billion, as compared to $3.083 billion at the end of March 2009. At the midpoint of the guided range, we expect deferred revenue to grow 3.5% year-over-year on an as-reported basis. We expect 65% or $993 million of our March quarter revenue to come from the balance sheet. In closing, I'd like to emphasize that while we are pleased with our revenue and deferred revenue performance in the December quarter, we will continue to focus intently on our cost structure, as we work to offset the near-term P&L impact of the growth in our consumer OEM fees. And now, I'll turn it back to Helyn, so that we can take some of your questions."

A couple of things that are important to our customers is we want them to not think about backup and archiving separately. We want them to look at that as one integrated capability, so instead of having to perform a backup on, let's say, an exchange server, and then do a separate archive, what we've done is to optimize the entire process and we're uniquely positioned to do this. What you're able to do is basically archive off of the backup data set. That makes the utilization of the exchange server much more efficient, and so that example of bringing together archiving and backup is an important thing that we have been talking about because it simplifies deployment, better utilizes the resources. We've integrated deduplication capabilities. We've improved the virtualization or virtualized environment support, and so the new capabilities and the integration of the market-leading archiving technologies starts to provide greater differentiation for both of those market-leading products."

And that's what I think is starting to drive some of the success in the large enterprise or in larger deals. We've been talking about, for the last year, further integration of our technologies. When you look at what we're doing with products like net backup and archiving, that's just an example. You'll be hearing more from us at our User Conference about how we're leveraging our DLP technology more broadly. So it's really about integration, enabling us to cross-sell across the entire portfolio. The other thing I want to just call out, which is also encouraging for me, is to look at the ability to work across the Consumer business and the Enterprise business. And if you look at the Comcast deal, our grave relationships with Comcast and the data center enabled them to have a very favorable view towards Symantec that was very supportive of the work we did on the consumer side. And so when you look at what we're doing, we're starting to get leverage across the portfolio and also across business segments."

And what's differentiating us, Brad, is we're incredibly pleased with how well the products are doing. We were having a discussion internally here the other day where we said winning 50 awards in four months, I mean that's almost becoming, to us, like second nature. That's unheard of. Very few companies. We win every award now with our consumer products. And so from our perspective, the ability to have the best products in the market is allowing us to go across the channels. And so as James has mentioned, one of the places that you're going to see some benefit is, while the OEM fees have gone up and there is a lag between when the OEM fees go up and when the bookings come in and then when the ratable revenue materializes, so there's definitely a lag there. But we're encouraged by the cross channel and some of the things that we're seeing given the product capabilities. Now to the HP deal, I don't have anything new to report. Clearly, we're always looking at all of the different OEM deals. We stand by what we've always said, which we're not going to do deals that don't make economic sense for Symantec.

And with Comcast, they clearly saw the great performance of our products, the quality of the products, plus the relationship they were enjoying with us in the data center that drove our ability to expand into being the provider for the 15 million Internet users at Comcast. As far as the go forward model for us, what we're very focused on, is given the strength of our products, we want to get more unit into the marketplace and so we are absolutely working across all of the different channels to get as many of the 2010 products into the marketplace."

Some of our new heuristic technologies, our reputation-based technologies, our intrusion prevention technologies, so there's a whole range of things that could be utilized to detect the threat. The second part of it is, what are people targeting ultimately is information. Whether that information is intellectual property in the form of source code, customer data, credit card data.

In a moment, I will turn the call over to Enrique. He will discuss how Symantec executed during the quarter, then James will provide highlights of our financial results as well as discuss our guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session.
Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our website. And a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on our Investor Relations website shortly after the call is completed.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we will review our non-GAAP financial results focusing on year-over-year constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated. Sequential growth rates are based on our recorded results. For the March quarter 2010, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.38 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.35 per euro compared to our guided rate of $1.40 per euro. 
For the March 2009 quarter, the actual weighted average was $1.30 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.34 per euro. We've included a summary and reconciliation of the year-over-year growth rate in our press release tables and in our supplemental information.
As we stated on last week's call, we will regularly provide a currency update following the end of each quarter. This will be posted on our website's Quarterly Results section. Given the rapidly fluctuating exchange rate environment, we encourage everyone to apply the rule of thumb as a guide to estimating the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial metrics once the quarter has ended.
Moving on. Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter, contain forward-looking statements.
These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statement. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. And now, I would like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem."

It's a great way to end the fiscal year. We started this fiscal year with a clear set of priorities. And as I looked back over the year, I'm proud of what we've accomplished. I'm pleased with the progress we've made in revitalizing our Security business, moving customers to the next generation data protection, driving the commoditization of IT infrastructure and expanding our Cloud-based offerings.
We also made significant progress using technology across our business to develop unique, integrated solutions that make cross-selling our products much easier for our sales team.
Now I'll spend some time discussing the highlights from this last quarter. Our Consumer business generated another quarter of robust growth, reflecting strong go-to-market partnerships. Our results-oriented relationships enabled us to acquire consumers and grow our business aggressively. We focused on replacing the competition and structuring positive financial deals for both Symantec and the partner. 
We entered into a significant new partnership with Samsung, shipping Norton Internet Security on their netbooks, and Norton Online Backup on their netbooks and notebooks worldwide. In addition, Fujitsu signed the exclusive agreement to ship Norton products globally on their consumer and commercial PCs. We now have partnerships with nine of the top 10 OEMs with our security products. We continue to expand our partnerships with our online backup offerings and have partnerships with six of the top 10 OEMs, five of which we signed during the last year.
Our new eCommerce solution is also helping us to acquire and retain more customers. We're very thorough in the development of our eCommerce platform and we now have access to much richer information about our customers. We're also benefiting from the ability to quickly make improvements to address the unique needs of each customer segment and we have already seen an increase in OEM trialware conversions. We expect to complete the transition to our in-house eCommerce platform by the end of the June quarter. 
We continued to successfully upsell customers from Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security to Norton 360. We're excited about the new version of Norton 360, which became available in February. And is already winning awards around the world, including PC Magazine's Editor's Choice. Norton 360 now includes our reputation-based technology which has earned us the top spot in rigorous industry tests, such as AV-Comparatives. Norton 360 remains the industry lightest and fastest all-in-one security suite with an integrated tuneup feature that keeps a PC running like it's new.
Customers using backup in Norton 360 or using our stand-alone Norton Online Backup product, now have the ability to access their data from iPads, iPhones and Android devices. Symantec now hosts 56 petabytes of data for 12 million customers. We are the undisputed global leader in online backup.
Moving on to our Enterprise business. Surveys report that customers value the breadth of our portfolio and prefer to work with a single vendor. During the fourth quarter, 49% of our deals over $1 million included sales from both our Security and Storage segments. This continues to build on the positive progressions we've seen from 27% in the September quarter and 39% in the December quarter.
During the quarter, we also generated strong sales with companies in the financial services, telecommunications and the government sector. TSYS, a leader in electronic payment services selected Symantec for endpoint protection, data loss prevention, net backup with deduplication, and business critical services.
The Australian defense department purchased our Control Compliance Suite and Business Critical Services supporting over 90,000 endpoints and 5,000 servers. Also, a large global telecommunications provider chose Symantec for Storage Foundation HA, enterprise vault, NetBackup and our Control Compliance Suite.
Our SaaS business, Symantec Hosted Services generated record revenue and posted double-digit growth. Our solid performance spanned all geographies and all customer sizes, including noteworthy strength from the SMB segment. We saw increased adoption of our hosted services within the Symantec customer base. For example, Ford signed a multiyear contract to protect over 150,000 users. 
During the March quarter, 134 hosted services deals came from the established Symantec relationships. And we added more than 100 new partners to our SaaS distribution network. Additionally, our Symantec Protection Suites now include hosted mail and web security as add-on options. 
Finally, our new Symantec hosted Endpoint Protection offering is currently in beta test and we are receiving very positive feedback. We expect this offering which brings together our expertise in Endpoint Security and SaaS to be released this quarter.
With respect to our on-premise security solutions, data loss prevention and compliance achieved another strong quarter of double-digit year-over-year bookings growth.  In April, we announced new versions of suites across our entire security portfolio. We also announced the release of our new security management console, Symantec Protection Center. 
Symantec Protection Center integrates multiple technologies across our Security business to deliver a unified management console with role-based access control, single sign-on, superior cross-product reporting and integrated policy management.
In addition to the recent security releases, last week, we announced our pending acquisition of encryption leaders, PGP and GuardianEdge. Combined with our data loss prevention solution, we continue to lead the market in providing comprehensive, information-centric protection. Furthermore, with our March announcement of Data Insight, an internally developed technology created jointly by our storage and security teams, we'll be the only company that can deliver intelligent, policy-driven security solutions to give users access to the specific data based on information intelligence and ownership. Going forward, Data Insight and encryption will be key technologies leveraged across our security and storage portfolio.
Our Storage and Server Management segment reported improved results year-over-year. We're seeing early traction in the adoption of version 5.1 of Storage Foundation HA released in December 2009. This release enables organizations to capitalize on new storage technology, such as solid state drives and thin provisioning, while continuing to reduce costs and complexity through improved performance and consolidation. We have expanded the distribution of our FileStore solution beyond the Huawei-Symantec joint venture, recently signing OEM agreements with Fujitsu America and Xiotech.
This gives customers choice in how they want to deploy our scalable file server solution to handle demanding workloads and to build their storage Cloud infrastructure. 
With information continuing to grow at unprecedented rates, our focus on next-generation information management couldn't be more relevant. Both NetBackup and Backup Exec posted solid, year-over-year revenue growth this quarter. In February, we released NetBackup 7.0 and Backup Exec 2010 and the response from our customers has been very positive. We're seeing high adoption rates for both products. There've been more than 1,000 customer installations of NetBackup 7.0 and more than 60,000 installations of Backup Exec 2010 since the release.
Customer adoption is being driven by the enhanced support for virtual environments and integrated deduplication features. Symantec is the only company that offers integrated deduplication at the client, media server and on third-party appliances through Symantec's open storage technology or OST program. The industry supports our deduplication solutions. 
We now have 14 independent hardware vendors in the OST program including, Data Domain, Quantum and FalconStor. In conclusion, our March quarter results illustrate the ongoing progress we're making. And our new product releases position us well to take advantage of the improving economic environment.
With that, I'll turn the call over to James to provide you the financial details of the quarter. And then I'll provide you with some comments on what to expect in fiscal year, 2011."
35000,99281521,59797,"Symantec Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, May-05-2010",2010-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report that our ongoing focus on consistent execution led us to exceed our guided range for each of our key financial metrics, both on an as-reported basis and after adjusting for foreign c",1954,"Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report that our ongoing focus on consistent execution led us to exceed our guided range for each of our key financial metrics, both on an as-reported basis and after adjusting for foreign currency. We closed the year with strong cash flow from operations, generating a total for the year of $1.69 billion, which clearly illustrates the resiliency of our business even during a challenging macroeconomic period. 
Our balance sheet continues to be strong, providing us with significant financial flexibility. We exited the March quarter with over $3 billion of cash on hand, 60% of which is held on-shore. We also generated solid sequential and year-over-year growth in deferred revenue.
During fiscal year 2010, non-GAAP revenue totaled $6 billion, a decline of 3% from the previous year. Fiscal year 2010 non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.51, down 4% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was down 180 basis points to 28.6% due to higher OEM placement fees and the launch of our new eCommerce platform, which together accounted for 120 basis points of the decline. 
The extra week of activity that occurred in the June quarter of fiscal year 2009 accounted for another 30 basis points of the year-over-year operating margin decline.
As we move into fiscal year 2011, we will continue to improve the efficiency of our cost structure, as well as redirect more of our spending to areas that offer the most potential for growth, such as the Consumer business and our hosted SaaS offerings.
Now I'll review the financial details of the March quarter. Non-GAAP revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.535 billion, flat versus the year-ago period in constant currency terms, and an increase of 3% on an as-reported basis. This quarter's revenue was driven by strength in our Consumer, Enterprise, Backup and Archiving, Data Loss Prevention and Hosted Services businesses. 
Net income was $327 million resulting in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.40 for the March 2010 period. Several one-time tax benefits added $0.02 to this quarter's earnings per share.
During the quarter, the U.S. dollar weakened 6% against the euro versus the year-ago period, increasing our international revenue as measured in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency movements positively impacted revenue by $40 million or by three percentage points year-over-year. 
Currency effects, however, negatively impact impacted revenue as compared to the guidance we've provided on January 27. Had currencies remained at our guided rate for the March quarter, non-GAAP revenue would've been $1.54 billion.
By geography, international revenue of $768 million represented 50% of the total and decreased 3% year-over-year in constant currency. On an as-reported basis, however, international revenue grew 3%. The Americas region grew 3% in both constant currency and on an as-reported basis, while Asia-Pacific Japan declined 1% in constant currency terms, but grew 5% on an as-reported basis. The Europe, Middle East, Africa region declined by 4% in constant currency and grew 2% as reported.
Now moving on to revenue by segment. The Consumer business had another strong quarter generating revenue of $483 million, up 6% year-over-year and 9% on an as-reported basis. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of the year-over-year growth for the Consumer group, driven by our success in upselling customers to our award-winning Norton 360 suites. Norton 360 grew 34% versus the reported results in the year-ago period and accounted for 37% of consumer revenue.
We were pleased with the strength across the Consumer business of both our electronic and retail distribution channels. Our Enterprise business generated a total of 371 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, up 1% over year-over-year. 87 of these transactions generated more than $1 million, up 2% year-over-year. Of our deals valued at more than $300,000, 70% included more than one of our products, once again emphasizing the breadth of what we have to offer our customers. 
The Security and Compliance group generated revenue of $364 million, a decline of 1% year-over-year, but up 2% on an as-reported basis. Data Loss Prevention, Endpoint Management and Symantec Hosted Services posted strong double-digit year-over-year revenue growth this quarter. We have been pleased by the boost given to our SaaS sales by the volume of business referred from our on-premise focused worldwide salesforce. We will continue to build out our portfolio of SaaS offerings during fiscal year 2011.
The Storage and Server Management group generated revenue of $578 million, a decline of 4% year-over-year and 1% on an as-reported basis. We are encouraged however by the stabilization of our storage products sales across all platforms. We have reduced our dependency on the Solaris platform, both by focusing on growth areas, such as Windows and Linux, and by strengthening our partnerships with IBM and HP. 
OEM revenue from Sun-Oracle accounted for only $45 million during fiscal year 2010, equivalent to 5% of our Storage Management business.
Turning now to our Backup and Archiving businesses. After four quarters of year-over-year declines, Backup Exec posted revenue growth this quarter driven by strong customer demand for our Backup Exec 2010 release. Enterprise Vault and NetBackup posted double-digit and high single-digit year-over-year revenue growth respectively.
Some years ago, the Backup business saw a one-off increase in revenue at the time of a major product release, as customers not under our current maintenance contract made catch-up payments in order to access the new release. In more recent times however, we have seen an increasing customers renewing their maintenance contracts as a result of our including more meaningful features in each minor doc release, and improvements in our renewal process. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we did not see an increase to revenue related to catch-up maintenance payments, even though we rolled out major new releases of both NetBackup and Backup Exec. 
Today, catch-up maintenance payments consistently account of between 1% to 1.5% of each quarter's revenue, and are driven by negotiations of large renewal deals that extend beyond the expiration of the previous maintenance contract, oftentimes as a result of our sales force working to cross-sell additional products into a particular customer.
Our Services business generated revenue of $110 million, up 6% year-over-year and 8% on an as-reported basis. While we are moving to a partner-led approach to selling Consulting Services, we do not expect a significant reduction in our Services revenue in fiscal year 2011. As a result of our relatively large backlog of bookings, which we will fulfill during the coming year.
Our new consulting strategy represents another commitment to our partners, which we believe will yield improved license sales over time as our partners focus upon Symantec's broad portfolio of solutions.
Turning now to margins. Gross margin was 85.1% for the March 2010 quarter, down 90 basis points from the year-ago period. Cost of goods sold rose, since this line item now includes credit card fees driven by our new eCommerce store. In addition, royalties paid by our Hosted Services business also grew in line with that group's stronger performance.
Our operating margin of 28.3% was down 160 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher consumer OEM fees and the launch of our new eCommerce platform. Cash flow from operations for the March quarter grew 16% year-over-year on an as-reported basis, driven by strong collections and lower tax payments. 
Our cost reduction efforts also contributed to cash flow growth as we were able to more than offset the cash effect of increasing OEM fees and the build out of our eCommerce platform. This quarter, we spent $189 million to repurchase 11.2 million shares at an average price of $16.93. 
In total, during fiscal year 2010, we returned $553 million to shareholders by repurchasing  34 million shares at an average price of $16.39. We have $747 million remaining on our current board-authorized share repurchase plan.
Non-GAAP deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $3.22 billion, up 3% year-over-year in constant currency and 4% on an as-reported basis. Sequentially, deferred revenue was up 5% on an as-reported basis. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted non-GAAP deferred revenue versus our guidance. Had currencies remained at the guided rate for the quarter, deferred revenue would have been $3.25 billion.
Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for the June 2010 quarter. As we've discussed on our call last Thursday, we are assuming an exchange rate of $1.35 per euro in our FY '11 planning. Our guidance for this first quarter therefore, assumes this same rate versus the $1.37 per euro we experienced during the June 2009 quarter equivalent to approximately a 1% currency headwind. Also the end-of-period rate for the June 2009 quarter was $1.40 per euro versus our $1.35 per euro assumption, equivalent to approximately a 3.5% currency headwind. We will update everyone following the end of the quarter as to the actual FX rates incurred.
Our guidance also assumes a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 810 million shares and an effective tax rate before consideration of any loss from our joint venture of 27%. This figure contrasts with a full year tax rate assumption before consideration of any loss from our joint venture of 27.5%.
As we mentioned last week, beginning in fiscal 2011, we will discontinue reporting Symantec's revenue and deferred revenue on a non-GAAP basis. This change will make our disclosures more consistent with our peer group. As such, today, we are providing revenue and deferred revenue guidance for the June 2010 quarter on a GAAP-basis only. 
In addition, we expect the previously-announced acquisitions of PGP and GuardianEdge to close during the June quarter. We have assumed that the two acquired companies will add a total of less than $5 million to our first quarter revenue. Thus, for the June 2010 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.48 billion to $1.50 billion, as compared to revenue of $1.43 billion during the June 2009 quarter. 
We expect revenue to grow by approximately 3% to 5% year-over-year on both an as-reported and constant currency basis. Please note that we are expecting GAAP revenue from PGP and GuardianEdge to total $50 million to $55 million for the September through March quarters of FY '11.
GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.16 and $0.17 as compared to $0.09 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.35 and $0.36 as compared to $0.33 in the year-ago period, up 6% to 9% on an as-reported basis. We have included $0.005 of dilution in our June quarter EPS guidance is a result of the two acquisitions. 
Please note that we expect PGP and GuardianEdge will together drive an additional $0.01 of dilution in the September quarter and another $0.005 of dilution in the December quarter. We expect the acquisitions to be accretive to our non-GAAP operating results starting in the March 2011 quarter. 
We expect GAAP deferred revenue to be between $3.06 billion and $3.09 billion, compared to $2.97 billion at the end of June, 2009. We expect deferred revenue to grow 3% to 4% year-over-year on an as-reported basis and 4% to 5% on a constant currency basis. We expect approximately 70% or $1.04 billion of our June quarter revenue to come from the balance sheet.
In closing, we were encouraged during the March quarter by the improvement in our year-over-year revenue and deferred revenue performance, which reflected our initiatives to further improve execution and focus on areas of greatest growth potential. In addition, our cash flow generation continues to be robust. We are working to develop this momentum in fiscal year 2011 as we focus on a clear set of priorities. And now, I'll turn it back to Enrique to provide an update on our FY '11 objectives."

And now what I'd like to do is take a moment to discuss our focus areas for this coming fiscal year.
Customers are challenged by increased complexity in risk. Data volumes are still growing at more than 50% a year, while the threat environment is becoming much more targeted. Customers want to expand the use of virtualization and understand how they can take advantage of software delivered as a service. 
In addition, customers are dealing with the consumerization of IT and the implications of users bringing new devices into the organization. And they are managing too many point products and want to work with fewer vendors.
During fiscal year 2011, we will build upon our 2010 accomplishments by helping our customers simplify how they manage and secure their information. Our goal is to enable customers to focus on running their businesses, instead of worrying about costly breaches and system failures that put their information at risk. 
We plan to do this by building on the progress we made in the Security business by offering more solution suites, new encryption capabilities and improved centralized management. By extending our success in the Consumer Security business to protect critical information on devices beyond PCs; by helping customers adopt SaaS and appliance solutions in their environments; by driving innovation and technology advancements to more effectively back up and manage information; by enabling customers to reduce costs by commoditizing their hardware infrastructure; and by standardizing and automating more of our processes to simplify and improve the way customers and partners interact with Symantec. 
Our customers live and work in an information economy, and protecting information is essential. No matter which devices or applications are being used. We continue to focus on delivering solutions that allow customers to trust that their information will be there when they need it. And trust that it's only available to those who should have access. Enabling trust is crucial to accelerating the information economy, enabling customers to take advantage of emerging technology trends and enabling individuals and organizations to operate confidently in an information-driven world.
These efforts position us well to be the vendor of choice in helping enterprises and consumers secure and manage their information on any device across both the Enterprise and Consumer segments and in the Cloud better than any other competitor. You will hear more about our focus areas during our Financial Analyst Day on May 27. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Helyn, so she can start taking some of your questions."

That said, I think it's also going to be important that we make sure that we're funding the parts of our business that have the highest growth opportunities available to them. So that's areas like the Consumer business, our SaaS businesses and our Appliance business as well. So that'll be how we'll approach fiscal year '11."

And what we wanted just to make sure that our partners start specializing in specific parts of our portfolio, because we think that's going to be the best way to make sure that our customers can be successful. So what we did as we entered the new fiscal year, as we extended that program and the reception, quite frankly, by our partner community has been outstanding. Today, we're three partners announced some of the new things that they're doing to support the direction that we're taking. And as I think about the efforts given that focus from the partners, I think now a matter of making sure that the partner community is well-engaged with the entire Symantec sales force. That process is going well. We've been having a number of internal discussions, people understand the direction. Our customers understand the direction. And so I think so far from an overall reception in the marketplace, I'm pleased. I think people are doing and acting in the way we behave and ultimately, should make us much more scalable, because it would allow us to deliver solutions more broadly around the globe as partners are fully enabled to deliver the solutions into the marketplace."

And so from a revenue perspective, some of the investments we made in the December quarter, we're starting to see the opportunity to convert those units in the June quarter, but that's literally just a conversion. And then you take the revenue from that conversion point forward. When you comment about the lag or the notion of server shipments, definitely, server shipments have a positive impact on our business. And what you want to look at is again, there is a lag. People buy the server, and then they think about whether they do from a file system perspective, what do they do from a backup perspective and again, there is that time lag, but both or positive for Symantec.

We did some new things in data loss prevention where we added in the ten fiber list, something that we call Data Insight which is a clear differentiator that Symantec is uniquely positioned to deliver given our strong background in storage. And so what I look at is our go-to-market and the quality of our products in the securities base is rapidly improving, and I expect that to continue. From a competitive perspective, I would tell you that we have been gaining a lot of large wins. We're tracking the numbers of nodes that we're winning on a quarterly basis across all three geos. That number's continuing to increase. I haven't seen anything different. We've got a number of different competitors, and some of our competitors are geographic based, some of them are segment based.

It's not about if somebody's greater in that back up, I wanted to be greater than that back up, and we were making sure that they have the intellectual property and the tools and the training to be successful. So we've done a very detailed effort to make sure that the partners are ready. But ultimately, our sales force, both in large Enterprise, Enterprise segments, is still with their account managers having  direct interaction with the customer. And so, the goal here is to really bring the partners in to help deliver the overall solution to the customer, and the feedback so far has been very good."

And it was very clear that there all trying to figure out what is the way to embrace some of these more consumer-oriented devices and technologies. And for Symantec, it's a positive, because when you have got kind of diversity or you've got some fragmentation, given our roots and our focus on hydrogenation, it's a plus for us.

With me today are Enrique Salem, Symantec's President and CEO; and James Beer, Symantec's Executive Vice President and CFO.
In a moment, I will turn the call over to Enrique. He will discuss how Symantec executed during the quarter, then James will provide highlights of our financial results as well as discuss our guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session.
Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our website. And a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on our Investor Relations website shortly after the call is completed.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we will review our non-GAAP financial results focusing on year-over-year constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated. Sequential growth rates are based on our recorded results. For the March quarter 2010, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.38 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.35 per euro compared to our guided rate of $1.40 per euro. 
For the March 2009 quarter, the actual weighted average was $1.30 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.34 per euro. We've included a summary and reconciliation of the year-over-year growth rate in our press release tables and in our supplemental information.
As we stated on last week's call, we will regularly provide a currency update following the end of each quarter. This will be posted on our website's Quarterly Results section. Given the rapidly fluctuating exchange rate environment, we encourage everyone to apply the rule of thumb as a guide to estimating the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial metrics once the quarter has ended.
Moving on. Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter, contain forward-looking statements.
These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statement. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. And now, I would like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem.

It's a great way to end the fiscal year. We started this fiscal year with a clear set of priorities. And as I looked back over the year, I'm proud of what we've accomplished. I'm pleased with the progress we've made in revitalizing our Security business, moving customers to the next generation data protection, driving the commoditization of IT infrastructure and expanding our Cloud-based offerings.
We also made significant progress using technology across our business to develop unique, integrated solutions that make cross-selling our products much easier for our sales team.
Now I'll spend some time discussing the highlights from this last quarter. Our Consumer business generated another quarter of robust growth, reflecting strong go-to-market partnerships. Our results-oriented relationships enabled us to acquire consumers and grow our business aggressively. We focused on replacing the competition and structuring positive financial deals for both Symantec and the partner. 
We entered into a significant new partnership with Samsung, shipping Norton Internet Security on their netbooks, and Norton Online Backup on their netbooks and notebooks worldwide. In addition, Fujitsu signed the exclusive agreement to ship Norton products globally on their consumer and commercial PCs. We now have partnerships with nine of the top 10 OEMs with our security products. We continue to expand our partnerships with our online backup offerings and have partnerships with six of the top 10 OEMs, five of which we signed during the last year.
Our new eCommerce solution is also helping us to acquire and retain more customers. We're very thorough in the development of our eCommerce platform and we now have access to much richer information about our customers. We're also benefiting from the ability to quickly make improvements to address the unique needs of each customer segment and we have already seen an increase in OEM trialware conversions. We expect to complete the transition to our in-house eCommerce platform by the end of the June quarter. 
We continued to successfully upsell customers from Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security to Norton 360. We're excited about the new version of Norton 360, which became available in February. And is already winning awards around the world, including PC Magazine's Editor's Choice. Norton 360 now includes our reputation-based technology which has earned us the top spot in rigorous industry tests, such as AV-Comparatives. Norton 360 remains the industry lightest and fastest all-in-one security suite with an integrated tuneup feature that keeps a PC running like it's new.
Customers using backup in Norton 360 or using our stand-alone Norton Online Backup product, now have the ability to access their data from iPads, iPhones and Android devices. Symantec now hosts 56 petabytes of data for 12 million customers. We are the undisputed global leader in online backup.
Moving on to our Enterprise business. Surveys report that customers value the breadth of our portfolio and prefer to work with a single vendor. During the fourth quarter, 49% of our deals over $1 million included sales from both our Security and Storage segments. This continues to build on the positive progressions we've seen from 27% in the September quarter and 39% in the December quarter.
During the quarter, we also generated strong sales with companies in the financial services, telecommunications and the government sector. TSYS, a leader in electronic payment services selected Symantec for endpoint protection, data loss prevention, net backup with deduplication, and business critical services.
The Australian defense department purchased our Control Compliance Suite and Business Critical Services supporting over 90,000 endpoints and 5,000 servers. Also, a large global telecommunications provider chose Symantec for Storage Foundation HA, enterprise vault, NetBackup and our Control Compliance Suite.
Our SaaS business, Symantec Hosted Services generated record revenue and posted double-digit growth. Our solid performance spanned all geographies and all customer sizes, including noteworthy strength from the SMB segment. We saw increased adoption of our hosted services within the Symantec customer base. For example, Ford signed a multiyear contract to protect over 150,000 users. 
During the March quarter, 134 hosted services deals came from the established Symantec relationships. And we added more than 100 new partners to our SaaS distribution network. Additionally, our Symantec Protection Suites now include hosted mail and web security as add-on options. 
Finally, our new Symantec hosted Endpoint Protection offering is currently in beta test and we are receiving very positive feedback. We expect this offering which brings together our expertise in Endpoint Security and SaaS to be released this quarter.
With respect to our on-premise security solutions, data loss prevention and compliance achieved another strong quarter of double-digit year-over-year bookings growth.  In April, we announced new versions of suites across our entire security portfolio. We also announced the release of our new security management console, Symantec Protection Center. 
Symantec Protection Center integrates multiple technologies across our Security business to deliver a unified management console with role-based access control, single sign-on, superior cross-product reporting and integrated policy management.
In addition to the recent security releases, last week, we announced our pending acquisition of encryption leaders, PGP and GuardianEdge. Combined with our data loss prevention solution, we continue to lead the market in providing comprehensive, information-centric protection. Furthermore, with our March announcement of Data Insight, an internally developed technology created jointly by our storage and security teams, we'll be the only company that can deliver intelligent, policy-driven security solutions to give users access to the specific data based on information intelligence and ownership. Going forward, Data Insight and encryption will be key technologies leveraged across our security and storage portfolio.
Our Storage and Server Management segment reported improved results year-over-year. We're seeing early traction in the adoption of version 5.1 of Storage Foundation HA released in December 2009. This release enables organizations to capitalize on new storage technology, such as solid state drives and thin provisioning, while continuing to reduce costs and complexity through improved performance and consolidation. We have expanded the distribution of our FileStore solution beyond the Huawei-Symantec joint venture, recently signing OEM agreements with Fujitsu America and Xiotech.
This gives customers choice in how they want to deploy our scalable file server solution to handle demanding workloads and to build their storage Cloud infrastructure. 
With information continuing to grow at unprecedented rates, our focus on next-generation information management couldn't be more relevant. Both NetBackup and Backup Exec posted solid, year-over-year revenue growth this quarter. In February, we released NetBackup 7.0 and Backup Exec 2010 and the response from our customers has been very positive. We're seeing high adoption rates for both products. There've been more than 1,000 customer installations of NetBackup 7.0 and more than 60,000 installations of Backup Exec 2010 since the release.
Customer adoption is being driven by the enhanced support for virtual environments and integrated deduplication features. Symantec is the only company that offers integrated deduplication at the client, media server and on third-party appliances through Symantec's open storage technology or OST program. The industry supports our deduplication solutions. 
We now have 14 independent hardware vendors in the OST program including, Data Domain, Quantum and FalconStor. In conclusion, our March quarter results illustrate the ongoing progress we're making. And our new product releases position us well to take advantage of the improving economic environment.
With that, I'll turn the call over to James to provide you the financial details of the quarter. And then I'll provide you with some comments on what to expect in fiscal year, 2011.

I am pleased to report that our ongoing focus on consistent execution led us to exceed our guided range for each of our key financial metrics, both on an as-reported basis and after adjusting for foreign currency. We closed the year with strong cash flow from operations, generating a total for the year of $1.69 billion, which clearly illustrates the resiliency of our business even during a challenging macroeconomic period. 
Our balance sheet continues to be strong, providing us with significant financial flexibility. We exited the March quarter with over $3 billion of cash on hand, 60% of which is held on-shore. We also generated solid sequential and year-over-year growth in deferred revenue.
During fiscal year 2010, non-GAAP revenue totaled $6 billion, a decline of 3% from the previous year. Fiscal year 2010 non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.51, down 4% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was down 180 basis points to 28.6% due to higher OEM placement fees and the launch of our new eCommerce platform, which together accounted for 120 basis points of the decline. 
The extra week of activity that occurred in the June quarter of fiscal year 2009 accounted for another 30 basis points of the year-over-year operating margin decline.
As we move into fiscal year 2011, we will continue to improve the efficiency of our cost structure, as well as redirect more of our spending to areas that offer the most potential for growth, such as the Consumer business and our hosted SaaS offerings.
Now I'll review the financial details of the March quarter. Non-GAAP revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.535 billion, flat versus the year-ago period in constant currency terms, and an increase of 3% on an as-reported basis. This quarter's revenue was driven by strength in our Consumer, Enterprise, Backup and Archiving, Data Loss Prevention and Hosted Services businesses. 
Net income was $327 million resulting in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.40 for the March 2010 period. Several one-time tax benefits added $0.02 to this quarter's earnings per share.
During the quarter, the U.S. dollar weakened 6% against the euro versus the year-ago period, increasing our international revenue as measured in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency movements positively impacted revenue by $40 million or by three percentage points year-over-year. 
Currency effects, however, negatively impact impacted revenue as compared to the guidance we've provided on January 27. Had currencies remained at our guided rate for the March quarter, non-GAAP revenue would've been $1.54 billion.
By geography, international revenue of $768 million represented 50% of the total and decreased 3% year-over-year in constant currency. On an as-reported basis, however, international revenue grew 3%. The Americas region grew 3% in both constant currency and on an as-reported basis, while Asia-Pacific Japan declined 1% in constant currency terms, but grew 5% on an as-reported basis. The Europe, Middle East, Africa region declined by 4% in constant currency and grew 2% as reported.
Now moving on to revenue by segment. The Consumer business had another strong quarter generating revenue of $483 million, up 6% year-over-year and 9% on an as-reported basis. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of the year-over-year growth for the Consumer group, driven by our success in upselling customers to our award-winning Norton 360 suites. Norton 360 grew 34% versus the reported results in the year-ago period and accounted for 37% of consumer revenue.
We were pleased with the strength across the Consumer business of both our electronic and retail distribution channels. Our Enterprise business generated a total of 371 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, up 1% over year-over-year. 87 of these transactions generated more than $1 million, up 2% year-over-year. Of our deals valued at more than $300,000, 70% included more than one of our products, once again emphasizing the breadth of what we have to offer our customers. 
The Security and Compliance group generated revenue of $364 million, a decline of 1% year-over-year, but up 2% on an as-reported basis. Data Loss Prevention, Endpoint Management and Symantec Hosted Services posted strong double-digit year-over-year revenue growth this quarter. We have been pleased by the boost given to our SaaS sales by the volume of business referred from our on-premise focused worldwide salesforce. We will continue to build out our portfolio of SaaS offerings during fiscal year 2011.
The Storage and Server Management group generated revenue of $578 million, a decline of 4% year-over-year and 1% on an as-reported basis. We are encouraged however by the stabilization of our storage products sales across all platforms. We have reduced our dependency on the Solaris platform, both by focusing on growth areas, such as Windows and Linux, and by strengthening our partnerships with IBM and HP. 
OEM revenue from Sun-Oracle accounted for only $45 million during fiscal year 2010, equivalent to 5% of our Storage Management business.
Turning now to our Backup and Archiving businesses. After four quarters of year-over-year declines, Backup Exec posted revenue growth this quarter driven by strong customer demand for our Backup Exec 2010 release. Enterprise Vault and NetBackup posted double-digit and high single-digit year-over-year revenue growth respectively.
Some years ago, the Backup business saw a one-off increase in revenue at the time of a major product release, as customers not under our current maintenance contract made catch-up payments in order to access the new release. In more recent times however, we have seen an increasing customers renewing their maintenance contracts as a result of our including more meaningful features in each minor doc release, and improvements in our renewal process. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we did not see an increase to revenue related to catch-up maintenance payments, even though we rolled out major new releases of both NetBackup and Backup Exec. 
Today, catch-up maintenance payments consistently account of between 1% to 1.5% of each quarter's revenue, and are driven by negotiations of large renewal deals that extend beyond the expiration of the previous maintenance contract, oftentimes as a result of our sales force working to cross-sell additional products into a particular customer.
Our Services business generated revenue of $110 million, up 6% year-over-year and 8% on an as-reported basis. While we are moving to a partner-led approach to selling Consulting Services, we do not expect a significant reduction in our Services revenue in fiscal year 2011. As a result of our relatively large backlog of bookings, which we will fulfill during the coming year.
Our new consulting strategy represents another commitment to our partners, which we believe will yield improved license sales over time as our partners focus upon Symantec's broad portfolio of solutions.
Turning now to margins. Gross margin was 85.1% for the March 2010 quarter, down 90 basis points from the year-ago period. Cost of goods sold rose, since this line item now includes credit card fees driven by our new eCommerce store. In addition, royalties paid by our Hosted Services business also grew in line with that group's stronger performance.
Our operating margin of 28.3% was down 160 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher consumer OEM fees and the launch of our new eCommerce platform. Cash flow from operations for the March quarter grew 16% year-over-year on an as-reported basis, driven by strong collections and lower tax payments. 
Our cost reduction efforts also contributed to cash flow growth as we were able to more than offset the cash effect of increasing OEM fees and the build out of our eCommerce platform. This quarter, we spent $189 million to repurchase 11.2 million shares at an average price of $16.93. 
In total, during fiscal year 2010, we returned $553 million to shareholders by repurchasing  34 million shares at an average price of $16.39. We have $747 million remaining on our current board-authorized share repurchase plan.
Non-GAAP deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $3.22 billion, up 3% year-over-year in constant currency and 4% on an as-reported basis. Sequentially, deferred revenue was up 5% on an as-reported basis. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted non-GAAP deferred revenue versus our guidance. Had currencies remained at the guided rate for the quarter, deferred revenue would have been $3.25 billion.
Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for the June 2010 quarter. As we've discussed on our call last Thursday, we are assuming an exchange rate of $1.35 per euro in our FY '11 planning. Our guidance for this first quarter therefore, assumes this same rate versus the $1.37 per euro we experienced during the June 2009 quarter equivalent to approximately a 1% currency headwind. Also the end-of-period rate for the June 2009 quarter was $1.40 per euro versus our $1.35 per euro assumption, equivalent to approximately a 3.5% currency headwind. We will update everyone following the end of the quarter as to the actual FX rates incurred.
Our guidance also assumes a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 810 million shares and an effective tax rate before consideration of any loss from our joint venture of 27%. This figure contrasts with a full year tax rate assumption before consideration of any loss from our joint venture of 27.5%.
As we mentioned last week, beginning in fiscal 2011, we will discontinue reporting Symantec's revenue and deferred revenue on a non-GAAP basis. This change will make our disclosures more consistent with our peer group. As such, today, we are providing revenue and deferred revenue guidance for the June 2010 quarter on a GAAP-basis only. 
In addition, we expect the previously-announced acquisitions of PGP and GuardianEdge to close during the June quarter. We have assumed that the two acquired companies will add a total of less than $5 million to our first quarter revenue. Thus, for the June 2010 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.48 billion to $1.50 billion, as compared to revenue of $1.43 billion during the June 2009 quarter. 
We expect revenue to grow by approximately 3% to 5% year-over-year on both an as-reported and constant currency basis. Please note that we are expecting GAAP revenue from PGP and GuardianEdge to total $50 million to $55 million for the September through March quarters of FY '11.
GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.16 and $0.17 as compared to $0.09 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.35 and $0.36 as compared to $0.33 in the year-ago period, up 6% to 9% on an as-reported basis. We have included $0.005 of dilution in our June quarter EPS guidance is a result of the two acquisitions. 
Please note that we expect PGP and GuardianEdge will together drive an additional $0.01 of dilution in the September quarter and another $0.005 of dilution in the December quarter. We expect the acquisitions to be accretive to our non-GAAP operating results starting in the March 2011 quarter. 
We expect GAAP deferred revenue to be between $3.06 billion and $3.09 billion, compared to $2.97 billion at the end of June, 2009. We expect deferred revenue to grow 3% to 4% year-over-year on an as-reported basis and 4% to 5% on a constant currency basis. We expect approximately 70% or $1.04 billion of our June quarter revenue to come from the balance sheet.
In closing, we were encouraged during the March quarter by the improvement in our year-over-year revenue and deferred revenue performance, which reflected our initiatives to further improve execution and focus on areas of greatest growth potential. In addition, our cash flow generation continues to be robust. We are working to develop this momentum in fiscal year 2011 as we focus on a clear set of priorities. And now, I'll turn it back to Enrique to provide an update on our FY '11 objectives.

And now what I'd like to do is take a moment to discuss our focus areas for this coming fiscal year.
Customers are challenged by increased complexity in risk. Data volumes are still growing at more than 50% a year, while the threat environment is becoming much more targeted. Customers want to expand the use of virtualization and understand how they can take advantage of software delivered as a service. 
In addition, customers are dealing with the consumerization of IT and the implications of users bringing new devices into the organization. And they are managing too many point products and want to work with fewer vendors.
During fiscal year 2011, we will build upon our 2010 accomplishments by helping our customers simplify how they manage and secure their information. Our goal is to enable customers to focus on running their businesses, instead of worrying about costly breaches and system failures that put their information at risk. 
We plan to do this by building on the progress we made in the Security business by offering more solution suites, new encryption capabilities and improved centralized management. By extending our success in the Consumer Security business to protect critical information on devices beyond PCs; by helping customers adopt SaaS and appliance solutions in their environments; by driving innovation and technology advancements to more effectively back up and manage information; by enabling customers to reduce costs by commoditizing their hardware infrastructure; and by standardizing and automating more of our processes to simplify and improve the way customers and partners interact with Symantec. 
Our customers live and work in an information economy, and protecting information is essential. No matter which devices or applications are being used. We continue to focus on delivering solutions that allow customers to trust that their information will be there when they need it. And trust that it's only available to those who should have access. Enabling trust is crucial to accelerating the information economy, enabling customers to take advantage of emerging technology trends and enabling individuals and organizations to operate confidently in an information-driven world.
These efforts position us well to be the vendor of choice in helping enterprises and consumers secure and manage their information on any device across both the Enterprise and Consumer segments and in the Cloud better than any other competitor. You will hear more about our focus areas during our Financial Analyst Day on May 27. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Helyn, so she can start taking some of your questions.

Some of that is a combination of market and then our improvement in execution.

The early returns, and I've talked to a number of very large customers that are using NetBackup 7, has been outstanding. And if you remember when we shipped NetBackup 6, the adoption was much slower, we did a number of updates. And so at this point, it's really driven by some of the new options and support for some of the new capabilities. The integration with archiving is being well received. It's also important to note we did a new release of Backup Exec that's also doing well. I think I made a comment that about 60,000 people have already installed the new version of Backup Exec 2010.

And so from a revenue perspective, some of the investments we made in the December quarter, we're starting to see the opportunity to convert those units in the June quarter, but that's literally just a conversion. And then you take the revenue from that conversion point forward. When you comment about the lag or the notion of server shipments, definitely, server shipments have a positive impact on our business. And what you want to look at is again, there is a lag. People buy the server, and then they think about whether they do from a file system perspective, what do they do from a backup perspective and again, there is that time lag, but both or positive for Symantec. And my expectation is the investment we've made in consumer so far is paying off both on the product side and on the go-to-market side.

A number of companies and businesses were impacted, a number of consumers, and so it's clearly giving us an opportunity to have conversations with those customers around not just the point security product but the entire security suite that we've got in place. And so it's been really more an opportunity to have conversations with customers who may not currently be using our product and look at a more holistic strategy. Because it's not about replacing a point product, it's about introducing the suite offerings, and quite frankly, the breadth of what we can do for a lot of these customers. So it's really giving us an opportunity to go back into those accounts and have good conversations.

You see us doing some new things with the consumer products as far as how do we more effectively move customers and continue to move them through the product range. So from the point product to the suites, we're still continue to have success on that. We've got premium editions of 360. We shipped the new version. So we absolutely believe that there's more room to work on both the renewal rates and the attach rates, Adam. And I think you'll continue to see my team get focused on that. They did a great job in the previous fiscal year, and I definitely believe there's more that can be done there. Adam, you had two parts to your question, renewals and attach, and then there was the second piece? The price increases. So when we look at prices, that is a factor, but as you know, the increases have become much smaller and there's not a lot more that can be done there. It's more a matter of how do we get everybody to the higher-end suite, which is the Norton 360 product which has the highest right price point, that's going to be the more significant benefit.

When we set out in the fiscal year, we laid out a very clear set of priorities. And one of those priorities that we set out was we were going to put a great team in place around the Security business. We were going to continue to work on delivering suites. We are going to focus on improvements in the SMB segment, and I think what you're seeing right now is that work is, it's working. I mean it absolutely has had the benefits that we expected. Now clearly, there's more work to do. We still see an opportunity to go to the broader range of our suites. We did some new things in data loss prevention where we added in the ten fiber list, something that we call Data Insight which is a clear differentiator that Symantec is uniquely positioned to deliver given our strong background in storage. And so what I look at is our go-to-market and the quality of our products in the securities base is rapidly improving, and I expect that to continue. From a competitive perspective, I would tell you that we have been gaining a lot of large wins. We're tracking the numbers of nodes that we're winning on a quarterly basis across all three geos. That number's continuing to increase. I haven't seen anything different. We've got a number of different competitors, and some of our competitors are geographic based, some of them are segment based. But ultimately, what I feel good about is our team is doing a great job in the security space and making progress. But there's more work to do in fiscal year '11, and that's why it'll continue to be a focus. We extended our portfolio with the new PGP and Guardian Edge acquisitions, and so I think we're in a very strong position for fiscal year '11 in the Security business.

In a moment, I will turn the call over to Enrique. He will discuss how Symantec executed during the quarter. Then James will provide highlights of our financial results as well as discuss our guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session.
Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website at www.symantec.com /invest. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our website and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on our Investor Relations website shortly after the call is completed.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we will review our financial results focusing on year-over-year constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated. Sequential growth rates are based on as reported results. For June 2010 quarter, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.26 per euro and the end-of-period rate was also $1.26 per euro, compared to our guided rate of $1.35 per euro.  For the June 2009 quarter, the actual weighted average rate was $1.37 per euro, and the end-of-period rate was $1.40 per euro. We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release table and in our supplemental information.
As a reminder, we will provide a currency update following the end of each quarter. This will be posted on our website's quarterly results section. Given the rapidly fluctuating exchange environment, we encourage everyone to apply our rules of thumb as a guide to estimating the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial metrics once the quarter has ended.
Moving on. Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter, contain forward-looking statements.  These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in statement. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial metrics. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. 
And now I would like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem."

I'd like to start off by highlighting our key priorities for fiscal 2011. These priorities are: extending beyond the PC in consumer security, growing license sales, expanding the adoption of our SaaS offerings and simplifying the customer and partner experience. While we made progress in some of these areas during the June quarter, a number of enterprise deals slipped due to a longer than expected customer procurement cycles driven by continued cautiousness among IT buyers. In particular, this affected our Storage Management results. With that said, we are confident that these deals have not been lost to competitors, as in fact, we have closed many of them in July. 
Having said that, highlights for the quarter included strong results in our Public Sector business and continued strength in DLP and SaaS. In addition, we are beginning to reap the rewards of our new backup solutions and are pleased with the steady growth in the Consumer business. The integration of PGP and GuardianEdge is off to a great start with customers excited with the addition of new encryption offerings to our portfolio. 
We’re pleased with the year-over-year growth in public sector deals for state, local and federal governments. We signed a multi-year contract with the U.S. Marine Corps who chose to use NetBackup with their Enterprise IT Services program. In addition, SESCAM, a Public Health Care Department in Spain, signed a multi-year contract spanning across our Endpoint Security, backup storage and service offerings. 
Our recent acquisition of GuardianEdge is resonating well within the government sector due to the adoption of standards-based solutions and increased regulatory encryption requirements. This positions us well for the federal government fiscal year and in September.
In our Enterprise Security segment, we continue to do well in a large and mid-sized enterprise market segments. In particular, customers are adopting DLP, which generated another strong quarter of double-digit growth. Our DLP solution continues to shift the focus of security from simply locking down the infrastructure to protecting the information itself. As a result, we are leveraging our relationships with CISOs to sell our data protection suite along with our endpoint security, management and compliance suites. Customers are increasingly turning towards vendors that offer complete security solutions versus point product tools. Our suites enable customers to protect completely, manage easily and control automatically the assets most crucial to their business. We’re seeing higher Net Promoter Scores as for our Enterprise Security suites driven by the recent improvement in customer experience and quality.
We continue to address the SMB market by increasing our focus with our channel partners. For example, we have expanded our small business specialization partner program. More and more small business customers are increasingly adopting managed services to reduce upfront licensing costs and operational expenses. As a result, we expanded our service prior program, enabling our partners to offer customers a monthly subscription. This licensing model aligns with the way these partners do business with their customers.
The Symantec Hosted Services business posted strong, double-digit revenue growth. Our performance was driven by Hosted E-mail Security and newer products such as Web Security. In the last 12 months, we grow our customer base by 50% and we remain the clear leader in this fast growing market by gaining share from our competitors around the world. In May, we launched our internally developed Symantec Hosted Endpoint Protection solution. The early response from our customers has been very positive do to its ease of use and lighter footprint on the endpoint. Our hosted Endpoint Protection solution was jointly developed leveraging the combined answer please enterprise, consumer and hosted services teams. We will continue to expand our portfolio by delivering additional hosted services such as Data Loss Prevention and archiving. I'm pleased with the progress we’re making in this part of the business.
Now moving on to our backup and archiving business. Backup Exec posted double-digit bookings growth of year-over-year across all geographies. Backup Exec 2010 has been one of our strongest backup releases to date. There’s been more than 155,000 installations since its February release. Small and medium-sized organizations are excited about our simplify data management from integrated deduplication and archiving as well as virtual machine protection. We will continue to educate and engage our partners on the new features and benefits of the product.
Since the launch of NetBackup 7, we have seen more than 2,350 installations and over 12,000 customers are evaluating the product, representing approximately of 25% of the NetBackup install base. Customers value the improved storage efficiency with integrated deduplication, greater infrastructure utilization and faster recovery times, which reduces the total cost of ownership. We expect this release to benefit us in the second half of this fiscal year. 
In the September quarter, we expect to ship a new version of our archiving product, Enterprise Vault 9.0. With this release, we plan to include support for Exchange and SharePoint 2010, enhance the deduplication and additional e-Discovery capabilities. These features will make it easier for our customers to adopt and standardized on our archiving solution.
Our Consumer business generated another quarter of solid growth driven by our award-winning products, superior user experience and multi-channel strategy. We continue to enter into agreements that are beneficial to both Symantec and our partners. As we announced in June, we are pleased to have extended our worldwide consumer security relationship with HP for another three years. This quarter, we expected our security OEM relationship with Toshiba to include Norton PC Checkup in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand. Norton PC Checkup helps customer become aware of PC performance problems and recommends possible solutions. This is an opportunity to up-sell our Norton Security, backup and remote service offerings. 
Our PC Tools business achieved double-digit revenue growth this quarter. We are leveraging Symantec's extensive distribution network to distribute PC Tools worldwide. For example, PC Tools is now being sold in retail stores in France, Spain, Portugal and Hong Kong, taking shelf space from competitors. We also introduced PC Tools into the Japanese markets through a co-branded security solution with BBSS, a Softbank Group company, displacing our largest Japanese competitor.
We completed the transition to our eCommerce platform in June as planned. The performance from our online store is surpassing our expectations. We can tailor the user experience depending on where the customer acquired our product to maximize customer spend and improve close rates. I'm very proud of the team's strong execution on this very strategic initiative.
I'm pleased with the progress we've made since the close of the acquisitions of PGP and GuardianEdge in early June. Through the efforts of our integrated sales force, we exceeded our bookings expectations. The acquisitions generated revenues of $4 million and diluted EPS by $0.005, in line with our plans. Encryption is being sold by the combined sales force, and the integrated product roadmap is already complete. Customers and partners are responding well and I'm pleased with how we've executed so far.
The acquisition of VeriSign’s security businesses is on track to close shortly. I'm very excited about adding identity security to our portfolio as it strengthens our core value proposition in securing and managing information. By bringing together our security portfolios, we will be the only company capable to protect identities online and create hassle-free experiences for our consumer and enterprise customers. I look forward to updating you on this acquisition in subsequent quarters.
In conclusion, we remain confident in our strategy and vision of securing and managing information and identities. We are focused on delivering industry-leading products, integrated technologies and cross-selling the portfolio. I'm confident that we have laid the foundation for continued to improved execution in the September quarter. I'll now turn over the call to James to provide the financial details for the quarter."
35000,109022660,70153,"Symantec Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2010",2010-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. In the June quarter, we saw strength in our Backup, Data Loss Prevention and public sectors sales. In addition, our Software-as-a-Service offerings posted double-digit growth. However, these positive devel",1213,"Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. In the June quarter, we saw strength in our Backup, Data Loss Prevention and public sectors sales. In addition, our Software-as-a-Service offerings posted double-digit growth. However, these positive developments were offset by the longer enterprise procurement cycles that Enrique referred to. Given the relatively high volume of our business that typically gets booked during the last week of a quarter, the additional time taken by some of our corporate customers impacted the June quarter's results. This buying dynamic was primarily a factor at some of our larger customers who typically buy products such as our storage management offerings.
GAAP revenue was $1.43 billion and increased 2% in constant currency terms versus the June 2009 period. U.S. dollar strengthened 8% against the Euro as compared to the year-ago period, reducing our international revenue as measured in U.S. dollars. As a result, foreign currency movements negatively impacted revenue growth by two percentage points year-over-year. 
Net income was $284 million, resulting in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35. The reversal of accrued interest related to the successful outcome in our Veritas 2000 to 2001 tax case added a one-time tax benefit of $0.01 to this quarter's non-GAAP earnings per share. Other one-time tax benefits recorded during the quarter generated another $0.005 of earnings per share benefit. Looking at our geographic results, international revenue of $711 million increased 3% year-over-year and accounted for 50% of total GAAP revenue. Revenue increased 2% year-over-year in each of our three geographies: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, Africa; and Asia Pacific/Japan.
Now I'd like to move on to our GAAP revenue by segment. The Consumer business had another strong quarter generating revenue of $473 million, up 7% versus the June 2009 quarter. With the launch of our eCommerce solution, our renewal and upselling efforts continued to perform well. For example, our Norton 360 revenue grew 22% versus the reported results in a year-ago period and accounted for approximately 40% of total consumer revenue. Our Enterprise business generated a total of 245 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, down 6% year-over-year. 37 of these transactions generated more than $1 million, down 30% year-over-year. The lengthening procurement cycles that I mentioned earlier particularly affected the number of large deals closed this quarter.
The Storage and Server Management group generated revenue of $524 million and declined 3%, as compared to the June 2009 quarter. We experienced fewer new license sales in our Storage Management business. However, our newly refreshed backup products performed well. Our mid-market product, Backup Exec, generated double-digit bookings growth as a result of the successful launch of the 2010 product. New releases of our enterprise-scale Net Backup product tend to be gradually adopted by data center managers over 12 to 18 months, although we are pleased with our early deployment results and with a positive customer reaction we've seen thus far. 
The Security and Compliance group generated revenue of $340 million, equivalent to an increase of 2% year-over-year driven by strong growth in both Data Loss Prevention and Hosted Services. The percentage of Symantec Hosted Services bookings driven by referrals from the on-premise sales force increased sharply year-over-year. 
Our Services business generated revenue of $96 million, an increase of 2% as compared to the June 2009 quarter. We have received positive feedback on our recently launched partner-led consulting program and we believe that our core software business will benefit from the resulting strengthening relationships with our partners.
Turning now to margins. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.9% for the June 2010 quarter, down 30 basis points from the year-ago period. Cost of goods sold increased, as this line item now includes credit card fees driven by our new eCommerce store and also reflects our increased investment in offshore technical support centers.
Our non-GAAP operating margin of 26.5% in the June 2010 quarter was down 60 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher consumer OEM fees. Cash flow from operating activities for the June quarter totaled $335 million. Cash flow was negatively affected year-over-year by higher OEM fees and cash taxes.
We exited the June quarter with approximately $2.74 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the quarter, we spent $362 million to acquire PGP and GuardianEdge. In addition, we spent $200 million to repurchase nearly 14 million shares at an average price of $14.49. We have $547 million remaining on our current board-authorized share repurchase plan. GAAP deferred revenue at the end of June 2010 was $3 billion, up 3% year-over-year.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the September 2010 quarter. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.26 per Euro for the September 2010 quarter versus the $1.44 per Euro that we experienced during the September 2009 quarter, equivalent to approximately a 13% currency headwind. Also the end-of-period rate for the September 2009 quarter was $1.46 per Euro versus our $1.26 per Euro assumption, equivalent to approximately a 14% currency headwind. 
Our guidance assumes a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 790 million shares and an effective tax rate, before consideration of any loss from our joint venture, of 28%. The acquisition of VeriSign's Identity and Authentication business is on track to close shortly. And therefore, we have already included approximately two months of revenue and contribution from the VeriSign assets in our guidance. 
Thus, for the September 2010 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.445 billion to $1.465 billion, as compared to revenue of $1.47 billion during the September 2009 quarter. We are expecting PGP and GuardianEdge to contribute $10 million and VeriSign's security assets to contribute $16 million to our September quarter revenue. Once again, these acquisition-related assumptions are already included in our revenue guidance.
We expect year-over-year revenue growth to be down 1% to 2% on an as reported basis and up 1% to 3% on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.09 and $0.10, as compared to $0.19 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.27 and $0.28, as compared to $0.36 in the year-ago period. Our September quarter EPS guidance already includes $0.04 of dilution as a result of our three new acquisitions. Specifically, we are expecting VeriSign to dilute EPS by $0.03 and PGP and GuardianEdge together to dilute EPS by $0.01 in the September quarter.
We expect GAAP deferred revenue to be between $2.83 billion and $2.86 billion, compared to $2.9 billion at the end of September 2009. We expect deferred revenue to be down 2% to 3% on an as reported basis and up 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis. We expect approximately 70%, or $1.03 billion, of our September quarter revenue to come from the balance sheet. 
In closing, we are very focused on quickly and successfully integrating our recently announced acquisitions while also executing on the growth opportunities inherent in our core business. We will continue to redirect our spending to areas with the best growth opportunities as we benefit from the various cost reduction initiatives that are driving additional efficiencies across the business. And now, I'll turn it back to Helyn so that we can take some of your questions."

When you look at the core storage management business, what we're seeing is a move in our customer base to try to build out what I'll call a more distributed or scale-out data center, where they're moving to use many commodity components, commodity storage, and that's where the technologies like FileStore become more relevant. And so we’re definitely seeing a move in the enterprise data center from what we’ve traditionally seen as what I'll say the bigger focus on bigger systems to a more distributed architecture. And that's why the FileStore capabilities becoming important. So you're right. We definitely have continued to see a softness in the sale of some of the traditional products."

And my expectations are that, that will continue, and they’ll continue to use it in many of business-critical applications. The other thing that we're seeing that we're encouraged by, is then some of the new deployments of virtualization technology, VMware and others, they're looking to us to help drive the improved SLA or availability. And so that's going to help us with some of the clustering technologies and some of the new capabilities that we'll be shipping that will support that environment. So ultimately, it's really a shift, I would say, from the architecture and the data center to what I'll call a much more distributed scale-out architecture.

And so we've got that combination and we think we’ve got the mix about right, right now with our high-end premium Norton product and then PC Tools at the low end.

Then James will provide highlights of our financial results as well as discuss our guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session.
Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website at www.symantec.com /invest. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our website and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on our Investor Relations website shortly after the call is completed.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we will review our financial results focusing on year-over-year constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated. Sequential growth rates are based on as reported results. For June 2010 quarter, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.26 per euro and the end-of-period rate was also $1.26 per euro, compared to our guided rate of $1.35 per euro.  For the June 2009 quarter, the actual weighted average rate was $1.37 per euro, and the end-of-period rate was $1.40 per euro. We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release table and in our supplemental information.
As a reminder, we will provide a currency update following the end of each quarter. This will be posted on our website's quarterly results section. Given the rapidly fluctuating exchange environment, we encourage everyone to apply our rules of thumb as a guide to estimating the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial metrics once the quarter has ended.
Moving on.

Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial metrics.

I'd like to start off by highlighting our key priorities for fiscal 2011. These priorities are: extending beyond the PC in consumer security, growing license sales, expanding the adoption of our SaaS offerings and simplifying the customer and partner experience. While we made progress in some of these areas during the June quarter, a number of enterprise deals slipped due to a longer than expected customer procurement cycles driven by continued cautiousness among IT buyers. In particular, this affected our Storage Management results. With that said, we are confident that these deals have not been lost to competitors, as in fact, we have closed many of them in July. 
Having said that, highlights for the quarter included strong results in our Public Sector business and continued strength in DLP and SaaS. In addition, we are beginning to reap the rewards of our new backup solutions and are pleased with the steady growth in the Consumer business. The integration of PGP and GuardianEdge is off to a great start with customers excited with the addition of new encryption offerings to our portfolio. 
We’re pleased with the year-over-year growth in public sector deals for state, local and federal governments. We signed a multi-year contract with the U.S. Marine Corps who chose to use NetBackup with their Enterprise IT Services program. In addition, SESCAM, a Public Health Care Department in Spain, signed a multi-year contract spanning across our Endpoint Security, backup storage and service offerings. 
Our recent acquisition of GuardianEdge is resonating well within the government sector due to the adoption of standards-based solutions and increased regulatory encryption requirements. This positions us well for the federal government fiscal year and in September.
In our Enterprise Security segment, we continue to do well in a large and mid-sized enterprise market segments. In particular, customers are adopting DLP, which generated another strong quarter of double-digit growth. Our DLP solution continues to shift the focus of security from simply locking down the infrastructure to protecting the information itself. As a result, we are leveraging our relationships with CISOs to sell our data protection suite along with our endpoint security, management and compliance suites. Customers are increasingly turning towards vendors that offer complete security solutions versus point product tools. Our suites enable customers to protect completely, manage easily and control automatically the assets most crucial to their business. We’re seeing higher Net Promoter Scores as for our Enterprise Security suites driven by the recent improvement in customer experience and quality.
We continue to address the SMB market by increasing our focus with our channel partners. For example, we have expanded our small business specialization partner program. More and more small business customers are increasingly adopting managed services to reduce upfront licensing costs and operational expenses. As a result, we expanded our service prior program, enabling our partners to offer customers a monthly subscription. This licensing model aligns with the way these partners do business with their customers.
The Symantec Hosted Services business posted strong, double-digit revenue growth. Our performance was driven by Hosted E-mail Security and newer products such as Web Security. In the last 12 months, we grow our customer base by 50% and we remain the clear leader in this fast growing market by gaining share from our competitors around the world. In May, we launched our internally developed Symantec Hosted Endpoint Protection solution. The early response from our customers has been very positive do to its ease of use and lighter footprint on the endpoint. Our hosted Endpoint Protection solution was jointly developed leveraging the combined answer please enterprise, consumer and hosted services teams. We will continue to expand our portfolio by delivering additional hosted services such as Data Loss Prevention and archiving. I'm pleased with the progress we’re making in this part of the business.
Now moving on to our backup and archiving business. Backup Exec posted double-digit bookings growth of year-over-year across all geographies. Backup Exec 2010 has been one of our strongest backup releases to date. There’s been more than 155,000 installations since its February release. Small and medium-sized organizations are excited about our simplify data management from integrated deduplication and archiving as well as virtual machine protection. We will continue to educate and engage our partners on the new features and benefits of the product.
Since the launch of NetBackup 7, we have seen more than 2,350 installations and over 12,000 customers are evaluating the product, representing approximately of 25% of the NetBackup install base. Customers value the improved storage efficiency with integrated deduplication, greater infrastructure utilization and faster recovery times, which reduces the total cost of ownership. We expect this release to benefit us in the second half of this fiscal year. 
In the September quarter, we expect to ship a new version of our archiving product, Enterprise Vault 9.0. With this release, we plan to include support for Exchange and SharePoint 2010, enhance the deduplication and additional e-Discovery capabilities. These features will make it easier for our customers to adopt and standardized on our archiving solution.
Our Consumer business generated another quarter of solid growth driven by our award-winning products, superior user experience and multi-channel strategy. We continue to enter into agreements that are beneficial to both Symantec and our partners. As we announced in June, we are pleased to have extended our worldwide consumer security relationship with HP for another three years. This quarter, we expected our security OEM relationship with Toshiba to include Norton PC Checkup in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand. Norton PC Checkup helps customer become aware of PC performance problems and recommends possible solutions. This is an opportunity to up-sell our Norton Security, backup and remote service offerings. 
Our PC Tools business achieved double-digit revenue growth this quarter. We are leveraging Symantec's extensive distribution network to distribute PC Tools worldwide. For example, PC Tools is now being sold in retail stores in France, Spain, Portugal and Hong Kong, taking shelf space from competitors. We also introduced PC Tools into the Japanese markets through a co-branded security solution with BBSS, a Softbank Group company, displacing our largest Japanese competitor.
We completed the transition to our eCommerce platform in June as planned. The performance from our online store is surpassing our expectations. We can tailor the user experience depending on where the customer acquired our product to maximize customer spend and improve close rates. I'm very proud of the team's strong execution on this very strategic initiative.
I'm pleased with the progress we've made since the close of the acquisitions of PGP and GuardianEdge in early June. Through the efforts of our integrated sales force, we exceeded our bookings expectations. The acquisitions generated revenues of $4 million and diluted EPS by $0.005, in line with our plans. Encryption is being sold by the combined sales force, and the integrated product roadmap is already complete. Customers and partners are responding well and I'm pleased with how we've executed so far.
The acquisition of VeriSign’s security businesses is on track to close shortly. I'm very excited about adding identity security to our portfolio as it strengthens our core value proposition in securing and managing information. By bringing together our security portfolios, we will be the only company capable to protect identities online and create hassle-free experiences for our consumer and enterprise customers. I look forward to updating you on this acquisition in subsequent quarters.
In conclusion, we remain confident in our strategy and vision of securing and managing information and identities. We are focused on delivering industry-leading products, integrated technologies and cross-selling the portfolio. I'm confident that we have laid the foundation for continued to improved execution in the September quarter. I'll now turn over the call to James to provide the financial details for the quarter.

In the June quarter, we saw strength in our Backup, Data Loss Prevention and public sectors sales. In addition, our Software-as-a-Service offerings posted double-digit growth. However, these positive devel",1213,"Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. In the June quarter, we saw strength in our Backup, Data Loss Prevention and public sectors sales. In addition, our Software-as-a-Service offerings posted double-digit growth. However, these positive developments were offset by the longer enterprise procurement cycles that Enrique referred to. Given the relatively high volume of our business that typically gets booked during the last week of a quarter, the additional time taken by some of our corporate customers impacted the June quarter's results. This buying dynamic was primarily a factor at some of our larger customers who typically buy products such as our storage management offerings.
GAAP revenue was $1.43 billion and increased 2% in constant currency terms versus the June 2009 period. U.S. dollar strengthened 8% against the Euro as compared to the year-ago period, reducing our international revenue as measured in U.S. dollars. As a result, foreign currency movements negatively impacted revenue growth by two percentage points year-over-year. 
Net income was $284 million, resulting in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35. The reversal of accrued interest related to the successful outcome in our Veritas 2000 to 2001 tax case added a one-time tax benefit of $0.01 to this quarter's non-GAAP earnings per share. Other one-time tax benefits recorded during the quarter generated another $0.005 of earnings per share benefit. Looking at our geographic results, international revenue of $711 million increased 3% year-over-year and accounted for 50% of total GAAP revenue. Revenue increased 2% year-over-year in each of our three geographies: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, Africa; and Asia Pacific/Japan.
Now I'd like to move on to our GAAP revenue by segment. The Consumer business had another strong quarter generating revenue of $473 million, up 7% versus the June 2009 quarter. With the launch of our eCommerce solution, our renewal and upselling efforts continued to perform well. For example, our Norton 360 revenue grew 22% versus the reported results in a year-ago period and accounted for approximately 40% of total consumer revenue. Our Enterprise business generated a total of 245 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, down 6% year-over-year. 37 of these transactions generated more than $1 million, down 30% year-over-year. The lengthening procurement cycles that I mentioned earlier particularly affected the number of large deals closed this quarter.
The Storage and Server Management group generated revenue of $524 million and declined 3%, as compared to the June 2009 quarter. We experienced fewer new license sales in our Storage Management business. However, our newly refreshed backup products performed well. Our mid-market product, Backup Exec, generated double-digit bookings growth as a result of the successful launch of the 2010 product. New releases of our enterprise-scale Net Backup product tend to be gradually adopted by data center managers over 12 to 18 months, although we are pleased with our early deployment results and with a positive customer reaction we've seen thus far. 
The Security and Compliance group generated revenue of $340 million, equivalent to an increase of 2% year-over-year driven by strong growth in both Data Loss Prevention and Hosted Services. The percentage of Symantec Hosted Services bookings driven by referrals from the on-premise sales force increased sharply year-over-year. 
Our Services business generated revenue of $96 million, an increase of 2% as compared to the June 2009 quarter. We have received positive feedback on our recently launched partner-led consulting program and we believe that our core software business will benefit from the resulting strengthening relationships with our partners.
Turning now to margins. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.9% for the June 2010 quarter, down 30 basis points from the year-ago period. Cost of goods sold increased, as this line item now includes credit card fees driven by our new eCommerce store and also reflects our increased investment in offshore technical support centers.
Our non-GAAP operating margin of 26.5% in the June 2010 quarter was down 60 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher consumer OEM fees. Cash flow from operating activities for the June quarter totaled $335 million. Cash flow was negatively affected year-over-year by higher OEM fees and cash taxes.
We exited the June quarter with approximately $2.74 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the quarter, we spent $362 million to acquire PGP and GuardianEdge. In addition, we spent $200 million to repurchase nearly 14 million shares at an average price of $14.49. We have $547 million remaining on our current board-authorized share repurchase plan. GAAP deferred revenue at the end of June 2010 was $3 billion, up 3% year-over-year.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the September 2010 quarter. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.26 per Euro for the September 2010 quarter versus the $1.44 per Euro that we experienced during the September 2009 quarter, equivalent to approximately a 13% currency headwind. Also the end-of-period rate for the September 2009 quarter was $1.46 per Euro versus our $1.26 per Euro assumption, equivalent to approximately a 14% currency headwind. 
Our guidance assumes a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 790 million shares and an effective tax rate, before consideration of any loss from our joint venture, of 28%. The acquisition of VeriSign's Identity and Authentication business is on track to close shortly. And therefore, we have already included approximately two months of revenue and contribution from the VeriSign assets in our guidance. 
Thus, for the September 2010 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.445 billion to $1.465 billion, as compared to revenue of $1.47 billion during the September 2009 quarter. We are expecting PGP and GuardianEdge to contribute $10 million and VeriSign's security assets to contribute $16 million to our September quarter revenue. Once again, these acquisition-related assumptions are already included in our revenue guidance.
We expect year-over-year revenue growth to be down 1% to 2% on an as reported basis and up 1% to 3% on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.09 and $0.10, as compared to $0.19 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.27 and $0.28, as compared to $0.36 in the year-ago period. Our September quarter EPS guidance already includes $0.04 of dilution as a result of our three new acquisitions. Specifically, we are expecting VeriSign to dilute EPS by $0.03 and PGP and GuardianEdge together to dilute EPS by $0.01 in the September quarter.
We expect GAAP deferred revenue to be between $2.83 billion and $2.86 billion, compared to $2.9 billion at the end of September 2009. We expect deferred revenue to be down 2% to 3% on an as reported basis and up 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis. We expect approximately 70%, or $1.03 billion, of our September quarter revenue to come from the balance sheet. 
In closing, we are very focused on quickly and successfully integrating our recently announced acquisitions while also executing on the growth opportunities inherent in our core business. We will continue to redirect our spending to areas with the best growth opportunities as we benefit from the various cost reduction initiatives that are driving additional efficiencies across the business. And now, I'll turn it back to Helyn so that we can take some of your questions.

I mean, 25% of the base in NetBackup is looking at the product. And so we're optimistic about what we're seeing there. When you look at the core storage management business, what we're seeing is a move in our customer base to try to build out what I'll call a more distributed or scale-out data center, where they're moving to use many commodity components, commodity storage, and that's where the technologies like FileStore become more relevant. And so we’re definitely seeing a move in the enterprise data center from what we’ve traditionally seen as what I'll say the bigger focus on bigger systems to a more distributed architecture. And that's why the FileStore capabilities becoming important. So you're right. We definitely have continued to see a softness in the sale of some of the traditional products.

The product portfolio, the largest companies in the world still depend on products like Storage Foundation and Storage Foundation HA. And my expectations are that, that will continue, and they’ll continue to use it in many of business-critical applications. The other thing that we're seeing that we're encouraged by, is then some of the new deployments of virtualization technology, VMware and others, they're looking to us to help drive the improved SLA or availability. And so that's going to help us with some of the clustering technologies and some of the new capabilities that we'll be shipping that will support that environment. So ultimately, it's really a shift, I would say, from the architecture and the data center to what I'll call a much more distributed scale-out architecture. And that's why we shipped some of the new products that we’re expecting to see some benefits as we go forward.

By simplifying the message which lines up to what customers are expecting, which is how do they get away from lots and lots of point products. That should also benefit us. So when I look across bottoming out on the Storage side; improvements in security; also the strength of the new NetBackup and Backup Exec releases; and then lastly, we did see double-digit growth in that SaaS business.

When we look at the freemuim market, we haven't seen any dramatic changes in that marketplace, and quite frankly,  we’re pleased because you take the PC Tools offerings and what we’ve done, which was our initial strategy, is we’re better positioning PC Tools to go after the more price-sensitive, buyers, to go after the freemuim or lower-cost solutions or offerings. And so we've got that combination and we think we’ve got the mix about right, right now with our high-end premium Norton product and then PC Tools at the low end.  And we think that’s going to combat the freemuim vendors.  The other thing I commented on is that we now have PC Tools also available in many of the markets where the freemuim vendors have historically done well, not just emerging markets, but parts of Europe.  So I think that will also help.

And so to that will continue to help us in that more pliant deduplication marketplace. But we are gaining share in the backup space. When you talk about the new license growth, it really is a matter of executing across the portfolio: driving more DLP, driving the new solutions from backup, driving the Software-as-a-Service opportunity. And so to get that back in place, those things I just outlined have to become a larger total percentage of the overall business.  And that’s what we're seeing as we see double-digit growth in both DLP and Software-as-a-Service. Now they’re coming off a smaller base, but as that continues, that should be a positive towards new license growth.

A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our website and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on our Investor Relations website shortly after the call is completed.
 Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we will review our financial results focusing on year-over-year constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated. Sequential growth rates are based on as reported results. For June 2010 quarter, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.26 per euro and the end-of-period rate was also $1.26 per euro, compared to our guided rate of $1.35 per euro.  For the June 2009 quarter, the actual weighted average rate was $1.37 per euro, and the end-of-period rate was $1.40 per euro. We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release table and in our supplemental information.
 As a reminder, we will provide a currency update following the end of each quarter. This will be posted on our website's quarterly results section. Given the rapidly fluctuating exchange environment, we encourage everyone to apply our rules of thumb as a guide to estimating the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial metrics once the quarter has ended.
 Moving on.

Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
 In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial metrics. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website.

I'd like to start off by highlighting our key priorities for fiscal 2011. These priorities are: extending beyond the PC in consumer security, growing license sales, expanding the adoption of our SaaS offerings and simplifying the customer and partner experience. While we made progress in some of these areas during the June quarter, a number of enterprise deals slipped due to a longer than expected customer procurement cycles driven by continued cautiousness among IT buyers. In particular, this affected our Storage Management results. With that said, we are confident that these deals have not been lost to competitors, as in fact, we have closed many of them in July.
 Having said that, highlights for the quarter included strong results in our Public Sector business and continued strength in DLP and SaaS. In addition, we are beginning to reap the rewards of our new backup solutions and are pleased with the steady growth in the Consumer business. The integration of PGP and GuardianEdge is off to a great start with customers excited with the addition of new encryption offerings to our portfolio.
 We’re pleased with the year-over-year growth in public sector deals for state, local and federal governments. We signed a multi-year contract with the U.S. Marine Corps who chose to use NetBackup with their Enterprise IT Services program. In addition, SESCAM, a Public Health Care Department in Spain, signed a multi-year contract spanning across our Endpoint Security, backup storage and service offerings.
 Our recent acquisition of GuardianEdge is resonating well within the government sector due to the adoption of standards-based solutions and increased regulatory encryption requirements. This positions us well for the federal government fiscal year and in September.
 In our Enterprise Security segment, we continue to do well in a large and mid-sized enterprise market segments. In particular, customers are adopting DLP, which generated another strong quarter of double-digit growth. Our DLP solution continues to shift the focus of security from simply locking down the infrastructure to protecting the information itself. As a result, we are leveraging our relationships with CISOs to sell our data protection suite along with our endpoint security, management and compliance suites. Customers are increasingly turning towards vendors that offer complete security solutions versus point product tools. Our suites enable customers to protect completely, manage easily and control automatically the assets most crucial to their business. We’re seeing higher Net Promoter Scores as for our Enterprise Security suites driven by the recent improvement in customer experience and quality.
 We continue to address the SMB market by increasing our focus with our channel partners. For example, we have expanded our small business specialization partner program. More and more small business customers are increasingly adopting managed services to reduce upfront licensing costs and operational expenses. As a result, we expanded our service prior program, enabling our partners to offer customers a monthly subscription. This licensing model aligns with the way these partners do business with their customers.
 The Symantec Hosted Services business posted strong, double-digit revenue growth. Our performance was driven by Hosted E-mail Security and newer products such as Web Security. In the last 12 months, we grow our customer base by 50% and we remain the clear leader in this fast growing market by gaining share from our competitors around the world. In May, we launched our internally developed Symantec Hosted Endpoint Protection solution. The early response from our customers has been very positive do to its ease of use and lighter footprint on the endpoint. Our hosted Endpoint Protection solution was jointly developed leveraging the combined answer please enterprise, consumer and hosted services teams. We will continue to expand our portfolio by delivering additional hosted services such as Data Loss Prevention and archiving. I'm pleased with the progress we’re making in this part of the business.
 Now moving on to our backup and archiving business. Backup Exec posted double-digit bookings growth of year-over-year across all geographies. Backup Exec 2010 has been one of our strongest backup releases to date. There’s been more than 155,000 installations since its February release. Small and medium-sized organizations are excited about our simplify data management from integrated deduplication and archiving as well as virtual machine protection. We will continue to educate and engage our partners on the new features and benefits of the product.
 Since the launch of NetBackup 7, we have seen more than 2,350 installations and over 12,000 customers are evaluating the product, representing approximately of 25% of the NetBackup install base. Customers value the improved storage efficiency with integrated deduplication, greater infrastructure utilization and faster recovery times, which reduces the total cost of ownership. We expect this release to benefit us in the second half of this fiscal year.
 In the September quarter, we expect to ship a new version of our archiving product, Enterprise Vault 9.0. With this release, we plan to include support for Exchange and SharePoint 2010, enhance the deduplication and additional e-Discovery capabilities. These features will make it easier for our customers to adopt and standardized on our archiving solution.
 Our Consumer business generated another quarter of solid growth driven by our award-winning products, superior user experience and multi-channel strategy. We continue to enter into agreements that are beneficial to both Symantec and our partners. As we announced in June, we are pleased to have extended our worldwide consumer security relationship with HP for another three years. This quarter, we expected our security OEM relationship with Toshiba to include Norton PC Checkup in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand. Norton PC Checkup helps customer become aware of PC performance problems and recommends possible solutions. This is an opportunity to up-sell our Norton Security, backup and remote service offerings.
 Our PC Tools business achieved double-digit revenue growth this quarter. We are leveraging Symantec's extensive distribution network to distribute PC Tools worldwide. For example, PC Tools is now being sold in retail stores in France, Spain, Portugal and Hong Kong, taking shelf space from competitors. We also introduced PC Tools into the Japanese markets through a co-branded security solution with BBSS, a Softbank Group company, displacing our largest Japanese competitor.
 We completed the transition to our eCommerce platform in June as planned. The performance from our online store is surpassing our expectations. We can tailor the user experience depending on where the customer acquired our product to maximize customer spend and improve close rates. I'm very proud of the team's strong execution on this very strategic initiative.
 I'm pleased with the progress we've made since the close of the acquisitions of PGP and GuardianEdge in early June. Through the efforts of our integrated sales force, we exceeded our bookings expectations. The acquisitions generated revenues of $4 million and diluted EPS by $0.005, in line with our plans. Encryption is being sold by the combined sales force, and the integrated product roadmap is already complete. Customers and partners are responding well and I'm pleased with how we've executed so far.
 The acquisition of VeriSign’s security businesses is on track to close shortly. I'm very excited about adding identity security to our portfolio as it strengthens our core value proposition in securing and managing information. By bringing together our security portfolios, we will be the only company capable to protect identities online and create hassle-free experiences for our consumer and enterprise customers. I look forward to updating you on this acquisition in subsequent quarters.
 In conclusion, we remain confident in our strategy and vision of securing and managing information and identities. We are focused on delivering industry-leading products, integrated technologies and cross-selling the portfolio. I'm confident that we have laid the foundation for continued to improved execution in the September quarter. I'll now turn over the call to James to provide the financial details for the quarter.

In addition, our Software-as-a-Service offerings posted double-digit growth. However, these positive developments were offset by the longer enterprise procurement cycles that Enrique referred to. Given the relatively high volume of our business that typically gets booked during the last week of a quarter, the additional time taken by some of our corporate customers impacted the June quarter's results. This buying dynamic was primarily a factor at some of our larger customers who typically buy products such as our storage management offerings.
 GAAP revenue was $1.43 billion and increased 2% in constant currency terms versus the June 2009 period. U.S. dollar strengthened 8% against the Euro as compared to the year-ago period, reducing our international revenue as measured in U.S. dollars. As a result, foreign currency movements negatively impacted revenue growth by two percentage points year-over-year.
 Net income was $284 million, resulting in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35. The reversal of accrued interest related to the successful outcome in our Veritas 2000 to 2001 tax case added a one-time tax benefit of $0.01 to this quarter's non-GAAP earnings per share. Other one-time tax benefits recorded during the quarter generated another $0.005 of earnings per share benefit. Looking at our geographic results, international revenue of $711 million increased 3% year-over-year and accounted for 50% of total GAAP revenue. Revenue increased 2% year-over-year in each of our three geographies: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, Africa; and Asia Pacific/Japan.
 Now I'd like to move on to our GAAP revenue by segment. The Consumer business had another strong quarter generating revenue of $473 million, up 7% versus the June 2009 quarter. With the launch of our eCommerce solution, our renewal and upselling efforts continued to perform well. For example, our Norton 360 revenue grew 22% versus the reported results in a year-ago period and accounted for approximately 40% of total consumer revenue. Our Enterprise business generated a total of 245 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, down 6% year-over-year. 37 of these transactions generated more than $1 million, down 30% year-over-year. The lengthening procurement cycles that I mentioned earlier particularly affected the number of large deals closed this quarter.
 The Storage and Server Management group generated revenue of $524 million and declined 3%, as compared to the June 2009 quarter. We experienced fewer new license sales in our Storage Management business. However, our newly refreshed backup products performed well. Our mid-market product, Backup Exec, generated double-digit bookings growth as a result of the successful launch of the 2010 product. New releases of our enterprise-scale Net Backup product tend to be gradually adopted by data center managers over 12 to 18 months, although we are pleased with our early deployment results and with a positive customer reaction we've seen thus far.
 The Security and Compliance group generated revenue of $340 million, equivalent to an increase of 2% year-over-year driven by strong growth in both Data Loss Prevention and Hosted Services. The percentage of Symantec Hosted Services bookings driven by referrals from the on-premise sales force increased sharply year-over-year.
 Our Services business generated revenue of $96 million, an increase of 2% as compared to the June 2009 quarter. We have received positive feedback on our recently launched partner-led consulting program and we believe that our core software business will benefit from the resulting strengthening relationships with our partners.
 Turning now to margins. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.9% for the June 2010 quarter, down 30 basis points from the year-ago period. Cost of goods sold increased, as this line item now includes credit card fees driven by our new eCommerce store and also reflects our increased investment in offshore technical support centers.
 Our non-GAAP operating margin of 26.5% in the June 2010 quarter was down 60 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher consumer OEM fees. Cash flow from operating activities for the June quarter totaled $335 million. Cash flow was negatively affected year-over-year by higher OEM fees and cash taxes.
 We exited the June quarter with approximately $2.74 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the quarter, we spent $362 million to acquire PGP and GuardianEdge. In addition, we spent $200 million to repurchase nearly 14 million shares at an average price of $14.49. We have $547 million remaining on our current board-authorized share repurchase plan. GAAP deferred revenue at the end of June 2010 was $3 billion, up 3% year-over-year.
 Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the September 2010 quarter. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.26 per Euro for the September 2010 quarter versus the $1.44 per Euro that we experienced during the September 2009 quarter, equivalent to approximately a 13% currency headwind. Also the end-of-period rate for the September 2009 quarter was $1.46 per Euro versus our $1.26 per Euro assumption, equivalent to approximately a 14% currency headwind.
 Our guidance assumes a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 790 million shares and an effective tax rate, before consideration of any loss from our joint venture, of 28%. The acquisition of VeriSign's Identity and Authentication business is on track to close shortly. And therefore, we have already included approximately two months of revenue and contribution from the VeriSign assets in our guidance.
 Thus, for the September 2010 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.445 billion to $1.465 billion, as compared to revenue of $1.47 billion during the September 2009 quarter. We are expecting PGP and GuardianEdge to contribute $10 million and VeriSign's security assets to contribute $16 million to our September quarter revenue. Once again, these acquisition-related assumptions are already included in our revenue guidance.
 We expect year-over-year revenue growth to be down 1% to 2% on an as reported basis and up 1% to 3% on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.09 and $0.10, as compared to $0.19 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.27 and $0.28, as compared to $0.36 in the year-ago period. Our September quarter EPS guidance already includes $0.04 of dilution as a result of our three new acquisitions. Specifically, we are expecting VeriSign to dilute EPS by $0.03 and PGP and GuardianEdge together to dilute EPS by $0.01 in the September quarter.
 We expect GAAP deferred revenue to be between $2.83 billion and $2.86 billion, compared to $2.9 billion at the end of September 2009. We expect deferred revenue to be down 2% to 3% on an as reported basis and up 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis. We expect approximately 70%, or $1.03 billion, of our September quarter revenue to come from the balance sheet.
 In closing, we are very focused on quickly and successfully integrating our recently announced acquisitions while also executing on the growth opportunities inherent in our core business. We will continue to redirect our spending to areas with the best growth opportunities as we benefit from the various cost reduction initiatives that are driving additional efficiencies across the business. And now, I'll turn it back to Helyn so that we can take some of your questions.

I mean, 25% of the base in NetBackup is looking at the product. And so we're optimistic about what we're seeing there. When you look at the core storage management business, what we're seeing is a move in our customer base to try to build out what I'll call a more distributed or scale-out data center, where they're moving to use many commodity components, commodity storage, and that's where the technologies like FileStore become more relevant. And so we’re definitely seeing a move in the enterprise data center from what we’ve traditionally seen as what I'll say the bigger focus on bigger systems to a more distributed architecture. And that's why the FileStore capabilities becoming important. So you're right. We definitely have continued to see a softness in the sale of some of the traditional products.

And while we continue to do very well in a number of segments, we think that the future lies more in what we're doing with some of the new products with our Cluster File System and FileStore. The product portfolio, the largest companies in the world still depend on products like Storage Foundation and Storage Foundation HA. And my expectations are that, that will continue, and they’ll continue to use it in many of business-critical applications. The other thing that we're seeing that we're encouraged by, is then some of the new deployments of virtualization technology, VMware and others, they're looking to us to help drive the improved SLA or availability. And so that's going to help us with some of the clustering technologies and some of the new capabilities that we'll be shipping that will support that environment. So ultimately, it's really a shift, I would say, from the architecture and the data center to what I'll call a much more distributed scale-out architecture. And that's why we shipped some of the new products that we’re expecting to see some benefits as we go forward.

By simplifying the message which lines up to what customers are expecting, which is how do they get away from lots and lots of point products. That should also benefit us. So when I look across bottoming out on the Storage side; improvements in security; also the strength of the new NetBackup and Backup Exec releases; and then lastly, we did see double-digit growth in that SaaS business.

When you look at the marketplace, this level of growth, plus or minus anyone quarter, it’s going to move around. So I think we are in the right range. That's 7% plus or minus is probably around right. Could be a little higher, could be a little lower. When we look at the freemuim market, we haven't seen any dramatic changes in that marketplace, and quite frankly,  we’re pleased because you take the PC Tools offerings and what we’ve done, which was our initial strategy, is we’re better positioning PC Tools to go after the more price-sensitive, buyers, to go after the freemuim or lower-cost solutions or offerings. And so we've got that combination and we think we’ve got the mix about right, right now with our high-end premium Norton product and then PC Tools at the low end.  And we think that’s going to combat the freemuim vendors.  The other thing I commented on is that we now have PC Tools also available in many of the markets where the freemuim vendors have historically done well, not just emerging markets, but parts of Europe.  So I think that will also help.

And so to that will continue to help us in that more pliant deduplication marketplace. But we are gaining share in the backup space. When you talk about the new license growth, it really is a matter of executing across the portfolio: driving more DLP, driving the new solutions from backup, driving the Software-as-a-Service opportunity. And so to get that back in place, those things I just outlined have to become a larger total percentage of the overall business.  And that’s what we're seeing as we see double-digit growth in both DLP and Software-as-a-Service. Now they’re coming off a smaller base, but as that continues, that should be a positive towards new license growth.

In a moment, I will turn the call over to Enrique. He will discuss how Symantec executed during the quarter. Then James will provide highlights of our financial results as well as discuss our guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session.
Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website at www.symantec.com /invest. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our website and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on our Investor Relations website shortly after the call is completed.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we will review our financial results focusing on year-over-year constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated. Sequential growth rates are based on as reported results. For June 2010 quarter, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.26 per euro and the end-of-period rate was also $1.26 per euro compared to our guided rate of $1.35 per euro.  For the June 2009 quarter, the actual weighted average rate was $1.37 per euro, and the end-of-period rate was $1.40 per euro. We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information.
As a reminder, we will provide a currency update following the end of each quarter. This will be posted on our website's quarterly results section. Given the rapidly fluctuating exchange environment, we encourage everyone to apply our rules of thumb as a guide to estimating the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial metrics once the quarter has ended.
Moving on. Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter, contain forward-looking statements.  These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in statement. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial metrics. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. 
And now I would like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem."

I'd like to start off by highlighting our key priorities for fiscal 2011. These priorities are: extending beyond the PC in consumer security, growing license sales, expanding the adoption of our SaaS offerings and simplifying the customer and partner experience. While we made progress in some of these areas during the June quarter, a number of enterprise deals slipped due to longer than expected customer procurement cycles driven by continued cautiousness among IT buyers. In particular, this affected our Storage Management results. With that said, we are confident that these deals have not been lost to competitors, as in fact, we have closed many of them in July. 
Having said that, highlights for the quarter included strong results in our Public Sector business and continued strength in DLP and SaaS. In addition, we are beginning to reap the rewards of our new backup solutions and are pleased with the steady growth in the Consumer business. The integration of PGP and GuardianEdge is off to a great start with customers excited with the addition of new encryption offerings to our portfolio. 
We’re pleased with the year-over-year growth in public sector deals for state, local and federal governments. We signed a multi-year contract with the U.S. Marine Corps who chose to use NetBackup with their Enterprise IT Services program. In addition, SESCAM, a public health care department in Spain, signed a multi-year contract spanning across our Endpoint Security, backup, storage and service offerings. 
Our recent acquisition of GuardianEdge is resonating well within the government sector due to the adoption of standards-based solutions and increased regulatory encryption requirements. This positions us well for the federal government fiscal year end in September.
In our Enterprise Security segment, we continue to do well in a large and mid-sized enterprise market segments. In particular, customers are adopting DLP, which generated another strong quarter of double-digit growth. Our DLP solution continues to shift the focus of security from simply locking down the infrastructure to protecting the information itself. As a result, we are leveraging our relationships with CISOs to sell our data protection suite along with our endpoint security, management and compliance suites. Customers are increasingly turning towards vendors that offer complete security solutions versus point product tools. Our suites enable customers to protect completely, manage easily and control automatically the assets most crucial to their business. We’re seeing higher Net Promoter Scores for our Enterprise Security suites driven by the recent improvement in customer experience and quality.
We continue to address the SMB market by increasing our focus with our channel partners. For example, we have expanded our small business specialization partner program. More and more small business customers are increasingly adopting managed services to reduce upfront licensing costs and operational expenses. As a result, we expanded our service prior program, enabling our partners to offer customers a monthly subscription. This licensing model aligns with the way these partners do business with their customers.
The Symantec Hosted Services business posted strong, double-digit revenue growth. Our performance was driven by Hosted E-mail Security and newer products such as Web Security. In the last 12 months, we grow our customer base by 50% and we remain the clear leader in this fast growing market by gaining share from our competitors around the world. In May, we launched our internally developed Symantec Hosted Endpoint Protection solution. The early response from our customers has been very positive do to its ease of use and lighter footprint on the endpoint. Our hosted Endpoint Protection solution was jointly developed leveraging the combined answer please enterprise, consumer and hosted services teams. We will continue to expand our portfolio by delivering additional hosted services such as Data Loss Prevention and archiving. I'm pleased with the progress we’re making in this part of the business.
Now moving on to our backup and archiving business. Backup Exec posted double-digit bookings growth of year-over-year across all geographies. Backup Exec 2010 has been one of our strongest backup releases to date. There’s been more than 155,000 installations since its February release. Small and medium-sized organizations are excited about our simplify data management from integrated deduplication and archiving as well as virtual machine protection. We will continue to educate and engage our partners on the new features and benefits of the product.
Since the launch of NetBackup 7, we have seen more than 2,350 installations and over 12,000 customers are evaluating the product, representing approximately of 25% of the NetBackup install base. Customers value the improved storage efficiency with integrated deduplication, greater infrastructure utilization and faster recovery times, which reduces the total cost of ownership. We expect this release to benefit us in the second half of this fiscal year. 
In the September quarter, we expect to ship a new version of our archiving product, Enterprise Vault 9.0. With this release, we plan to include support for Exchange and SharePoint 2010, enhance the deduplication and additional e-Discovery capabilities. These features will make it easier for our customers to adopt and standardized on our archiving solution.
Our Consumer business generated another quarter of solid growth driven by our award-winning products, superior user experience and multi-channel strategy. We continue to enter into agreements that are beneficial to both Symantec and our partners. As we announced in June, we are pleased to have extended our worldwide consumer security relationship with HP for another three years. This quarter, we expected our security OEM relationship with Toshiba to include Norton PC Checkup in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand. Norton PC Checkup helps customer become aware of PC performance problems and recommends possible solutions. This is an opportunity to up-sell our Norton Security, backup and remote service offerings. 
Our PC Tools business achieved double-digit revenue growth this quarter. We are leveraging Symantec's extensive distribution network to distribute PC Tools worldwide. For example, PC Tools is now being sold in retail stores in France, Spain, Portugal and Hong Kong, taking shelf space from competitors. We also introduced PC Tools into the Japanese markets through a co-branded security solution with BBSS, a Softbank Group company, displacing our largest Japanese competitor.
We completed the transition to our eCommerce platform in June as planned. The performance from our online store is surpassing our expectations. We can tailor the user experience depending on where the customer acquired our product to maximize customer spend and improve close rates. I'm very proud of the team's strong execution on this very strategic initiative.
I'm pleased with the progress we've made since the close of the acquisitions of PGP and GuardianEdge in early June. Through the efforts of our integrated sales force, we exceeded our bookings expectations. The acquisitions generated revenues of $4 million and diluted EPS by $0.005, in line with our plans. Encryption is being sold by the combined sales force, and the integrated product roadmap is already complete. Customers and partners are responding well and I'm pleased with how we've executed so far.
The acquisition of VeriSign’s security businesses is on track to close shortly. I'm very excited about adding identity security to our portfolio as it strengthens our core value proposition in securing and managing information. By bringing together our security portfolios, we will be the only company capable to protect identities online and create hassle-free experiences for our consumer and enterprise customers. I look forward to updating you on this acquisition in subsequent quarters.
In conclusion, we remain confident in our strategy and vision of securing and managing information and identities. We are focused on delivering industry-leading products, integrated technologies and cross-selling the portfolio. I'm confident that we have laid the foundation for continued to improved execution in the September quarter. I'll now turn over the call to James to provide the financial details for the quarter."

In addition, our Software-as-a-Service offerings posted double-digit growth. However, these positive developments were offset by the longer enterprise procurement cycles that Enrique referred to. Given the relatively high volume of our business that typically gets booked during the last week of a quarter, the additional time taken by some of our corporate customers impacted the June quarter's results. This buying dynamic was primarily a factor at some of our larger customers who typically buy products such as our storage management offerings.
GAAP revenue was $1.43 billion and increased 2% in constant currency terms versus the June 2009 period. U.S. dollar strengthened 8% against the Euro as compared to the year-ago period, reducing our international revenue as measured in U.S. dollars. As a result, foreign currency movements negatively impacted revenue growth by two percentage points year-over-year. 
Net income was $284 million, resulting in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35. The reversal of accrued interest related to the successful outcome in our Veritas 2000 to 2001 tax case added a one-time tax benefit of $0.01 to this quarter's non-GAAP earnings per share. Other one-time tax benefits recorded during the quarter generated another $0.005 of earnings per share benefit. Looking at our geographic results, international revenue of $711 million increased 3% year-over-year and accounted for 50% of total GAAP revenue. Revenue increased 2% year-over-year in each of our three geographies: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, Africa; and Asia Pacific/Japan.
Now I'd like to move on to our GAAP revenue by segment. The Consumer business had another strong quarter generating revenue of $473 million, up 7% versus the June 2009 quarter. With the launch of our eCommerce solution, our renewal and upselling efforts continued to perform well. For example, our Norton 360 revenue grew 22% versus the reported results in a year-ago period and accounted for approximately 40% of total consumer revenue. Our Enterprise business generated a total of 245 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, down 6% year-over-year. 37 of these transactions generated more than $1 million, down 30% year-over-year. The lengthening procurement cycles that I mentioned earlier particularly affected the number of large deals closed this quarter.
The Storage and Server Management group generated revenue of $524 million and declined 3%, as compared to the June 2009 quarter. We experienced fewer new license sales in our Storage Management business. However, our newly refreshed backup products performed well. Our mid-market product, Backup Exec, generated double-digit bookings growth as a result of the successful launch of the 2010 product. New releases of our enterprise-scale Net Backup product tend to be gradually adopted by data center managers over 12 to 18 months, although we are pleased with our early deployment results and with a positive customer reaction we've seen thus far. 
The Security and Compliance group generated revenue of $340 million, equivalent to an increase of 2% year-over-year driven by strong growth in both Data Loss Prevention and Hosted Services. The percentage of Symantec Hosted Services bookings driven by referrals from the on-premise sales force increased sharply year-over-year. 
Our Services business generated revenue of $96 million, an increase of 2% as compared to the June 2009 quarter. We have received positive feedback on our recently launched partner-led consulting program and we believe that our core software business will benefit from the resulting strengthening relationships with our partners.
Turning now to margins. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.9% for the June 2010 quarter, down 30 basis points from the year-ago period. Cost of goods sold increased, as this line item now includes credit card fees driven by our new eCommerce store and also reflects our increased investment in offshore technical support centers.
Our non-GAAP operating margin of 26.5% in the June 2010 quarter was down 60 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher consumer OEM fees. Cash flow from operating activities for the June quarter totaled $335 million. Cash flow was negatively affected year-over-year by higher OEM fees and cash taxes.
We exited the June quarter with approximately $2.74 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the quarter, we spent $362 million to acquire PGP and GuardianEdge. In addition, we spent $200 million to repurchase nearly 14 million shares at an average price of $14.49. We have $547 million remaining on our current board-authorized share repurchase plan. GAAP deferred revenue at the end of June 2010 was $3 billion, up 3% year-over-year.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the September 2010 quarter. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.26 per Euro for the September 2010 quarter versus the $1.44 per Euro that we experienced during the September 2009 quarter, equivalent to approximately a 13% currency headwind. Also the end-of-period rate for the September 2009 quarter was $1.46 per Euro versus our $1.26 per Euro assumption, equivalent to approximately a 14% currency headwind. 
Our guidance assumes a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 790 million shares and an effective tax rate, before consideration of any loss from our joint venture, of 28%. The acquisition of VeriSign's Identity and Authentication business is on track to close shortly. And therefore, we have already included approximately two months of revenue and contribution from the VeriSign assets in our guidance. 
Thus, for the September 2010 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.445 billion to $1.465 billion, as compared to revenue of $1.47 billion during the September 2009 quarter. We are expecting PGP and GuardianEdge to contribute $10 million and VeriSign's security assets to contribute $16 million to our September quarter revenue. Once again, these acquisition-related assumptions are already included in our revenue guidance.
We expect year-over-year revenue growth to be down 1% to 2% on an as reported basis and up 1% to 3% on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.09 and $0.10, as compared to $0.19 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.27 and $0.28, as compared to $0.36 in the year-ago period. Our September quarter EPS guidance already includes $0.04 of dilution as a result of our three new acquisitions. Specifically, we are expecting VeriSign to dilute EPS by $0.03 and PGP and GuardianEdge together to dilute EPS by $0.01 in the September quarter.
We expect GAAP deferred revenue to be between $2.83 billion and $2.86 billion, compared to $2.9 billion at the end of September 2009. We expect deferred revenue to be down 2% to 3% on an as reported basis and up 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis. We expect approximately 70%, or $1.03 billion, of our September quarter revenue to come from the balance sheet. 
In closing, we are very focused on quickly and successfully integrating our recently announced acquisitions while also executing on the growth opportunities inherent in our core business. We will continue to redirect our spending to areas with the best growth opportunities as we benefit from the various cost reduction initiatives that are driving additional efficiencies across the business. And now, I'll turn it back to Helyn so that we can take some of your questions."

When you look at the core storage management business, what we're seeing is a move in our customer base to try to build out what I'll call a more distributed or scale-out data center, where they're moving to use many commodity components, commodity storage, and that's where the technologies like FileStore become more relevant. And so we’re definitely seeing a move in the enterprise data center from what we’ve traditionally seen as what I'll say the bigger focus on bigger systems to a more distributed architecture. And that's why the FileStore capabilities becoming important. So you're right. We definitely have continued to see a softness in the sale of some of the traditional products."

And my expectations are that, that will continue, and they’ll continue to use it in many of business-critical applications. The other thing that we're seeing that we're encouraged by, is then some of the new deployments of virtualization technology, VMware and others, they're looking to us to help drive the improved SLA or availability. And so that's going to help us with some of the clustering technologies and some of the new capabilities that we'll be shipping that will support that environment.

By simplifying the message which lines up to what customers are expecting, which is how do they get away from lots and lots of point products. That should also benefit us. So when I look across bottoming out on the Storage side; improvements in security; also the strength of the new NetBackup and Backup Exec releases; and then lastly, we did see double-digit growth in that SaaS business.

Now they’re coming off a smaller base, but as that continues, that should be a positive towards new license growth."

A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our site, and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the site shortly after the call is completed. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that we will review our financial results focusing on year-over-year constant currency growth rates, unless otherwise stated. Sequential growth rates are based on as-reported results. For September 2010, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.30 per euro, and the end of period rate was $1.38 per euro compared to our guided rate of $1.26 per euro. For the September 2009 quarter, the actual weighted average was $1.44 per euro and the end of period rate was $1.46 per euro. We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information. 
Some of the information discussed on this call including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. 
And now, I would like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem."

The team's solid execution during the September quarter resulted in better-than-expected results. Our performance was driven by strength in backup and archiving and continued growth in hosted services and Data",2103,"Thanks, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. The team's solid execution during the September quarter resulted in better-than-expected results. Our performance was driven by strength in backup and archiving and continued growth in hosted services and Data Loss Prevention. We closed a majority of the enterprise deals that had slipped last quarter and finished the September quarter on a strong note. In addition, I'm pleased with the better-than-expected results for PGP, GuardianEdge and the VeriSign Security business. 
Now let's take a closer look at some of the highlights from the quarter. Our Consumer business benefited from the strength of our eCommerce platform and our market-leading products, Norton Internet Security and Norton 360. Our new eCommerce platform completed its first anniversary of operations and now serves 230 countries in 18 languages and supports 24 currencies. Our ability to develop more targeted programs is benefiting renewals, as well as our upselling and cross-selling efforts. 
According to Internet Retailer, Symantec ranked number one in software online sales and is one of the top five consumer brands. Last month, we successfully launched the 2011 version of Norton Internet Security and Norton AntiVirus, which further improve consumers' online safety without sacrificing performance. Consumers benefit from our innovative technologies such as reputation-based security, which harnesses results from over 100 million systems in over 200 countries to expose threats other security vendors miss. Features like Safe Web, Proactive PC Performance Alerts and integration with Norton Online Family further differentiate Norton from the competition. 
According to independent research from PassMark, AV-Test, AV Comparatives and DennisLabs, Norton Internet Security has ranked number one in online threat detection and number one in overall performance. In addition, PC Magazine awarded Norton Internet Security its Editor's Choice Award for the fourth consecutive year and Norton AntiVirus, its Editors Choice Award, for the first time since 2006. 
Over the past two quarters, the growth rate of the Consumer revenue has declined as PC units have shifted towards low-end devices, which have lower conversion rates. Having said that, we expect growth rates to stabilize as we benefit from growth in overall PC unit shipments in our ongoing efforts to drive higher conversion rates. As part of these efforts, we are continuing to enhance the trial experience by improving the design and messaging of trial activation reminders. We're also working with our partners to further integrate the trial and purchase experience into the initial PC set-up. 
We are in focused on acquiring new customers through our multi-channel distribution network. I'd like to highlight a few of our September quarter wins. We expanded our retail relationships with Costco, Best Buy and Boulanger, a French retailer, during the quarter. In addition, we won several ISP deals with partners such as United Online and Telmex. We also renewed our OEM relationship with Sony to ship Norton Internet Security in the Americas. We continue to build on the Norton value proposition through sales of our Norton Online Backup, which ships on six of the top 10 OEMs. 
In addition, we are reaching millions of consumers through free offerings such as Norton Online Family, Norton Security Scan and Norton PC Checkup. Through these services, we are upselling our Norton Security, Backup and remote service offerings. 
Beyond the PC, we are positioned to take advantage of protecting consumers through our Norton Everywhere initiative. Norton Everywhere extends trust to new devices and consumer applications spanning across mobile, smart devices and embedded services. The June beta release of Norton Mobile Security and Norton DNS have received positive response with over 300,000 users to date. Partner interest around the globe for these offerings has also been encouraging. You can expect us to leverage our technologies and collaborate with industry leaders to take advantage of Internet-connected devices beyond the PC. 
Now, I'd like to turn my attention to our Enterprise business. As the fiscal year for the U.S. federal government came to a close, we posted double-digit, public-sector bookings growth, driven by strength across all product lines in both the civilian and defense agencies. Our commitment to government standards across the portfolio, along with products such as DLP and Enterprise Vault, helped drive our performance. With increased revelatory requirements, our recent acquisition of GuardianEdge has also resonated well in the public sector. 
Storage Management performed in line with our expectations. Our Storage Foundation and Cluster Server Products helped organizations capitalize on advanced storage technologies such as thin provisioning and solid state drives, while continuing to reduce costs and get better ROI from their hardware infrastructure. For example, Symantec's Storage Management products helped Vodafone decrease their annual hardware and ongoing maintenance costs and realize a three- to four-fold reduction in the company's Microsoft Exchange data store.  Our value proposition continues to remain strong given our software's ability to work in heterogeneous environments. 
Over the last few quarters, a decline in OEM revenues from Sun-Oracle has put pressure on this part of the business. But having said that, we are committed to selling our products on all platforms, as well as focusing on long-term growth opportunities such as virtualization, private clouds and storage optimization. 
Our Storage business remains important as we further integrate our security and storage technologies to create unique offerings such as Data Insight, which helps customers manage growth in unstructured data in ways that our competitors cannot match. We remain focused on strengthening our relationships and product footprint in our top accounts. 
Some of our new storage management initiatives are centered around helping customers virtualize applications and databases. Earlier this quarter, we launched the Application High Availability, also known as AppHA and VirtualStore, which are jointly developed with VMware. AppHA helps organizations virtualize their business-critical applications with confidence, and VirtualStore provides high-performance, low-cost storage for desktop and server virtualization deployments. These new products, along with our recently launched FileStore and Data Insight offerings represent long-term growth opportunities for our Storage business. 
Now moving on to our Backup and Archiving business. NetBackup, the number one backup solution for the enterprise posted mid-single-digit revenue growth, driven by strong demand for deduplication and virtual machine protection. Through integrated deduplication, we help customers control information growth, eliminating redundant data at the source and optimize storage resources more efficiently than first-generation deduplication solutions. 
NetBackup, won the Best of VMWorld 2010 Gold Award in the Business Continuity and Data Protection category for its market-leading and unique virtual machine protection capabilities. Additionally, we started shipping NetBackup deduplication appliances, and the response from customers has been very positive. As information continues to grow at unprecedented rates, our capacity-based pricing model positions us to take advantage of this trend. We're seeing strong customer adoption of this new model as over 23% of licensed bookings for the NetBackup were on the capacity-based model. We will update you on customer adoption of this new pricing model once a year. 
In the mid-market, Backup Exec generated second consecutive quarter of double-digit bookings growth. Our customers and partners benefit from an unmatched comprehensive solution that simplifies data management through integrated deduplication, archiving and virtual machine protection. Backup Exec now protects more than 40,000 VMware hosts and an estimated 1 million VMware guests. Business Solutions magazine named Backup Exec the best channel product for 2010 due to its ease of installation, richness of features and reliability. 
Our market-leading archiving products, Enterprise Vault, posted double-digit revenue growth. Our performance was driven by strength in e-Discovery in the federal -- including the U.S. federal government vertical and execution across all geographies. Last month, we released Enterprise Vault 9, which includes support for Exchange 2010, hosted Exchange, Sharepoint 2010 and enhanced discovery features. 
Moving on to Enterprise Security, our Hosted Services business realized another quarter of double-digit bookings growth, driven by the rapid adoption of our SaaS-based security solutions. We are beating the competition worldwide and realizing growth across all regions. By leveraging the Symantec sales force, we are extending our customer and geographic reach. 
We won a competitive contract with Internet Solutions, a leading South African ISP to provide hosted messaging security services to over 225,000 users. We're also seeing a positive response for our new hosted Endpoint Protection service launched in May. This offering provides comprehensive security for desktops, laptops and servers as a hosted service without the need to install additional hardware or management software. 
Our leading DLP security product continues to be a growth driver for our Enterprise Security business, posting another quarter of double-digit bookings growth. Both Vontu and Message Labs are examples of acquisitions that we've been able to effectively integrate and grow consistently in highly competitive markets. 
We continue to use DLP to capture mind share with CISOs and cross-sell our security portfolio. As a result, we're seeing increased interest in our security suites, which include our Endpoint Protection and mail security products. Recently, independent research from PassMark ranked Symantec Endpoint Protection number one in overall performance for both the enterprise and SMB markets, beating our nearest competitors. 
As expected, Encryption is a complementary sale to our DLP solutions. ECI Telecommunications, a global networking infrastructure provider in Israel, signed a multi-year deal, which includes our encryption and DLP products. 
The PGP and GuardianEdge acquisitions exceeded our expectations in the September quarter. The team has done an outstanding job of integrating sales and operations. We are now positioned as a leader in the 2010 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Mobile Data Protection, receiving the highest rating in the Vision category. When we acquired PGP and GuardianEdge, we outlined several near-term goals. First, use the acquired technologies to enhance our ability to make data protection more intelligent. Second, utilize the broad Symantec distribution network to grow these businesses. And third, integrate PGP's encryption management platform into the Symantec protection Center. 
Let me give you an update on where we are today. Earlier this month, we announced the integration of our removal storage encryption offering with Data Loss Prevention. By integrating encryption and DLP capabilities, customers can utilize central policies to automate the identification of sensitive content and intelligently drive encryption.
We also announced the integration of Intel's Antitheft Technology into PGP Whole Disk Encryption. With this release, customers will be able to use Symantec's PGP technology to remotely disable a lost or stolen notebook and reactivate it if the system is recovered. 
To take advantage of Symantec's distribution strength, we introduced our new encryption solutions to our partners and are working on program initiatives that encourage them to sell these offerings. We also integrated the Encryption sales group into our specialist team. The sales team quickly started cross-selling on Encryption Solutions with DLP and other security products into various customer segments and verticals, such as the public sector and financial services, with particular strength in the Americas. 
Lastly, we combined the engineering teams to work closely on the integration of PGP's encryption management platform with Symantec's Protection Center. We are on schedule to launch the integrated console by the middle of next year. 
On August 9, we closed the acquisition of VeriSign Security business, and our results exceeded our expectations. The SSL certificate installed base grew 16% year-over-year as we realized growth in both the premium and low-end segments. During 2009, the macroeconomic environment was a headwind for the SSL business. However, we've seen the business improve, generating its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year bookings growth. The addition of unique features such as daily malware scans and seal-in-search are driving VeriSign's SSL sales and renewals higher. Seal-in-search is a feature that differentiates VeriSign's SSL customers by including the VeriSign Trust Seal in online search results. We are utilizing or GeoTrust and Thawte SSL offerings to aggressively go after the price-sensitive segments of the market and gain share. 
The VeriSign authentication assets are critical to achieving our vision of securing and managing information and identities. As a result, we have the following near-term goals. One, leverage the Symantec sales force to expand adoption of user authentication. Two, cross-sell these technologies into the installed base; and three, make our consumer and enterprise products more identity-aware. 
To leverage the Symantec distribution network, user authentication services are already being sold by the combined sales force, and the response from customers has been very positive. The VeriSign telesales team is already cross-selling Symantec's Critical Systems Protection and we plan to launch VeriSign's authentication products integrated with Symantec Protection Center, as well as launch integrated seal-in-search into Norton Safe Web by the end of the fiscal year. 
I'm pleased with the progress we're making in integrating all three of our recent acquisitions and the team's focus on our key priorities. I'll now turn the call over to James to provide you the financial details for the quarter."

I am pleased to report that Symantec posted better-than-expected second quarter results in each of our key financial metrics.

I am pleased to report that Symantec posted better-than-expected second quarter results in each of our key financial metrics. Our performance was driven by strength in our Backup and Archiving, Hosted Securities Services and Data Loss Prevention businesses. 
In addition, our three acquisitions exceeded our expectations. We prudently managed our expenses and generated another quarter of strong cash flows. GAAP revenue of $1.48 billion increased 2% in constant-currency terms versus the September 2009 period. The content, subscription and maintenance line accounted for 86% of our revenue, of which approximately 40 percentage points came from our consumer, Software-as-a-Service and authentication solutions. These offerings are solely subscription-based and represent a significant portion of our new business growth. However, this new business is not included in our license revenue line. 
The U.S. dollar strengthens 10% against the euro as compared to the year-ago period, decreasing our international revenue as measured in U.S. dollars. As a result, foreign currency movements negatively impacted revenue growth by two percentage points year-over-year. Net income of $266 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.34. Excluding the purchase accounting related deferred revenue write-downs of $49 million from our three recent acquisitions, EPS would have increased by $0.04 to $0.38 compared to $0.36 in the September 2009 quarter. 
As a reminder, with the acquisition of VeriSign's Security business, we now own the majority of VeriSign Japan. The consolidated revenue and expenses for VSJ are included in our income statement, with an adjustment below the net income line to account for the income attributable to the noncontrolling minority interest. 
Looking at our geographic results, international revenue of $741 million increased 3% year-over-year and accounted for 50% of total GAAP revenue. Revenue was flat in the EMEA region while the Americas and Asia Pacific/Japan regions increased year-over-year by 3% and 5%, respectively. It's interesting to note that the euro and the yen moved in opposite directions with respect to the U.S. dollar during the quarter. This has been reflected in our currency-adjusted growth rates for the EMEA and APJ regions. 
Now, I'd like to move on to GAAP revenue and GAAP operating margin by segment. The Consumer business generated revenue of $468 million. It reduced Consumer revenue by approximately $10 million due to a onetime charge resulting from certain consumers not receiving their subscription entitlements on a timely basis. Excluding this item, Consumer revenue increased 3% year-over-year as reported and 5% year-over-year after adjusting for foreign exchange. 
Our Consumer segment's GAAP operating margin was 45% as compared to 47% in the September 2009 quarter. The margin decline was driven by the onetime charge. We remain focused on upselling consumers to our premium suites. Norton 360 continues to generate double-digit revenue growth versus the reported results in the year-ago period and accounted for 39% of total Consumer revenue. 
Turning now to our Enterprise business. We generated a total of 320 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, up 15% year-over-year. 59 of these transactions generated more than $1 million, down 16% year-over-year. Of our deals valued up more than $300,000, 74% included more than one of our products, and 42% of our deals over $1 million included sales from both our Security and Storage segments, emphasizing our ability to cross-sell our broad product portfolio. 
The Storage and Server Management segment generated revenue of $557 million and increased 1% as compared to the September 2009 quarter. Revenue from our Backup and Archiving business increased 8% year-over-year. We continued to see strong demand for our award-winning Backup and Archiving Solutions, which generated double-digit bookings growth in the September quarter. 
Revenue from our Storage Management business declined 8% year-over-year. OEM royalty declines from Sun-Oracle represented approximately 1/3 of the year-over-year decline. Our Storage and Server Management segment GAAP operating margin was 49%, flat as compared to the September 2009 quarter. 
The Security and Compliance segment generated revenue of $363 million, up 7% year-over-year. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for both our DLP and Software-as-a-Service solutions. Total revenue for our three recently acquired businesses was $33 million compared to our expectations of $26 million. Specifically, PGP and GuardianEdge exceeded expectations, posting revenue of $15 million. The VeriSign Security acquisition also performed better than expected, generating revenue of $18 million. 
The combined EPS dilution from these acquisitions was $0.03, which was $0.01 less diluted than our expectation of $0.04. Our Security and Compliance segment GAAP operating margin was 16% as compared to 26% in the September 2009 quarter, driven by increased expenses from our three acquisitions. Excluding the deferred revenue write-downs, the Security and Compliance operating margin would have totaled 26%. 
Our Services business generated revenue of $92 million, a decrease of 9% as compared to the September 2009 quarter. Our Services segment GAAP operating margin was 9% as compared to 13% in the September 2009 quarter. We remain focused on supporting our partner-less consulting program, which is driving a commensurate reduction in low-margin consulting revenue. 
Turning now to total company margins. Non-GAAP gross margin was 85.2% for the September 2010 quarter, down 50 basis points from the year-ago period. Cost of goods sold increased as this line item now includes credit card fees, driven by our new eCommerce store and also reflects our increased investment in offshore technical support centers. And non-GAAP operating margin of 25.1% was down 300 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the effect of the acquired deferred revenue write-down, our operating margin for the September quarter would have been 27.5%. 
Cash flow from operating activities for the September quarter totaled $310 million, up 37% year-over-year as reported. The strength was primarily driven by improvements in working capital and lower tax payments. During the last 12 months, we have generated strong cash flow from operations totaling $1.74 billion. 
We exited the September quarter with $2.26 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, with approximately 50% of our cash balance in the U.S. During the quarter, we raised $1.1 billion from the issuance of two tranches of investment-grade senior unsecured notes. A total of $350 million of 2.75% notes will mature in September 2015, and $750 million of 4.2% notes will mature in September 2020. Shortly after issuing these notes, we repaid $500 million of our convertible senior notes due in June 2011. $600 million of these convertible notes remain outstanding.  Separately, we renewed our $1 billion revolving line of credit during September, extending its term for another four years. 
During the quarter, we spent $1.28 billion to acquire VeriSign Security business. In addition, we spent $225 million to repurchase approximately 17 million shares at an average price of $13.16. We have $322 million remaining on our current Board-authorized share repurchase plan. 
GAAP deferred revenue at the end of September 2010 was $3.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year, which exceeded our expectations and reflected in part strong quarter end execution by our Enterprise sales team. 
Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the December 2010 quarter. We're assuming an exchange rate of $1.35 per euro for the December 2010 quarter versus the $1.48 per euro that we experienced during the December 2009 quarter, equivalent to approximately a 10% currency headwind. Also, the end of period rate for the December 2009 quarter was $1.43 per euro versus our $1.35 per euro assumption, equivalent to approximately a 6% currency headwind. 
Our guidance assumes a common stock equivalence total for the quarter of approximately 780 million shares and an effective tax rate before consideration of any loss from our joint venture of 27%. Thus for the December 2010 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.59 billion as compared to revenue of $1.55 billion during the December 2009 quarter. We are expecting PGP and GuardianEdge to contribute $18 million and the VeriSign Security business to contribute $38 million to our December quarter revenue. These acquisition-related assumptions are already included in our revenue guidance. 
We expect year-over-year revenue growth to be up 2% to 3% on an as-reported basis and up 3% to 4% on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.23 and $0.24 as compared to $0.37 in the year ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.32 and $0.33 as compared to $0.40 in the year ago period. We expect $0.045 of dilution as a result of our three new acquisitions. Specifically, we expect VeriSign to dilute EPS by $0.04 and PGP and GuardianEdge together to dilute EPS by $0.005 in the December quarter. 
In addition, our December quarter EPS guidance includes approximately $0.01 of dilution as a result of the recent senior note issuance and credit facility replacements, which is not currently fully reflected in consensus estimates for the December and March quarters. Including $65 million of deferred revenue write-down amortization for the December quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share would increase by $0.06 and would be between $0.38 and $0.39. 
We expect GAAP deferred revenue to be between $3.19 billion and $3.22 billion compared to $3.05 billion at the end of December 2009. We expect deferred revenue to be up 5% to 6% on both an as-reported and constant currency basis. We expect approximately 68% or $1.08 billion of our December quarter revenue to come from the balance sheet. 
In closing, we will continue to focus on integrating our recent acquisitions, managing costs and generating strong cash flows while we reallocate resources into the growth areas of our company. And now, I'll turn it back to Helyn so that we can take some of your questions."

One, what we've have always done is looked at a multi-channel customer acquisition approach. And so we always are saying what are the different ways we can bring new customers' into the Norton products and you heard me outline a range of different things. We've got our products that allow us to have customers scan their PC and check if they've got any malware on it, and then we upsell them to our full antivirus products. So we've got things like we call Norton Security Scan, which is an online delivery technology. The other thing that we're always doing is, in the ISP segment, we have a range of big accounts that we work with for many years. T-Online and others had been using our services and delivering them. From an ISP perspective, you saw us win Comcast about a year ago now. And so, we're always going to look at the ISP channel. What I did want to make sure is clear is that PC unit shipments, we expect to still grow year-over-year, December over December. What we have seen was a bit of a mix shift to lower-end devices, probably driven by a netbook phenomenon. And the netbook, as we've said, had a slightly lower conversion rate. We expect, at this point though, that there'll be stability in the consumer revenue growth rate off of these levels that we achieved in the September quarter."

And when I look to the deals that you're doing and deal size and your deal metrics, it seems like the number of $1 million-plus deals are consistently coming down. And I guess just as we've tried to resolve what's happening here, I was hoping you could maybe comment a little bit about the customers' willingness to purchase forward, something that you've talked about a little bit in the past?

You focused on the point, Brad, that customers are not pre-buying years two and three. There's really no reason at this point for them to do that, given what they saw in 2009, while 2010 obviously, there's improved confidence than we saw in previous years. There's no move to say we'll pre-buy years two and three, so that's not changing. The other thing to focus on the discussions moving up to the CISO is some of those deals are for one or two of the technologies. They're not necessarily buying all of the DLP technologies so that gives us an opportunity, for example, to sell the initial functionality of DLP and then come back and sell the next set of capabilities. And so as we look at the big deal metrics, given that I don't expect anyone to start buying or prebuying the outyears, the one factor that will have an effect is historically, the first half of the year is seasonally a little bit slower than the second half of the year from the big deals as people ramp into both our calendar year and our fiscal year end. So that's what will drive all the improvements in the big deal metrics. But again, I don't expect prebuying to begin at all during this fiscal year."

We're bringing partners that are Backup or Archiving experts because these products require true specialization. We've also set it up so that partners can work together, so that there is a benefit to somebody saying, ""If I specialize on Backup or Archiving and I need to bring in somebody who has expertise in DLP, we've worked out a channel model and an incentive model that allows our partners to both be successful, while being very targeted in these notion of specialization."" When you think about the sales force, we've got a cost structure and incentive structure that's typically put in place at the beginning of the year and we're running with that structure. Obviously, at this point, given that we've done the three new acquisitions, there's a lot of enthusiasm in the sales force because everywhere we've sold our DLP products, there's now more opportunities to sell our Encryption products. And so our sales force is seeing a real opportunity around some of the new acquisitions. Our conference though are stable from the beginning of the year, and we will look at what we need to do as we go into fiscal year '12."

He will discuss how Symantec executed during this quarter, then James will provide highlights of our financial results, as well as discuss our guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our site, and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the site shortly after the call is completed. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that we will review our financial results focusing on year-over-year constant currency growth rates, unless otherwise stated. Sequential growth rates are based on as-reported results. For September 2010, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.30 per euro, and the end of period rate was $1.38 per euro compared to our guided rate of $1.26 per euro. For the September 2009 quarter, the actual weighted average was $1.44 per euro and the end of period rate was $1.46 per euro. We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information. 
Some of the information discussed on this call including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. 
And now, I would like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem.

35000,114080358,82430,"Symantec Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. The team's solid execution during the September quarter resulted in better-than-expected results. Our performance was driven by strength in backup and archiving and continued growth in hosted services and Data",2103,"Thanks, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. The team's solid execution during the September quarter resulted in better-than-expected results. Our performance was driven by strength in backup and archiving and continued growth in hosted services and Data Loss Prevention. We closed a majority of the enterprise deals that had slipped last quarter and finished the September quarter on a strong note. In addition, I'm pleased with the better-than-expected results for PGP, GuardianEdge and the VeriSign Security business. 
Now let's take a closer look at some of the highlights from the quarter. Our Consumer business benefited from the strength of our eCommerce platform and our market-leading products, Norton Internet Security and Norton 360. Our new eCommerce platform completed its first anniversary of operations and now serves 230 countries in 18 languages and supports 24 currencies. Our ability to develop more targeted programs is benefiting renewals, as well as our upselling and cross-selling efforts. 
According to Internet Retailer, Symantec ranked number one in software online sales and is one of the top five consumer brands. Last month, we successfully launched the 2011 version of Norton Internet Security and Norton AntiVirus, which further improve consumers' online safety without sacrificing performance. Consumers benefit from our innovative technologies such as reputation-based security, which harnesses results from over 100 million systems in over 200 countries to expose threats other security vendors miss. Features like Safe Web, Proactive PC Performance Alerts and integration with Norton Online Family further differentiate Norton from the competition. 
According to independent research from PassMark, AV-Test, AV Comparatives and DennisLabs, Norton Internet Security has ranked number one in online threat detection and number one in overall performance. In addition, PC Magazine awarded Norton Internet Security its Editor's Choice Award for the fourth consecutive year and Norton AntiVirus, its Editors Choice Award, for the first time since 2006. 
Over the past two quarters, the growth rate of the Consumer revenue has declined as PC units have shifted towards low-end devices, which have lower conversion rates. Having said that, we expect growth rates to stabilize as we benefit from growth in overall PC unit shipments in our ongoing efforts to drive higher conversion rates. As part of these efforts, we are continuing to enhance the trial experience by improving the design and messaging of trial activation reminders. We're also working with our partners to further integrate the trial and purchase experience into the initial PC set-up. 
We are in focused on acquiring new customers through our multi-channel distribution network. I'd like to highlight a few of our September quarter wins. We expanded our retail relationships with Costco, Best Buy and Boulanger, a French retailer, during the quarter. In addition, we won several ISP deals with partners such as United Online and Telmex. We also renewed our OEM relationship with Sony to ship Norton Internet Security in the Americas. We continue to build on the Norton value proposition through sales of our Norton Online Backup, which ships on six of the top 10 OEMs. 
In addition, we are reaching millions of consumers through free offerings such as Norton Online Family, Norton Security Scan and Norton PC Checkup. Through these services, we are upselling our Norton Security, Backup and remote service offerings. 
Beyond the PC, we are positioned to take advantage of protecting consumers through our Norton Everywhere initiative. Norton Everywhere extends trust to new devices and consumer applications spanning across mobile, smart devices and embedded services. The June beta release of Norton Mobile Security and Norton DNS have received positive response with over 300,000 users to date. Partner interest around the globe for these offerings has also been encouraging. You can expect us to leverage our technologies and collaborate with industry leaders to take advantage of Internet-connected devices beyond the PC. 
Now, I'd like to turn my attention to our Enterprise business. As the fiscal year for the U.S. federal government came to a close, we posted double-digit, public-sector bookings growth, driven by strength across all product lines in both the civilian and defense agencies. Our commitment to government standards across the portfolio, along with products such as DLP and Enterprise Vault, helped drive our performance. With increased revelatory requirements, our recent acquisition of GuardianEdge has also resonated well in the public sector. 
Storage Management performed in line with our expectations. Our Storage Foundation and Cluster Server Products helped organizations capitalize on advanced storage technologies such as thin provisioning and solid state drives, while continuing to reduce costs and get better ROI from their hardware infrastructure. For example, Symantec's Storage Management products helped Vodafone decrease their annual hardware and ongoing maintenance costs and realize a three- to four-fold reduction in the company's Microsoft Exchange data store.  Our value proposition continues to remain strong given our software's ability to work in heterogeneous environments. 
Over the last few quarters, a decline in OEM revenues from Sun-Oracle has put pressure on this part of the business. But having said that, we are committed to selling our products on all platforms, as well as focusing on long-term growth opportunities such as virtualization, private clouds and storage optimization. 
Our Storage business remains important as we further integrate our security and storage technologies to create unique offerings such as Data Insight, which helps customers manage growth in unstructured data in ways that our competitors cannot match. We remain focused on strengthening our relationships and product footprint in our top accounts. 
Some of our new storage management initiatives are centered around helping customers virtualize applications and databases. Earlier this quarter, we launched the Application High Availability, also known as AppHA and VirtualStore, which are jointly developed with VMware. AppHA helps organizations virtualize their business-critical applications with confidence, and VirtualStore provides high-performance, low-cost storage for desktop and server virtualization deployments. These new products, along with our recently launched FileStore and Data Insight offerings represent long-term growth opportunities for our Storage business. 
Now moving on to our Backup and Archiving business. NetBackup, the number one backup solution for the enterprise posted mid-single-digit revenue growth, driven by strong demand for deduplication and virtual machine protection. Through integrated deduplication, we help customers control information growth, eliminating redundant data at the source and optimize storage resources more efficiently than first-generation deduplication solutions. 
NetBackup, won the Best of VMWorld 2010 Gold Award in the Business Continuity and Data Protection category for its market-leading and unique virtual machine protection capabilities. Additionally, we started shipping NetBackup deduplication appliances, and the response from customers has been very positive. As information continues to grow at unprecedented rates, our capacity-based pricing model positions us to take advantage of this trend. We're seeing strong customer adoption of this new model as over 23% of licensed bookings for the NetBackup were on the capacity-based model. We will update you on customer adoption of this new pricing model once a year. 
In the mid-market, Backup Exec generated second consecutive quarter of double-digit bookings growth. Our customers and partners benefit from an unmatched comprehensive solution that simplifies data management through integrated deduplication, archiving and virtual machine protection. Backup Exec now protects more than 40,000 VMware hosts and an estimated 1 million VMware guests. Business Solutions magazine named Backup Exec the best channel product for 2010 due to its ease of installation, richness of features and reliability. 
Our market-leading archiving products, Enterprise Vault, posted double-digit revenue growth. Our performance was driven by strength in e-Discovery in the federal -- including the U.S. federal government vertical and execution across all geographies. Last month, we released Enterprise Vault 9, which includes support for Exchange 2010, hosted Exchange, Sharepoint 2010 and enhanced discovery features. 
Moving on to Enterprise Security, our Hosted Services business realized another quarter of double-digit bookings growth, driven by the rapid adoption of our SaaS-based security solutions. We are beating the competition worldwide and realizing growth across all regions. By leveraging the Symantec sales force, we are extending our customer and geographic reach. 
We won a competitive contract with Internet Solutions, a leading South African ISP to provide hosted messaging security services to over 225,000 users. We're also seeing a positive response for our new hosted Endpoint Protection service launched in May. This offering provides comprehensive security for desktops, laptops and servers as a hosted service without the need to install additional hardware or management software. 
Our leading DLP security product continues to be a growth driver for our Enterprise Security business, posting another quarter of double-digit bookings growth. Both Vontu and Message Labs are examples of acquisitions that we've been able to effectively integrate and grow consistently in highly competitive markets. 
We continue to use DLP to capture mind share with CISOs and cross-sell our security portfolio. As a result, we're seeing increased interest in our security suites, which include our Endpoint Protection and mail security products. Recently, independent research from PassMark ranked Symantec Endpoint Protection number one in overall performance for both the enterprise and SMB markets, beating our nearest competitors. 
As expected, Encryption is a complementary sale to our DLP solutions. ECI Telecommunications, a global networking infrastructure provider in Israel, signed a multi-year deal, which includes our encryption and DLP products. 
The PGP and GuardianEdge acquisitions exceeded our expectations in the September quarter. The team has done an outstanding job of integrating sales and operations. We are now positioned as a leader in the 2010 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Mobile Data Protection, receiving the highest rating in the Vision category. When we acquired PGP and GuardianEdge, we outlined several near-term goals. First, use the acquired technologies to enhance our ability to make data protection more intelligent. Second, utilize the broad Symantec distribution network to grow these businesses. And third, integrate PGP's encryption management platform into the Symantec protection Center. 
Let me give you an update on where we are today. Earlier this month, we announced the integration of our removal storage encryption offering with Data Loss Prevention. By integrating encryption and DLP capabilities, customers can utilize central policies to automate the identification of sensitive content and intelligently drive encryption.
We also announced the integration of Intel's Antitheft Technology into PGP Whole Disk Encryption. With this release, customers will be able to use Symantec's PGP technology to remotely disable a lost or stolen notebook and reactivate it if the system is recovered. 
To take advantage of Symantec's distribution strength, we introduced our new encryption solutions to our partners and are working on program initiatives that encourage them to sell these offerings. We also integrated the Encryption sales group into our specialist team. The sales team quickly started cross-selling on Encryption Solutions with DLP and other security products into various customer segments and verticals, such as the public sector and financial services, with particular strength in the Americas. 
Lastly, we combined the engineering teams to work closely on the integration of PGP's encryption management platform with Symantec's Protection Center. We are on schedule to launch the integrated console by the middle of next year. 
On August 9, we closed the acquisition of VeriSign Security business, and our results exceeded our expectations. The SSL certificate installed base grew 16% year-over-year as we realized growth in both the premium and low-end segments. During 2009, the macroeconomic environment was a headwind for the SSL business. However, we've seen the business improve, generating its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year bookings growth. The addition of unique features such as daily malware scans and seal-in-search are driving VeriSign's SSL sales and renewals higher. Seal-in-search is a feature that differentiates VeriSign's SSL customers by including the VeriSign Trust Seal in online search results. We are utilizing or GeoTrust and Thawte SSL offerings to aggressively go after the price-sensitive segments of the market and gain share. 
The VeriSign authentication assets are critical to achieving our vision of securing and managing information and identities. As a result, we have the following near-term goals. One, leverage the Symantec sales force to expand adoption of user authentication. Two, cross-sell these technologies into the installed base; and three, make our consumer and enterprise products more identity-aware. 
To leverage the Symantec distribution network, user authentication services are already being sold by the combined sales force, and the response from customers has been very positive. The VeriSign telesales team is already cross-selling Symantec's Critical Systems Protection and we plan to launch VeriSign's authentication products integrated with Symantec Protection Center, as well as launch integrated seal-in-search into Norton Safe Web by the end of the fiscal year. 
I'm pleased with the progress we're making in integrating all three of our recent acquisitions and the team's focus on our key priorities. I'll now turn the call over to James to provide you the financial details for the quarter.

I am pleased to report that Symantec posted better-than-expected second quarter results in each of our key financial metrics. Our performance was driven by strength in our Backup and Archiving, Hosted Securities Services and Data Loss Prevention businesses. 
In addition, our three acquisitions exceeded our expectations. We prudently managed our expenses and generated another quarter of strong cash flows. GAAP revenue of $1.48 billion increased 2% in constant-currency terms versus the September 2009 period. The content, subscription and maintenance line accounted for 86% of our revenue, of which approximately 40 percentage points came from our consumer, Software-as-a-Service and authentication solutions. These offerings are solely subscription-based and represent a significant portion of our new business growth. However, this new business is not included in our license revenue line. 
The U.S. dollar strengthens 10% against the euro as compared to the year-ago period, decreasing our international revenue as measured in U.S. dollars. As a result, foreign currency movements negatively impacted revenue growth by two percentage points year-over-year. Net income of $266 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.34. Excluding the purchase accounting related deferred revenue write-downs of $49 million from our three recent acquisitions, EPS would have increased by $0.04 to $0.38 compared to $0.36 in the September 2009 quarter. 
As a reminder, with the acquisition of VeriSign's Security business, we now own the majority of VeriSign Japan. The consolidated revenue and expenses for VSJ are included in our income statement, with an adjustment below the net income line to account for the income attributable to the noncontrolling minority interest. 
Looking at our geographic results, international revenue of $741 million increased 3% year-over-year and accounted for 50% of total GAAP revenue. Revenue was flat in the EMEA region while the Americas and Asia Pacific/Japan regions increased year-over-year by 3% and 5%, respectively. It's interesting to note that the euro and the yen moved in opposite directions with respect to the U.S. dollar during the quarter. This has been reflected in our currency-adjusted growth rates for the EMEA and APJ regions. 
Now, I'd like to move on to GAAP revenue and GAAP operating margin by segment. The Consumer business generated revenue of $468 million. It reduced Consumer revenue by approximately $10 million due to a onetime charge resulting from certain consumers not receiving their subscription entitlements on a timely basis. Excluding this item, Consumer revenue increased 3% year-over-year as reported and 5% year-over-year after adjusting for foreign exchange. 
Our Consumer segment's GAAP operating margin was 45% as compared to 47% in the September 2009 quarter. The margin decline was driven by the onetime charge. We remain focused on upselling consumers to our premium suites. Norton 360 continues to generate double-digit revenue growth versus the reported results in the year-ago period and accounted for 39% of total Consumer revenue. 
Turning now to our Enterprise business. We generated a total of 320 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, up 15% year-over-year. 59 of these transactions generated more than $1 million, down 16% year-over-year. Of our deals valued up more than $300,000, 74% included more than one of our products, and 42% of our deals over $1 million included sales from both our Security and Storage segments, emphasizing our ability to cross-sell our broad product portfolio. 
The Storage and Server Management segment generated revenue of $557 million and increased 1% as compared to the September 2009 quarter. Revenue from our Backup and Archiving business increased 8% year-over-year. We continued to see strong demand for our award-winning Backup and Archiving Solutions, which generated double-digit bookings growth in the September quarter. 
Revenue from our Storage Management business declined 8% year-over-year. OEM royalty declines from Sun-Oracle represented approximately 1/3 of the year-over-year decline. Our Storage and Server Management segment GAAP operating margin was 49%, flat as compared to the September 2009 quarter. 
The Security and Compliance segment generated revenue of $363 million, up 7% year-over-year. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for both our DLP and Software-as-a-Service solutions. Total revenue for our three recently acquired businesses was $33 million compared to our expectations of $26 million. Specifically, PGP and GuardianEdge exceeded expectations, posting revenue of $15 million. The VeriSign Security acquisition also performed better than expected, generating revenue of $18 million. 
The combined EPS dilution from these acquisitions was $0.03, which was $0.01 less diluted than our expectation of $0.04. Our Security and Compliance segment GAAP operating margin was 16% as compared to 26% in the September 2009 quarter, driven by increased expenses from our three acquisitions. Excluding the deferred revenue write-downs, the Security and Compliance operating margin would have totaled 26%. 
Our Services business generated revenue of $92 million, a decrease of 9% as compared to the September 2009 quarter. Our Services segment GAAP operating margin was 9% as compared to 13% in the September 2009 quarter. We remain focused on supporting our partner-less consulting program, which is driving a commensurate reduction in low-margin consulting revenue. 
Turning now to total company margins. Non-GAAP gross margin was 85.2% for the September 2010 quarter, down 50 basis points from the year-ago period. Cost of goods sold increased as this line item now includes credit card fees, driven by our new eCommerce store and also reflects our increased investment in offshore technical support centers. And non-GAAP operating margin of 25.1% was down 300 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the effect of the acquired deferred revenue write-down, our operating margin for the September quarter would have been 27.5%. 
Cash flow from operating activities for the September quarter totaled $310 million, up 37% year-over-year as reported. The strength was primarily driven by improvements in working capital and lower tax payments. During the last 12 months, we have generated strong cash flow from operations totaling $1.74 billion. 
We exited the September quarter with $2.26 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, with approximately 50% of our cash balance in the U.S. During the quarter, we raised $1.1 billion from the issuance of two tranches of investment-grade senior unsecured notes. A total of $350 million of 2.75% notes will mature in September 2015, and $750 million of 4.2% notes will mature in September 2020. Shortly after issuing these notes, we repaid $500 million of our convertible senior notes due in June 2011. $600 million of these convertible notes remain outstanding.  Separately, we renewed our $1 billion revolving line of credit during September, extending its term for another four years. 
During the quarter, we spent $1.28 billion to acquire VeriSign Security business. In addition, we spent $225 million to repurchase approximately 17 million shares at an average price of $13.16. We have $322 million remaining on our current Board-authorized share repurchase plan. 
GAAP deferred revenue at the end of September 2010 was $3.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year, which exceeded our expectations and reflected in part strong quarter end execution by our Enterprise sales team. 
Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the December 2010 quarter. We're assuming an exchange rate of $1.35 per euro for the December 2010 quarter versus the $1.48 per euro that we experienced during the December 2009 quarter, equivalent to approximately a 10% currency headwind. Also, the end of period rate for the December 2009 quarter was $1.43 per euro versus our $1.35 per euro assumption, equivalent to approximately a 6% currency headwind. 
Our guidance assumes a common stock equivalence total for the quarter of approximately 780 million shares and an effective tax rate before consideration of any loss from our joint venture of 27%. Thus for the December 2010 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.59 billion as compared to revenue of $1.55 billion during the December 2009 quarter. We are expecting PGP and GuardianEdge to contribute $18 million and the VeriSign Security business to contribute $38 million to our December quarter revenue. These acquisition-related assumptions are already included in our revenue guidance. 
We expect year-over-year revenue growth to be up 2% to 3% on an as-reported basis and up 3% to 4% on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.23 and $0.24 as compared to $0.37 in the year ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.32 and $0.33 as compared to $0.40 in the year ago period. We expect $0.045 of dilution as a result of our three new acquisitions. Specifically, we expect VeriSign to dilute EPS by $0.04 and PGP and GuardianEdge together to dilute EPS by $0.005 in the December quarter. 
In addition, our December quarter EPS guidance includes approximately $0.01 of dilution as a result of the recent senior note issuance and credit facility replacements, which is not currently fully reflected in consensus estimates for the December and March quarters. Including $65 million of deferred revenue write-down amortization for the December quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share would increase by $0.06 and would be between $0.38 and $0.39. 
We expect GAAP deferred revenue to be between $3.19 billion and $3.22 billion compared to $3.05 billion at the end of December 2009. We expect deferred revenue to be up 5% to 6% on both an as-reported and constant currency basis. We expect approximately 68% or $1.08 billion of our December quarter revenue to come from the balance sheet. 
In closing, we will continue to focus on integrating our recent acquisitions, managing costs and generating strong cash flows while we reallocate resources into the growth areas of our company. And now, I'll turn it back to Helyn so that we can take some of your questions.

One, what we've have always done is looked at a multi-channel customer acquisition approach. And so we always are saying what are the different ways we can bring new customers' into the Norton products and you heard me outline a range of different things. We've got our products that allow us to have customers scan their PC and check if they've got any malware on it, and then we upsell them to our full antivirus products. So we've got things like we call Norton Security Scan, which is an online delivery technology. The other thing that we're always doing is, in the ISP segment, we have a range of big accounts that we work with for many years. T-Online and others had been using our services and delivering them. From an ISP perspective, you saw us win Comcast about a year ago now. And so, we're always going to look at the ISP channel. What I did want to make sure is clear is that PC unit shipments, we expect to still grow year-over-year, December over December. What we have seen was a bit of a mix shift to lower-end devices, probably driven by a netbook phenomenon. And the netbook, as we've said, had a slightly lower conversion rate. We expect, at this point though, that there'll be stability in the consumer revenue growth rate off of these levels that we achieved in the September quarter.

They're not necessarily buying all of the DLP technologies so that gives us an opportunity, for example, to sell the initial functionality of DLP and then come back and sell the next set of capabilities. And so as we look at the big deal metrics, given that I don't expect anyone to start buying or prebuying the outyears, the one factor that will have an effect is historically, the first half of the year is seasonally a little bit slower than the second half of the year from the big deals as people ramp into both our calendar year and our fiscal year end.

And then for James, on the operating margin, is there any reason to believe why you shouldn't be able to get back above 30% at some point, considering some of these factors seem to be one-off issues that you're going through right now and that should pass here with time?

My expectations as we're going into a seasonally stronger period, and I believe that we should see results that are consistent with what we've seen in years, where we're not facing IT budgets being down 9%. So I'm confident that our execution's improving, and I'm confident that the integration of the acquisitions is going well, and I believe that we should see a typically stable end to this fiscal year, nothing that is unexpected on either the up or the downside of this point.

And so we adjust for that when we look at payments. The same is true when we think about high-end units or non-netbooks, and we definitely adjust the payments based on that. And so as we renew agreements, as we get better knowledge of what conversion rates look like, we always take that into account.

A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our site, and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the site shortly after the call is completed. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that we will review our financial results focusing on year-over-year constant-currency growth rates, unless otherwise stated. Sequential growth rates are based on as-reported results. For September 2010, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.30 per euro, and the end of period rate was $1.38 per euro compared to our guided rate of $1.26 per euro. For the September 2009 quarter, the actual weighted average was $1.44 per euro and the end of period rate was $1.46 per euro. We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant-currency and actual growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information. 
Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter, contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. 
And now, I would like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem."

The team's solid execution during the September quarter resulted in better-than-expected results. Our performance was driven by strength in backup and archiving and continued growth in hosted services and Data Loss Prevention. We closed a majority of the enterprise deals that had slipped last quarter and finished the September quarter on a strong note. In addition, I'm pleased with the better-than-expected results for PGP, GuardianEdge and the VeriSign Security business. 
Now let's take a closer look at some of the highlights from the quarter. Our Consumer business benefited from the strength of our eCommerce platform and our market-leading products, Norton Internet Security and Norton 360. Our new eCommerce platform completed its first anniversary of operations and now serves 230 countries in 18 languages and supports 24 currencies. Our ability to develop more targeted programs is benefiting renewals, as well as our upselling and cross-selling efforts. 
According to Internet Retailer, Symantec ranked number one in software online sales and is one of the top five consumer brands. Last month, we successfully launched the 2011 version of Norton Internet Security and Norton AntiVirus, which further improve consumers' online safety without sacrificing performance. Consumers benefit from our innovative technologies such as reputation-based security, which harnesses results from over 100 million systems in over 200 countries to expose threats other security vendors miss. Features like Safe Web, Proactive PC Performance Alerts and integration with Norton Online Family further differentiate Norton from the competition. 
According to independent research from PassMark, AV-Test, AV Comparatives and DennisLabs, Norton Internet Security has ranked number one in online threat detection and number one in overall performance. In addition, PC Magazine awarded Norton Internet Security its Editor's Choice Award for the fourth consecutive year and Norton AntiVirus, its Editors Choice Award, for the first time since 2006. 
Over the past two quarters, the growth rate of the Consumer revenue has declined as PC units have shifted towards low-end devices, which have lower conversion rates. Having said that, we expect growth rates to stabilize as we benefit from growth in overall PC unit shipments in our ongoing efforts to drive higher conversion rates. As part of these efforts, we are continuing to enhance the trial experience by improving the design and messaging of trial activation reminders. We're also working with our partners to further integrate the trial and purchase experience into the initial PC set-up. 
We've been focused on acquiring new customers through our multi-channel distribution network. I'd like to highlight a few of our September quarter wins. We expanded our retail relationships with Costco, Best Buy and Boulanger, a French retailer, during the quarter. In addition, we won several ISP deals with partners such as United Online and Telmex. We also renewed our OEM relationship with Sony to ship Norton Internet Security in the Americas. We continue to build on the Norton value proposition through sales of our Norton Online Backup, which ships on six of the top 10 OEMs. 
In addition, we are reaching millions of consumers through free offerings such as Norton Online Family, Norton Security Scan and Norton PC Checkup. Through these services, we are upselling our Norton Security, Backup and remote service offerings. 
Beyond the PC, we are positioned to take advantage of protecting consumers through our Norton Everywhere initiative. Norton Everywhere extends trust to new devices and consumer applications spanning across mobile, smart devices and embedded services. The June beta release of Norton Mobile Security and Norton DNS have received positive response with over 300,000 users to date. Partner interest around the globe for these offerings has also been encouraging. You can expect us to leverage our technologies and collaborate with industry leaders to take advantage of Internet-connected devices beyond the PC. 
Now, I'd like to turn my attention to our Enterprise business. As the fiscal year for the U.S. federal government came to a close, we posted double-digit public sector bookings growth, driven by strength across all product lines in both the civilian and defense agencies. Our commitment to government standards across the portfolio, along with products such as DLP and Enterprise Vault, helped drive our performance. With increased regulatory requirements, our recent acquisition of GuardianEdge has also resonated well in the public sector. 
Storage Management performed in line with our expectations. Our Storage Foundation and Cluster Server Products helped organizations capitalize on advanced storage technologies such as thin provisioning and solid state drives, while continuing to reduce costs and get better ROI from their hardware infrastructure. For example, Symantec's Storage Management products helped Vodafone decrease their annual hardware and ongoing maintenance costs and realize a three- to four-fold reduction in the company's Microsoft Exchange data store. Our value proposition continues to remain strong given our software's ability to work in heterogeneous environments. 
Over the last few quarters, a decline in OEM revenues from Sun-Oracle has put pressure on this part of the business. But having said that, we are committed to selling our products on all platforms, as well as focusing on long-term growth opportunities such as virtualization, private clouds and storage optimization. 
Our Storage business remains important as we further integrate our security and storage technologies to create unique offerings such as Data Insight, which helps customers manage growth in unstructured data in ways that our competitors cannot match. We remain focused on strengthening our relationships and product footprint in our top accounts. 
Some of our new storage management initiatives are centered around helping customers virtualize applications and databases. Earlier this quarter, we launched the Application High Availability, also known as AppHA and VirtualStore, which were jointly developed with VMware. AppHA helps organizations virtualize their business-critical applications with confidence, and VirtualStore provides high-performance, low-cost storage for desktop and server virtualization deployments. These new products, along with our recently launched FileStore and Data Insight offerings represent long-term growth opportunities for our Storage business. 
Now moving on to our Backup and Archiving business. NetBackup, the number one backup solution for the enterprise posted mid-single-digit revenue growth, driven by strong demand for deduplication and virtual machine protection. Through integrated deduplication, we help customers control information growth, eliminating redundant data at the source and optimize storage resources more efficiently than first-generation deduplication solutions. 
NetBackup won the Best of VMWorld 2010 Gold Award in the Business Continuity and Data Protection category for its market-leading and unique virtual machine protection capabilities. Additionally, we started shipping NetBackup deduplication appliances, and the response from customers has been very positive. As information continues to grow at unprecedented rates, our capacity-based pricing model positions us to take advantage of this trend. We're seeing strong customer adoption of this new model as over 23% of licensed bookings for the NetBackup were on the capacity-based model. We will update you on customer adoption of this new pricing model once a year. 
In the mid-market, Backup Exec generated second consecutive quarter of double-digit bookings growth. Our customers and partners benefit from an unmatched comprehensive solution that simplifies data management through integrated deduplication, archiving and virtual machine protection. Backup Exec now protects more than 40,000 VMware hosts and an estimated 1 million VMware guests. Business Solutions magazine named Backup Exec the best channel product for 2010 due to its ease of installation, richness of features and reliability. 
Our market-leading Archiving products, Enterprise Vault, posted double-digit revenue growth. Our performance was driven by strength in e-Discovery, including the U.S. federal government vertical and execution across all geographies. Last month, we released Enterprise Vault 9, which includes support for Exchange 2010, hosted Exchange, Sharepoint 2010 and enhanced discovery features. 
Moving on to Enterprise Security, our Hosted Services business realized another quarter of double-digit bookings growth, driven by the rapid adoption of our SaaS-based security solutions. We are beating the competition worldwide and realizing growth across all regions. By leveraging the Symantec sales force, we are extending our customer and geographic reach. 
We won a competitive contract with Internet Solutions, a leading South African ISP to provide hosted messaging security services to over 225,000 users. We're also seeing a positive response for our new hosted Endpoint Protection service launched in May. This offering provides comprehensive security for desktops, laptops and servers as a hosted service without the need to install additional hardware or management software. 
Our leading DLP security product continues to be a growth driver for our Enterprise Security business, posting another quarter of double-digit bookings growth. Both Vontu and MessageLabs are examples of acquisitions that we've been able to effectively integrate and grow consistently in highly competitive markets. 
We continue to use DLP to capture mind share with CISOs and cross-sell our security portfolio. As a result, we're seeing increased interest in our security suites, which include our Endpoint Protection and mail security products. Recently, independent research from PassMark ranked Symantec Endpoint Protection number one in overall performance for both the enterprise and SMB markets, beating our nearest competitors. 
As expected, encryption is a complementary sale to our DLP solutions. ECI Telecommunications, a global networking infrastructure provider in Israel, signed a multi-year deal, which includes our encryption and DLP products. 
The PGP and GuardianEdge acquisitions exceeded our expectations in the September quarter. The team has done an outstanding job of integrating sales and operations. We are now positioned as a leader in the 2010 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Mobile Data Protection, receiving the highest rating in the Vision category. When we acquired PGP and GuardianEdge, we outlined several near-term goals. First, use the acquired technologies to enhance our ability to make data protection more intelligent. Second, utilize the broad Symantec distribution network to grow these businesses. And third, integrate PGP's encryption management platform into the Symantec Protection Center. 
Let me give you an update on where we are today. Earlier this month, we announced the integration of our removal storage encryption offering with Data Loss Prevention. By integrating encryption and DLP capabilities, customers can utilize central policies to automate the identification of sensitive content and intelligently drive encryption.
We also announced the integration of Intel's Antitheft Technology into PGP Whole Disk Encryption. With this release, customers will be able to use Symantec's PGP technology to remotely disable a lost or stolen notebook and reactivate it if the system is recovered. 
To take advantage of Symantec's distribution strength, we introduced our new Encryption Solutions to our partners and are working on program initiatives that encourage them to sell these offerings. We also integrated the Encryption sales group into our specialist team. The sales team quickly started cross-selling on Encryption Solutions with DLP and other security products into various customer segments and verticals, such as the public sector and financial services, with particular strength in the Americas. 
Lastly, we combined the engineering teams to work closely on the integration of PGP's encryption management platform with Symantec's Protection Center. We are on schedule to launch the integrated console by the middle of next year. 
On August 9, we closed the acquisition of VeriSign Security business, and our results exceeded our expectations. The SSL certificate installed base grew 16% year-over-year as we realized growth in both the premium and low-end segments. During 2009, the macroeconomic environment was a headwind for the SSL business. However, we've seen the business improve, generating its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year bookings growth. The addition of unique features such as daily malware scans and seal-in-search are driving VeriSign's SSL sales and renewals higher. Seal-in-search is a feature that differentiates VeriSign's SSL customers by including the VeriSign Trust Seal in online search results. We are utilizing our GeoTrust and Thawte SSL offerings to aggressively go after the price-sensitive segments of the market and gain share. 
The VeriSign authentication assets are critical to achieving our vision of securing and managing information and identities. As a result, we have the following near-term goals. One, leverage the Symantec sales force to expand the adoption of user authentication; two, cross-sell these technologies into the installed base; and three, make our consumer and enterprise products more identity-aware. 
To leverage the Symantec distribution network, user authentication services are already being sold by the combined sales force, and the response from customers has been very positive. The VeriSign telesales team is already cross-selling Symantec's Critical Systems Protection and we plan to launch VeriSign's authentication products integrated with Symantec Protection Center, as well as launch integrated seal-in-search into Norton Safe Web by the end of the fiscal year. 
I'm pleased with the progress we're making in integrating all three of our recent acquisitions and the team's focus on our key priorities. I'll now turn the call over to James to provide you the financial details for the quarter."

I am pleased to report that Symantec posted better-than-expected second quarter results in each of our key financial metrics. Our performance was driven by strength in our Backup and Archiving, Hosted Securities Services and Data Loss Prevention businesses. 
In addition, our three acquisitions exceeded our expectations. We prudently managed our expenses and generated another quarter of strong cash flows. GAAP revenue of $1.48 billion increased 2% in constant-currency terms versus the September 2009 period. The content, subscription and maintenance line accounted for 86% of our revenue, of which approximately 40 percentage points came from our consumer, Software-as-a-Service and authentication solutions. These offerings are solely subscription-based and represent a significant portion of our new business growth. However, this new business is not included in our license revenue line. 
The U.S. dollar strengthened 10% against the euro as compared to the year-ago period, decreasing our international revenue as measured in U.S. dollars. As a result, foreign currency movements negatively impacted revenue growth by two percentage points year-over-year. Net income of $266 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.34. Excluding the purchase accounting-related deferred revenue write-downs of $49 million from our three recent acquisitions, EPS would have increased by $0.04 to $0.38 compared to $0.36 in the September 2009 quarter. 
As a reminder, with the acquisition of VeriSign's Security business, we now own the majority of VeriSign Japan. The consolidated revenue and expenses for VSJ are included in our income statement, with an adjustment below the net income line to account for the income attributable to the noncontrolling minority interest. 
Looking at our geographic results, international revenue of $741 million increased 3% year-over-year and accounted for 50% of total GAAP revenue. Revenue was flat in the EMEA region while the Americas and Asia Pacific/Japan regions increased year-over-year by 3% and 5%, respectively. It's interesting to note that the euro and the yen moved in opposite directions with respect to the U.S. dollar during the quarter. This has been reflected in our currency-adjusted growth rates for the EMEA and APJ regions. 
Now, I'd like to move on to GAAP revenue and GAAP operating margin by segment. The Consumer business generated revenue of $468 million. It reduced Consumer revenue by approximately $10 million due to a onetime charge resulting from certain consumers not receiving their subscription entitlements on a timely basis. Excluding this item, Consumer revenue increased 3% year-over-year as reported and 5% year-over-year after adjusting for foreign exchange. 
Our Consumer segment GAAP operating margin was 45% as compared to 47% in the September 2009 quarter. The margin decline was driven by the onetime charge. We remain focused on upselling consumers to our premium suites. Norton 360 continues to generate double-digit revenue growth versus the reported results in the year-ago period, and accounted for 39% of total Consumer revenue. 
Turning now to our Enterprise business. We generated a total of 320 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, up 15% year-over-year. 59 of these transactions generated more than $1 million, down 16% year-over-year. Of our deals valued up more than $300,000, 74% included more than one of our products, and 42% of our deals over $1 million included sales from both our Security and Storage segments, emphasizing our ability to cross-sell our broad product portfolio. 
The Storage and Server Management segment generated revenue of $557 million and increased 1% as compared to the September 2009 quarter. Revenue from our Backup and Archiving business increased 8% year-over-year. We continued to see strong demand for our award-winning Backup and Archiving Solutions, which generated double-digit bookings growth in the September quarter. 
Revenue from our Storage Management business declined 8% year-over-year. OEM royalty declines from Sun-Oracle represented approximately 1/3 of the year-over-year decline. Our Storage and Server Management segment GAAP operating margin was 49%, flat as compared to the September 2009 quarter. 
The Security and Compliance segment generated revenue of $363 million, up 7% year-over-year. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for both our DLP and Software-as-a-Service solutions. Total revenue for our three recently acquired businesses was $33 million compared to our expectations of $26 million. Specifically, PGP and GuardianEdge exceeded expectations, posting revenue of $15 million. The VeriSign Security acquisition also performed better than expected, generating revenue of $18 million. 
The combined EPS dilution from these acquisitions was $0.03, which was $0.01 less diluted than our expectation of $0.04. Our Security and Compliance segment GAAP operating margin was 16% as compared to 26% in the September 2009 quarter, driven by increased expenses from our three acquisitions. Excluding the deferred revenue write-down, the Security and Compliance operating margin would have totaled 26%. 
Our Services business generated revenue of $92 million, a decrease of 9% as compared to the September 2009 quarter. Our Services segment GAAP operating margin was 9% as compared to 13% in the September 2009 quarter. We remain focused on supporting our partner-led consulting program, which is driving a commensurate reduction in low-margin consulting revenue. 
Turning now to total company margins. Non-GAAP gross margin was 85.2% for the September 2010 quarter, down 50 basis points from the year-ago period. Cost of goods sold increased as this line item now includes credit card fees, driven by our new eCommerce store and also reflects our increased investment in offshore technical support centers. And non-GAAP operating margin of 25.1% was down 300 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the effect of the acquired deferred revenue write-down, our operating margin for the September quarter would have been 27.5%. 
Cash flow from operating activities for the September quarter totaled $310 million, up 37% year-over-year as reported. The strength was primarily driven by improvements in working capital and lower tax payments. During the last 12 months, we have generated strong cash flow from operations totaling $1.74 billion. 
We exited the September quarter with $2.26 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, with approximately 50% of our cash balance in the U.S. During the quarter, we raised $1.1 billion from the issuance of two tranches of investment-grade senior unsecured notes. A total of $350 million of 2.75% notes will mature in September 2015, and $750 million of 4.2% notes will mature in September 2020. Shortly after issuing these notes, we repaid $500 million of our convertible senior notes due in June 2011. $600 million of these convertible notes remain outstanding.  Separately, we renewed our $1 billion revolving line of credit during September, extending its term for another four years. 
During the quarter, we spent $1.28 billion to acquire VeriSign Security business. In addition, we spent $225 million to repurchase approximately 17 million shares at an average price of $13.16. We have $322 million remaining on our current Board-authorized share repurchase plan. 
GAAP deferred revenue at the end of September 2010 was $3.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year, which exceeded our expectations and reflected, in part, strong quarter end execution by our Enterprise sales team. 
Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the December 2010 quarter. We're assuming an exchange rate of $1.35 per euro for the December 2010 quarter versus the $1.48 per euro that we experienced during the December 2009 quarter, equivalent to approximately a 10% currency headwind. Also, the end of period rate for the December 2009 quarter was $1.43 per euro versus our $1.35 per euro assumption, equivalent to approximately a 6% currency headwind. 
Our guidance assumes a common stock equivalence total for the quarter of approximately 780 million shares and an effective tax rate before consideration of any loss from our joint venture of 27%. Thus for the December 2010 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.59 billion as compared to revenue of $1.55 billion during the December 2009 quarter. We are expecting PGP and GuardianEdge to contribute $18 million and the VeriSign Security business to contribute $38 million to our December quarter revenue. These acquisition-related assumptions are already included in our revenue guidance. 
We expect year-over-year revenue growth to be up 2% to 3% on an as-reported basis and up 3% to 4% on a constant-currency basis. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.23 and $0.24 as compared to $0.37 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.32 and $0.33 as compared to $0.40 in the year-ago period. We expect $0.045 of dilution as a result of our three new acquisitions. Specifically, we expect VeriSign to dilute EPS by $0.04 and PGP and GuardianEdge together to dilute EPS by $0.005 in the December quarter. 
In addition, our December quarter EPS guidance includes approximately $0.01 of dilution as a result of the recent senior note issuance and credit facility replacements, which is not currently fully reflected in consensus estimates for the December and March quarters. Including $65 million of deferred revenue write-down amortization for the December quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share would increase by $0.06 and would be between $0.38 and $0.39. 
We expect GAAP deferred revenue to be between $3.19 billion and $3.22 billion compared to $3.05 billion at the end of December 2009. We expect deferred revenue to be up 5% to 6% on both an as-reported and constant currency basis. We expect approximately 68% or $1.08 billion of our December quarter revenue to come from the balance sheet. 
In closing, we will continue to focus on integrating our recent acquisitions, managing costs and generating strong cash flows while we reallocate resources into the growth areas of our company. And now, I'll turn it back to Helyn so that we can take some of your questions."

We've got our products that allow us to have customers scan their PC and check if they've got any malware on it, and then we upsell them to our full antivirus products. So we've got things that we call Norton Security Scan, which is an online delivery technology. The other thing that we're always doing is, in the ISP segment, we have a range of big accounts that we've worked with for many years. T-Online and others have been using our services and delivering them from an ISP perspective. You saw us win Comcast about a year ago now. And so we're always going to look at the ISP channel. What I did want to make sure is clear is that PC unit shipments, we expect to still grow year-over-year, December over December. What we have seen was a bit of a mix shift to lower-end devices, probably driven by a netbook phenomenon. And the netbook, as we've said, had a slightly lower conversion rate. We expect, at this point though, that there'll be stability in the consumer revenue growth rate off of these levels that we achieved in the September quarter."

There's no move to say we'll pre-buy years two and three, so that's not changing. The other thing to focus on the discussions moving up to the CISO is some of those deals are for one or two of the technologies. They're not necessarily buying all of the DLP technologies so that gives us an opportunity, for example, to sell the initial functionality of DLP and then come back and sell the next set of capabilities. And so as we look at the big deal metrics, given that I don't expect anyone to start buying or prebuying the out years, the one factor that will have an effect is historically, the first half of the year is seasonally a little bit slower than the second half of the year from the big deals as people ramp into both our calendar year and our fiscal year end.

And so we adjust for that when we look at payments. The same is true when we think about high-end units or non-netbooks, and we definitely adjust the payments based on that. And so as we renew agreements, as we get better knowledge of what conversion rates look like, we always take that into account. Netbooks have now been out for more than a year, and so as we've renewed to these agreements, that's been a factor in our thinking.

A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our site, and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the site shortly after the call is completed.
 Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that we will review our financial results focusing on year-over-year constant currency growth rates, unless otherwise stated. Sequential growth rates are based on as-reported results. For September 2010, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.30 per euro, and the end of period rate was $1.38 per euro compared to our guided rate of $1.26 per euro. For the September 2009 quarter, the actual weighted average was $1.44 per euro and the end of period rate was $1.46 per euro. We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information.
 Some of the information discussed on this call including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
 In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website.
 And now, I would like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem.

The team's solid execution during the September quarter resulted in better-than-expected results. Our performance was driven by strength in backup and archiving and continued growth in hosted services and Data Loss Prevention. We closed a majority of the enterprise deals that had slipped last quarter and finished the September quarter on a strong note. In addition, I'm pleased with the better-than-expected results for PGP, GuardianEdge and the VeriSign Security business.
 Now let's take a closer look at some of the highlights from the quarter. Our Consumer business benefited from the strength of our eCommerce platform and our market-leading products, Norton Internet Security and Norton 360. Our new eCommerce platform completed its first anniversary of operations and now serves 230 countries in 18 languages and supports 24 currencies. Our ability to develop more targeted programs is benefiting renewals, as well as our upselling and cross-selling efforts.
 According to Internet Retailer, Symantec ranked number one in software online sales and is one of the top five consumer brands. Last month, we successfully launched the 2011 version of Norton Internet Security and Norton AntiVirus, which further improve consumers' online safety without sacrificing performance. Consumers benefit from our innovative technologies such as reputation-based security, which harnesses results from over 100 million systems in over 200 countries to expose threats other security vendors miss. Features like Safe Web, Proactive PC Performance Alerts and integration with Norton Online Family further differentiate Norton from the competition.
 According to independent research from PassMark, AV-Test, AV Comparatives and DennisLabs, Norton Internet Security has ranked number one in online threat detection and number one in overall performance. In addition, PC Magazine awarded Norton Internet Security its Editor's Choice Award for the fourth consecutive year and Norton AntiVirus, its Editors Choice Award, for the first time since 2006.
 Over the past two quarters, the growth rate of the Consumer revenue has declined as PC units have shifted towards low-end devices, which have lower conversion rates. Having said that, we expect growth rates to stabilize as we benefit from growth in overall PC unit shipments in our ongoing efforts to drive higher conversion rates. As part of these efforts, we are continuing to enhance the trial experience by improving the design and messaging of trial activation reminders. We're also working with our partners to further integrate the trial and purchase experience into the initial PC set-up.
 We are in focused on acquiring new customers through our multi-channel distribution network. I'd like to highlight a few of our September quarter wins. We expanded our retail relationships with Costco, Best Buy and Boulanger, a French retailer, during the quarter. In addition, we won several ISP deals with partners such as United Online and Telmex. We also renewed our OEM relationship with Sony to ship Norton Internet Security in the Americas. We continue to build on the Norton value proposition through sales of our Norton Online Backup, which ships on six of the top 10 OEMs.
 In addition, we are reaching millions of consumers through free offerings such as Norton Online Family, Norton Security Scan and Norton PC Checkup. Through these services, we are upselling our Norton Security, Backup and remote service offerings.
 Beyond the PC, we are positioned to take advantage of protecting consumers through our Norton Everywhere initiative. Norton Everywhere extends trust to new devices and consumer applications spanning across mobile, smart devices and embedded services. The June beta release of Norton Mobile Security and Norton DNS have received positive response with over 300,000 users to date. Partner interest around the globe for these offerings has also been encouraging. You can expect us to leverage our technologies and collaborate with industry leaders to take advantage of Internet-connected devices beyond the PC.
 Now, I'd like to turn my attention to our Enterprise business. As the fiscal year for the U.S. federal government came to a close, we posted double-digit, public-sector bookings growth, driven by strength across all product lines in both the civilian and defense agencies. Our commitment to government standards across the portfolio, along with products such as DLP and Enterprise Vault, helped drive our performance. With increased revelatory requirements, our recent acquisition of GuardianEdge has also resonated well in the public sector.
 Storage Management performed in line with our expectations. Our Storage Foundation and Cluster Server Products helped organizations capitalize on advanced storage technologies such as thin provisioning and solid state drives, while continuing to reduce costs and get better ROI from their hardware infrastructure. For example, Symantec's Storage Management products helped Vodafone decrease their annual hardware and ongoing maintenance costs and realize a three- to four-fold reduction in the company's Microsoft Exchange data store.  Our value proposition continues to remain strong given our software's ability to work in heterogeneous environments.
 Over the last few quarters, a decline in OEM revenues from Sun-Oracle has put pressure on this part of the business. But having said that, we are committed to selling our products on all platforms, as well as focusing on long-term growth opportunities such as virtualization, private clouds and storage optimization.
 Our Storage business remains important as we further integrate our security and storage technologies to create unique offerings such as Data Insight, which helps customers manage growth in unstructured data in ways that our competitors cannot match. We remain focused on strengthening our relationships and product footprint in our top accounts.
 Some of our new storage management initiatives are centered around helping customers virtualize applications and databases. Earlier this quarter, we launched the Application High Availability, also known as AppHA and VirtualStore, which are jointly developed with VMware. AppHA helps organizations virtualize their business-critical applications with confidence, and VirtualStore provides high-performance, low-cost storage for desktop and server virtualization deployments. These new products, along with our recently launched FileStore and Data Insight offerings represent long-term growth opportunities for our Storage business.
 Now moving on to our Backup and Archiving business. NetBackup, the number one backup solution for the enterprise posted mid-single-digit revenue growth, driven by strong demand for deduplication and virtual machine protection. Through integrated deduplication, we help customers control information growth, eliminating redundant data at the source and optimize storage resources more efficiently than first-generation deduplication solutions.
 NetBackup, won the Best of VMWorld 2010 Gold Award in the Business Continuity and Data Protection category for its market-leading and unique virtual machine protection capabilities. Additionally, we started shipping NetBackup deduplication appliances, and the response from customers has been very positive. As information continues to grow at unprecedented rates, our capacity-based pricing model positions us to take advantage of this trend. We're seeing strong customer adoption of this new model as over 23% of licensed bookings for the NetBackup were on the capacity-based model. We will update you on customer adoption of this new pricing model once a year.
 In the mid-market, Backup Exec generated second consecutive quarter of double-digit bookings growth. Our customers and partners benefit from an unmatched comprehensive solution that simplifies data management through integrated deduplication, archiving and virtual machine protection. Backup Exec now protects more than 40,000 VMware hosts and an estimated 1 million VMware guests. Business Solutions magazine named Backup Exec the best channel product for 2010 due to its ease of installation, richness of features and reliability.
 Our market-leading archiving products, Enterprise Vault, posted double-digit revenue growth. Our performance was driven by strength in e-Discovery in the federal -- including the U.S. federal government vertical and execution across all geographies. Last month, we released Enterprise Vault 9, which includes support for Exchange 2010, hosted Exchange, Sharepoint 2010 and enhanced discovery features.
 Moving on to Enterprise Security, our Hosted Services business realized another quarter of double-digit bookings growth, driven by the rapid adoption of our SaaS-based security solutions. We are beating the competition worldwide and realizing growth across all regions. By leveraging the Symantec sales force, we are extending our customer and geographic reach.
 We won a competitive contract with Internet Solutions, a leading South African ISP to provide hosted messaging security services to over 225,000 users. We're also seeing a positive response for our new hosted Endpoint Protection service launched in May. This offering provides comprehensive security for desktops, laptops and servers as a hosted service without the need to install additional hardware or management software.
 Our leading DLP security product continues to be a growth driver for our Enterprise Security business, posting another quarter of double-digit bookings growth. Both Vontu and Message Labs are examples of acquisitions that we've been able to effectively integrate and grow consistently in highly competitive markets.
 We continue to use DLP to capture mind share with CISOs and cross-sell our security portfolio. As a result, we're seeing increased interest in our security suites, which include our Endpoint Protection and mail security products. Recently, independent research from PassMark ranked Symantec Endpoint Protection number one in overall performance for both the enterprise and SMB markets, beating our nearest competitors.
 As expected, Encryption is a complementary sale to our DLP solutions. ECI Telecommunications, a global networking infrastructure provider in Israel, signed a multi-year deal, which includes our encryption and DLP products.
 The PGP and GuardianEdge acquisitions exceeded our expectations in the September quarter. The team has done an outstanding job of integrating sales and operations. We are now positioned as a leader in the 2010 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Mobile Data Protection, receiving the highest rating in the Vision category. When we acquired PGP and GuardianEdge, we outlined several near-term goals. First, use the acquired technologies to enhance our ability to make data protection more intelligent. Second, utilize the broad Symantec distribution network to grow these businesses. And third, integrate PGP's encryption management platform into the Symantec protection Center.
 Let me give you an update on where we are today. Earlier this month, we announced the integration of our removal storage encryption offering with Data Loss Prevention. By integrating encryption and DLP capabilities, customers can utilize central policies to automate the identification of sensitive content and intelligently drive encryption.
 We also announced the integration of Intel's Antitheft Technology into PGP Whole Disk Encryption. With this release, customers will be able to use Symantec's PGP technology to remotely disable a lost or stolen notebook and reactivate it if the system is recovered.
 To take advantage of Symantec's distribution strength, we introduced our new encryption solutions to our partners and are working on program initiatives that encourage them to sell these offerings. We also integrated the Encryption sales group into our specialist team. The sales team quickly started cross-selling on Encryption Solutions with DLP and other security products into various customer segments and verticals, such as the public sector and financial services, with particular strength in the Americas.
 Lastly, we combined the engineering teams to work closely on the integration of PGP's encryption management platform with Symantec's Protection Center. We are on schedule to launch the integrated console by the middle of next year.
 On August 9, we closed the acquisition of VeriSign Security business, and our results exceeded our expectations. The SSL certificate installed base grew 16% year-over-year as we realized growth in both the premium and low-end segments. During 2009, the macroeconomic environment was a headwind for the SSL business. However, we've seen the business improve, generating its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year bookings growth. The addition of unique features such as daily malware scans and seal-in-search are driving VeriSign's SSL sales and renewals higher. Seal-in-search is a feature that differentiates VeriSign's SSL customers by including the VeriSign Trust Seal in online search results. We are utilizing or GeoTrust and Thawte SSL offerings to aggressively go after the price-sensitive segments of the market and gain share.
 The VeriSign authentication assets are critical to achieving our vision of securing and managing information and identities. As a result, we have the following near-term goals. One, leverage the Symantec sales force to expand adoption of user authentication. Two, cross-sell these technologies into the installed base; and three, make our consumer and enterprise products more identity-aware.
 To leverage the Symantec distribution network, user authentication services are already being sold by the combined sales force, and the response from customers has been very positive. The VeriSign telesales team is already cross-selling Symantec's Critical Systems Protection and we plan to launch VeriSign's authentication products integrated with Symantec Protection Center, as well as launch integrated seal-in-search into Norton Safe Web by the end of the fiscal year.
 I'm pleased with the progress we're making in integrating all three of our recent acquisitions and the team's focus on our key priorities. I'll now turn the call over to James to provide you the financial details for the quarter.

I am pleased to report that Symantec posted better-than-expected second quarter results in each of our key financial metrics. Our performance was driven by strength in our Backup and Archiving, Hosted Securities Services and Data Loss Prevention businesses.
 In addition, our three acquisitions exceeded our expectations. We prudently managed our expenses and generated another quarter of strong cash flows. GAAP revenue of $1.48 billion increased 2% in constant-currency terms versus the September 2009 period. The content, subscription and maintenance line accounted for 86% of our revenue, of which approximately 40 percentage points came from our consumer, Software-as-a-Service and authentication solutions. These offerings are solely subscription-based and represent a significant portion of our new business growth. However, this new business is not included in our license revenue line.
 The U.S. dollar strengthens 10% against the euro as compared to the year-ago period, decreasing our international revenue as measured in U.S. dollars. As a result, foreign currency movements negatively impacted revenue growth by two percentage points year-over-year. Net income of $266 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.34. Excluding the purchase accounting related deferred revenue write-downs of $49 million from our three recent acquisitions, EPS would have increased by $0.04 to $0.38 compared to $0.36 in the September 2009 quarter.
 As a reminder, with the acquisition of VeriSign's Security business, we now own the majority of VeriSign Japan. The consolidated revenue and expenses for VSJ are included in our income statement, with an adjustment below the net income line to account for the income attributable to the noncontrolling minority interest.
 Looking at our geographic results, international revenue of $741 million increased 3% year-over-year and accounted for 50% of total GAAP revenue. Revenue was flat in the EMEA region while the Americas and Asia Pacific/Japan regions increased year-over-year by 3% and 5%, respectively. It's interesting to note that the euro and the yen moved in opposite directions with respect to the U.S. dollar during the quarter. This has been reflected in our currency-adjusted growth rates for the EMEA and APJ regions.
 Now, I'd like to move on to GAAP revenue and GAAP operating margin by segment. The Consumer business generated revenue of $468 million. It reduced Consumer revenue by approximately $10 million due to a onetime charge resulting from certain consumers not receiving their subscription entitlements on a timely basis. Excluding this item, Consumer revenue increased 3% year-over-year as reported and 5% year-over-year after adjusting for foreign exchange.
 Our Consumer segment's GAAP operating margin was 45% as compared to 47% in the September 2009 quarter. The margin decline was driven by the onetime charge. We remain focused on upselling consumers to our premium suites. Norton 360 continues to generate double-digit revenue growth versus the reported results in the year-ago period and accounted for 39% of total Consumer revenue.
 Turning now to our Enterprise business. We generated a total of 320 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, up 15% year-over-year. 59 of these transactions generated more than $1 million, down 16% year-over-year. Of our deals valued up more than $300,000, 74% included more than one of our products, and 42% of our deals over $1 million included sales from both our Security and Storage segments, emphasizing our ability to cross-sell our broad product portfolio.
 The Storage and Server Management segment generated revenue of $557 million and increased 1% as compared to the September 2009 quarter. Revenue from our Backup and Archiving business increased 8% year-over-year. We continued to see strong demand for our award-winning Backup and Archiving Solutions, which generated double-digit bookings growth in the September quarter.
 Revenue from our Storage Management business declined 8% year-over-year. OEM royalty declines from Sun-Oracle represented approximately 1/3 of the year-over-year decline. Our Storage and Server Management segment GAAP operating margin was 49%, flat as compared to the September 2009 quarter.
 The Security and Compliance segment generated revenue of $363 million, up 7% year-over-year. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for both our DLP and Software-as-a-Service solutions. Total revenue for our three recently acquired businesses was $33 million compared to our expectations of $26 million. Specifically, PGP and GuardianEdge exceeded expectations, posting revenue of $15 million. The VeriSign Security acquisition also performed better than expected, generating revenue of $18 million.
 The combined EPS dilution from these acquisitions was $0.03, which was $0.01 less diluted than our expectation of $0.04. Our Security and Compliance segment GAAP operating margin was 16% as compared to 26% in the September 2009 quarter, driven by increased expenses from our three acquisitions. Excluding the deferred revenue write-downs, the Security and Compliance operating margin would have totaled 26%.
 Our Services business generated revenue of $92 million, a decrease of 9% as compared to the September 2009 quarter. Our Services segment GAAP operating margin was 9% as compared to 13% in the September 2009 quarter. We remain focused on supporting our partner-less consulting program, which is driving a commensurate reduction in low-margin consulting revenue.
 Turning now to total company margins. Non-GAAP gross margin was 85.2% for the September 2010 quarter, down 50 basis points from the year-ago period. Cost of goods sold increased as this line item now includes credit card fees, driven by our new eCommerce store and also reflects our increased investment in offshore technical support centers. And non-GAAP operating margin of 25.1% was down 300 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the effect of the acquired deferred revenue write-down, our operating margin for the September quarter would have been 27.5%.
 Cash flow from operating activities for the September quarter totaled $310 million, up 37% year-over-year as reported. The strength was primarily driven by improvements in working capital and lower tax payments. During the last 12 months, we have generated strong cash flow from operations totaling $1.74 billion.
 We exited the September quarter with $2.26 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, with approximately 50% of our cash balance in the U.S. During the quarter, we raised $1.1 billion from the issuance of two tranches of investment-grade senior unsecured notes. A total of $350 million of 2.75% notes will mature in September 2015, and $750 million of 4.2% notes will mature in September 2020. Shortly after issuing these notes, we repaid $500 million of our convertible senior notes due in June 2011. $600 million of these convertible notes remain outstanding.  Separately, we renewed our $1 billion revolving line of credit during September, extending its term for another four years.
 During the quarter, we spent $1.28 billion to acquire VeriSign Security business. In addition, we spent $225 million to repurchase approximately 17 million shares at an average price of $13.16. We have $322 million remaining on our current Board-authorized share repurchase plan.
 GAAP deferred revenue at the end of September 2010 was $3.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year, which exceeded our expectations and reflected in part strong quarter end execution by our Enterprise sales team.
 Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the December 2010 quarter. We're assuming an exchange rate of $1.35 per euro for the December 2010 quarter versus the $1.48 per euro that we experienced during the December 2009 quarter, equivalent to approximately a 10% currency headwind. Also, the end of period rate for the December 2009 quarter was $1.43 per euro versus our $1.35 per euro assumption, equivalent to approximately a 6% currency headwind.
 Our guidance assumes a common stock equivalence total for the quarter of approximately 780 million shares and an effective tax rate before consideration of any loss from our joint venture of 27%. Thus for the December 2010 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.59 billion as compared to revenue of $1.55 billion during the December 2009 quarter. We are expecting PGP and GuardianEdge to contribute $18 million and the VeriSign Security business to contribute $38 million to our December quarter revenue. These acquisition-related assumptions are already included in our revenue guidance.
 We expect year-over-year revenue growth to be up 2% to 3% on an as-reported basis and up 3% to 4% on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.23 and $0.24 as compared to $0.37 in the year ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.32 and $0.33 as compared to $0.40 in the year ago period. We expect $0.045 of dilution as a result of our three new acquisitions. Specifically, we expect VeriSign to dilute EPS by $0.04 and PGP and GuardianEdge together to dilute EPS by $0.005 in the December quarter.
 In addition, our December quarter EPS guidance includes approximately $0.01 of dilution as a result of the recent senior note issuance and credit facility replacements, which is not currently fully reflected in consensus estimates for the December and March quarters. Including $65 million of deferred revenue write-down amortization for the December quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share would increase by $0.06 and would be between $0.38 and $0.39.
 We expect GAAP deferred revenue to be between $3.19 billion and $3.22 billion compared to $3.05 billion at the end of December 2009. We expect deferred revenue to be up 5% to 6% on both an as-reported and constant currency basis. We expect approximately 68% or $1.08 billion of our December quarter revenue to come from the balance sheet.
 In closing, we will continue to focus on integrating our recent acquisitions, managing costs and generating strong cash flows while we reallocate resources into the growth areas of our company. And now, I'll turn it back to Helyn so that we can take some of your questions.

One, what we've have always done is looked at a multi-channel customer acquisition approach. And so we always are saying what are the different ways we can bring new customers' into the Norton products and you heard me outline a range of different things. We've got our products that allow us to have customers scan their PC and check if they've got any malware on it, and then we upsell them to our full antivirus products. So we've got things like we call Norton Security Scan, which is an online delivery technology. The other thing that we're always doing is, in the ISP segment, we have a range of big accounts that we work with for many years. T-Online and others had been using our services and delivering them. From an ISP perspective, you saw us win Comcast about a year ago now. And so, we're always going to look at the ISP channel. What I did want to make sure is clear is that PC unit shipments, we expect to still grow year-over-year, December over December. What we have seen was a bit of a mix shift to lower-end devices, probably driven by a netbook phenomenon. And the netbook, as we've said, had a slightly lower conversion rate. We expect, at this point though, that there'll be stability in the consumer revenue growth rate off of these levels that we achieved in the September quarter.

You focused on the point, Brad, that customers are not pre-buying years two and three. There's really no reason at this point for them to do that, given what they saw in 2009, while 2010 obviously, there's improved confidence than we saw in previous years. There's no move to say we'll pre-buy years two and three, so that's not changing. The other thing to focus on the discussions moving up to the CISO is some of those deals are for one or two of the technologies. They're not necessarily buying all of the DLP technologies so that gives us an opportunity, for example, to sell the initial functionality of DLP and then come back and sell the next set of capabilities. And so as we look at the big deal metrics, given that I don't expect anyone to start buying or prebuying the outyears, the one factor that will have an effect is historically, the first half of the year is seasonally a little bit slower than the second half of the year from the big deals as people ramp into both our calendar year and our fiscal year end. So that's what will drive all the improvements in the big deal metrics. But again, I don't expect prebuying to begin at all during this fiscal year.

And so we adjust for that when we look at payments. The same is true when we think about high-end units or non-netbooks, and we definitely adjust the payments based on that.

Well, let me just get to your expectations there and understanding how you're viewing that joint venture longer term? I understand there's a one-time option here in a couple of weeks that comes up. And really, how you're going to be using that joint venture to target the North American market and how you see that going into the competitive landscape?

So our expectations is part of the appliance capability is going to be working closely with the joint venture. As you probably know, a majority of hardware today is already being built in China. And so we're able to leverage a relationship with one of the largest tech companies in China as a strategic partner. And so we will absolutely be taking a number of different appliances to market, some developed by the joint venture, some with the content developed by Symantec into markets all over the world. We had this June quarter, we saw some of the initial sales outside of the U.S. for the appliances that we've developed with the JV, and my expectation is that, that will be technology that we deliver all over the world, including the United States.

Just looking at that based the value of the last 10-K, 10-Q you put out had $51 million, really would imply about a $1.4 billion valuation for that. Is my math correct there?

Obviously, you guys saw a good bounce back quarter-to-quarter and license sales up after you mentioned some deals slipped during our fiscal Q1. When you think about what programs, et cetera, that you've got in place, you'd sort of keep that consistency back on place here, just what are those? And then also, Enrique, when you do think about your channel model right now, any tweaks that you're making in that program?

We're bringing partners that are Backup or Archiving experts because these products require true specialization. We've also set it up so that partners can work together, so that there is a benefit to somebody saying, ""If I specialize on Backup or Archiving and I need to bring in somebody who has expertise in DLP, we've worked out a channel model and an incentive model that allows our partners to both be successful, while being very targeted in these notion of specialization."" When you think about the sales force, we've got a cost structure and incentive structure that's typically put in place at the beginning of the year and we're running with that structure. Obviously, at this point, given that we've done the three new acquisitions, there's a lot of enthusiasm in the sales force because everywhere we've sold our DLP products, there's now more opportunities to sell our Encryption products. And so our sales force is seeing a real opportunity around some of the new acquisitions. Our conference though are stable from the beginning of the year, and we will look at what we need to do as we go into fiscal year '12.
